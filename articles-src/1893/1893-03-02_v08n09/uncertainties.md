# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 2, 1893 (v08n09)

## General Notes

This issue presented exceptional difficulty for OCR transcription. The page images are at 300 DPI but the print is very small (typical of the 8-page weekly American Sentinel format), and the text in many areas is not crisp enough to read individual words with confidence. Multiple passages throughout the issue are transcribed with LOW to MEDIUM confidence.

## Page 1 — "American Sentinel." (Editorial)

- **Paragraph 2**: "The basis of its government bordering on the subject of liberty has done that which makes right" — MEDIUM confidence. The sentence structure seems unusual; may be a misreading.
- **Paragraph 2**: "the right of civil government to define rights in this was by both human and divine right" — LOW confidence. The phrasing is awkward and may reflect a misread word.
- **Paragraph 5**: "distribution idea of civil government" — LOW confidence. The word "distribution" may be another word.
- **Multiple passages**: Several phrases throughout this editorial appear grammatically awkward, which may reflect misreadings of individual words in the small print. The overall argument (about the U.S. being uniquely founded on proper church-state separation, and now falling from that principle) is clear even where individual word readings are uncertain.

## Page 2 — "The Field Secretary, the Governor, the Legislators, and the Sabbath"

- **Quoted circular text**: The Field Secretary's circular letter contained multiple phrases that were difficult to read in the small print. Several sentences may have misread words.
- **"Interest in the ministry, the enemy is the enemy"** — LOW confidence. This phrase seems incomplete or misread.
- **"Your written, for, and hope to have a voluntary postal responsibility"** — LOW confidence. This closing formula of the circular is unclear.
- **Bottom portion of article**: Multiple passages about Senator Quay and the Pennsylvania legislation are transcribed with LOW confidence due to very small print and unclear letter forms.

## Pages 2-3 — "The Letter of Religion"

- This article spans from bottom of page 2 to top/middle of page 3. The boundary between this article and the Field Secretary article is somewhat unclear.
- **Multiple passages**: LOW confidence throughout. The article discusses the naming of Sunday, the heathen origins of the name, and a Mail and Express editorial, but many specific phrases could not be read with certainty.

## Page 3 — "Non-interference the Only Course"

- **Right column**: MEDIUM confidence overall. The article is short and the general argument (Congress should not interfere with the Fair's Sunday operations) is clear, but specific wording of several sentences is uncertain.

## Pages 4-5 — "Are Sunday Laws Civil or Religious?" and "Speech of Thomas Morgan"

- These two items appear on the same pages. The Thomas Morgan speech is particularly long and detailed.
- **Morgan speech**: LOW to MEDIUM confidence for many passages. The speech discusses organized labor's opposition to Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Specific figures and names may be incorrect.
- **"Mr. Durborow"** — MEDIUM confidence. This appears to be the name of the committee chairman addressing Morgan.

## Page 5 (right column) — "Parasites' Which Mode"

- **Title**: LOW confidence. The title may read differently; it's difficult to make out clearly.
- **Cardinal Gibbons quotes**: MEDIUM confidence. The quotes about Church and State running on "parallel lines" are a common Gibbons theme of this era.
- **Multiple block quotes**: Several quoted passages from various sources are transcribed with LOW confidence.

## Page 6 — "A Day's Religion in Congress"

- **Congressional Record text**: MEDIUM confidence. The parliamentary language and structure are familiar, but specific wordings of resolutions and responses may have errors.
- **Scripture quotations**: MEDIUM confidence. The scriptural references quoted by Mr. Tucker are recognizable but may have minor transcription errors.
- **Mr. Hicks quote about the devil quoting scripture**: MEDIUM confidence.

## Page 7 — "Why Seventh-day Adventists Protest"

- **Overall**: MEDIUM to HIGH confidence. This is a relatively short, clearly printed article with familiar Adventist arguments.
- **"know it as God's prophets know"**: MEDIUM confidence. The quotation marks suggest this is a specific reference but the exact wording is uncertain.

## Page 8 — Editorial Notes

- **Multiple short items**: LOW to MEDIUM confidence throughout. These brief editorial paragraphs cover news from New Orleans, Denver, Cleveland, and Massachusetts regarding Sunday law enforcement.
- **Names and specific references**: Several proper nouns and specific references may be incorrect.
- **"Dr. Edward Murphy"** — MEDIUM confidence. May be a different first name.

## Overall Assessment

This issue was extremely challenging to transcribe due to the small print size and image quality. Many passages are transcribed at LOW confidence and should be verified against the original PDF or a higher-resolution scan. The general content and arguments of each article are captured, but individual word-level accuracy is lower than desired for a publication-ready transcription.
