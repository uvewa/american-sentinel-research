It is sometimes said that Seventh-day Adventists protest as they do against Sunday laws and religious legislation (1) because they do not believe that Sunday is the true Sabbath; and (2) because they suffer prosecution under Sunday laws. As to the first reason we wish emphatically to say that we would oppose just as strenuously a law for the "support," "promotion," or "protection" of the seventh day as for Sunday. In the first place, civil governments have no right to legislate on religious questions, dogmas, or institutions; and in the second place, God does not need the assistance of civil government to compel observance of his laws. The only acceptable observance of such laws is in faith and love, and law can not compel love; it only develops hypocrisy. God will care for his own. As to the second reason, Seventh-day Adventists do not oppose Sunday laws because they are afraid of being persecuted. They do so because God has bidden those who are bearing "the everlasting gospel" to the world (no matter who they are), to protest against the worship of the beast or his image, or the reception of the mark of the beast. See Rev. 14:6-12. They can not do otherwise if they are faithful to God. Their natural inclinations would lead them to agree with the majority; their loyalty to God places them on the side of his gospel, his word. As for persecution, they know it is coming, "know it as God's prophets know;" years ago they knew it.

They know it better than the prophet, because what he saw in vision they see in fact in the light of the increase of knowledge promised in the word of God. See Dan. 12:4, 9, 10. What we knew by faith years ago, we now see in fact, while faith takes larger strides for the future before. We know persecution is coming. We do not invite it; we, in the weakness of the flesh, would fear because of it; but in the strength of Christ we are willing to meet it, bearing faithful warning against the mystery of iniquity now fast creeping in to nullify if possible the mystery of God.

Yes, we know that it will come, but we are assured in the same word by which we are assured of the coming tribulation, that those who keep the word of Christ's patience, he will keep in the hour of temptation, which is coming on all the world to try them that dwell on all the face of the earth. Rev. 3:10.

May God pity and save those who are blindly opposing themselves against the truth, and may he help his people to reveal Christ and his power to those who are longing for light and power in the darkness and weakness of sin.—Signs of the Times.
