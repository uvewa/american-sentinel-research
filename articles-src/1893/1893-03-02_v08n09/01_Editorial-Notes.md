THE United States has stood before the world as the highest example of governmental perfection to which man had yet attained. The distinction was merited. All other governments have assumed, as by natural and divine right, censorship of the religious views of their subjects. The United States has utterly repudiated all such assumption of authority.

THE basis of government heretofore in the world's history has been that might makes right. As ground for pretended authority in religious affairs divine right was assumed. The claim of right to rule was by both human and divine might. This has been true, and is, of all governments but that of the United States. Both claims are unchristian. The one is despotic; the other papal. Erring humanity has always mingled the two in government. The only exception has been the United States.

THE theory of the Government of this country was based upon the inherent equality of all men, not among themselves, but before God. The proudest and the most powerful is possessed of no natural and absolute right which his humblest neighbor does not equally share. That is true. Upon this truth the Government of the United States was established. That truth is the gospel of civil government which no man ever preached until taught of Jesus Christ. The United States was its first and only governmental convert.

THE proclamation of justice and equity to and for all men, which the fathers of this country issued, was the noblest profession of political faith ever uttered; noblest and highest, because there was in it less of man, and more of God, than in any other such public proclamation ever made. The time was ripe for the greatest and last test to which humanity was to be put in its civil relations. All that was necessary to place this Government upon the correct basis on which, and by which, Christian people should govern, and be governed, was presented to the constitutional Assembly, and there formulated into governmental expression.

So blind is the human mind, and so prone to error, that, by that very Assembly, a constitutional clause was inserted permitting the rights of the negro as a man to be ignored. Only twenty-three years ago, the Constitution was purged of that error. But the results to this country of that error can not be done away with so long as time lasts. Its shadow, both real and figurative, is here forever. Yet, with the removal from the fundamental law of that which was taken to be a permission of negro slavery, and the insertion of its positive prohibition, making the Constitution consistent with itself, the fundamental law came into complete harmony with the gospel. The governments of all the rest of the world were arrayed against God. They all assumed the divine prerogative, and required the subjection of their citizens to them as appointed of God and voicing his authority. Here alone stood one Government after God's own heart.

THIS was a Government after God's own heart because, in harmony with the gospel, it had set itself for the protection of all men within its jurisdiction, without discrimination, in the possession of their natural rights. That which God had given to man all other governments have sought to take from him. Heretofore human governments had sought to make themselves gods in the place of God. The possibility of persecution for conscience' sake, of compulsion in the observance of religious forms, and compulsory acceptance of religious belief, has entered into the fundamental theory upon which all other governments have been formed and administered. In their case no revolution was necessary, no reforming of constitution required, to make religious persecution possible. All the legal processes and judicial machinery necessary to persecute for conscience' sake, other governments have held ready for action from the origin of their public polity. This Government was organized on totally opposite principles. Since the adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, there has been no constitutional excuse in this country for any civil, legislative, or judicial act out of harmony with the divine idea of civil government.

BUT there has been an inherited body of religious law in this country, a fatal heritage from the Church and State statutes of England; although its manifest incongruity with the Constitution and the principles of this Government has kept it in abeyance. To subvert the true principles of civil government, enshrined in the Constitution, and endow with supreme power this alien intruder has required a revolution. The revolution has been accomplished. History records no more marvelous transformation in civil polity than that which has taken place under our eyes in the last few years, in this country. This Government has forsaken its preeminent place and is now in line with the governments of the rest of the world. The governments of all the world have arrayed themselves against God, and only await the fullness of time to become actively persecuting powers. There is now no city of refuge for the persecuted of the nations upon the face of the whole earth. All earthly power is in the hands of those who defy God. If it is in the hands of those who do not openly defy God, but deceive themselves and yield obedience to the great deceiver, instead of to God, the result is the same. They work iniquity no less, and receive the reward of the iniquitous as well.

THE power over the whole earth is in the hands of those who assume to speak for divinity, and to act for divinity, and by divine authority compel the world to be in subjection to divinity. Heathen, pagan, Roman Catholic, Protestant, nations all stand now upon the same platform in this regard. The difference between them is of degree and not of kind. The civil enforcement of Christianity is just as unchristian as the civil enforcement of Buddhism or Mohammedanism. The one puts itself under the condemnation of God just as much as the other. They all have made void the law of God. But as in times before there were those who would not worship the king nor bow to golden images, so now there will be those who will not yield idolatrous homage to the State. These will call upon Him whom they serve and he will deliver them. The fiery furnace harmed none but those who had prepared it.

The world has come to a crisis in its history. They are wise who understand it and set their house in order accordingly. John saw in his apocalyptic vision the terrors which were to fall upon the earth, when time had run its course and defiance of God become complete, but he saw also the glorious reward of the faithful, the just and the true. There can be no pessimism among those who believe in the Bible, and accepting its promises trust implicitly in their God. Theirs is the highest optimism of which this world is capable. They know that the wondrous things of God will be as he has said they will be. They know that has been done in the past,—and just now is done,—which God said in his word would be, and now that is shortly to come to pass which he has said would follow the fulfillment of this. Not one jot or one tittle shall fail from his word, but all will be completed.

W. H. M.
