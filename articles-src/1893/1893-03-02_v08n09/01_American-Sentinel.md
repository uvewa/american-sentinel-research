The United States has stood before the world as the highest example of governmental perfection to which man had yet attained. The distinction was merited, for all other governments have assumed, by natural and divine right, censorship of the religious views of their subjects. The United States has utterly repudiated all such assumption of authority.

The basis of its government bordering on the subject of liberty has done that which makes right. As ground for pretended authority to religious affairs the right of civil government to define rights in this was by both human and divine right. This has been true, and is, of all governments of the world outside of the United States. Both classes are intolerable. The one is political; the other papal. Erring humanity has always mingled the two to govern the world. Only one exception has been the United States.

But the theory of the Government of the United States was based upon the inherent equality of all men, not among themselves, but before God. The proudest and the most powerful is possessed of no natural authority of which his humblest neighbor does not equally share. That is the proposition upon this truth the Government of the United States was established. That truth is the gospel of civil government which no man ever preached until taught of Jesus Christ. The United States was in its first and only governmental convert.

The proclamation of justice and equality as a fact of nature, which the fathers of this country issued, was the noblest product of political faith ever uttered, the noblest and highest, because there was in it none of man, and more of God, than in any other such public proclamation ever made. The time was ripe for the greatest and last test to which humanity was to be put in its civil relations. All that was necessary to place this Government upon the correct basis on which, and by which, Christian people should govern, and be governed, was presented to the constitutional Assembly, and there formulated into governmental expression.

So blind is the human mind, and so prone to error, that, by that very Assembly, a constitutional clause was inserted permitting the rights of the negro as a man to be ignored. Only twenty-three years ago a foundation was provided, upon which, to correct that error. But the result to this country of that error can not be done away with so long as time lasts. Its shadow, both real and figurative, is here forever. Yet, with the recovery from the fundamental law of that which was taken to be a permission of negro slavery, and the insertion of its positive prohibition, making the Constitution consistent with itself, the fundamental law was made into complete harmony with the gospel. The government and all the rest of the world were arrayed against God. They all assumed the divine prerogative, and required the allegiance of their citizens to them as applied to and touching his authority. Here alone stood one Government after God's own heart.

This was a Government after God's own heart because, in harmony with the gospel, it had set itself for the protection of all men within its jurisdiction, without discrimination, in the possession of their inalienable rights. That which God had given to man all other governments have sought to take from him. Heretofore no man governments had sought to make themselves gods in the place of God. The possibility of persecution for conscience sake, of compulsion in the observance of religious forms, and compulsory acceptance of religious belief, has entered into the fundamental theory upon which all other governments have been framed and administered. In their case no revolution was necessary, no reforming of constitutions required, to make religious persecution possible. All the legal processes and judicial machinery necessary to persecute for conscience sake, other governments have held ready for action from the origin of their public policy. This Government was organized on totally opposite principles. Since the adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, there has been no constitutional avenue in this country for any civil, legislative, or judicial act out of harmony with the distribution idea of civil government.

But there has been an inherited body of religious law in this country, a fund drawn from the Church and State legislation of England; although its manifold enactments were in violation of the most vital principles of this Government has kept it in abeyance. To subvert the true principles of civil government, maintain it in the Constitution, and endow with supreme power this alien intruder has required a revolution. The revolution has been accomplished. History records no more marvelous transformation in civil body politic than which has taken place under our eyes in the last few years, in this country. This Government has fallen into line, and taken its place and is now in line with the governments of the rest of the world. The governments of all the world have arrayed themselves against God, and only await the fullness of time to become actively persecuting powers. There is now no city of refuge for the persecuted of the nations upon the face of the earth. All human authority, all power is in the hands of those who defy God. If it is the last days, God, they deserve themselves and their obedience to the great deceiver; instead of to God, the result is the same. They work iniquity no less, and receive the reward of the iniquitous no less.

The power over the whole earth is in the hands of those who assume to speak for divinity, and to set for divinity, and by divine authority control the world to be in subjection to divinity. Tradition, pagan, Roman Catholic, Protestant, national—all stand upon the same platform in this regard. The difference between them is of degree and not of kind. The civil enforcement of Christianity is just as unchristian as the civil enforcement of Buddhism or Mohammedanism.
