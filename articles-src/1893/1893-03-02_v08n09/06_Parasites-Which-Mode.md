"Parasites'" Which Mode.

The Catholics of Philadelphia gave their annual banquet on Monday evening, and among the many expressions of good-will, the senior who took part in the celebration was Archbishop ——, and others. He was called upon to respond to the toast "Church and State." This problem has a unique faculty of expressing himself on public questions in a way that may easily lead men to see him as a diplomat of the highest caliber; and yet at times so betrays himself that the critical student of the admiration with which the "church" seeks to flatter the State into subserviency.

These are some of his statements. We call special attention to the conditions upon the occasions referred to:—

A word upon what is termed the relations of "Church and State." I am firmly persuaded, both by study and experience, the more political freedom and political responsibility are enjoyed by the people, the more also are free to pursue her divine mission with liberty, since liberty is conceded to all alike that in his proposition, does the church and the State move on parallel lines.

No one has more reason to be satisfied with the existing relations between Church and State than we have.

No State or religious or official church is our ideal State. And it would be a great evil and one opposed to our republican traditions for any section of the religious body to aspire to political influence. I venture to say, on the contrary, that we have a Government better adapted to the condition of the nation than the Government of the United States.

*How the Christian Sabbath (Sunday) is a heathen's day of rest.* The earth, the church, the world of labor, of amusement, of recreation, are so many departments of the human activities whose legitimate operations of the commandments in the exercise of her earthly authority, ... the government may claim on the conduct of the members of Christ in the future, as it has been able to do in the past, the same liberty in her mission, ... for men within whose souls not even the first principles of the church in political affairs ... and right understanding of all good government.

*Church and State are not and cannot be antagonistic.* ... Not even an agreement between them is desired or would answer.

Readers of the *American Sentinel* must be convinced ere this that there are in this country forces at work that will bring about more religious legislation. This article speaks of them pointedly. This speaks prayerfully at every times, and always of the combination of the National Reform, Catholicism and Protestantism. The Protestants are working for it in the open, are shrewd in its maneuvers, while the Protestantism is in the van by proclamation "hand in hand"—on many occasions avowed. In this connection, some questions raised by some utterances which have been put forth from Cardinal Gibbons are worthy of notice. He says:—

And adds to prove his statement continually, and its voice will be heard much oftener in the future than in the past. And Rev. H. H. George, recently declared in a speech in Paterson, N. J.: "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." Certainly, for Senator Hewitt says:—

If the time to-day decides that it will not close the Fair on Sunday, the Roman Catholic Church, an organization with a membership of over more than forty millions of people—seriously and sternly opposed to any such legislation, would be heard. ... and they are found to be patriotic voters that from the foundation of the country. ... I am a Protestant; I am not likely to be suspected of favoring Romanism, but let me advise it. if you dare. How many who voted for the Sunday closing of the Fair, do you suppose, have the courage to defy the Roman Catholic Church?

Cardinal Gibbons closes his reply to the effect that any objection to his views upon relations that the relations between "church" and State are as close and so cordial as could be desired ——

... What more should we desire of the church than to control the State and make demands corresponding to her in the last speech to the Legislature.

Parallel lines may find by theoretical exercise never meet; but the "parallel lines" of the Rev. J. M. Foster, and others are in such close proximity that civil government of the United States is to be informed by the church this side a church which speaks it speals to its own, and the "unchangeable ultimatum" to demand of the United States Government to be a Government organized by and for the interests of a church on the principles of the past. This has not been done in a free country before; and we respectfully warned the country of these things.

And also the expressions of Rev. J. M. Foster, in the *Christian Cynosure,* Oct. 17, 1892.

According to the Scriptures, the State and the church are one. The separation theory is infidel in its origin. It holds that the State has no spiritual reference to the Church's interests in all its departments. This union is not the relation of Church to State but of State to Church.

Now add to these the following from Rev. T. T. Talbott's speech in a convention of the National Reform party:

In administering this our constitutional law ... it was expected that our Government ... of man, God has ordained two administrative agencies. The State should of course hold itself supreme but the State must, as the guardian of its own interests, either the State or Church as its auxiliary agent in the realm ... 1893, and for other purposes approved August 4, 1893.

This union, therefore, is the true form of Government in which all matters, whether affecting religion or affecting politics, are brought under and kept in subjection to the Church.

It is worth noting anything these words mean that the Church, the papacy, has merely proposed to get the churches, the Protestants, and the State, to dominate or control the State, that it has set out to submerge the State, the men through their faith or religious sentiment may be fired or persuaded to act for those who desire to bring the Government to Church dogmas, the State is to come under the power of the Church, and the Church and State run in "parallel lines." And as for the Catholic side, a parallel example has been established; and so Rev. J. M. Foster, of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Pa., "The Church is gaining power and must needs be gaining power, and its voice will be heard much oftener in the future than in the past."

And Rev. H. H. George, recently declared in a speech in Paterson, N. J.: "I have learned that we hold the United States Senate in our hands." Certainly, for Senator Hewitt says:—

If the time to-day decides that it will not close the Fair on Sunday the Roman Catholic Church, ... have the courage to defy the Roman Catholic Church?

Cardinal Gibbons closes his reply to the effect that the relations between "church" and State are as close and as cordial and so could be desired.

What more should we ask? When the church shall than to control the State and make demands corresponding to her last speech to the government.

Parallel lines may find by theoretical exercise never meet; but the "parallel lines" of the Rev. J. M. Foster, and others are in such close proximity ... Government organized by and for the interests of a church ...

In its Encyclical 1885 Pope Leo XIII. admonished Catholics everywhere as follows:

All earnest all Catholics who would devote serious attention to what belongs to the safety of the State ... to have for their idea those Catholic Church, to cherish from their hearts the best wishes for the further principles of the church in political and social life in the countries where they may happen to live. The supreme authority vested, is a sacred thing itself, under the safeguard of the strictest religious and moral law.

Those who govern should guard vigilance and energy to prevent the mischief of those who are opposed to the advancement of God's foe. All Catholics should be found worthy of the profession of Catholics.

As Cardinal Gibbons speaks of the "church" in this country the line includes Protestants and Catholics both joining hands together. And Bishop Keane in a lecture at the Harvard Divinity School invited Protestants and Catholics to vote for temperance law with "the emphasis of moral legislation."

In its Encyclical 1885 Pope Leo XIII. admonished Catholics everywhere as follows:

It would be a great mistake to draw the inference that in America, the separation of Church and State is universally established. ... Therefore our Government is Anti-Christian.
