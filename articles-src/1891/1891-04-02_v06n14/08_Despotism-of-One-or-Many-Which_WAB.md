Many people seem to think that the majority should always have their own way; that it is only necessary to ascertain what is the will of the majority, and then to carry out that will at whatever cost. If somebody's rights are in the way—why, so much the worse for the rights, thats all. If some one objects to such high-handed interference with that which is most sacred and dear, and without which life itself has no charm—he is confronted with the reply, "The majority has rights as well as you," and then he is treated all the worse for his insolence. Thus it has ever been since power has been with the people. *Vox populi, Vox Dei*, is the cry, and they endeavor to carry out that voice, private rights to the contrary notwithstanding.

It was intended, however, when the American Government was established, to give this theory—as well as the theory of the divine right of kings—its deathblow in this country. In nearly every State paper, notably the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution of the United States,—the inalienable rights of man or the existence of the eternal law of justice was asserted, and the framers of these immortal documents were not at all careful about concealing the meaning of the words used. They asserted, and they meant to assert, that there are certain inherent and inalienable rights in man, given by his Creator, that no power on earth, whether it be a Solomon in all his glory or a majority of teeming millions, has a right to molest or in any way interfere with. Governments may be established for the protection of these rights, but any encroachment upon such rights is an illegitimate use of the power entrusted,—is tyranny, and should be so stigmatized. "The rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment," says Madison in his famous Virginia memorial, "exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are tyrann. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them, and are slaves." Jefferson likewise asserted that "our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us."

This principle was not only laid down by the founders of our great political system, but has been emphatically reasserted by the Supreme Court of the United States, the most august judicial tribunal in the world. "It must be conceded," says our highest court, "that there are such [private] rights in every free government beyond the control of the State. A government which recognized no such rights, which held the lives, the liberty, and the property of its citizens, subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism. It is true it is a despotism of the many, of the majority if you choose to call it so, but it is none the less a despotism. It may well be doubted if a man is to hold all that he is accustomed to call his own, all in which he has placed his happiness, and the security of which is essential to that happiness under the unlimited dominion of others, whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many.

"The theory of our Governments, State and National, is opposed to the deposit of unlimited power anywhere. The executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches of these Governments are all of limited and defined powers.

"There are limitations on such powers that grow out of the essential nature of all free governments;—implied reservations of individual rights, without which the social compact could not exist, and which are respected by all governments entitled to the name. No court, for instance, would hesitate to declare void a statute which enacted that A and B, who were husband and wife to each other, should be so no longer; but that A should thereafter be the husband of C, and B the wife of D; or which should enact that the homestead now owned by A should no longer be his but should henceforth be the property of B."

Judge Cooley, in his "Constitutional Limitations," also asserts, in part, the principle underlying the foregoing decision of the Supreme Court. It must be borne in mind that rights are just claims according to natural law—the law of justice. Declarations of rights are simply declarations of these claims;—the claims are valid and just, whether recognized in our Constitutions or not. Judge Cooley says:—

The bills of rights in the American Constitutions forbid that parties shall be deprived of property except by the law of the land; but if the prohibition had been omitted, a legislative enactment to pass one man's property over to another would nevertheless be void. If the act proceeded upon the assumption that such other person was justly entitled to the estate, and therefore it was transferred, it would be void, because judicial in its nature; and if it proceeded without reasons, it would be equally void, as neither legislative nor judicial, but a mere arbitrary fiat.

The Parliament of Great Britain, indeed, as possessing the sovereignty of the country, has the power to disregard fundamental principles, and pass arbitrary and unjust enactments; but it can not do this rightfully, and it has the power to do so simply because there is no written Constitution from which its authority springs or on which it depends, and by which the courts can test the validity of its declared will.

The rules which confine the discretion of Parliament within the ancient landmarks are rules for the construction of the powers of the American legislatures; and however proper and prudent it may be expressly to prohibit those things which are not understood to be within the proper attributes of legislative power, such prohibition can never be regarded as essential, when the extent of the power apportioned to the legislative department is found upon examination not to be broad enough to cover the obnoxious authority. The absence of such prohibition can not, by implication, confer power.

Nor, where fundamental rights are declared by the Constitution, is it necessary at the same time to prohibit the Legislature, in express terms, from taking them away. The declaration is itself a prohibition, and is inserted in the Constitution for the express purpose of operating as a restriction upon legislative power.—Chapter 7, pages 173, 176.

These fundamental principles of our Government are too often overlooked. The truth is, according to the American political system, that the rights of man are wholly "beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty," as Madison says, "wherever vested or however viewed." And it is just as much a citizen's right and a citizen's duty to resist interference by the Government when it tramples on one right as when it tramples upon another. It is just as much his right and duty to disregard a law depriving him of one seventh of his time, as is done by Sunday laws, as it would be to disregard a decree giving to some one else one seventh of his property. Viewed even in a purely civil light, nothing less than this flagrant disregard of his private right can be seen;—and the further disregard of his religious right adds just so much more to the outrage upon the individual.

In this connection is seen the truth of Professor Francis Lieber's statement upon the question of majorities:—

Liberty has not unfrequently been defined as consisting in the rule of the majority; or, it has been said, where the people rule, there is liberty. The rule of the majority, of itself, indicates the power of a certain body; but power is not liberty. Suppose the majority bid you drink hemlock, is there liberty for you? Or, suppose the majority give away liberty and establish a despot. We might say with greater truth, find where the minority is protected although the majority rule, then probably liberty exists. But in this latter case it is the protection, or in other words, rights beyond the reach of the majority, which constitute liberty;—not the power of the majority. There can be no doubt that the majority ruled in the French massacres of the Protestants; was there liberty in France on that account? All despotism, without a standing army, must be supported or acquiesced in, by the majority. It could not stand otherwise.—*On Civil Liberty and Self-Government* (London, 1883), page 15.

It is only by a just appreciation of these principles that liberty can be preserved; for any infringement upon the rights of the minority, if persisted in, always results in trampling them in the dust. There is no longer any danger to America from oppression by a despotic king; but there are far graver dangers against which the American people must stand guarded. A man can better defend himself against a tyrannical king than he can against a tyrannical majority. "It may be doubted," as the Supreme Court of the United States declares, if we are to have a despotism over us at all, "whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many."

"From kings, indeed," says John Fiske, "we have no more fear; they have come to be as spooks and bogies of the nursery. But the gravest dangers are those which present themselves in new forms, against which people's minds have not yet been fortified with traditional sentiments and phrases."* Then let us not spend all force against past evils,—evils which have gone down never again to rise;—but rather guard against the actual evils that threaten us. Paternalism, centralization, nationalism, a despotism of the majority, the deprivation of the rights of the minority, are evils coming on with a force in this country, that, if not checked, will yet prove as destructive of individual liberty as any despotism of a single man ever did. The rights of man can not be too securely guarded against the encroachment of any and all tyranny whatsoever. When this is done—when every man is insured his every right, and every individual realizes that he himself is a sovereign—then, and not till then, will the possibilities of a democracy like ours be fully realized.
