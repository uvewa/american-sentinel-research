THE *Christian Instructor* is a religious paper of the Simon Pure National Reform stripe; consequently, it was very much offended when the President's Thanksgiving proclamation, last fall, did not have the name of Christ in it; and it indignantly inquires, "Has not the time come when the churches should unite in issuing a proclamation of their own in which their Lord should be recognized?"

Well, if the time has not come yet, we should think it high time the churches were finding it out. It is a queer thing, indeed, if the churches can not give a thanksgiving to their Lord, or even issue a proclamation in which their Lord shall be recognized. It is singular, indeed, that the churches must depend on a civilian officer to appoint for them days of thanksgiving. It is bad enough if the churches can not give thanks to their Lord, without having the President of the United States turn himself into a national high priest—Pontifex Maximus—and appoint a day, and tell how to give thanks.
