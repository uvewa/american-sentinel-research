CLOSELY akin to this idea that for the sake of homogeneity the State may properly teach religion as something that it is not, is the theory of the "civil Sabbath." Those who admit, because they must, that the State can not enforce the keeping of the religious Sabbath, turn right around and say, "But the State can enforce the keeping of the civil Sabbath." Upon examination, however, the two are found to be identical in everything except in the sacred regard for the day which resides in some hearts, while it is absent from others. The "civil Sabbath" is simply a fraud, a pretense; it is simply a religious day masquerading in secular garments for the sake of civil support which it could get in no other way. How long will it be before somebody will be explaining that the State has no right to compel baptism, as such, but for hygienic reasons it might properly require the wholesale immersion of the people? Great possibilities are bound up in Dr. Hoyt's suggestion that "the State has no right to compel the teaching of religion, as such."
