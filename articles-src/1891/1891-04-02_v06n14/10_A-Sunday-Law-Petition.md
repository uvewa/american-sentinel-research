In 1889 we were obliged to say considerable about the manner in which the petitions for a national Sunday law were gotten up by the American Sabbath Union and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Having exposed the thing quite fully, we have not said anything further about it for somewhat more than a year past; now, however, we have to mention it again for the sake of showing that their original manifestations have not yet been abandoned.

Being in the city of Washington, lately, and looking over the petitions for a Sunday law, we found one of which the following is as nearly a perfect copy as we can make with type. On the back of it was the indorsement that it is a—

Petition of 131 persons from the Second Cong. Dist. of Louisiana and elsewhere, collected by the National W. C. T. U., asking for a national Sunday rest law against needless Sunday work in the Government mail and military service, and inter-state commerce.

Following this is the official congressional indorsement:—

Sep. 15, 1890.
Referred to Committee on Labor.

The original we have had in our hands and have had it copied, and can certify that the following is an exact copy of the original:—

Petitions Gathered by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

The petition which follows was endorsed by a standing vote of——to——(men and women of 21 years of age or more) by a meeting of the citizens of the State (or Territory) of the State of Penn., County of Jefferson, City (or town) of Knox, on the 29th of June, 1890.

To the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled:

We, the undersigned citizens of the United States, respectfully petition your honorable body to pass laws forbidding Sunday work in the mail and military service of the Government and in inter-state commerce.

It will be observed that to make the 131 names claimed for this petition, the entire membership of the two churches must be counted, and to this number must be added all the individual names, each of which, with the exception of four, appears three times. It is thus that they are still swelling the number of petitioners for a Sunday law by triplicating names.
