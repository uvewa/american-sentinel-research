THE *Central Presbyterian* says:—

The truth is, there seems to be a craze in certain quarters for human machinery within the Church. There seems to be a want of confidence in the efficacy of the agencies and means which our Lord has instituted. It is a subtle form of unbelief creeping into the Church.

And in nothing is this unbelief more plainly manifested than in the demand for civil-law props for the tottering faith of the multitude.
