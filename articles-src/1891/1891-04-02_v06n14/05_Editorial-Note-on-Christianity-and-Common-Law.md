AN English judge at one time set forth that Christianity is part of the common law of England, and several American judges have repeated this dictum. So far as it relates to rights and duties, Christianity is a part of the common law only in so far as it is distinctly embodied in the common law. You can not indict a man for not loving his neighbor as himself. Christianity may require a man to sell all that he has and give to the poor, or when one cheek is smitten to turn the other also to the smiter, but these duties are not enforced by the penal code of any Christian nation in our time.—*New York Times.*
