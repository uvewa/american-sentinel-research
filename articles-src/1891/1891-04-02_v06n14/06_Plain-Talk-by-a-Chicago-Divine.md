Is a sermon on the subject of religious liberty, published in the *Inter-Ocean*, of February 9, Rev. Geo. W. Ballenger, pastor of the First Evangelical Church of South Chicago, said:—

"You can fetter the limbs, lacerate the flesh, and torture the body, but the conscience cries, 'I will be free.' The people of God love this freedom of conscience so dearly that in the history of the past they have chosen to suffer every imaginable kind of persecution that blind zeal and satanic hatred could inflict, millions choosing death in the most horrible manner, rather than recant and surrender their right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. And firmly believing that there are many at the present time who guard the wealth of conscience with as much sacredness, and would suffer equally as much now as did our ancestors in the Dark Ages rather than hush the voice of conscience and surrender their God-given rights, I am in favor of religious liberty alike for all. I am decidedly opposed to the present attempt on the part of many—and some of them high in the church—to secure legislation on merely religious matters, which can not but result in religious persecution. These so-called reforms demand the careful study of the American people at the present time. Especially does it become the pressing duty of the clergy to acquaint themselves with the signs of the times. I am compelled to believe there is a necessity for rallying in defense of the United States of America—which guarantees to every man the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

"The venomous head of the persecuting monster can be seen to-day in the King case now pending in the District Court of the United States. The treatment which this Christian man and many more of the members of his denomination in Tennessee, Georgia, and Arkansas, have received, is enough to mantle the cheek of every true American with shame, and fire the Nation with just indignation. The evidence in the case proves him a Christian; the law, which is unconstitutional, treats him like a felon; and while the secular press, North and South, and many statesmen, East and West, have in positive terms expressed their indignation at this outrageous persecution, I take shame to myself as a Christian minister that my brethren of the ministry, and members of the Christian churches have not protested in behalf of these our brethren. Have denominational lines so divided us and priestly creeds so separated us that the common brotherhood of Christ is lost sight of? And is the Church of America so great a backslider in heart that it must resort to the civil law in order to protect its doctrines? Beware of that man or body of men, no matter how exalted their position or high sounding their title, who move in legislative halls, seeking thereby to secure the strong arm of the law to enforce their creed upon a free people!"
