[page 112]

THE *Progressive Age* very properly reminds us that "our schools should be so conducted that a child would never be reminded that he was a Protestant or Catholic, Jew or Christian, Unitarian or Trinitarian."

---

*United Presbyterians* says:—

> The truth is, there seems to be no cause within of Christian but a human sentiment within the Church. *It is not the notion of particular churches, for the preservation of the agencies and instincts out Lord intends.* It is not taught by these modern numbers whether in the fourth century.

---

THE *Legal News* compilation states that "the Governor of Minnesota has appointed a retired, Ireland, a Roman Catholic, chaplain of the State militia." Well, what of it? If chaplains are appointed by State authority why is a Catholic one any less acceptable? Of course, the proper thing to do would be to abolish all such relics of a union of Church and State; but is the Legislature ready to take that step?

---

REV. WALTON HOLT, D. D., says in the *Christian Endeavor*, of March 8:—

"Very good, I agree to that." But in such a system, conscience is not only not a guide, it is not even a helper; for all the work must be done and the knowledge of obtained, before conscience is done of, and before conscience takes it up.

Thus, according to this system, of what earthly use is conscience? None whatever. In fact, this statement demonstrates that in this system of ethics, conscience really has no intelligible place at all. It is virtually no intelligence of what the real is.

---

This is simply an attempt to justify the State in doing that which it clearly has no right to do, namely, to meddle in religious matters. The State has no right to compel religious instruction, as such, nor to enforce any religion. The State has a right to insist that public business shall be conducted in the language of the State, and to this end that those who are to carry on that business for the State shall be familiar with that language, but by no possibility can a justification be wrung from this fact for the *teaching of religion by the State*, or for the teaching of religion as something else than that which it actually is.

---

"CLOSELY akin to this idea that for the sake of homogeneity the State may properly teach religion as something that it is not, is the theory of the 'civil Sabbath.' Those who admit, because they must, that the State can not enforce the keeping of the religious Sabbath, turn right around and say, 'But the State *can* enforce the keeping of the *civil* Sabbath.' Upon examination, however, they are found to be identical in everything except in the sacred name, which is drawn from religion. The 'civil Sabbath' is simply a fraud, a pretense; it is simply a religious day masquerading in secular garments for the sake of civil support which it could get in no other way. How long will it be before ministers will be so honest as to acknowledge that the State has no right to compel homage, and that by legislative means, as such, not by legislative reasons it might properly require the wholesale observance of the people? Great possibilities are bound up in Mr. Hoyt's suggestion that 'the State has no right to compel the teaching of religion, as such.'"

THE pastor of a Presbyterian Church, in this State, writes:—

> I stated, that no man, as such, according to the Constitutions, must be invited as to religion, that no religious education should be sanctioned by law. I stated that the law had nothing to do with the question of religion and the public school so far, and so long as it is religion and no more. I will add that I believe the real trouble with our American system of education is to be let alone and be let as our own; and that we have to learn to endeavor, keep the eye in the public school rather than battle conscience and go for the education of our position with religious confidence.

This is doubtless the real sentiment of many not only in the Presbyterian, but of all Protestant churches. Not all, however, like to have the courage to say what they think on the subject.

---

THE *Christian Statesman* declares that the combination of the church members in support of political and practical measures of reform, is the duty of the hour; accordingly it advocates an outward, or rather pretended unity amongst the churches, and says:—

> Concession in favor of some forms of practical unity among the followers of Christ are deepening and widening every year. The spirit of union has reached every branch of the Church of Christ, even the most exclusive. It is not the union of particular churches, for the preservation, but a mass of all the churches of Christ, for the discharge of their common and joint responsibilities toward the Nation and the world, which requires the attention of one of those open and thoughtful Christians.

Yes, this is the same kind of unity they had in the fourth century, and the professional church leaders pushed it off upon Constantine as though it were made. By this means they succeeded in getting the control of the civil power in their hands just as soon as political and financial benefits became seemingly the humeral unity which had been established, was disrupted, and there followed the work that the world afterward knew peace. Such unity as is proposed by the *Statesman* can never prove anything more than a curse to the Nation.

---

THE *Christian Instructor* is a religious paper of the Simon Pure National Reform type. But even the *Instructor* is a little restful when the President's Thanksgiving proclamation, last fall, did not have the name of Christ in it, and in indignantly demands, "Has not the time come when the churches should be making a proclamation of their own in which that name should be recognized?"

Well, if the time has not come, it soon would come, it is to be feared, for the name will be thought of. It is a quiet thought; indeed, if the churches can not give a thanksgiving to their Lord, or even honor a proclamation in which their Lord shall be recognized. It is to be remembered that the Church depends not on a nation or any other civil form to appeal to, the Lord, without having the President of the United States direct them in national form to a right prayer—Puritan Mavetics and appoint a day, and tell how to give thanks and whom to thank.

"AMONG the Northern Lutherans," in one of the late conventions the members of "Young People's Library" yet laurel. The book is a brief history of the principal English and American Anti-slavery ephemera of the present century, and is intensely interesting. It is the best brief story of so vast a subject that we have ever read. Price, in cloth, 40 cents; in paper, 25 cents. Pacific Press, New York, and Oakland.

THE SENTINEL, we received the other day and very promptly. I think it is correct in the direction of saving Church and State. Let us here say before that, the mail goes well also.
