OF the Saturday half-holiday and the law which makes it such, the *World* says:—

It is difficult to see what can be done, apart from persuasion, to secure a more general observance of the Saturday half-holiday. The law does not compel any merchant or shop-keeper or factory owner to close his establishment on Saturday afternoon. Indeed, there is no power in the Legislature to enact such a law. All that can be done by statute is done. The law makes Saturday afternoon a half-holiday. It compels banks to close, renders the protest of notes and the like illegal, and thus makes it less easy than it would otherwise be for general business to go on. As a consequence most large, and many small, establishments close at noon on Saturday during the summer. If they decline to do so at other times of the year they violate no law. . . . If employers do not see fit to observe the half-holiday in their own business there is nowhere any authority to compel them.

We have italicized one sentence in the foregoing to call attention to the central thought in it, namely, that "there is no power in the Legislature to enact" a law compelling suspension of business on Saturday afternoon. This we believe to be the truth. Then how is it that laws are not only passed but are sustained by the courts compelling suspension of business on Sunday?
