THE pastor of a Presbyterian Church, in this State, writes:—

I believe that the State, as such, according to our Constitution, must be neutral as to religion; that religious education must be assumed by the Church; and that much of what is said by church writers on the question of religion and the public school is pure prejudice, and will not stand candid examination. I will add that I believe the real trouble with Protestant churches is their abominable inertia, laziness for us at one say; and that we have come to find it easy to shout, Keep the Bible in the public schools! rather than bestir ourselves and give the children of our parishes real religious instruction.

This is doubtless the real sentiment of many not only in the Presbyterian, but in all Protestant churches. Not all, however, have the courage to say what they think on the subject.
