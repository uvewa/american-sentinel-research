## Plain Talk by a Chicago Divine.

[page 107]

On the general subject of religious liberty, published in the *Inter-Ocean*, of February 8, Rev. W. W. Belknap, pastor of the First Evangelical Church of Chicago, said:—

"You can fetter the limbs, lacerate the flesh, and torture the body, but the conscience, 'I will be free.' The people of God love this freedom of conscience so much that in the history of the past they have chosen to suffer every imaginable kind of persecution that blind zeal and satanic hatred could inflict, millions choosing death in the most horrible manner, rather than recant and surrender their right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. And firmly believing that there are many at the present time who appreciate the wealth of conditions, and such sacrifices, and suffer cruelty as much now as did our ancestors in the Dark Ages rather than hush the voice of that monitor from which their God-given rights, I am in favor of religious liberty after all. I am compelled to subscribe to the present attempt on the part of many—and some of them high in the church—to secure legislation on purely religious matters, which can not but result in religious persecution. The so-called reforms demanded demand the careful study of all American people at the present time. Especially does it become the pressing duty of the clergy to acquaint themselves with the signs of the times. I am compelled to believe there is a necessity for rallying in defense of the United States of America—which guarantees to every man the freedom of conscience according to the dictates of his own conscience.

"The enormous fund of the persecuting monster can be seen to-day in the King case now pending in the District Court of the United States. The treatment of this Christian man and many of his co-religionists in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Georgia, have received, is enough to startle the cloud of every true American with shame, and fire the Nation with just indignation. The evidence in the case proves him a Christian, the law, which is unconstitutional, treats him like a felon; and while the so-called peers, North and South, and many statesmen, East and West, have by positive terms championed these indignities at this outrageous persecution, I take shame to myself as a Christian minister that my brothers of the ministry, and members of the Christian churches have not protested in behalf of these our brethren. Have the commandments been so divided in and primarily creeds so separated so that the commands brotherhood of Christ is lost sight of? And is the Church of America so great a backslider in heart that it must resort to the civil law in order to protect its doctrine? Beware of that man or body of men, no matter how much tainted their [page 108] position or high sounding their title, who moves in legislative halls, seeking thereby to secure the strong arm of the law to enforce their creed upon a free people!"
