READING, writing, arithmetic, and geography are not taught differently by a Methodist and by a Jesuit, but in precisely the same fashion, if they are taught properly. To say that a "godless" instruction in these branches of knowledge, or in any others that are properly within the province of the public schools, is "necessarily immoral," is to make a perfectly meaningless assertion.—*New York Times.*
