## What Is the Guide to Morality?

[page 105]

At the end of his discussion of the subject of "Ethics of Schools," Mr. Bierbower comes to "conscience-teaching." In fact this point is touched upon in the very beginning of the Introduction of the book, so that the beginning and the end, the first and the last, deals with the question of conscience. In stating "the ground of right," the second paragraph in the book says:—

> We recognize right by our judgment of what is and by a *feeling*—conscience—which indicates, in the souls of many impressional, what we ought to do and its impact on others.

And in the last chapter of the book begins with the following paragraph:—

> The best general rule of morality is *to do what you believe right and good, and to preserve your personal consciousness of this* by its instantly perforating your conduct, when in doubt. Goodness is simple when thus reduced to one rule. *For you have but to look at the sense of what we ought to do, which makes clear to you our thought and information on the subject.*—Page 168.

This ground of right is just as treacherous as that which was discovered in the peroration on this subject, in fact, it is the same thing only stated in other words; yet it enters the realm of conscience; it touches the real ground of conscience right, and substitutes good. If conscience were a true guide, then this rule would be good enough, but conscience is not a true guide. Conscience as a guide [page 106] is as erratic as any other faculty in man. The truth is that consciences need first to be guided. This is admitted by the book now under notice. One statement to this effect is as follows:—

> It is important then in taking conscience as a guide, to *have it in its working order.*—Page 74.

Aye, we should naturally suppose so. Any kind of an instrument that is not in working order is not of much use; and especially in questions of conscience and of ultimate right. And in this case even to think of taking as a guide an instrument that could ever by any possibility get out of working order, seems rather a singular suggestion. Another statement to the same purpose is as follows:—

> We can not judge to-day on to-morrow's wrongs; what men must should often straighten out their consciences before they get to the legitimate challenges.—Page 311.

And again:—

> Respect your conscience well as your observance of it; or, rather, look after your *tree* of right as well as the latter's judgment.

Of what use is a rule of right which gives so much away and sometimes so much folded that it reads "ought" to be straightened out? And, of what use is a guide that has to be laid up for inspection every little while?

Again we read:—

> Though conscience may err, it is the best judge we have.—Page 40.

shall straighten it out? By what standard shall it be compared when it is straightened, to know whether it is straight or not.

And so while to do this, the directions must be plain. Inspect your own conscience. *Men should often straighten out their conscience.* That is, let the individual be the big judge in his own conscience, as to whether it is in working order, or as to whether it is straight or not. This being so, then who is really to guide the individual, or the conscience of the individual? Clearly the individual himself, and this directly prevents the order of the book; the proposition of the book, that conscience is the guide to right, and the indicator of what we ought to do. And when the one who is to be guided most needs inspect and straighten out, and put in working order, that which is to guide him; then the one who is to be guided becomes in fact the only guide. Which words the one who is guided, must straighten out, put in order, and carry round the circle to the original starting point, that whatever each individual may think best for himself, that is right, in its own right, in his own sight, that is. As to be attended with which the conscience is to be compared when straightened, to know whether it is straight or not; to know whether it is in working order; and to know whether it fitly passes inspection,—this is the sense at the strongest converging of the argument; the matter of right, whatever each one thinks for himself, he says the book, in columns—

> *though conscience may err,* it is the *best judge* we have; *because the principle of the compact after all the conflicting forces which would diversely incline us, ... whatever the individual may think best for himself, that is right, and ending in supreme selfishness.*

But this is where we came in, and just where we started from; and Mr. Bierbower does not tell us but one or two others do it for him on the same basis. And so again we are brought round the circle to the original starting point, that whatever each individual may think best for himself, that is right, and ending in supreme selfishness. By the evidences already given, it will be seen that in the final analysis, this system of ethics comes dangerously close to the fallacious doctrine that "Whatever is, is right." This would be bad enough if it stopped with going dangerously near; but it does not stop there, it goes all the way, as logically every system of morals without religion must do; and here is the evidence:—

> Though conscience may err, it is the best judge we have; *because the principle of the compact after all the conflicting forces which would diversely incline us. ... Whatever the individual may think best for himself, that is right,* and ending in supreme selfishness.

having examined the book, would use it with any measure of approval whatever. Again we say that which is so often admitted by this book, consciences that must needs have a guide. And faith is the guide and the only guide of conscience. Whenever a man believes he is right, by it his conscience will freely assent. Therefore a right faith is essential to good conscience. Now the only right faith in this world, is the faith of Jesus Christ. Without faith in Jesus Christ, there can be no right conscience; without a right conscience there can be no genuine morality.

If this is the logic of the question and it can never be escaped; and it only demonstrates once more by proofs that can not be refuted, the principle which THE SENTINEL has always occupied, that morality without religion is a misnomer. And more than this, that morality without the religion of Jesus Christ, is a misnomer. Jesus Christ is the author of the right faith, which is the author or source of right morality. The teaching of this, that by which alone right morality can be attained, is committed to the Church. The Church is endowed with the Spirit of God by which the teaching is to be perfected with power. If the Church would do its work as it is its privilege and duty, there would be no need of even looking to the teaching it was never committed to the State; the power by which alone it can work effectively has never been bestowed upon the State.

Therefore as genuine morality can come only from a right conscience, and a right conscience can come only from a right faith, and a right faith can come only by the teaching which is committed to the Church; it is demonstrated that there is no genuine morality outside of a genuine Christianity; and as the civil power can not teach faith in Jesus Christ, as the State can not teach the religion of Jesus Christ, the position of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, that the State can not teach morals, is fully confirmed.

The final conclusion of Mr. Bierbower's proposed system of ethics for society and schools in the United States, in this nineteenth century, is identical with that of the pagan, Marcus Aurelius, in the second century. And this upon and since pagan time, it is supremely proposed, shall be taught to the children and practiced by society in the United States! And Mr. Bierbower actually seems to have as much confidence in his proposed system; that is, he thinks that "Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and unbelievers may use this book with equal approval." For our part we should like very much to see a single Catholic, or Protestant, or Jew, or unbeliever, who, having examined the book, would use it with any measure of approval whatever.

An English judge at our time or two forth the common law of England, and several American courts have repeated this opinion. So far as it relates to rights and duties, Christianity is a part of the common law; so far as it is to distinctly embraced by the common law. You can not insist that a man for not loving his neighbor as himself. Christianity may require a man to all that he has and give it; the law of the page, when one chose to mention to turn the other also to the mines; but the law does not are not enforced by the penal code of any Christian nation in our time.—*New York*
