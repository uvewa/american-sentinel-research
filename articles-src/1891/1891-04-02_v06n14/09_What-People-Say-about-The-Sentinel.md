From lawyers and magistrates in North Carolina who have received two numbers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL:—

As well as I can understand the purpose of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, I am in full accord with its views. I favor allowing the widest latitude in religious opinion, and no interference with the opinion or conduct of others while they conform to the requirement of the law enacted in compliance with the Constitution.

I have perused your paper carefully, and consider it worthy of the attention of all good people. I feel grateful for the numbers sent to me, and would be happy to read more of them. Success to your paper.

I have received THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and like its contents, and the position it takes. I believe it is the duty of every Christian who is a lover of religious liberty, to keep posted upon all matters and laws that have a tendency to make the least encroachment upon the same. I further believe that every church organization should be free and independent of another, and as a church, should recognize no authority except the Bible, and no law-giver but our Lord Jesus Christ, and that in the New Testament.

Please put my name on your subscription list for THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. I like the principles of the paper very much.

THE SENTINEL was received the other day and carefully perused. I think it is correct on the question of uniting Church and State. Let us have anything before that. You may send me a few numbers of the paper, as I would like to see what is being said on the subject.

I think THE SENTINEL is first-class paper, and I see solid opinions expressed in it. I think the sacredness of the Sabbath should be left to the people and their common sense, and Church and State should be forever separate. The government that governs the least and with the least expense, I think sonicated and healthiest. My best wishes for THE SENTINEL.

Your letter and valuable paper have reached me, and found me in sympathy with your views as regards the union of Church and State. I like to read all such, and if you see fit to send me a few numbers, I will be very much obliged.
