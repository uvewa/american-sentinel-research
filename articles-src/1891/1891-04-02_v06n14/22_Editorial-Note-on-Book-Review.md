"Among the Northern Icebergs," is one of the very best numbers of the "Young People's Library" yet issued. The book is a brief history of the principal English and American Arctic explorations of the present century, and is intensely interesting. It is the best brief work on this subject that we have ever read. Price, in cloth, 50 cents; in paper, 25 cents. Pacific Press, New York, and Oakland, California.
