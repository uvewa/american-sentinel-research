## Another Sunday-Law Convention.

[page 107]

THE American Sabbath Union recently held a convention in Boston for the purpose of organizing an auxiliary State Association. Such an organization was effected, and bent to the organization the Massachusetts Sabbath Association. The following officers were elected:—

President, Hon. Rufus S. Frost; Vice-Presidents, Ex-Governor W. Claflin, Rev. S. Huntington Gaines; Secretary Talmb., Robert Guilbert, Mr. G. B. Stacy; State Secretary, Rev. George A. Crawford, D. D.; Treasurer, Rev. O. W. Ward; Board of Trustees, Rev. Alexander McKenzie, D. D., Charles A. Dod, Rev. A. H. Plumb, D. D., Rev. S. H. Roblin, Rev. J. M. Graves, Hon. Wm. E. Russell, A. Miner, D. D.

An astonishing array of Reverends and D. D.'s as officers and directors, it would seem a trifle difficult for all of the National Union to continue set of old, to declare that the movement is not in any sense a church one, that it is only the effort of the poor overworked laboring classes to secure his rest. Nevertheless, even this manifestation of assurance has, through much practice, become habitual to the Union, and so, if it should be repeated here in Massachusetts, there would be "nothing new under the sun."

The convention delivered itself of the usual number of speeches against Sunday newspapers and Sunday travel, and all sorts of Sunday work, and resulted in the appointment of a committee to intervene with the Massachusetts Legislature for such a change in the State Sunday laws as will prohibit the publication of the Sunday papers, the daily "proceedings" of the Sunday sermon.

They also authorized as the committee to petition the Legislature relative to the publication of Sunday papers, the following:—

Rev. Dr. Reed, Rev. Dr. Miner, Rev. Dr. Gordon, Rev. Mr. Bradshaw, Rev. Dr. Bradlee, Sr., Chairman, Hon. Jonathan A. Lane, and Hon. S. E. Dana, with power to fill vacancies.

Another lot of Rev. D. D. by, which makes the poor-over-worked-laboring-man plea look as though it were written with compassion. With these Reverends garnishing the conventions and lecturing before popular audiences, for the purpose of arousing sympathy and support for their Sunday-law crusade, the wonder will come to tell them, that they had so utterly forgotten themselves and their own central interest, and had so completely become en rapport with the hard-toiled dollar, that they stood there before the people, the personification of the combined interests of organized labor, a sort of a national Knight of Labor combination, boiled down to one man. When, however, you hear them, in their own convention, tell the real rea- [page 108] son why they want these Sunday laws, this rose-tinted illusion of superficial selfishness quickly vanishes, and it is seen that they, too, are men of like passions with common humanity, and even small (may I not say it), with all the persecutions and ingratitude of self. Not a word about the interests of the poor toilers then, only in for so they are true to their own selfish interest into the support of their own Sunday-law schemes. All is about the preloaded; and the Sunday papers, and the Sabbath and Sunday keep compliers of the divinity, and so for the reason they want it controlled by law.

The first resolution passed by this Massachusetts Convention was:—

> *Resolved*, That we believe that when Christ said the Sabbath was made for man, he stated a principle of perpetual validity, involving those theological instructions which assert of conscience between the Lord's day and the principle of universal rest, as were recognized in the legislation of the earliest colonial Commonwealths.

And yet, as an institution in the world that have done so much to "serve the convenience" between the Nation, there is none to be compared with the American Sabbath Union. They have everywhere insisted that there really be no reasonable connection between the Lord's day and the religious Sabbath, as the Sabbath resting on the original institution of rest, which was made for man.

They have everywhere insisted that there is no Sabbath law as having any religious nature in that nation that the civil Sabbath law, without these laws being religious laws in any way affecting the religious separation, and have-declared that Sunday laws were human laws in dignity, that they have ever were and now are, and that by misrepresented them.

Now a convention of the American Sabbath Union, right while it is working for stricter law to enforce Sunday observance, declares that we are right, and have been right all the time, and that in the very first official act attempts to secure the enactment; that religion and the divine commandments are the ground of it.

Well, we are glad they have acknowledged it, but it must be remembered that before that we allow to them the entire consistency in the matter; they are quite certain they cover their people. Undoubtedly the American Sabbath Union will play the civil Sunday game as long as they can; but here in Massachusetts as it has been elsewhere. In one of the first responsible speakers in that convention has already spoken to us very actively, from the Protestant Temple platform, and declared:—

The next resolution passed by the convention reads as follows:—

> *Resolved*, That we believe that the establishment of the first day of the week for the seventh, in the belief, with undiscriminated moral significance, is intended to "the Lord of the Sabbath" as a perpetual memorial of its preservation, and that it was by apostolic authority, and continues to be.

Now this convention evidently sent to organize for the purpose of securing stricter Sunday legislation. We would like to impress upon that real meditation has to do with the securing of would-be civil Sunday laws in harmony, as they say, with our Federal Constitution. No one doubts their civil right to believe that, or to believe anything else they choose; that is the right to them by law to believe, or to force them to act as though they believed, is a very different thing. If they really had a good reason for that belief, they would be content to that reason to others, and thus trust to the awakening of their moral sense for stricter Sunday observance.

Truth has always been willing to stand its own foundations, trusting to its own inherent strength. The early Christian Church while it remained true to the simple and beautiful principles that Jesus and the apostles taught, needed not the supports of the civil power. Strong in the power of truth, which is the power of God, it went forth conquering and to conquer, and in spite of the civil power, in spite of an established and weakened by persuasion, in spite of the world, the flesh, and the devil, it did conquer it. So the new gospel was preached to the civilized world. It was only after, according to Dievers, "a pagan food, flowing into the Church, gave birth and settled in its customs, practices, and morals," till the teachings of the Church was false instead of true, that the Church sought the support of the civil power. Then an unholy alliance was made with the unholy State. But Christianity as a whole the world darkened down into a night of a thousand years. We repeat, in history it has not been the true but the false in religion that has ever sought the support of the civil power; and it has sought such support, not that it might force a little larger upon its more subtle conscience of a doctrine more dangerous than that they were outgrowing. This is the philosophy of religious isolation, and of persecution. Viewed in this light it is easy to see what relation the teaching has to the effort of the Sabbath Union to secure Sunday laws.

"Chambers' Encyclopedia," article "Sabbath," has the following:—

> at or about the middle of the first day of the week began to be especially used for certain religious exercises; for as a distinct institution neither in the Old Testament nor in the writings of the fathers before the fourth century was Sunday called the Sabbath, nor to the duty of ceasing of proceeding by them either in the fourth century to any passages of the Sabbath law.

Kitto in his "Encyclopaedia of Biblical Literature," article "Lord's Day," says:—

> We will readily grant that most things in last time, no fixed considerable reference to a sort of meaning of the day is done; not even a name as yet pointed in the ancient Church to have assumed the form of an observance or a solemn rest.

humanities have commenced. Nor do those within and or before instances to adopt an arbitrary observance of moral or extra-apostolic practice in support of it.

So we see, that though such a doctrine was never taught by Christ, or the apostles, or by the Christian Church for the first four centuries, the American Sabbath Union now declares that Christ did change the day of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week; and as in the case of all past religious legislation, because they have no better evidence for their belief than mere assertion, they seek to force it upon the world by the civil power. This is the only relation that meditation can have to this item of their convention to secure stricter Sunday laws. Not that they would have any more right to enforce that belief by law, if it were true; but that it is were true, and they truly above it to be true by undeniable evidence, that would suffice, and they would not be found trying to compel such belief and practice by law. One more resolution was adopted. It was the third, and reads as follows:—

> *Resolved*, That we will resist all attempts to drive the Sabbath of Christ out of our civil and working out of the consciences of the citizens.

Now the inevitable result of all attempts to enforce the divine law by the civil power, is to "discard" that law of any pretence of divinity, and to lower it to the standard of human civility. The divine law then loses to the thoughts and intents of the heart. The civil power, though backed by all the infernal machinery of an Inquisition, can only occasionally reach the thoughts and enforce the law. Therefore it is that in the greatest majority of cases in the nations that have been civilized and divine morals normally only exist in the enforcing of a human civility, that is, it takes cognizance of the act only and not of the thought, or if it occasionally does reach the thought through torture, more than it fails to bring true submission, and as the State comes to be acknowledged as the authorized teacher and enforcer of religion and morals, and if only outwardly the outward act, the conception of the divine law in the public mind is made to exceed the new human standard of confided morality.

Even in the theocracy of Israel, after it ceased to be a true theocracy, by resisting God, and neglecting the righteousness of his prophets, this was the inevitable result. They came to the point that unless a man broke the law of the Sabbath against murder, never, mouth by his right hand is brother and wife to kill him, he had not broken the divine law; which says, "Thou shalt not kill;" but however lustily they might, unless they committed the open act they were not adulterers. Jesus had to teach them afresh, and magnified the law by lifting it to its high position in heart.

So while the American Sabbath Union suggests that they will make all attempts to direct the Christian Sabbath of the sanctities of the divine law, if what they call the "Christian Sabbath" every had any such sacredness, they have done more to rob it of it, by their device to secure for it the enforcing by the civil power, than all, whether they recognize its divine importance or not, are doing more than all the others combined to lower it to a merely civil level. Vainly constituting. C. P. Bollman.
