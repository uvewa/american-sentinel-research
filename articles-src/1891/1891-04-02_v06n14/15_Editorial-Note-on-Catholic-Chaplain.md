THE *Loyal American* complains that "the Governor of Minnesota has appointed priest Ireland, a Roman bishop, chaplain of the State militia." Well, what of it? If chaplains are appointed by State authority why should Roman Catholics be excluded? Of course, the proper thing to do would be to abolish all such relics of a union of Church and State; but is the *Loyal American* ready to take that position?
