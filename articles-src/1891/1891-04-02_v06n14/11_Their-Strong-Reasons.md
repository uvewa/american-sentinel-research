The following are some of the reasons given by prominent ministers why saloons should not be open on Sunday:—

Lyman Abbott, Pastor Plymouth Church, Brooklyn: The general policy of the State is to prohibit secular business on the Sabbath.

Thomas Stacy, Pastor Brown Memorial M. E. Church: The subject has been considered in our Pastor's Ministerial Association in Syracuse, representing over sixty churches, all of whom are unanimously opposed to opening the saloons on the Lord's day.

William Merle Smith, Pastor Central Presbyterian Church, New York: I wish to assure you of my hearty sympathy in all the work your society is trying to do, and particularly to express the hope that the friends of the Sabbath may be successful in defeating the infamous legislation proposed at Albany.

Vito L. Calabrese, Pastor Italian Mission of the M. E. Church, Varick Place, New York: No friend of the Sabbath, whether he be an American or an Italian, or any other foreigner, wants the saloons open any part of the Sabbath day. In this Christian land the Sabbath day is Sunday, and God has instituted the Sabbath in that he declares in his word that on six days only shall man labor and the seventh shall be hallowed unto Jehovah. The saloon keeper is included in this command. To give him the right to open his saloon on the day thus to be hallowed is to say to him, "you must not hallow that day as God has decreed, but you must work that day and the other six days also." That will be the meaning of his license under such a law.

R. S. MacArthur, Pastor Calvary Baptist Church, New York: It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of protecting our American Sunday. The man who would destroy the sacredness of the day is an enemy to God, to the Republic and to the race. I trust the appeal which has been made will defeat the proposed legislation. Should this proposed legislation prevail, it would practically destroy the Sabbath. I shall use every endeavor to thwart the enemies of the American Sunday and to defeat their proposed plans.

One would naturally expect that those who oppose Sunday liquor selling would dwell largely upon the evils of the drink traffic, and plead that because of the great numbers idle upon Sunday the evils would be augmented by open saloons upon that day, but instead of that the great consideration urged, the one reason above all others, is the religious character of the day! Do we not well say that the "civil Sabbath" is a fraud? and that were it not for the sacredness, which in many minds attaches to Sunday, none would be found so poor as to do it reverence, or to plead for laws restricting the liquor business upon that day more than upon any other? The disposition manifested by many to compromise with the saloons, giving them six days out of seven, shows that it is the exaltation of Sunday rather than the prohibition of liquor selling that is desired.
