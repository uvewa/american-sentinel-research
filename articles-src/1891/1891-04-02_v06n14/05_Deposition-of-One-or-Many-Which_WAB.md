## Deposition of One or Many—Which?

[page 108]

MANY people seem to think that the majority should always have their own way. But if this is so, there is no use in talking about the will of the majority, and then to carry out that will at whatever cost. If monopoly's rights are in the way, so much the worse for the rights. But in fact, if one comes out of right, the high-handed interference with that which is meant sacred and dear, and without which life itself has no reason—he is constituted the worse for his infidelity. You say, "well, why not," and then he is reminded the worse for his infidelity. Over even lesser power has been the worse for his people. You forget, *For Joy, it is the city, and they delivered to carry* that claim, that day and the children to the contrary notwithstanding.

It was intended, however, when the American Government was established, to give to this theory—as well as the theory of the divine right of kings—its deathblow. In the republic, in nearly every State paper, notably the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution of the United States,—the inalienable rights of men, the sovereignty of the people, the consent of the governed and the right of revolution was asserted, and the framers of these immortal documents were not at all modest about announcing the meaning of the words used. They asserted, and they meant to assert, that there are certain just and inalienable rights in man, given by the Creator, that no power on earth, whether it be a Bourbon in all its might, has a right to molest or in any way interfere with. Government may be established, and it is, for the protection of these rights, but any encroachment upon such rights was an illustration of the ene of the persecutions—is tyranny, and should not be acquiesced in. "The father who are guilty of such an encroachment," says Madison "in his famous Memorial," "exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are tyrants. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them, and are slaves." Jefferson likewise asserted that "our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us."

This principle was not only laid down [page 109] by the founders of our great political system, but has been emphatically restated by the Supreme Court of the United States, the most august judicial tribunal in the world. "It must be conceded," says the unrestricted court, "that there exists, and in rightful liberty in every free government beyond the control of the State.

"A government which recognized no such rights, which held the lives, the liberty, and the property of the citizens, subject at its mercy to the absolute disposition, and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism. It is true it is a despotism of the many, of the majority, if you choose to call it so, but it is none the less a despotism. ... It may well be doubted if a man is to be hold that it he is accustomed to call his own, and in which he has placed his happiness, and the security of which is essential to that happiness under the unlimited dominion of others, whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many.

"In the theory of our Government, State and National, is opposed to the deposit of unlimited power anywhere. The executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches of those Governments are all of limited and defined powers.

"There are limitations on such powers that grow out of the essential nature of all free governments, implied reservations of individual rights, without which the social compact could not exist, and which are respected by all governments, settled to the name. No court, for instance, would hesitate to declare void an act which enacted that A and B, who were husband and wife to each other, should be so no longer; that A should therefore be the husband of C, and B the wife of D; or which should enact that the homestead now owned by A should belong to B but should henceforth belong to C."

Judge Cooley, in his "Constitutional Limitations," also asserts, in part, the principle underlying the foregoing decision of the Supreme Court. It must be borne in mind that no just claim can be asserted contrary to natural law—the law of justice. Declarations of rights are simply declarations of those—the citizens shall be and just, whether recognized in our Constitution or not. Judge Cooley says:—

> The rules which confine the discretion of Parliaments within the ancient landmarks are rules for the construction of the genius of the American legislation; and however proper and prudent it may be, expressly to prohibit them or such as are not authorized to lie within the proper attributes of legislative power, and prohibitions also are not required as essential, when the extent of the power appertains to the legislative department is found upon examination not to be broad enough to cover the obnoxious authority. The absence of such prohibitions is not equivalent to an affirmative grant.

> Now, where fundamental rights are defined by a code of positive enactment, no subsequent law can prohibit the Legislature, in express terms, from taking them away, contravene the constitution; a restriction, and is inserted in the Constitution for the express purpose of operating as a restriction upon legislative power.—*Cooley*, pages 175, 176.

These fundamental principles of our Government are too often overlooked. The truth is, according to the American political system, that the rights of man are wholly "beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty," as Madison says, "whatever ever or however exercised." And it is just as much a citizen's right and a citizen's duty to resist interference by the Government when it tramples on one right as when it tramples upon another. It is a man's right and duty to disregard a law depriving him of one seventh of his time, as to defy a Sunday law, as it would be to disregard a law depriving him of some one else one seventh of his property.

Every citizen even in a purely civil right, nothing less than this flagrant assumption of his private right has no more—just the further disregard of his religious right that you set aside by a monstrous piece upon the individual.

In this connection is sent the text of Professor Francis Lieber's statement upon the question of majorities:—

> Liberty has not unfrequently been defined as consisting in the rule of the majority; or, it has been said, where the people rules, there is liberty. The rule of the majority, if that infuses the power of a certain body; not yet is power itself liberty. ... It may be said, with greater truth, that where the minority is protected, there is liberty, rather than in the form of liberty stasis. But in the latter case it is the protection of the minority which constitutes the essence of the majority, which constitutes liberty—and not the power of the majority. There is no power so great as the majority ruled in the French massacres of the Protestants; was there liberty in those massacres? All despotism, without a standing army, must be supported or acquiesced in, by the majority.

> The rule of the majority, however, is not Self Government (*Lieber*, pages 178, 179).

It is only by a just appreciation of these principles that liberty can be preserved, for any infringement upon the rights of the minority, if persisted in, always ends in the overthrow of liberty in the state. There is no longer any danger to America from oppression by a despotic king; but there are far graver dangers coming against which the American people must stand guarded. A [page 110] man can better defend himself against a tyrannical majority. "It may be doubted," as the Supreme Court of the United States declares, if we are to have a despotism exercised over us at all, "whether it is not wiser to have it exercised by one, rather than by many."

"From kings, indeed," says John Fiske, "those who run to minor; they have ceased to be as stools and bogies of the nursery. It is the *grossed dangers and changes*, those which present themselves in new forms, against which peoples must take care, that have yet been fortified with traditional sentiments and watchwords." Then to us and upon good liberal intentions we have never again to rise—but rather guard against the actual effort that animated its. Patriotism, constitutionalism, a deposition of the majority, the deprivation of the rights of the minority, can still menace us with a form in which the country, that, if not checked, will yet prove as destructive of individual liberty as any deposition of a single man ever did. The rights of man can not be turned to guard against the encroachment of one and all tyranny whatsoever. When this is done—when every man is insured his full right, and every individual realizes that until each and every other individual's the right, that he can not be secure of his own, not till then, will the possibilities of a defined structure like ours be fully realized.
