## Their Strong (?) Reasons.

[page 110]

THE following are some of the reasons given by prominent ministers why saloons should not be open on Sunday:

*Ignaus Abbott, Pastor Plymouth Church, Brooklyn.* The primary policy of the State is to prohibit all business on the Sabbath.

*Thomas Atkey, Pastor Brown Memorial M. E. Church.* The subject has been considered in our Board of Education Association in Elysburg, representing every church, all of whom are unanimously opposed to the opening the saloons on the Sabbath.

*William Merle Smith, Pastor Central Presbyterian Church, New York.* I wish to assure you of my hearty sympathy in all the work your society is trying to do, and particularly to express the hope that the friends of the Sabbath may be successful in defeating the infamous legislation proposed at Albany.

*The L. Coleman, Pastor Bolton Minister of the Sabbath.* Whether he be an American or an alien; or any foreigner, wants the saloons open any part of the Sabbath day. In this Christian land the Sabbath day in Sunday, and God has written in the fourth commandment a single word that on six days only shall man labor and do all his work, and no other authority of any longer is included in his command. To give power of that nature is contrary to what he believed it to say to him, "you must not value that day as told he have ordered, but you may sell that day and for the other six days walk." This the meaning of the future makes out to be a sin.

*R. S. MacArthur, Pastor Calvary Baptist Church, New York.* It is almost unnecessary to present the importance of protecting our American Sunday. This was a well-voiced during the early days of our army as it seems to God; to the Republic and to the future. I trust his respect with those who may defeat the proposed legislation. Should this pre-eminently practical reform, a word practically interest congress. I shall do every endeavor to throw influence on the side of the American Sabbath and to defeat this legislation.

One would naturally expect that those who oppose Sunday liquor selling would dwell largely upon the evils of the drink traffic, and plead that because of the great numbers who ruin themselves the evil would be augmented by open saloons upon that day, but instead of that the great consideration urged, the one reason above all others, is the *religious character of the day!* Do we not all well say that the "civil Sabbath" is a fraud? and that were it not for the association, which in many minds attaches to Sunday, none would be found so poor as to do it reverence, or to plead for laws restricting the liquor business upon that day more than upon any other? The disposition manifested by many to compromise with the saloons, giving them six more out of seven, shows that it is the exaltation of Sunday rather than the prohibition of liquor selling that is the aim.

"Men have a great deal to learn before they shall unlearn the lesson of intolerance —that fearful lesson too easily learned, which enfeebles the mind and interprets other good lessons which the intelligent mind should receive."—Rev. O. B. Frothingham.
