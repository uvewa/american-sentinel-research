HONEST, writing, arithmetic, and geography are not taught differently by a Catholic and by a Jesuit, but in precisely the same fashion, if they are taught properly. To say that a "graded" "instruction" in these branches of knowledge, or in any others that are properly within the province of the public schools, is "nonsense," is, "to make a perfectly browning assertion."—*New York Tribune.*

THE Christian religion made the way into the world in opposition to all existing governments. Banishment, tortures, and death were inflicted in vain to stop its progress. But many of its professors, as soon as clothed with political power, lost the same spirit which their creed taught, and began to inflict on others similar, and on dissenting sects of their own religion, persecutions more dangerous than those from which their own creeds had sprung.—*Col. Richard M. Johnson.*

AS the Saturday half-holiday and the law which makes it such, the *World* says, has developed a condition of things that calls for mention. The Saturday half-holiday law does not compel any employer or shopkeeper to close during the summer. If they decline to do so at other times of the year they violate no law. If employers try and set fit to observe the half holiday in their own business there is neither any authority to compel them.

We have italicized one sentence in the foregoing to call attention to the central thought in it, namely, that "there is no power in the Legislature to enact" a law compelling suspension of business on Saturday afternoon. This we believe to be the truth. Now how is it that laws are not only passed but are sustained by the courts compelling suspension of business on Sunday?
