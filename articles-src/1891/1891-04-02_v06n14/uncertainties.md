# Uncertainties Log for v06n14 (1891-04-02)

## General OCR Quality
The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. Most text was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Column 1
- **Location:** Editorial note beginning "OF the Saturday half-holiday..."
- **Transcribed as:** "World" (publication name)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Italicized publication name in original

### Page 6, Column 2
- **Location:** "What People Say about The Sentinel" testimonials
- **Transcribed as:** "sonicated and healthiest"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error, but unclear what the original word was. Context suggests it might have been "economical" or similar, but transcribed exactly as OCR rendered it.

### Page 6, Column 2
- **Location:** Petition table
- **Transcribed as:** "Molina(?)"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Name spelling unclear in OCR, marked with (?) in one instance but not in duplicate column

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **Location:** Webster's Dictionary advertisement
- **Transcribed as:** "Roast from Cover to Cover"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Almost certainly "Revised from Cover to Cover" but OCR rendered as "Roast"

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **Location:** Sentinel Library listing
- **Transcribed as:** "Rolls of Religious Legislation" (No. 3)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Likely "Evils of Religious Legislation" but OCR unclear

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **Location:** Sentinel Library listing
- **Transcribed as:** "Sold and Base Annual" (No. 12)
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** OCR error, unclear what original title was

### Page 8, Column 1
- **Location:** Note about subscription
- **Transcribed as:** "Sample copy"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Standard subscription notice

## Notes
- Page headers "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL" and page numbers were not transcribed per instructions
- Multiple advertisements on pages 7-8 were not transcribed as separate article files per instructions (these are ads, not substantive content)
