## A Sunday-Law Petition.

[page 110]

IN 1889 we were obliged to say considerable about the manner in which the petitions for a national Sunday law were gotten up by the American Sabbath Union and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Having exposed the thing quite fully, we have not said anything further about it for somewhat more than a year past; now, however, we have to mention it again for the sake of showing that their disgraceful tactics have not yet been abandoned.

Being in the city of Washington, lately, and looking over the petitions of a Sunday law, we found one of which the following is an early a perfect copy as we can make with type. On the back of it was the indorsement that it is a—

Petition of 18 persons from the Second Congressional District of Louisiana and churches, collected by the National W. C. T. C. asking for a national Sunday law against needless working work in the Government mail and military services, and inter-state commerce.

Following is the official response.

Sep. 18, 1889.

Referred to the Committee on Education and Labor.

The original we have had in our hands and have had it copied, and can certify that the following is an exact copy of the original:—

*Petitions Gathered by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.*

For a National Sunday Rest Law.

The petition of the citizens of ———— men and women of the State of ————, lawful age, citizens of the United States in the Territory of the State of Fresno, respectfully pray your honorable body to enact the National Sunday Rest Bill, of the 26th of June, 1890.

Attest: Rev. John Gilbert, Presiding.

The petition which follows was indorsed at various called to the fore showing that for all regular societies, temperance societies, and other organizations, the above named boards.

[This is followed by a table of signatures showing 131 names claimed]

It will be observed that to make the 131 names claimed for this petition, the entire membership of the two churches must be counted, and to this number must be added all the individual names, each of which, with the exception of four, appears three times. It is that they are still well with the means of a petitioners for a Sunday law by triplicating names.

On the appeal for adding, or induced by mail to or organizations or meetings, and signed by the usual parties, printed or exclusively signed to, all endorsement suggested.—*Standard*, That it is this time the petition speaks for itself.

*To the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled.*

We, the undersigned adult citizens of the United States, respectfully petition your honorable body to pass a law forbidding Sunday work in the mail and military service of the Government and in interstate commerce.
