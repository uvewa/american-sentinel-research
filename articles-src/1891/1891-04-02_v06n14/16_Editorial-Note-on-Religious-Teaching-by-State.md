REV. WAYLAND HOYT, D. D., says in the *Baptist Examiner*, of March 26:—

The State has no right to compel religious teaching, as such. But the State has a right to compel, for its own weal, similar speech, and so homogeneity of feeling and of interest among its citizens.

This is simply an attempt to justify the State in doing that which it clearly has no right to do, namely, to meddle in religious matters. The State has no right to compel religious instruction, as such, nor as anything else. The State has a right to insist that public business shall be conducted in the language of the State, and to this end that those who are to carry on that business for the State shall be familiar with that language, but by no possibility can a justification be wrung from this fact for the teaching of religion by the State, or for the teaching of religion as something else than that which it really is.
