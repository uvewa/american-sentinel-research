THE *Christian Statesman* declares that the combination of the church members in support of pending and practical measures of reform, is the duty of the hour; accordingly, it advocates an outward, or rather pretended unity amongst the churches, and says:—

Convictions in favor of some form of practical unity among the followers of Christ are deepening and widening every year. The spirit of union has reached every branch of the Church of Christ, even the most exclusive and the most conservative. It is not the union of particular churches, for the purpose of strengthening kindred denominational interests, but a union of all the churches of Christ, for the discharge of their common and joint responsibility toward the Nation and the world, which engages the attention of the most open and thoughtful minds.

Yes, this is the same kind of unity they had in the fourth century, and then political church leaders palmed it off upon Constantine so though it were real. By this means they succeeded in getting the control of the civil power; but just as soon as political and financial benefits became a certainty, the blessed unity which had been extolled, was dissipated, and neither the State nor the Church ever afterward knew peace. Such unity as is proposed by the *Statesman* can never prove anything else than a curse to the Nation.
