It is stated that "the severity of the anti-Jewish penal laws, in Russia, has been redoubled in vigor, and, in view of these persecutions, about one hundred thousand of the poorest classes of Jews have embraced Russian orthodoxy." This should greatly encourage our National Reform friends for it disproves (?) the assertion that people can not be made religious by law. These Jews are, it seems, even made Christian (?) by law. Truly, great are the possibilities of National Reform; and the influence of Christian (?) rulers such as the Czar, like the old college professor's momentum, is "simply prodigious"—when backed up by genuine National Reform laws.
