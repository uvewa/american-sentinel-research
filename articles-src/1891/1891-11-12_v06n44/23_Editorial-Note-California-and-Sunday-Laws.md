THE San Francisco Examiner prints the following item, with the accompanying pithy comment:—

> California alone of the forty-four States and four Territories of the United States, is the only one without some form of a Sunday, or one day in seven as a legal rest day. Do not your checks tingle with shame when you think of this?—R. H. McDonald.

My good man, they do not. Following the commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," I fail to find the words, "Governments shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."
