The charge is continually being made by those who are working for Sunday laws, that the Religious Liberty Association and Seventh-day Adventists are working hand in hand with the infidel element of the country in their continued opposition to all forms of Sunday legislation. Now it is a known fact that the American Secular Union is largely composed of skeptics as well as openly avowed infidels. And in announcing the fifteenth annual congress of this Union their leaders states that particular attention will be given to certain of the demands of secularism, among which is the following:—

> The repeal and prevention of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution, rather than an economic one, justified by physiological and other secular reasons.

From this article in the creed of the Secular Union, it will readily be seen that they are in favor of civil Sunday laws on "economic" and "physiological" grounds. The Religious Liberty Association, and the Seventh-day Adventists as well, maintain that Sunday is purely a religious institution, and that it is just as impossible to separate it from its religious character as it is to take the coloring matter from the Ethiopian's skin. The origin of the Sunday institution is lost in remote antiquity, but when first brought to view in history it is a heathen festival day in honor of the sun-god, thus it has its foundation laid in the heathen *religion*. When it was brought over into Christianity and adopted as a part of the faith and practice of a large part of the Christian Church, it was brought in as a religious institution. And so it has always been religious and only so. Then to talk of it as a civil institution is the merest nonsense. And to talk of enforcing the observance of the day from "economic" or "physiological" reasons without also enforcing the religion that is in it is as absurd as it can be. And it is just as unreasonable for a Christian to favor a Sunday law as it would be for him to favor a law enforcing any other tenet of his faith. Christianity needs no human law to give it strength. It has its foundation in the words of eternal truth, and is as sure as the everlasting hills. And he who would seek civil law to uphold it, is still unacquainted with the mighty power that is in Him who is the source of all our power.

To briefly sum up the points in the above is to state that the Secular Union is in favor of Sunday laws from a civil basis; the National Religious Liberty Association, and Seventh-day Adventists, oppose all such laws. Carrying the matter still farther and stating the position of the American Sabbath Union, and hindred organizations, it might be added that these have all stated their belief in a "civil" Sabbath, and that they do not want religious Sunday laws, they only want the day observed on sanitary and economic grounds. The reader can readily draw his conclusions in regard to who are working with the infidels.
