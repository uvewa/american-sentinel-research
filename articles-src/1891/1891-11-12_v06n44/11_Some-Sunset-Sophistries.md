REFERRING to the recent discussion of the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, at a meeting of the Sunset Club in Chicago, the editor of the Chicago *Evening Journal*, of October 23, makes the following comment under this heading:—

"Both sides held up their end of the argument with considerable ability, but the preponderance of logic and rhetoric seemed to be in favor of an open Sunday Exposition. Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson championed Sunday closing, and did what he could to make the worse appear the better reason, but with indifferent success.

"Dr. Johnson's argument is one that is frequently used by the advocates of Sunday laws, but which has never met with the answer that it deserves. His argument was this: 'We are a Christian Nation. Christianity is imbedded in our national character and law. We issue proclamations asking men to give thanks. We put men on oath in the name of God.' But, as if afraid of his own conclusions, he also says: 'I recognize that the Church does not run the State, nor the State the Church. I do not believe there are a dozen men in the country who would attempt to force men to religious belief or observance.' This reasoning, if it can be called such, strikes us as timid, sophistical and inconsistent.

"If, as Dr. Johnson claims, 'we are a Christian Nation, and Christianity is imbedded in our national law,' we regard it as a great misfortune, and should be in favor of immediately disimbedding the Christianity, and keeping it separate from law and State for all time. The world has seen too much already of Church and State. When the union turns Italy's stomach, Americans may well be nauseated at the idea of a civil Government hopelessly committed to religion of any kind. Dr. Johnson's address illustrates the dangers and evils of such a constitution. He makes it a reason for demanding that our people shall neither work nor play on Sunday, the inference being that they shall go to hear him preach or do nothing. That he should also say that there are not a dozen people in the country who would attempt to force men to a religious observance simply makes a jargon of his remarks. Looking at a picture gallery on Sunday cannot be condemned, denounced and prohibited, on any but purely religious grounds. 'Renunto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.'"
