At a meeting of the Congregationalist Club, in Salem, Massachusetts, October 26, the Sunday question was discussed under the heads of "Sunday Travel," "Sunday in the Home," "Sunday Traffic," "Sunday Rest," "Sunday Reading," and "Sunday Visiting." The reports indicated that there was quite a unanimity of feeling and expression in regard to the necessity of guarding the Sunday institution and working for its stricter observance. The points, made in a speech that would characterize the whole discussion, are as follows:—

> That it is manifest that the present generation is observing the Sabbath far different than was the former custom. A person now does things which he would have condemned years ago. It is God's will that we should rest one day in the week, and the Sabbath is the day appointed. Sunday riding is wrong, unless done for the Lord. Trains, horse cars, etc., all should be run, if in the service of the Lord. The speaker deemed it a blessing to have vehicles with which to convey the aged to church. He wound up his remarks by saying he always voted against Sunday camp-meetings, for which he was applauded vigorously. Sunday bicycle riding he considered the most pernicious habit of all.

It is very well to talk in this way in urging those who believe that Sunday should be observed as a religious institution, to so observe it. It is certainly the right and privilege of every one to keep Sunday, if he chooses; and it is his further privilege, undeniably, to proclaim his belief as widely as possible. But when those who have such ideas in regard to the strict observance of Sunday, believe that laws should be made in harmony with their views to compel those who do not believe in Sunday at all, or else are indifferent in regard to it, to thus observe the day, it is altogether out of place. It should ever be kept before the public mind that legislation looking toward the observance of any religious institution has been the bane of the ages, and the cause of very much of the suffering inflicted upon the human race.

Let all observe the day who will, but compel no one.
