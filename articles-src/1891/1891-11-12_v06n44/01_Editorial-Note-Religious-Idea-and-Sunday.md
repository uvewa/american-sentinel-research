THE religious idea can never be separated from Sunday. No enforcement of its observance, distinctively from other days, can be divorced from that inbred religious idea, any more than the physical and moral characteristics of the father and mother can be eliminated from the child. This child of the Church and a religious holiday ("the Venerable Day of the Sun") is, by birth, by inheritance, and by unbroken habit throughout its existence, a religious day,—nothing else.
