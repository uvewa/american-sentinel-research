THE charge is constantly being made by those who are working for Sunday laws, that the Religious Liberty Association and Seventh-day Adventist are working in hand in hand with infidelity and are in the movement of the country in their continued opposition to all forms of Sunday legislation. It is a sufficient reply to the charge and fact that the American Sentinel Section is largely composed of skeptics and well is apply in served reform and infidels. And in answering these infidels actual acquaint of this Union their leading ideas that particular attention will be directed to some of their utterances on this subject, according as which the following is a sample:—

The repeal and prevention of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious or semi-religious institution are, as excessive, justified by physiological and other secular grounds.

From this article in the creed of the Union, it will readily be seen that they are in favor of civil holiday based on "economic" and "physiological" grounds. The Religionist's Liberty Association and Seventh-day Adventist as a denomination, maintains that Sunday is purely a religious institution, and that it is just as impossible to separate it from its religious character as it is to take the core from the matter into the Ethiopian's skin. The origin of the Sunday institution is lost in remote antiquity, but when first brought to view so heavy it is a as a heathen festival day in honor of the sun-god, since it has day in honor of the solar god, since it has its foundation laid in the heathen practice its foundation held in the heathen religion and of sun-worship.

When it was brought over into Christianity and adopted as a part of the faith and practice of a large part of the Christian Church, it was brought in as a religious institution. And so it has always been religious and only so. Then to talk of it as a civil institution is the merest nonsense. And to talk of enforcing the observance of the day from "economic" or "physiological" "reasons without also" enforcing the religion that is in it as a shroud as it can be. And it is just as unreasonable for a Christian to favor a Sunday law as it would for be him to favor a law enforcing of any other tenet of his faith. Christianity needs no human law to give it standing. It has the foundations in the words of eternal truth, and is as sure as the everlasting hills. And he who would any civil law to uphold it, is so still unacquainted with the mighty power that is in Him who is the source of all our help.

To briefly sum up the points in the above is to state that the Secular Union is in favor of Sunday laws from a "civil" stand, in its the National Religious Liberty Association, and Seventh-day Adventists, are opposed to all laws. Carrying the matter yet still further and stating the position of the American Union, and the National Reform organization, it might be added that these have all stated their belief in a "civil" Sabbath, and that they do not want religious Sunday laws, they only want the day observed on entirely and religious grounds. The reader can now draw his conclusions in regard to who are working with the infidels.
