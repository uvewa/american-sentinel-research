THE Sioux City Journal of October 17, publishes the following unique prayer, and attributes it to a clergyman of Quincy, Illinois:—

> O, Lord, we pray that the excursion train going met on the Hannibal and St Joseph railroad this morning may not run off the track and kill any church members that may be on board. Church members on Sunday excursions are not in condition to die; and in addition to this it is embarrassing to a minister to officiate at the funeral of a member of the church who has been killed on a Sunday excursion. Keep the train on the track and preserve it from any calamity, that all church members among the excursionists may have opportunity for repentance, that their sins may be forgiven. We ask it for Christ's sake. Amen.

This is a peculiarly interesting petition, so simple and naive in form, and yet, between the lines "so replete with sensational information and crisp with editorial comment." And then the refreshing frankness with which the Deity is told how inconvenient a thing it is to preach the funeral sermon of one whom the Church has seen fit to call a sinner. This minister should have bethought himself of the Church doctrine of "not under law but under grace," and have directed his petition to the Illinois Legislature to repeal the Sunday law, and both he and his truant excursionists might have rested in peace.
