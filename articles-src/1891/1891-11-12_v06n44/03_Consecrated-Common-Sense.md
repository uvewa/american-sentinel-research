THE Rev. Josiah Strong lately delivered an address at the dedication of DeWitt's Mission at 121 West 21st Street, this city, where Rev. James A. O'Connor has instituted an organized work for the evangelization of Roman Catholicism, and in the course of his remarks expressed himself in these deadline forms of unmistakable common sense:—

I want to talk on the subject of our personal responsibility. I have often thought in reading what is called the most solemn thought that ever came to bring me, that I will be held to an accountability. I may say from the Book of Kings, chapter viii. . . . I may pray that across the seas reached all of us so long; judged by human standards that would seem to us to have a very respectable position. But every slight error of sin.

When the king washed of powerful, etc., "and shook me with a grip," and invited him to dine at the royal palace, the prophet said, "I will go and sit back for half of your home, because I was commanded not to eat bread or drink water with man." And yet when a old prophet came to him and said, "I too am a prophet, and I have a message from God that you are to come and eat bread with me"—he returned and ate with the false prophet, and in the course of doing it the judgment of God came upon him when the prophet said: "I have the word of the Lord to you: Thy servant found out that he was slain—a conscientious, courageous man, a prophet of God."

I think we see a little light on that penalty if we seek to serve him with our knowledge and belief an emulation emphasized by the magnitude of the punishment. I think God cannot be trusted so much, and this is a lesson that all ages should remember, the absolute sincerance of the ministrie of the Christian religion by God; that one is to come between this and the judgement of God. Two was he known. God brayed, and His blessed and given his direction.

I have said this by way of application: the instant the prophet should have waited until God himself should have told him directly. But a lady or anybody else should come and say, "I, too, am sent of the Lord, and give him a message from me to move on." If a soldier had been summoned by the president of a great republic government upon some occasion to discharge certain duties, which he performs most faithfully, and another soldier said, "I bring a message from the commanding general countermanding that order," that for soldiers to say,— "I received my orders distinctly from headquarters; if the general wishes to countermand them I must have the countermand from his own lips."

So when the Lord commanded us, you are to do. Did you ever think of the form of the commandment? What is the form of the Book of Exodus? They are not plural in form are they? Every commandment is addressed to every individual singly: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." "Thou shalt not make any graven image." "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain."

It is "thou," "thou," it "thou." God's command was and direct to the consciousness of one of the human race. He is talking to you personally, alone, as if there were no other human being in the world. Did God not give us individual responsibility in connection with our relation to his Church? He gave us our own consciences so he has a conscience, and hence God lays his commandment personally upon every individual, and it is a personal matter—wholly so. Whenever I commit sin, it is against God, something between God and me. God not only has made us individually, giving every one a conscience, and addressing his commands to us separately and personally, but because we personally must be related to him, as personally, and Christ has died for us personally, for the for the individual.

Christ did not die for the Anglo-Saxon race, as a nation, nor for the Irish, as a nation. Christ did not die for every nation. For every person individually, in his own way, and his love, and his grace toward for me and toward you individually, nothing between me and God, between him and the salvation on Christ.

Every soul shall give account of himself to God.

Every soul of himself and account to God, and made him accountable for me. God did not make you accountable for me; He did not make me responsible for him by giving to be accountable and every person to account for itself to God.

This is the greatest mistake of that prophet. God has given every man his own conscience and his own claims to come between God and him, and it is the most dangerous thing any man can undertake to stand. He comes to your conscience and lays upon you a command; I have not got the least right to say to him, you have no right to allow a priest, you have not the right—not the priest, nor do pope, nor a human being has the right of instructions as between your soul and God. God talks to me personally; He talks to you personally. Now, we keep man-kind so busy keeping the other 9 commandments of the 10 that we know very few individuals. . . .

This is unmistakable common sense, and yet knowledge does not keep mankind, and does not belong to many preachers. All—all—every individual—every individual quarter, and not one of them every individual. God did not hold Moses responsible to knows every individual human being and every accountable soul; gave to every individual an accountable to every one and to be entrusted with his own by God alone.

Now this is the best thing for every being, from every human being is sacred before God; let us look at something that involves every living and God is for Christians to do for our soul, and for God is the individual to come in his liberty, conscience and all. Verily, that is the great object of our discipline in the church: to bring men into close personal relations with God. That is what God is striving for year by year and day after day through our Christian discipline to bring us into close personal relations with God; and no human, no church, no human agency to come between him, into, to him into a human agency to come between him and me and my Lord.

This is unmistakable common sense. And yet this is the very common sense which those ministers and churches continue to call in statement of scriptural truth with the theory that "the State is a moral institution," and that again, a being with a divine charged with "moral accountability," and endowed with a "conscience."

Dr. Strong's words are in absolute antagonism to the paternal, papal, doctrines of the National Reform Association.
