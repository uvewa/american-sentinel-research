THE Cincinnati Post says, editorially, of the concerted effort in Pittsburg to enforce the Sunday laws of Pennsylvania, to the suppression of all forms of Sunday trade, labor, and amusement, that, if the law is on the statute books, it should be enforced. "Respect for the law, whether in the estimation of many or few it may be a good or bad law, is the sheet anchor of our liberties, and our only protection against anarchy." And so the Post calls for the enforcement of the Sunday law, and thinks that "the Sabbatarian Society of Pittsburg is justified in its effort." There is a serious fallacy in such a line of thought as this. The enforcement of a bad law must result in injustice and wrong. No one is justifiable in making themselves a party to injustice, whether it is possible for them to do so under color of law or not. If the Sunday law is a bad law, contrary to the principles of righteousness and equity, the Sunday Society of Pittsburg is not justifiable in its attempts to enforce it. It is a bad law. Its results can be nothing but inequity and unrighteousness. What then can this Society be justified in doing as regards this law? Manifestly nothing except to seek its repeal. And the same is true of all bad laws.
