The foregoing is the title of a new eight page tract just published by the National Religious Liberty Association. The idea that we can have a "civil Sabbath," wholly separate from the religious, is advanced with great earnestness in connection with the efforts being made to secure Sunday laws. This tract shows that all the intolerant persecutions of the past have been in the name of the civil power, and in obedience to the laws of the State. It also exposes the fallacy of the oft repeated assertion that man requires one day in seven for his physical rest, and refutes other erroneous theories in connection with the civil Sabbath discussion.

The tract is just the thing to be used where the National Reformers and others have been agitating this question, and if it can go in advance of them it is all the better. It should be circulated by thousands throughout the whole country.

Send orders to any State Tract Society, or to the National Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Michigan. Price thirty-five cents per hundred.
