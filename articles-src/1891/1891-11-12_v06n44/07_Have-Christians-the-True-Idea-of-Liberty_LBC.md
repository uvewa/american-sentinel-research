At the Temperance Congress held on Staten Island, one of the questions on the programme for discussion, August 5 and 6 was, "Can a Minister or other Member of a Church consistently support High License?"

A man who is an earnest worker at the head of an order established for the training of boys in habits of purity in word and deed, and in the principle of total abstinence from intoxicating beverages, pronounced the form of the question an insult. He gave his reasons for advocating high license, chief of which was, that it was better there should be a smaller number of saloons to present temptation to youth.

The attitude of mind in a large majority of the members of the Congress was that dealing in alcoholic beverages is criminal, and that a Christian cannot be a partaker in the crime, consistently, by consenting to any license of the traffic.

A gentleman who rode to the station with me, in commenting upon the position of the speaker, remarked that "it ought not to be allowed to any one to express such views"!

This sentiment was as inconsistent as it was amazing to me; because the specific purpose of the Congress was advertised to be the free discussion of all phases and shades of opinion upon the problem of the abolition of the saloon.

It seems impossible for some minds to comprehend the law of liberty, which is freedom to think, and freedom to express thought.

Faith in the potency of truth must be exceedingly weak in the person who considers it necessary to make it impossible that error shall have a hearing.

How little knowledge of the divine power have those souls who can only rely upon force and statute to bring people to act upon principles of right. A person who has enjoyed any degree of Christian life ought to know that the inward impulse and controlling force of individual life cannot be brought into accord with divine law by external restraint or formalities.

Perhaps the statute prohibitionist will say, "No, we do not expect this; but we will not consent to the outward infraction of the law. We are right in preventing by force the commission of wrong." Virtually, then, we mortals claim superior wisdom to the Deity; for, according to the divine management, human souls are left to choose their ways, and abide the consequences. They are not forced to do the right.

What Sunday worshipers need is a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit. A soul that knows the uplifting of the worship which is "in spirit and in truth," cannot be distracted or disturbed by the dreadful spectacle of a well-behaved family sitting in the quiet of their own premises on Sunday. If God's Sabbath is in one's soul, the motion of carriages and bicycles will not make them feel sinful.

Statutory prohibitionists, of all kinds, need more faith in the power of godliness, and less concern about its empty form. More concern to be in their own lives living examples of truth, love, and purity, and less disposition to control by force the conduct of others.

No individual is responsible for the thoughts or conduct of another. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. The divine method of dealing with human souls, is to make every one a law to himself,—to develop individual responsibility. The law of liberty—freedom to think, to express, and to act—is indispensable to this development.
