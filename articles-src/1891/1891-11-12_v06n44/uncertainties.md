# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 12, 1891 (v06n44)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from low-resolution scanned images (/tmp/as1891n44-1.png through /tmp/as1891n44-8.png). The scan quality is poor throughout, with significant areas of text that are blurred, faded, or partially illegible. Many passages required best-guess readings based on context, visible letter shapes, and the publication's typical vocabulary and style. The overall confidence level for this issue is LOW to MEDIUM due to scan quality limitations.

## Recommendation

This entire issue would benefit from re-transcription using higher-resolution scans. The current transcription represents best-effort readings from low-quality images, and many passages should be verified against clearer source material before publication.
