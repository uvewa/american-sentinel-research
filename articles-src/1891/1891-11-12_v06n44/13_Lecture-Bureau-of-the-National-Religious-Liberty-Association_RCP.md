From the foregoing it is evident that the plan of the National Reform Association is to make the Church and the State; and by law, enforce upon all citizens their view of the tries of the Christian's church, whether the citizens choose to be Christians or not. While the Religious Liberty Association forbid the Church and the State should be kept forever separate, and that all men be entitled themselves as good citizens are Accountable alone in God for their religious faith, and should be governed in their civil life by worship or not to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience, that the religion of the Bible being is, its in very nature, voluntary, and can never be a matter for legislation, nor even for the compulsion of public religious observance.

Inasmuch as both these associations claim to be looking to advance the Christian religion, as well as the best interests of the civil Government, two tests may be applied to which to try the justness of the claims of each that its principles is advantageous and right.

*First.* What has been the result, as shown by the history of the past, of a practical application of the principles of these?

*Second.* What does the Bible, which is the assumed basis of each, of a connection teach upon the subject?

In applying the first test to the principles taught by the National Reform Association, we get all the exact parallel by going back to the days of the Roman Empire in the reign of the Papacy.

The man who receives Christ and believes is not a vote by civil instruction by him for of soul, particular. Christianity is better to be preached by its great teacher, and must not themselves be grown together into the realm of evil preacher, but beautiful suffering, before they attain to the highest good and influence. There is no want to this day anything on this matter. Thunder truthfully or at all.

It was to Augustine, then, that a decree was propounded and finished, which contained the old principle of relation of spiritual discipline the infallible rights of the religion and the free extension of the civil tribunals of the Inquisition.—*Church History, vol. iii.*

And Emil Funder. Neander remarks that "in this way the Church received help from this practice the privileges and the the Church which contained the the frustration of her real."

What could afford a practical application of the principles of the National Reform Association as is then shown by the history of the past far practice to the world of religious independence and persecution that endured, and to work dissatisfaction alike to the best interests of both the Church and the State.

Like causes, under the same conditions, always produce like results. The principles of Christ and the moralities of society ever now, both in and out of the Churches, is to say of one-sided of nature of those from attending to force divine, the same as these; while the holy person one, an other, would be done those that conform to the law of the land by reasoning, their faith; and is is in the attempt of any church of them, and not the name of the organization that may hold the principles, that made the name what they are, the conclusion is not only logical but reasonable, that the principles advocated by the National Reform Association carried into effect in the nineteenth century, through it be in America under the name of Protestant Christianity, will cause the same results as in the early centuries of Christianity under Catholic Christianity.

That these conclusions are not overdrawn, and that Protestantism actuated by these principles, will persecute those who differ from them in religious faith as certainly as have others, in plain from he weed reading the history of the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, the history of the treatment of Baptists and Quakers during colonial times in this country, and the history of the case of Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists who have been arrested and fined during the last five years, in the States of Georgia, Arkansas, and Tennessee, for quietly working on Sunday, after they had conscientiously observed Saturday as the Sabbath.

Of the latest of these cases is that of Mr. King, of Tennessee, which has just been reported to the Supreme Court of the United States by the Religious Liberty Association.

That this subject is as follows the next to for an application of the principles held by the National Reform Association. A counter of the principles of those of the American Sabbath Union, and the American Temperance Union, and the Christian Temperance Union, what has been and above requires, with equal force to each.

We now look for a parallel in the history of some nation showing the result of a practical application of the principles of the National Religious Liberty Association. The following quotations from the Constitution of the United States show that this parallel is found in our own Government—

*No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification, to any office or public trust under the United States. . . . Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.*

The discerning reader will see at a glance that the principles embodied in the United States Constitution are opposed to a union of Church and State, and declare it to be out of place for Congress to make laws respecting an establishment of religion or observance, also, that this is exactly the position taken by the Religious Liberty Association in the application of these principles in this Government affected the cause of religion, and what has been the effect upon the State? The ready answer of every American citizen is well expressed in the following familiar statements:—

*No nation ever advanced so rapidly in all that constitutes real prosperity. . . . In no country in the world are the lives and property so well secured on undefeated resources.*

Nowhere ever existed, the foundations of whose government were laid so broad and deep in the principles of civil and religious freedom.

No people of any race or creed that have ever been left so free to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, while the arts and sciences so flourished, so many improvements so rapidly completed, the national debt so skillfully adjusted and the nation is free. It can be advanced in the arts of both peace and war, as in the country during the last century, and the results stand uncontestably in favor of complete personal liberty, and freedom, and the church of the individual life.

Those facts plainly show the result of the practical application of the principles held by the Religious Liberty Association. The facts settle it, that any one who has turned the events of liberty, both civil and religious, under the grandest form of government ever instituted by man, should, above desire to turn back to the principles of despotism, that all who believe in maintaining the noble principles, have stained all their past history with blood that he delivered with souls.
