IN an editorial review of "Religion in Europe" a late paper says:—

> In France, and especially in Paris, it is gratifying to see how little Sabbath work is done, compared to what met the eye at every turn thirty years ago.

This is a complete refutation of the claim that in this country law is necessary to preserve the "civil Sabbath." The fact is that the workingmen will take all the care necessary of the civil "rest day." They have more than once said that they need no assistance in this matter.
