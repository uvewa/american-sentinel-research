The annual Convention of the Non-Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Alliance, of Illinois, was recently held in the Grand Army Hall, Chicago. The report of the work of the Alliance for the past year indicated a good degree of prosperity.

In contrast with the previous action of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the convention indorsed the bichloride of gold cure for drunkenness as a valuable aid in reforming drunkards whose continual dissipation had resulted in a diseased condition of mind and body, to the extent of destroying will-power.

The organization proposes to bend all its energies in the direction of gospel temperance work, and not trammel itself with numerous side issues, political and moral,—the rock on which the old organization split.

When asked what attitude the Alliance would maintain toward compulsory Sunday observance, Miss Lathrop, Vice-President of the national organization, stated that she was opposed to adding that department, and but few State organizations had done so. The reason she gave for opposing it was, that inasmuch as they were, by their Constitution, declared to be non-partisan, it would be unconstitutional to bar Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists from their organization, and it would be unreasonable and unjust to ask them to aid in promoting Sunday observance by precept or civil legislation.

State officers were elected for the ensuing year, and Mrs. Webster and Dr. Henrietta K. Morris were appointed delegates to the national Convention, to meet November 10 to 15, in New York City.
