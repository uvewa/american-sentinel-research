CHURCH theology and true religion are not necessarily synonymous. They may be antitheses; or, the one may be a non-essential drapery concealing essential truth. Too close a discrimination cannot be made between them, for the first is of man, transitory, imperfect, while the second is the expression of the eternal verities of God.

Commentary, exegesis, human interpretation, when applied to things divine, must be subjected to the most merciless criticism. There is but one crucible in which the dross of error can be separated from the fine gold of truth and that is the literal, inerrant Bible. When God gave his Word to man he made no provision for theology. If it were not for theological misinterpretation the masses might to-day understand the Bible. Through theological error the inconsistency, between the biblical behest "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," remember to keep it holy, and the practice of first day observance, has arisen. To support this error the abomination of religious laws must be invoked, and thus the true guide of life is lost sight of entirely, and the plain teaching of Scripture becomes of no effect. Theology then becomes the exponent of the religion of man while the Bible voices the religion of God. At present, however much the fact may be concealed, the two antagonize each other. That there will be a contest directly on this ground, and what the result of this contest will be the Revelation of God foretells.
