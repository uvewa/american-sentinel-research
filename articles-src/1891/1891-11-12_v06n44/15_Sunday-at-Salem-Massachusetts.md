## Sunday at Salem, Massachusetts.

A MEETING of the Congregational Club at Salem, Massachusetts, October 6, at which questions was discussed under the heads of "Our Town's," "Church's," and "School's," "Greatest Need," "Sunday Rest;" "Sunday Reading," were freely and ably discussed by the speakers. In regard to the necessity of guarding the Sunday, some strong reasons were advanced against the enforced observance of Sunday by the State. The points, made in part, that would be applicable for universal adoption are the following:—

That it is manifest that the present generation is passing through a transition period of religious fervor and reform. A person now days them thinks he is doing well if he keeps Sunday to about the same degree that people once kept Saturday. The transition to the day has appeared. Sunday observance is not what it was. All, at its severe rest, it is what Christians make it. If it is the severe Christian religion, and he sees the people of the church. His wound so speaks for its right, the and the truth, and while he would keep Sunday rightly ruling he considered the most pernicious influence of the other kind.

It is very well to talk in this way in urging these things upon the attention of the churches. A religious institution, to be observed, is to observe it. It is certainly the right way to urge its observance of Sunday. If he chooses; and it is his further privilege really, to publicly so to preach its value as much as possible. But when those who have such think in regard to the due observance of Sunday, conclude that there should be made in decency with its there to some reason around the country not the right to observe the day, it is the farthest remove from keeping the Sabbath, because its observance is forced by law. It is altogether cut off from its religious character, and any mind that legislation looking toward the observance of Sunday is reprehensible. "It is the curse of the age, and the cause of very much of the sin of this world."

Let all observe the day who will, but compel no one.
