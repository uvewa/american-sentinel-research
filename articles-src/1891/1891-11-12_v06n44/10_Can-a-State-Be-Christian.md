The question which Giotto originated, and which has been many times discussed in the *Nation*, is the question of the "Christian State," which in 1847 formed the subject of debate in the German Diet. On that occasion Freiherr von Wincke, approaching the subject quite in the spirit of Giotto, said:—

> "I must confess that, in spite of the most earnest investigation, and most conscientious reflection, I cannot arrive at any clear conception of what is meant by a Christian State. I venerate Christianity highly, but the idea of religion can rest only on individual conviction. The State is a complex of individuals, but it cannot, as such, have a universal conviction. The State, it may be said, represents a moral person, but I cannot conceive that, as such, it can have a formulated religion. The idea of a Christian State is, hence, to me unintelligible. It cannot be the duty of a State to realize the dogmas of a particular confession,—to be, in a sense, the executor of the Church. But the idea of a Christian State is, perhaps, to be understood in another sense; it will, perhaps, be said that the State in its legislation, should aim at the realization of the principles of Christian morality. Religious dogmas are impossible of realization. But even here, I cannot see that the State can, in any sense, act as the executor of the Church. If it is a question of realizing the principles of Christian morality, I contend that Germany certainly cannot be regarded as a Christian State. This is evident on the most superficial comparison of the principles of our State law with the principles of the New Testament. I might even begin with the Old Testament, and with the ten commandments. Moses says: "Thou shalt not kill"; while the Minister of the Treasury, whose duties include the payment of the army, would certainly not think of condemning war in deference to the Mosaic command. Again, the New Testament says, "Swear not at all . . . Let your conversation be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than that cometh of evil," and here we have recently imposed a new oath in connection with the income tax: an oath moreover which is a great temptation to perjury. A State which runs counter to this plain command, "Swear not at all," cannot call itself Christian.

> Another Christian command is "Love your enemies" and "if anyone smite thee on the one cheek turn to him the other." How can we harmonize these Christian teachings with our legislation for redress of injuries? We should have to eliminate many paragraphs from the code. How shall we harmonize our foreign policy of treaties against foreign foes with the scriptural command to love our enemies?

> "I believe that if we were to hold an inquiry over the several Ministers of State we should find none of them acting in harmony with the Scriptures. Look, for instance, at the Treasury Minister, laying up treasure, in plain defiance of the scriptural command.

> "My view is that it is not a function of the State to realize Christian morality, and therefore the proposition that we live in a Christian State is false."

"Christian morality has not flourished on European soil. Where the struggle for existence is so keen as with us it is vain to preach, 'Take no thought for the morrow.' There probably never was so much cant in Europe as in this age; never a period exhibiting a contrast so sharp as exists between an imported code of morals, professed for appearance sake, and the real bias of society as exhibited in its daily public discussions. Shall we ever reconcile this contradiction between profession and reality, and how? That is the great, perhaps the greatest problem of the future."
