A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES.

I HAVE before me the principles of two National Associations, as set forth in their Constitutions and declaration of principles.

From a careful study of both I conclude that the object of each is to educate the people of this Nation on what they understand to be the true relations of the Church and the State, as taught in the gospel of Christ, and in this way to advance the best interests of both the civil Government and true religion.

It is, however, very easy to see that the principles of the two organizations are in direct conflict with each other; hence, allowing that the members of each may be equally honest in their intentions and purposes, they cannot both be right in the principles they have adopted, and the methods they advocate.

From the Constitutions and declaration of principles of these associations I quote as follows:—

> ARTICLE 1.—This society shall be called the National Reform Association.

> ARTICLE 2.—Object.—This society shall be to maintain existing Christian features in the American Government, and to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.

> ARTICLE 1.—Name.—This society shall be called the National Religious Liberty Association.

> ARTICLE 2.—The object of this Association shall be to protect the rights of conscience; to maintain a total separation between religion and the civil Government; and by means of the platform and the press to educate the public mind on the relations that should exist between the Church and the State.

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES OF THE NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curve to society.

We believe in supporting the civil Government and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man in worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil Government, that we and our fellow citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

From the foregoing it is evident that the plan of the National Reform Association is to unite the Church and the State; and, by law, enforce upon all citizens their view of the rites of the Christian Church, whether the citizens choose to be Christians or not: while the Religious Liberty Association holds that the Church and the State should be kept forever separate, and that all who conduct themselves as good citizens are accountable alone to God for their religious faith, and should be protected in their civil right to worship or not to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences. And further, that the religion of Christ is, in its very nature, voluntary, and can never be advanced by any outside pressure of human laws compelling religious observances.

Research as both these associations claim to be laboring to advance the Christian religion, as well as the best interests of the civil Government, two tests may be applied by which to try the justness of the claim of each that the principles it advocates are right.

First: What has been the result, as shown by the history of the past, of a practical application of the same principles?

Second: What does the Bible, which is the authority upon which the Christian religion rests, teach on the subject?

In applying the first test to the principles taught by the National Reform Association, we find an exact parallel by going back to the days of St. Augustine, under the reign of the Papacy. He wrote as follows:—

> It is, indeed, better that men should be brought to serve God by instruction than by fear of punishment, or by pain. But because the former means are better, the latter must not therefore be neglected. Many must often be brought back to their Lord, like wicked servants, by the rod of temporal suffering, before they attain to the highest grade of religious development.—Schaff's Church History, Vol. II., Sec. 27.

Commenting on this theory, Neander truthfully says:—

> It was by Augustine, then, that a theory was proposed and founded, which . . . contained the germ of that whole system of spiritual despotism, of intolerance and persecution, which ended in the tribunals of the Inquisition.—Church History, page 217.

And further, Neander remarks that "in this way the Church received help from the State for the furtherance of her ends."

The logical result of a practical application of the principles of the National Reform Association is thus shown by the history of the past to produce the worst kind of religious intolerance and persecution, and to work disastrously alike to the best interests of both the Church and the State.

Like causes, under the same conditions, always produce like results. This is a law of universal application. Hence, as the hearts of men are the same to-day as in the days of St. Augustine, and the condition of society now, both in and out of the Church, is largely that of pleasure-seeking more than attending to things divine, the same as then; while the truly pious now, as then, would die rather than conform to the law of the land by renouncing their faith; and as it is the principles that actuate them, and not the name of the organization that may hold the principles, that make men what they are, the conclusion is not only logical but unavoidable, that the principles advocated by the National Reform Association carried into effect in the nineteenth century, though it be in America under the name of National Reform, will produce the same results as in the early centuries of Christianity under the name of the Papacy.

That these conclusions are not overdrawn, and that Protestants actuated by those principles will persecute those who differ from them in religious belief and oppose their views, is plain to be seen by reading the history of the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century, the history of the treatment of Baptists and Quakers during colonial times in this country, and the history of the cases of Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists who have been arrested and fined during the last five years, in the States of Georgia, Arkansas, and Tennessee, for quietly working on Sunday after they had conscientiously observed Saturday as the Sabbath.

One of the latest of these cases is that of Mr. King, of Tennessee, which has just been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States by the Religious Liberty Association.

This is sufficient to show the practical workings of the principles held by the National Reform Association; and as these principles are also advocated by the American Sabbath Union, and the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, what has been said above applies with equal force to the work of these organizations.

We now look for a parallel in the history of some nation showing the result of a practical application of the principles of the National Religious Liberty Association. The following quotations from the Constitution of the United States show that this parallel is found in our own Government:—

> No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.—Art. 6.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.—Art. 1, Amendment.

The discerning reader will see at a glance that the principles embodied in the United States Constitution are opposed to a union of Church and State, and declare it to be out of place for Congress to make laws respecting an establishment of religious observances; also, that this is exactly the position taken by the Religious Liberty Association. How has the application of these principles in this Government affected the cause of religion, and what has been the effect upon the State? The ready answer of every American citizen is well expressed in the following forcible statements:—

No nation ever advanced so rapidly in all that constitutes national strength and capital.

No nation in so limited a time has developed such unlimited resources.

No nation has ever existed, the foundations of whose government were laid so broad and deep in the principles of righteousness and truth.

No nation has ever existed in which men have been left so free to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences.

In no nation and in no age of the world have the arts and sciences so flourished, so many improvements been made, and so great successes been achieved in the arts of both peace and war, as in our own country during the last fifty years.

In no nation and in no age of the world has the gospel found freedom, and the churches of Christ had such liberty to enlarge their borders and develop their strength.

These facts plainly show the result of the practical application of the principles held by the Religious Liberty Association. The only wonder is, that any one who has tasted the sweets of liberty, both civil and religious, under the grandest form of government ever instituted by man, should ever desire to turn back to the principles of despotism, which, with their blight and sorrow, death and desolation, have stained all their past history with blood.

The discussion of the second division of this subject must be deferred until next week.
