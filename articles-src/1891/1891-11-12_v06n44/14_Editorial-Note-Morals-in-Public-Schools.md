A year ago The Sentinel gave an account of a conference of delegates from ten different denominations, in this State, for the consideration of the question of instruction in morals in the public schools. Of the result of this conference the Christian Union, of November 7, says: "The platform then adopted, and now commended by the committee, declares that, 'for the preservation of the constitutional right thus exercised by New York State, it is proper and wise that the extent to which religious exercises be maintained in any school under the care of the State be left to the general voice of the constituency of such school, with strict care that no right of conscience be violated,' but that 'for the interest and preservation of the State, expediency demands that practical morals be taught, as an essential part of the curriculum, in every public school.' It also calls upon all good citizens to watch that the appointments of school officers and teachers be governed as far as possible by their fitness; that suitable text-books in morals be provided, and that in every school in the State at least the ten commandments be taught. Upon the basis of this platform and these recommendations a 'League for Moral Instruction in Public Schools' has been formed, and will soon hold a conference on the subject somewhat similar to that of last year."
