A FEW weeks ago, the barbers of Duluth, Minnesota, formed a union, and agreed to close their shops on Sunday. All of the city barbers, however, did not join the union, and consequently were closely watched.

It was soon discovered that barber Chuzer had placed a chair to operate in one of the halls of the Spalding Hotel, on Saturday, and was shaving on one who might apply. On the 1st of October he was brought into court at the instigation of the Duluth barbers, and tried before a jury.

Chuzer's attorney contended that he had a right to shave guests of the hotel on Sunday as he was not exposed to know whether all who applied were guests or not. The judge decided that a barber has no more right to shave a hotel guest on Sunday than he has any one else, and that it makes no difference where his chair is located. He thought Mr. Chuzer did not violate the statute regarding the Sunday, so he imposed the minimum penalty—a fine of one dollar and costs.

The judge was right when he said, "A barber has no more right to shave a hotel guest on Sunday than he has any one else;" for he has a right to shave any one "else," for he has a right to shave anyone on any and every day, and no State or municipal authority has any right to interfere. There may be as much law on the statute books of the State discriminating in favor of some religions; but the enforcement of such a law is an outrageous infringement upon the rights of every citizen upon whom it is enforced.

Strange, indeed, if a man has no right to lather another on a day that he has been making as a regard above other days; and that, too, under a Government whose national and State Constitution guarantees from free exercise and enjoyment of religious and conscience religious institutions and rites!

Most of the barbers do not care a wit for Sunday; but they see in the Sunday law an opportunity to protect their trade, while they spend the day in some pursuit,
