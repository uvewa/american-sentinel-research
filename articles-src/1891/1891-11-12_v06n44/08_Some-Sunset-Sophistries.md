REFERRING to the recent discussion of the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, at a meeting of the Sunset Club in Chicago, the editor of the Chicago *Evening Journal*, of October 13, makes the following comment this week:—

"Both sides held up their end of the argument with considerable ability, but the propositions of logic and a Sunday seemed to be in favor of an open Sunday Exposition. Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson championed Sunday closing, and all what I could do to make this writer accept the better reason, but, with indifferent success."

"Dr. Johnson's argument is one that is frequently used by the advocates of Sunday laws, but which has never met with the answer that it deserves. His argument was this: 'We are a Christian State. Christianity is imbedded in our national character and law. We lose in encroachments making men to give thanks. We put men on oath in the name of God.' But, as if afraid of his own conclusion, he also says: 'I recognize that the Church does not run the State, nor the State the Church. He is not believe there are a dozen men in the country that would attempt to force men to religion

belief or observance.' This reasoning, if it can be called such, strikes me as timid, equitable and inconsistent."

"If, as Dr. Johnson claims, 'we are a Christian Nation, and Christianity is imbedded in our national law,' we regard it as a great misfortune, and would be in favor of immediately disinheriting the Christianity, and keeping it separate from law and State for all time. The world has seen too much already of Church and State. When the union of State and Church existed, Americans may well be assured, and the idea of a civil Government righteously committed to religion of any kind, bid Johnson's address illustrate the dangers and evils of such a constitution. He makes it a reason for demanding that our people shall neither work nor play on Sunday, the inference being that they shall go to their homes and be preach to nothing. That he should also say that there are not a dozen people in this country who would attempt to force men to religious belief or observance, is proof that his vision is bounded by the horizon of jargon of his remarks. Looking at a picture gallery on Sunday cannot be a demand, denounced and prohibited, on Shalt not purely religious grounds. 'Get Carved the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's.'
