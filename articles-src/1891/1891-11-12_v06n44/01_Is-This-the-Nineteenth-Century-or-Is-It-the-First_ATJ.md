Every human being is intended to have a character of his own, to be what no other is, to do what no other can do.—*Channing.*

True religion can never be separated by enforced observance, distinctively from other days, can be divorced from that falsed religious idea, any more than the physical and mother can be eliminated from the physical child. "This talk of the Church and the Sun's Day," holy, by instrumentalities, and "civil Sabbath is but Christianity throughout by exhortation, a religious day,—nothing else.

Church theology and true religion are not necessarily synonymous. They may be antithesis; or, the one may be a sentimental drapery concealing essential truth. To close a discriminating career to make no choice between them, for the part of man, transcript, imperfect, while the second is the expression of the eternal verities of God.

Conservatism, congenial, human interleration, when applied to things divine, must be subjected to the most merciless criticism. There is but one crucible in which the dross of error can be separated from the fine gold of truth and that is the literal, inerrant Bible. When God gave his word to man he made no provision for theology. If it were not for theological misinformation the meanest might to-day understand the Bible. Through theological error the inconsistency between the biblical behest "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," remember to keep it holy, and the practice of first day observance, has arisen. To support this error the abomination of religious laws must be invoked, and then the true golden rule of life is lost sight of entirely, and the plain teaching of Scriptures set of no effect. Theology then becomes the expression of the religion of man while the Bible voices the religion of God. All present, however, match the fact may be concealed, the two antagonize each other. That there will be a contest directly on this ground, and what the result of this contest will be the Revelation of God foretells.

## Is This the Nineteenth Century, or Is it the First?

JESUS CHRIST came into the world to set men free, to make known to all mankind the genuine principles of freedom, and of religious freedom above all. The Roman Empire then filled the world,—"the sublimest incarnation of power, and a monument to the mightiest of human genius built by human hands, which hath upon this planet been suffered to appear." That Empire, proud of its conquests, and complacently justices of its claims, asserted its right to rule in all things, human and divine. As in those times all gods were served as national gods, and as Rome had conquered all nations, it was demonstrated by this to the Romans that their gods were superior to all others. And although Rome allowed conquered nations to maintain the worship of their national gods, those, as well as conquered peoples, were yet considered as only servants of the Roman State. Every religion, therefore, was held subordinate to the religion of Rome, and though "all forms of religion might come to Rome and take their places in their Pantheon, they must come as the servants of the State."

The Roman religion itself was but the servant of the State; and of all the gods of Rome none was so great as the genius of Rome itself. The chief distinction of the Roman gods was that they belonged to the Roman State. Instead of the State deriving any honor from the Roman gods, the gods derived their principal dignity from the fact that they were gods of Rome. This being so with Rome's own gods, it was counted at Rome as an act of exceeding condescension to recognize, legally, any form of god, or of the right of any Roman subject to worship any other gods than those of Rome. Neander quotes Cicero as laying down a fundamental maxim of legislation, as follows:—

"No one shall have for himself particular gods of his own; no man shall worship by himself any new or foreign gods, unless they are recognized by the public laws."

Another principle, announced by Maecenas, one of the two chief advisers of Augustus, was:—

Worship the gods in all respects according to the laws of your country, and compel all others to do the same; but hate and punish those who would introduce anything whatever alien to our customs in this particular.

Accordingly, the Roman law declared that—

Whoever introduces new religions, the character and tendency of which are unknown, whereby the minds of men may be disturbed, shall, if belonging to the higher ranks, be banished; if to the lower, punished with death.

The Roman Empire filled the world. Consequently, there was a government ruling over all; in which religion and the State were held to be essentially one and inseparable.

Jesus Christ gathered to himself a few disciples, instructing them in his heavenly doctrine; impressing upon them the divine freedom, the soul-freedom, which, by faith in him, one may obtain; imbued them with power on high; and sent them forth into the world to preach to every creature this gospel of freedom, and to teach to all to observe all things whatever he had commanded them.

He had commanded them to render to Cæsar only those things that were Cæsar's, and to God the things that were God's. This statement was the declaration of the principle of the total separation of Church and the State, and in the mind of every true disciple, it was a divine command, inseparable from the divine life, and supported by divine power.

In the exercise of this right, the disciples went everywhere, preaching the word, and calling all people to the joy of the freedom of Christ, and to the freedom which that salvation gives. But it was counted by the Romans that this was actually forbidden by the laws. Laws, too, and principles, which were of established usage long before Christ came into the world. The law forbade the introduction of any new religion, but the Christians introduced the new religion. The law especially forbade the introduction of any new religion, the tendency of which was to disturb men's minds. Of all religions, the Christian religion spread disquietude and alarm; and was the one which most directly and most forcibly to the mind. In the very letter which the Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Rome, he said to them: "Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind," and "with the heart man believeth" and "the love of God," to worship the gods according to the law. The Christians refused to worship any of the gods recognized by the world. They had a God not recognized in Jesus Christ.

According to Roman principles, the Roman State was divine. Cæsar was the embodiment of the Roman State, and was therefore divine. Divine honors were therefore expected toward the Emperor; and, as a matter of fact, the worship of the Roman Emperor was the most widespread of any single form of worship known to Rome. He was the chief Roman divinity; accordingly, under the Roman system, the things that were due to God were also due to Cæsar. Consequently, when the Christians refused to render to Cæsar the things that were God's, and render to him only what truly was Cæsar's, it was a refusal to recognize in Cæsar any attribute of divinity. But in Cæsar was concentrated the essence of the State. Therefore for the Christians to deny to him divinity was to deny him divine worship; to deny to the State its divine prerogative. In the preaching of the gospel of Christ, therefore, raised a positive and direct issue between Christianity and the Roman Empire. And the issue was in law between two principles—the principle of the freedom of the individual conscience, and therefore the principles of the separation of religion and the State; as against the principle of the union of religion and the State, and therefore the principles of the absolute subjection and enslavement of the individual conscience. Rome refused to recognize the principle of Christianity, and Christianity would not yield the principle. The contest was carried on two hundred and fifty years through streams of blood and untold suffering of the innocent. Then Rome, by an imperial edict, recognized the justice of the Christian principle, and the right of every man to worship whatsoever God he pleases, without any interference on the part of the State. The principle of Christianity had triumphantly established.

Then paganized bishops, ambitious of absolute power, through a dark intrigue with the Emperor Constantine, succeeded in establishing a union of the Catholic religion with the Roman State, and thus there was taken away from the Christians the victory which had been so nobly won, and again Christianity had to take up the contest in behalf of the rights of conscience, and of the separation of religion and the State. And again, through torrents of blood, and untold suffering of the guiltless, for more than a thousand years the Papacy made its way to the place of supreme authority in the world.

Then arose the Reformation, announcing anew to the world the Christian principles of the absolute separation of religion and the State, and the rights of the individual conscience, and by an unceasing succession of the divine right of dissent, established Protestantism. But and not every, and Protestantism was gradually perverted, and the Christian principle was violated which gives it of right a name in the world. Then the contest had still to go on ever, through blood and suffering of the innocent, by the Christians' observation of the divine right of dissent, and the freedom of conscience, and by a protest against a false Protestantism in Greece, in Scotland, in England, in New England, in Virginia, and all the other American Colonies, except Rhode Island alone.

Then arose the new Nation, declaring before all people "all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;" and, when the national Government was formed, recognizing and establishing as so cardinal to all the world, and as a principle of the Government itself, the Christian principles of the absolute separation of Church and State, and therefore the divine right of the free exercise of the individual conscience; requiring of men that they render to Cæsar only that which is Cæsar's, and leaving them absolutely free to render to God that which is God's, or not to render at all, even as the individual might choose in the exercise of his own personal individual right of conscience.

Thus, after ages of bloodshed and suffering, through fearful persecutions of Christianity, Catholicism, and false Protestantism, the Christian principle of freedom of conscience and the separation of religion and the State was made triumphant before all the world.

Much has been said (none too much, however) in praise of the wisdom of the fathers of this Republic in establishing a Government of such magnificent principles, but it would be an impeachment of their common sense to think of, of them that they would have done any one or any other, than that which they did. They saw the sufferings that had been endured in behalf of the rights of conscience, and which had been inflicted in the name of civil power upon the dissenters of the civil power. Were they to shut their eyes upon all this, and go blindly blundering on in the same course of suffering and blood?

Both the history and the philosophy of the whole matter is expressed by Madison in that magnificent memorial and remonstrance which he wrote in behalf of the free exercise of religion belief in Virginia, the preamble of which were likewise, by his influence, embodied in the National Constitution. He said:—

A just government, instituted to secure and protect it in [public liberty] . . . will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his religion with the same equal hand that protects his person and his property in neither invading the equal rights of any sect, nor suffering any sect to invade those of another. . . .

What has been the best of the world, governments acknowledging of folding form as regards to the preamble, it is found, is a signal of an approach to a State whose opinion in religion is not found so much in the quiet which reigns among the sects that compose it. If with the salutary effects of this system under our own eyes we begin to contract the bounds of religious freedom, we know no name that will too severely reproach our folly.

This bounty of history and of philosophy, upon the noble minds that formed the Government of the United States. The effect was, that it was declared, and that effectively and had been ordered, both in the new World and in the New, how born its fruit in the right of the free exercise of religious freedom, guaranteed by the express terms of the new Nation—the right of every citizen to be protected in the enjoyment of religious with the same just and equal hand that protects his person and his property. That, it is the meaning and intent of those who declared and established in it the right "of equal and complete liberty," of complete religious freedom, the bounds of which should never be contracted. This is the sense in which the doctrine of the free exercise of religion belief is declared and established by the Constitution of the United States, and by the Constitution of Tennessee, and the Arkansas State which have followed the example of the national Constitution.

Now, in view of history and these principles, please read the following extract from a recent issue of the Toledo *Blade*, on religious freedom:—

That very precious of religious freedom is the product of our religion, as of our good customs and our, and it is the earnest desire of those to be the ultimate condition that no man shall be in the least restrained, by law or public opinion, in hostility to religion itself, or in the exhibition of sentiments or feelings of hostility to any man's patriotism or religious observance of any kind, or be coerced by law or abused by any religion. It is demanded as only fair; those who claim their men would show themselves respecting the great doctrine of truly living and let living; none should compel others to accept his sentiments, the forcing custom upon others like incomes, to obey individuals the enforcement of the certain set, and the individual of the rest of man. Before this he comes when public opinion shall force men to be Christians whether they will or not. This is the petitioner *congress cannot* destroy *just* as and forbad the exercise of religion or abridge the freedom of this. Whatever excuse is given for denying the existence of a law and its application to citizens, which is destructive to law religion on the ground of restraining or correcting morals, the answer is fanaticism.

Can it be possible that the history of eighteen centuries has taught no lesson that can be of any benefit to the people of the United States? Can it be possible that the streams of blood that have been shed, and the fearful persecutions that have been endured, in behalf of the rights of conscience and the free exercise of religious liberty, have been in vain? Do we indeed stand in the first century instead of the nineteenth? And from none of "what the growth of the principles of religious freedom into such an intelligent application that religion and the State should be separate; and that every man should be free to worship God or not to worship, according to the individual conscience? Is it true that this time has not yet come when men can be counted free from religious oppression?"—from "by an equal enforcement of law," in "an equal and complete religious freedom and its spirit of the principle that has been made to this the absolute separation of Church and State?" Is it true that from such oppression cause not absolve themselves yet behind the doctrine of religious freedom?

Again, we can only inquire, and in astonishment, too, Has the history of the lesson these eighteen centuries been lost upon this subject that can be learned by a score of the United States? Have its teachings through these centuries for this principles all been enacted in vain? Has the work of our governmental fathers been entirely in vain? Do we truly live in the nineteenth century or do we live in the United States, or do we live in the first century and in the Roman Empire?
