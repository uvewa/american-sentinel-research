Some people imagine that in this country there is no danger of religious oppression because of the differences between Protestants and Catholics. But on some questions these are one. Archbishop Ireland, in an address before the Board of Managers of the National Temperance Society, at a reception given him by them, in the Concert Hall of the Metropolitan Opera House, in this city, on the 13th of last April, speaking of Protestants and Catholics, said: "Thank God we stand together in demanding the faithful observance of Sunday!"
