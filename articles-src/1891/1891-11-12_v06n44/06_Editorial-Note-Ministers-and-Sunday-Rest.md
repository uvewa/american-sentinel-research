A CORRESPONDENT of the Duluth Tribune remarks that "it is passing strange that ministers, who rest the entire week from manual labor, should be the first to discover that the toiling masses need rest. I should think the worn out laborer would be first to discover that. But this is not the case; for not a single labor organization has a lecturer in the field pleading for a Sunday-rest law. It looks a little suspicious to see religious men pleading for a civil law to protect a religious institution."
