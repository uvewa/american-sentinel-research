SYLVESTER F. SCOVIL, President of Wooster University, Ohio, said at the hearing of the American Sabbath Union before the World's Fair Commissioners at Chicago:—

> The Sabbath laws are habitual in America. They are in possession. They came into possession on grounds of reason and experience. They have been in possession in the most brilliant experience of our history, and they are now controlling the country; and we ask that you shall not overthrow them, but shall again proclaim them in requiring the Columbian Exhibition to be kept closed on Sunday, the Lord's day.

This is a specimen of the habitual reasoning of National Reformers. It is upon the principle that whatever is, is right, provided it is that which they have established. They stretch the old legal axiom one point, and instead of saying "Possession is nine points in the law," claim that it covers ten.
