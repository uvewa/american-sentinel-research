HERE is a sample "civil Sabbath" law argument:—

> It is proven by experiment that in an ordinary day of toil, a laborer loses one-sixth of an ounce of oxygen more than he regains by a night of rest, so he needs a Sunday rest to catch up. A man cannot rest properly all by himself, he must have social privileges, and cannot get them unless his family and friends and associates rest at the same time.

Neither assertion is true. It has not been proven that "in an ordinary day of toil, a laborer loses one-sixth of an ounce of oxygen more than he regains by a night of rest." Neither is it true that for the purpose of regaining oxygen a man cannot rest just as well alone as in company. The whole thing is as false as the cause, in whose support it is urged, is unjust.
