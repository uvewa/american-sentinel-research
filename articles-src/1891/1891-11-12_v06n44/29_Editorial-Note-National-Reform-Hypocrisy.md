A PROMINENT National Reformer says that the regime which they propose "would secure the administration of a rightly constituted government by righteous legislators, judges, and executors. It would make only righteous men, men of Christian morality—eligible to office. It would keep out of office all ungodly and wicked men. Aspirants for office, for power, for honor, or for spoils—unbelieving and immoral men—asking the dear people to make them legislators, or congressmen, or judges, or governors, would be left at home." That is, only professors of religion would be eligible to office, under practical National Reform. But that would only be to place an immense premium upon hypocrisy.
