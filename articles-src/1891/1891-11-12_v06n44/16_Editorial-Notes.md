REV. FRANCIS L. PATTON has matched the famous remark of W. H. Vanderbilt in reference to the public, he says:— "I know all sorts of reasons have been urged that the Park should be kept open on Sunday. It has been said the workingmen and his family cannot see the Fair on any other day. So much the worse for the workingman. The *Catholic Herald* remarks: "That speech will immortalize Francis L. Patton more than all his sermons."

THE *San Francisco Examiner* prints the following item, with the accompanying pithy comment:—

California allows of the forty-four States and four Territories of the United States. In this State a man can be arrested for performing manual labor, without even forms a of a Sunday, or one day in seven in law. This is a territory in which there is a moral law against sin.

My good men, they do not. Following the commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, I fail to find the words, "and/otherwise shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."

PERHAPS a sample in "civil" Sabbath argument:—

It has been proved by experiment that in an ordinary day of toil, a laborer loses one-sixth of an ounce of oxygen more than he requires by a night of rest, and his body gets it by and to furnish this, his rest must not properly all by himself, he must have social privileges, and cannot get them unless his family and friends and associates are also assessment rest.

Neither assertion is true. It has not been proven that "in an ordinary day of toil, a laborer loses one-sixth of an ounce of oxygen more than he requires by a night of rest." Neither is it true for all the purposes of requiring oxygen a man cannot rest just as well alone as in company. The whole thing is so far away as the nation, in whose support it is urged, is unjust.

The *Cincinnati Post* says, editorially, of the concerted effort in Pittsburg to enforce the Sunday laws of Pennsylvania, to the suppression of all forms of Sunday trade, labor, and amusement, that, if the law is on the statute books, it should be enforced. "Respect for the law, whether in the estimation of many or few it may be a good or bad law, is the sheet anchor of our liberties, and our only protection against anarchy." And so the *Post* calls for the enforcement of the Sunday law,

and thinks that "the Sabbatarian Society of Pittsburg is justified in its effort." There is a serious fallacy in such a line of thought as this. The enforcement of a bad law must result in injustice and wrong. No one is justifiable in making themselves a party to injustice; whether it is possible for them to do so under color of law or not. If the Sunday law is a bad law, contrary to the principles of righteousness and wrong, the Sabbatarian Society of Pittsburg is not justifiable in its attempts to enforce it. It is a bad law. Its results can be nothing but badly applied and unrighteousness. What then can this Society be justified in doing as regards this law? Manifestly nothing except to seek its repeal. And the same is true of all bad laws.

IN an editorial review of "Religion in Europe" a late paper says:—

In France, and especially in Paris, it is gratifying to see that the infidel has its losses, concerning of what the state was every one thirty years ago and more.

This is a complete refutation of the claim that in this country law is necessary to the preservation "civil Sabbath." That is that the workingmen will all take the care necessary of the civil "rest day." They have made them more care that they need no assistance in this matter.

THE latest reason for Sunday sacred rest, and one with only a parallel in that given by Rev. Dr. DeW. In a criticism upon a certain sermon, he says:

The savior paused and meant the on Sunday to listen of their slain called got, the sun, which was then highest deity; and our Lord honored the day by his own ascension from the grave.

Does the Doctor means to say the Lord honored a pagan festival? As if it were possible for Christ to so actually himself as to intend "to honor" the breaking of the first of the commandments, which he taught that "whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

Sunday advocates must be hard pressed, indeed, for proofs of its sanctity when they bring in an argument which, like Mephistophiles, is lame on both its feet.

The *Stone City Journal* of October 17, publishes the following unique prayer, and attributes it to a clergyman of that city:—

O Lord, we pray that the excursion trains going out on the Eastorial and the St. Joseph railroad this morning may run not off the track and kill any of the passengers, in order that we cannot make man-stacks on Sunday excursions not is in complete. We also pray Lord, that a punishment resembling to a minister to officiate at the funeral of a sort of the remains who has been killed on a Sunday excursion. Keep the train on the track and preserve it from any calamity, that at church man-sees among the excursionists may have opportunity for repentance, that their sins may be forgiven. We ask it for Christ's sake. Amen.

This is a peculiarly interesting petition,

as simple and naive in form, and yet, between the lines "as replete with sensational information and crisp with editorial comment as" any. The not reflecting frankness with which the Deity is told how inconvenient a thing it is to preach the funeral sermon of one whom the Church has sent fit to call a sinner. This minister should have been belonged himself of the Church doctrine of "not under law but under grace," and have directed his petition to the Illinois Legislature to repeal the Sunday law, and both he and his trust excursionists might have rested in content.

A PROMINENT National Reformer has told the express which they propose into secure the administration of a rightly constituted government by right eous legislators, judges, and executives. It would make only righteous men, men of Christian morality,—to office. It would not let office and ungodly wicked men. Aspirants for office, for president, for honor, for for speaker, state, and for general men—asking the dear people to make them legislators, or congressmen, or judges, or governors, would be ruled out. "That's only politicians; men of religion would have opportunity to office. They'd no more think of presenting their should a place for so alone permitted would be to place to an immense premium upon hypocrisy.

Some people imagine that in this country there is no danger of religious oppression, because of the differences between Protestants and Catholics. There are on many matters that these one on. Archbishop Ireland, in an address before Ten Temperance Society, at a reception given him by them, in the concert Hall at the Exposition, Opera House, which was held on the 15th of last April, speaking of "Protestants and Catholics" said:— "Shall God we stand together in demanding the faithful character to demand?"

Over all the most silly claims put forth by National Reformers in the demand as a republic. This is a new theory and a new theory the world solely for the purpose of concealing the native impurity in the so-called National Reform movement.
