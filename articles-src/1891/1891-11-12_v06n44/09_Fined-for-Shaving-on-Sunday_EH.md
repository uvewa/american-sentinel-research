A few weeks ago, the barbers of Duluth, Minnesota, formed a union, and agreed to close their shops on Sundays. All of the city barbers, however, did not join the union, and consequently were closely watched.

It was soon discovered that barber Connor had placed a chair up-stairs in one of the halls of the Spalding Hotel, on Sunday, and was shaving any one who might apply. On the 21st of October he was brought into court at the instigation of the Barber's Union, and tried before Judge Morris.

Connor's attorney contended that he had a right to shave guests of the hotel on Sunday, and he was not supposed to know whether all who applied were guests or not. The Judge decided that a barber has no more right to shave a hotel guest on Sunday than he has any one else, and that it makes no difference where his chair is located. He thought Mr. Connor did not wilfully violate the Sunday law, so he imposed the minimum penalty—a fine of one dollar and costs.

The Judge was right when he said, "A barber has no more right to shave a hotel guest on Sunday than he has any one else"; for he has a right to shave any one on Sunday or any other day, and no State or municipal authority has any right to interfere. There may be an unjust law on the statute books of the State discriminating in favor of some religionists; but the enforcement of such a law is an outrageous infringement upon the rights of every person upon whom it is enforced.

Strange, indeed, if a man has no right to shave another on a day for which neither has a regard above other days; and that, too, under a Government whose national and State Constitutions guarantee freedom of conscience in the observance of religious institutions and rites!

Most of the barbers do not care a whit for Sunday; but they see in the Sunday law an opportunity to protect their trade, while they spend the day in some pastime.

Thus a religious institution, through civil law, is made to serve worldly ambition. Every Sunday law that was ever enacted and enforced has only served to place a lower estimate on religion in the eyes of both the world and the Church. All Sunday laws spring from a selfish motive, and are to protect selfish interests, and can be productive of evil only.
