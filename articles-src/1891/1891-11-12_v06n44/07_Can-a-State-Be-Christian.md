Thus a religious institution, through civil law, is made to serve worldly ambition. Every Sunday that was ever enacted and enforced has only served to place a new estimate on religion in the eyes of both the world and the Church. All Sunday-law springs from a selfish motive, and are to protect selfish interests, and can be productive of evil.

## Can a State Be Christian?

This question which Giotto originated, and which has many times discomosed in the Union, is the question of the "Christian State," which in 1867 formed the subject of debate in the German Volt. On that occasion Professor von Virtualis, approaching the subject quite in the spirit of "frank and candid" —

"I must confess that, in spite of the most earnest investigation, and most conscientious reflection, I cannot arrive at any clear conception of what is meant by a Christian State. I remember Christendom highly, but the ideas of religious rest on no individual conviction. The State is a complex of individuals, but it cannot, as such, have a universal conviction. The State, it may be said, represents a moral person, but I cannot conceive that, as such, it can have a formulated religion. The idea of a Christian State is, hence, to my mind contradictory. It cannot be the duty of a State to realize the dignity of a prescribed religious confession,—to be, in a sense, the caretaker of the Church. But the idea of a Christian State is, perhaps, to be understood in a less exclusive meaning. It may be said the State is in legislation, the principles of all types of Christian morality. Religious clubs are imposition of realization. But even here, I cannot see that the State, in any sense, acts as the exerciser of the Christian duty.

"If it is a question of realizing the principles of Christian morality, I ordered that Germany certainly cannot be regarded as a Christian State. This is evident on the most superficial comparison of the principles of our State law with the principles of the New Testament. I might even begin with the Old Testament, and with the ten commandments. Moses says: "Thou shalt not kill." The Minister of the Treasury, whose duties include the payment of the army, would certainly not think of considering war is defense to the Mosaic command. Again, the New Testament: 'Swear not at all.' . . . Let your communication be yes, and nay, for whatsoever is more than that cometh of evil,' and a law knows scarcely begun a suit at all in connection with the income tax: an oath moreover which is a great contribution to perjury. A State which runs counter to this plain command, 'Swear not at all,' cannot call itself Christian.
