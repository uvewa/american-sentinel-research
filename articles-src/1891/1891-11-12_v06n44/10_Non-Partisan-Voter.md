THE annual convention of the Non-Partisan Women's Christian Temperance of Illinois, was recently held in the Grand Army Hall, Chicago. The report of the work of the Alliance for the past year indicates a good degree of activity.

In contrast with the previous action of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the convention indorsed the beholder of gold cure for drunkenness as a valuable aid in reforming drunkards whose constitutional disposition had resulted in a diseased condition of mind and body; to the extent of which the disposition to use drinks was. The organization proposes to bend all its energies in the direction of gospel temperance work, and to transmit itself with out compulsory side issues, political and moral, —the rock on which the old organization split.

When asked what attitude the Alliance would maintain toward compulsory Sunday observances, Miss Lathbury, Vice-President of the national organization, stated that she was opposed to adding that department, and but few State organizations had done so. The reason she gave for opposing it was, that inasmuch as they were,

by their Constitution, declared to be nonpartisan, it would be unconstitutional to Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists from their organization, and it would be unreasonable and unjust to ask them to aid in promoting Sunday observances by precept or civil legislation. State officers were elected for the ensuing year, and Mrs. Webster and Dr. Henrietta K. Morris were appointed delegates to the national Convention, to meet November 10 to 12, in New York City.
