THE Rev. Josiah Strong lately delivered an address at the dedication of Christ's Mission at 142 West 21st Street, this city, where Rev. James A. O'Connor has instituted an organized work for the evangelization of Roman Catholics, and in the course of his remarks expressed himself in these definite terms of unmistakable truth:—

> I want to talk on the subject of our personal responsibility to God, which Daniel Webster once called the most solemn thought that ever came to him, and in this connection I will read from the first Book of Kings, chapter xiii. . . . I suppose that account has troubled all of us more or less, judged by human standards that would seem to have been a very severe punishment for a very slight error of sin. . . . When the king wanted to reward him, and said, "Come back and eat with me," and invited him to dine at the royal palace, the prophet said, "No, I will not go back for half of your house, because I was commanded not to eat bread or drink water with you." And yet when the false prophet beguiled him and said, "I, too, am a prophet, and I have a message from God which says 'Bring him back and eat with him,'" he returned and ate with the false prophet, and in doing so doubtless thought he was obeying God. He at first refused to accept that invitation on the same ground that he refused the king, and only when the prophet said, "I have the word of the Lord for it," he turned back, and for that he was such—a conscientious, courageous man, a prophet of God.

> I think we get a little light on that penalty if we bear in mind what truth God evidently intended to emphasize by the magnitude of the punishment. I think God meant to teach, and teach in such a way that all ages should remember it, the absolute sacredness of the relations of the individual soul to God; that no one is to come between the soul and God himself. That was the lesson. God himself had said to the prophet, "Do not eat or drink in Bethel." He himself had given the directions. Now if God had wished to countermand that command the prophet should have waited until God himself had spoken. It was not enough that somebody else should come and say, "I, too, am a prophet of the Lord," and give him another command. If a soldier had been summoned by his commanding general and received specific instructions to discharge certain duties, which he proceeded to do, and another soldier said, "I bring a message from the commanding general countermanding that order," that first soldier ought to say, "I received my orders distinctly from headquarters; if the general wishes to countermand that order I must have the countermand from his lips or in writing over his name."

> Now, my friends, God gives his commandments directly to us. Did you ever think of the form of the ten commandments in the twentieth chapter of Exodus? They are not plural in form and not in the third person. It is the second person singular every time, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image." "Thou shalt not take thee name of the Lord thy God in vain."

> It is "thou," "thou," "thou." God's commands are sent direct to the conscience of every one of the human race. He is talking to you personally, alone, as if there were no other human being in all the world. God did not give one conscience to a community to dictate to each individual of that community. He did not give one conscience to the Church. He gave as many consciences as he gave souls. Every moral creature in the universe has a conscience, and hence God lays his command personally upon every individual soul. Sin is a personal matter—wholly so. Whenever I commit sin it is against God, something between him and me. . . . God not only has made us individually, giving every one a conscience, and addressing his commands to us separately and personally; but because we are personally sinners he has loved us personally, and Christ has died for us personally. Christ did not die for the Anglo-Saxons as a nation, nor for the Irish as a nation. Christ died for every man. . . . As Paul said, "He loved me, and gave himself for me," something personal, nothing between him and God, close personal relations. And then we are told, "Every soul shall give account of himself to God." God did not give any neighbor a conscience for me and make him accountable for me. God did not give me a conscience for my neighbor and make me responsible for him to give account of his sins. Every soul shall give account for itself to God.

> There is the great mistake of that prophet. God had come to him personally, and he allows another soul to come between God and him, to turn him aside from duty. God comes directly to every soul. He comes to your conscience and lays upon that a duty. You have no right to allow a minister, you have no right to allow a priest, you have no right to allow a church, you have no right to allow a human being or institution to come between your soul and God. . . . It is because God is infinite that he can descend to every human being. Now, we lump mankind; we lump the nations—the Germans, the Irish and the English; we know very few individuals. . . . We generalize because we are ignorant; but infinite knowledge does not lump mankind, and does not classify. God knows every individual spirit, and every individual sparrow, and not one of them falls to the ground without his knowledge. God knows every individual human being and every heart among us. Just because God is infinite he knows us every one and he is concerned with all that concerns us. . . . Let us remember that every human being is sacred before God; let us remember that every single soul is precious enough for Christ to die for that soul, and for God to desire it to come to him personally, without suffering anything to come between him and that soul. Why, that is the great object of our discipline in this life, to bring us into close personal relations with God. That is what God is striving for year after year, week after week, by his teaching and discipline to bring us into close personal relations with him. Are we going to suffer an institution, a human agency to come between him and us and tell us our duty? That is not God's teaching.

This is consecrated common sense. In what intense contrast is its clear statement of scriptural truth with the theory that "the State is a moral person, a moral agent, a being with true moral character and accountability," and endowed with responsibility immediately to God himself."

Dr. Strong's words are in absolute antagonism to the paternal, papal, doctrines of the National Reform Association.
