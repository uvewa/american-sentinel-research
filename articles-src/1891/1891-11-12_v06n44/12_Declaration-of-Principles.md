## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible.

We believe in the right of every man to worship, or not to worship, God, according to his own convictions.

## Two National Associations.

I MUST here note the principles of two National Associations and set them in contrast.

ARTICLE 1.—*That the principles and purpose of each is to educate the American people of this Nation in regard to the relations of the Church and State, as taught in the Bible, and Const. and in this way to secure the best interests of both the civil and ecclesiastical and religious liberty.*

It is, however, very easy to see that the principles of these two associations are not contradictory to each other; hence, showing that the mothers of men that we equally bound in their consistent and different purposes, they cannot be right in the principles they have adopted, and the mother can be wrong.

From the Constitutions and declaration of principles of these we quote:—

ARTICLE 2.—*This society shall be called the National Religious Liberty Association.*

ARTICLE 2.—*Object—That the object of this society shall be*

*a. To assert and maintain the right of every American citizen, whether Christian or otherwise, to determine the matter of religion according to his own conscience and judgment.*

*b. To memorialize the Congress of the United States and the several State Legislatures against the enactment of religious laws in any form, or of whatever character, such as Sunday laws, religious amendments to the Constitution of the United States or any of the State Constitutions, or any bills looking to the establishment of any of the Christian laws, institutions, and usages, either wholly or in part, upon any legal or governmental basis.*

ARTICLE 3.—*Name. This society shall be called the National Religious Liberty Association.*

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES:—

We believe that the American doctrine of true a total separation between religion and the civil government is the truest expression of the relation that should exist between the Church and the State.

We believe in the religion of the Bible.

We believe every man has a right undisturbed in the free exercise of his religious conscience.

We disapprove the right of legislating the civil Government to legislate in matters of religion.

We decepte the right of the civil Government to legislate in matters of religion.

We believe in the rights, and should be the privilege of every man to worship, or not to worship, according to the dictation of his own conscience.

We also believe IT is the right and privilege of every man, to determine for himself what day he considers proper for the civil Government, that we are opposed to religious legislation of all kinds, including all laws of religious and civil liberty.
