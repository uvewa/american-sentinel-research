AT the Temperance Congress held on Staten Island, one of the questions on the programme for discussion, August 8 and 9, was, "Can a Minister or other Member of a Church consistently support High License?"

A man who is an earnest worker at the bar and who was established at the national cause of the state for the standing of boys in habits of purity is word and deed, and in the principles of total abstinence from intoxicating beverages, presented this form of the question as illustrative. He gave his reasons for advocating high license, chief of which was, that it was the surest and most practical method and his saloon to present compulsion to the youth.

The attitude of mind in a large majority of the members of the Congress was that dealing in alcoholic beverages hereinafter, that a Christian cannot make a partisan in the crisis, consistently, by counseling any license of the traffic.

A gentleman who rode to the station with me, in commenting upon the position of the speaker, remarked that "if a soul is lost to be allowed me to express such views."

What was asserted was as inconsistent as it was amazing to me; because the express purpose of the Congress was advertised to be the free discussion of all phases and shaded of opinion upon the problem of the abolition of the saloon.

It seems impossible for some minds to comprehend the law of liberty, which is not to think, and freedom to express thought.

The faith of the piety of truth must be put to excessively work in the persons who considers it necessary to make it impossible that error shall have a hearing.

How little knowledge of the divine power have those who have who can only rely upon men and forces and statutes to bring people to the set principles of right. A person who had enjoyed any degree of the Christian experience ought to know that the inward impulse and controlling force of individual life cannot be brought into accord with divine law by external restraint or formulation. Perhaps the statue predisposition may say, "Oh no; we do not expect this; but we want the restraint to be an external distribution of the law. We are right in preventing by force the commission of wrong." Virtually, then, we moralize right superior to moralize by the Deity for, according to the divine management, human souls are left to choose their ways, and abide the consequences. They are not forced to do the right.

What Sunday worshippers need is a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit. A soul that knows the uplifting of the worship which is "in spirit and in truth," cannot be distracted or disturbed by the dreadful spectacle of a well-behaved family sitting in the quiet of their own premises on Sunday. If God's Sabbath is in one's soul, the motion of carriages and bicycles will not make them feel sinful.

Statutory prohibitionists, of all kinds, need more faith in the powers of godliness, and less concern about its earthly form. More concern to be in their own lives living examples of truth, love, and purity, and less disposition to be corrected by force the conduct of others.

No individual is responsible for the thoughts or conduct of another. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. The divine method of dealing with human souls, is to make every man a law to himself,—to develop individual responsibility. The law of liberty—freedom to think, to express, and to act—is indispensable to the development.
