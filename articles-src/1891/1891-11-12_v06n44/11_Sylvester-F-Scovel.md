A YEAR ago THE SENTINEL gave an account of a conference of delegates from ten different denominations, in this State, for the consideration of the question of instruction in morals in the public schools. Of the result of this conference the Christian *Union*, of November 7, says: "The platform then adopted, and now commended by the committee, declares that, for the preservation of the constitutional right thus exercised by New York State, it is proper and wise that the extent to which religious exercises be maintained in any school under the care of the State be left to the general voice of the constituency of each school, with strict adherence and fact that no right of conscience be violated; but that 'for the interest and preservation of the State, apprehending demands that practical morals be taught, as an essential part of the curriculum, in every public school.' It also calls upon all good citizens to watch that the appointments of school officers and teachers be governed as far as possible by their fitness; that suitable text-books in morals be provided, and that in every school in the State at least the ten commandments be taught. Upon the basis of this platform, and these recommendations, a 'League for Moral Instruction in Public Schools' has been formed, and will hold a conference on this subject—a conference what similar to that of last year."

SYLVESTER F. SCOVEL, President of Wooster University, Ohio, and at the hearing of the American Sabbath Union before the World's Fair Commissioners at Chicago:—

The Sabbath laws are habitual in America. They are just as old as the Constitution. They rest upon grounds of reason and experience. They have been on the statute books of the several States from early in our history, and they are now controlling the country, we see and they are not only advantageous to them, but shall again proclaim them is requiring the Columbian Exhibition to be kept closed on Sunday, the Lord's day.

This is a specimen of the habitual reasoning of National Reformers. It is upon the principle that whatever is law, is right, provided it is that which they advocate. They stretch the old legal axiom on its point, and instead of saying "Possession is nine points in the law," claim that it covers ten.
