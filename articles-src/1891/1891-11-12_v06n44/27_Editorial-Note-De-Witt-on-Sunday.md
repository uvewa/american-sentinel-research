THE latest reason for Sunday sacredness, and one quite without a parallel, is that given by Rev. Dr. De Witt. In his criticism upon a certain sermon, he says:

> The ancient pagans named the day Sunday in honor of their chief god, the sun, which was their highest deity, and our Lord honored the day by his own ascension from the grave.

Does the Doctor mean to say the Lord honored a pagan festival? As if it were possible for Christ to so stultify himself as to intend to "honor" the breaking of the first of the commandments, when he taught that "whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

Sunday advocates must be hard pressed, indeed, for proofs of its sanctity when they bring in an argument which, like Mephibosheth, is lame on both its feet.
