REV. FRANCIS L. PATTON has matched the famous remark of W. H. Vanderbilt in reference to the public, he says—"I know all sorts of reasons have been urged why the Fair should be kept open on Sunday. It has been said the workingman and his family cannot see the Fair on any other day. So much the worse for the workingman." The Chicago Herald thinks, "That speech will immortalize Rev. Francis L. Patton more than all his sermons."
