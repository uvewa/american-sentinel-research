An authorized exponent of American Sabbath Union principles made the following significant statement at a recent Sunday evening meeting in Chicago: "Meat markets are being closed in a certain section of this city. This will help church-members keep the Sabbath, and save ministers from preaching plain sermons."

This is the truth. The ministry are unable to keep their congregations from patronizing Sunday meat markets, and otherwise violating church discipline regarding Sunday observance, and fearing to discipline, or preach "plain sermons," they secure the enactment of Sunday laws which will "help church-members keep the Sabbath" by compelling them to act in harmony with their creed, and thus save the minister the unpleasant duty of disciplining his members, or offending them with plain sermons.

It is not difficult, on hearing these statements, to imagine one's self back in the sixteenth century, sitting in a Catholic Church listening to the priest expound the papal theory of government.

At this same meeting the pastor in charge gave utterance to the following kindred statement: "Piety cannot be preserved without the Bible; the Bible cannot be rightly taught without the Church; the Church cannot continue without the Sabbath; the Sabbath cannot be preserved without civil law." The logical deduction from this argument is that piety cannot be maintained without civil law. The pastor did not make this deduction, but it is not only the legitimate conclusion of the argument, but it is the error underlying this whole movement to secure civil recognition of religious doctrine and practice.

Another statement made at the same meeting by the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union reveals the fact that they want law to compel people to at least act as if they were pious. Said the speaker, with great feeling: "There is no Sabbath in Chicago except the Sabbath kept by God's people." And then followed an exhortation for the enforcement of Sunday laws. Of course there is not, and there never was, and never will be, any Sabbath keeping except by God's people. It would have been just as consistent to have said: There are no Christians except those who believe the Christian religion; therefore let us make laws forcing the others to believe, or act as if they believed, in the Christian religion.

The only and all-sufficient help in securing a better observance of the Sabbath is the help of him who promised to be with the preacher of the "gospel," "even unto the end of the world." "Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help."
