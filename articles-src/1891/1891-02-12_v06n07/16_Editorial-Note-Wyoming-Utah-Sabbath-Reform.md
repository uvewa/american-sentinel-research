A CONTRIBUTOR to Our Day says: "In Wyoming the State Sabbath Reform Association has been strengthened, and it hopes to restore the kidnapped Sabbath law which the last territorial Legislature suddenly repealed. In Utah, the State Association is also awakening to resist the boomerang against the Sabbath that is hidden in the 'boom' that comes with Gentile supremacy."

So it seems that when a Legislature repeals a Sunday law it is guilty of kidnapping! And that the political overthrow of Mormonism, by means of the ballot-box, is a boomerang, because likely to prove dangerous to Sunday laws!
