## "Sunday Labor."

THE FAILURE OF THE MEASURE OF THE BAKERS FROM ITS RELIGIOUS CHARACTER.

The above is the heading of an article clip from the *Boston Herald,* of Monday, Feb. 9th. A portion of the article is as follows:—

The bakers' Boston affiliated with the Knights of Labor, took possession of Faneuil Assembly Mr. H. Skeffington, state organizer, was present, and urged that body to petition the Legislature to enact laws abolishing Sunday work in all bake-shops.

It was claimed that Sunday work was unnecessary, that it had a demoralizing effect upon the craft; that its abolishment would tend to create thrift, to make the and, and more independent inmates who could be secure; the Assembly unanimously voted to comply with the request of the bakers, and to urge all delegates to their Assembly, to urge that body to adopt a similar resolution.

Here, indeed, would be something laughable in its extremity, if it were not, when viewed in the light of history, so productive of coming evil. It seems that the bakers of Boston are desirous of stopping Sunday baking. That is their right. But it is not dare to do so until they can induce the Legislature of the State to compel them to do the very thing they declare they want to do. So they deserve the same self-help by a bootless meeting to urge the Knights of Labor to petition the Legislature to take a law to protect them from desecrating it. Well, well, can it be that these bakers who live in the very shadow of "Bunkers shaft of liberty" have forgotten so entirely their rights as American citizens.

The very Declaration of Independence, which was the beginning of our national existence, declares that "all men are created free and equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

What is meant by liberty, which is here declared to be an inalienable right? What but the right of every man to his freedom, in the use of his time to be used and limited only by the rights of others?

It is the inalienable right of every one of these men to stop working when they pleased, and to work when they please, provided they do not interfere with others. What then do they want of the Legislature to make laws compelling them to stop working on Sunday or any other day; they petition the Legislature to take away their inalienable rights. They petition the Legislature to do what no legislation on earth has the right or power to do; for no human law can rightly interfere with the right which God has given, and which is inalienable. True, a human legislative body may invade these rights, but justice still demands otherwise.

It has always been the tendency of legislative bodies to be aggressive, and to infringe on the rights of the people; hence they have had to be checked by Constitutions, and all sorts of limitations. When [page 51] therefore, the people come by humbly begging to be restrained, and to fairly plead that their most sacred right shall be infringed upon, will it be strange if the Government accommodates them sooner or later, and makes them slaves indeed? One is reminded of all these things of the time when the Roman people became incapable of self-government and so looked more to the representative power for everything. There was built up a paternal government, and finally, an absolute despotism. Can it be that we too are in the last days of the Republic, as then was Rome?

Sure it is, that when any considerable proportion of the citizens of a nation, come to consent, or even to passionately permit the government to withhold from them their rights not to be infringed, these same rights will not long remain secure.
