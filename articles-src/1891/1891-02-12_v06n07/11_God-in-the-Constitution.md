In the crisis of the Opposition, some, thinks that it fails to recognize the idea that our nation has a religious constitution, the State to a religion to the exterior event of being introduced, because it is showing a recognition of "the social religion of the people" which is asked for a certain a state, and it is possible for it to be done. This doctrine of recognizing a religion being a certain thing is not mentioned in a brand new idea, and it sends us bright from the mind of Piracy's brain. It is at honest, however, and it would be to maintain that its president in his message recommended free trade because he failed to mention the tariff. It is not see why, upon this principle, the Nation does not recognize Christianity or the one-sided religion of the Christians, because it has failed to put attention in the Constitution. Those Constitution makers not only give evidence of being in a poor nation, but of having a happy company with common sense as well.

The idea of recognizing religion by failing to cover it direct that in silence in following.—*Oakland, California, Times.*
