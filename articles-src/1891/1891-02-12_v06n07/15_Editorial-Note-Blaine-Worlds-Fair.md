REV. T. A. FERNLEY, D. D., is credited by a Philadelphia paper, with the statement, that in a recent conversation which he had with Mr. Blaine, that gentleman had said the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday for hygienic reasons and that the society couldn't do better than print the "Sermon on the Mount," the best thing ever spoken, and scatter it broadcast. But so far as we are informed neither the Doctor nor the Secretary has explained the connection between the Sermon on the Mount and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.
