We have recently had occasion to pass some friendly criticisms upon the American Secular Union. And we are asked by a Southern correspondent to give our views of the "Nine Demands of Liberalism," which are as follows:—

**1.** We demand that churches and other ecclesiastical property shall be no longer exempt from just taxation.

**2.** We demand that the employment of chaplains in Congress, in State Legislatures, in the navy and militia, and in prisons, asylums, and all other institutions supported by public money, shall cease.

**3.** We demand that all public appropriations for educational and charitable institutions of a sectarian character shall cease.

**4.** We demand that all religious services now sustained by the Government shall be abolished; and especially that the use of the Bible in the public schools, whether ostensibly as a text book or avowedly as a book of religious worship, shall be prohibited.

**5.** We demand that the appointment, by the President of the United States or by the governors of the various States, of all religious festivals and fasts shall wholly cease.

**6.** We demand that the judicial oath in the courts and in all other departments of the Government, shall be abolished, and that simple affirmation under the pains and penalties of perjury shall be established in its stead.

**7.** We demand that all laws directly or indirectly enforcing the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath shall be repealed.

**8.** We demand that all laws looking to the enforcement of "Christian" morality shall be abrogated, and that all laws shall be conformed to the requirements of natural morality, equal rights and impartial liberty.

**9.** We demand that not only in the Constitution of the United States and of the several States, but also in the practical administration of the same, no privileges or advantages shall be conceded to Christianity or any other special religion; that our entire political system shall be founded and administered on a purely secular basis; and that whatever changes shall prove necessary to this end shall be consistently, unflinchingly, and promptly made.

These are the original "Nine Demands of Liberalism," and are almost identical with the demands of the American Secular Union. But why they should be the demands of liberals more than the demands [page 52] of Christianity is not clearly clear, for with little exception they are, in our opinion, perfectly proper and just, though in some cases scarcely strong enough.

The first demand is eminently just. We sincerely wish that everywhere church property might be equally subjected to its just share of taxation. This is now true of all church property in California, and recently the Baptists have shown a disposition, in quarters where their influence is the strongest. Indeed, one Baptist congregation in Canada has asked that its property be taxed the same as other property. We do not see how anybody can deny the justice and the propriety of this demand, nor from whatever source it may come. The second demand is likewise perfectly just. The employment of chaplains in the State, is a relic of a union of Church and State. So far at least as the Federal Government is concerned, it is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." In fact this is, to say the least, subversive of the fundamental principles of American institutions, and is everywhere out of the principle taught by our Lord Jesus Christ.

Number three is correct in the object, but is not broad enough. The word "sectarian" ought to be changed to the word "religious," so that it would read:

"We demand that all public appropriations for educational and charitable institutions of a religious character shall cease." This, we understand, is what the demand really means. It think it not what it actually demands. But it is what it ought to mean. The real religions are set now about playing such canonical tricks with the word "sectarian" that would make it easy for any person to obtain all the religious appropriations they wanted.

Number four is in harmony with number three, and is perfectly just. The Government should know neither religion nor irreligion, and all education sustained by public funds should be purely civil instruction.

Number five is a proper demand of the Government, and is a good one, more especially so as regards the President of the United States. The position of Jefferson, and the opinion of Madison, on this question is the true doctrine of the separation and the constitution of the secular Government. It would have been well for the country, and especially for the people, if all the Presidents of the United States had firmly established the position by an able command as set forth by President Jefferson. It is as follows:—

> To consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from even a recommendation to its citizens for a religious work of discipline, or exercises. This results not only from the provision of the Constitution itself, but that the establishment or free exercise of any religion, from that on which no powers to the Government can be drawn, as on the Federal Government, for the power not delegated to the United States Government, is to prevent any infringement.

> Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary [page 52] or to assume authority in religious discipline, has never been delegated to the Government. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises that the exercise of religion is different. Every one society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises and the objects proper to them, according to their own particular tenets and the right never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.

It speaks as it reads, demands too much. It demands the unconstitutional abolition of the judicial oath. But one who believes in the propriety of the judicial oath, and are willing to take it, have as much right to use it as those who do not believe in it have merely to affirm. To demand that those who believe in the judicial oath shall not have the privilege of taking accordingly, and to ask that there shall submit to the demands of those who do not believe in it, is to go to the same extreme in this direction, that those have already gone in the other direction who seek to force views of the judicial oath upon those who do not believe in it. What is referred to here as the judicial oath, is, in fact, the religious oath which is enforced in many of the States of the Union which is forced upon those who do not believe in the religious forms of solemnity, covers the Deity, constitutionally, in the oath.

It is well known that in certain States of the Union no man can be a competent witness in the courts of justice, who does not call upon the sacredness of the Bible as the word of God, and belief in the future world the Bible reveals. Now there are a great many people in all the States who do not believe at all in the sacredness of the Bible, and do not believe in God. Now to compel such a man to take his oath, as it is really to destroy his value as a witness. Compelled to go through with the taking of an oath which simply means to him to take something by that the State compels as much or more than he does himself, or his own use. To require him, therefore, to take an oath upon a book which he respects less than he does a book of his own use, is to lessen the value of his testimony. When any State compels any man who does not believe either in God or the Bible to take an oath by them both, it requires him publicly and secretly to profess to believe what he does not believe, and compels him really to commit perjury. In other words when any State or any Court compels such men to take such an oath it compels them to commit perjury, to be dishonest, to act as competent witnesses. It compels them to commit perjury as an evidence that they will not commit perjury. It compels them publicly to profess a lie as evidence that they will tell the truth. Could anything be more incongruous, or more subversive of civic purity?

This demand, therefore, is eminently just, so far as it refers to the oath element in the religious judicial oath. All that any Court may properly require of any man as such a pledge as it held to [page 52] regard as and more binding upon the conscience of the person taking it, whether that pledge be by oath or affirmation, is a simple promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. We are of the opinion that such is the real intent of this demand, but as the demand is worded it calls for more than that, and therefore goes too far. Those who believe in the religious oath have just as much right to use it as those who do not believe in it have not to use it.

The seventh demand or as it is worded is not strong enough. It demands that all laws directly or indirectly enforcing the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath, shall be repealed. This demand ought to be that all laws enforcing or indirectly enforcing the observance of Sunday, or any other day, in any way or to any extent whatever, as the Sabbath or anything else, shall be repealed. By this we would not be understood to deny the right of the State to set apart certain days as legal holidays. "This is perfectly legitimate. But for any Government to forbid combinations of labor or business upon any day for quite another thing, and is a most outrageous abuse of power."

The eighth demand is just and good, with the exception of the "requirements of natural morality." The requirements of natural morality are, and have always been, a most uncertain and a most dangerous standard by which to hold or govern legislation. Natural morality is only the natural outgrowth of the natural heart, which is not against the highest moral authority and subject to the highest moral law; therefore, where the majority of a people confess only to the requirements of natural morality, there is no such thing and there can be no such thing, as essential civil security. If, by the phrase, "natural morality" this demand means civility, and if it would then say what it means, then the demand taken altogether would be a perfectly proper and just one. The demand should read thus: "We demand that all laws looking to the enforcement of Christian morality shall be abrogated, and that all laws shall be conformed to the requirements of civility, equal rights, and impartial liberty." Then it would demand just what ought to be.

The ninth demand is perfectly sound, entirely just, and stated, and in it we can see no room for improvement.

With the changes which we have suggested, the nine demands simply express what ought to be in this Government, and in every other civil Government on earth. With the changes suggested, these demands express precisely what THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has always advocated, and always expects to advocate. We know that some people will lift up their hands and cry, "Oh you stand with the infidel!" to which we coolly reply, Not at all, we stand with the Christians. And when infidels happen to stand where they stand, they stand with the Christians, and are to be respected in putting such truths in Christian principle. THE AMERICAN SENTINEL does not accept of the King James version as a standard by which to regulate the conduct, though regarded it as a sectarian book, though accepted by all Protestant sects.

Neither does the question, "what Church with the State?" answer the objection, that it means a union of Church and State. A union of Church and State is not made, necessarily, when one or several churches unite to force the teaching of doctrines which they hold in common. It is sufficient if a single concept be forcing as a religion a single concept upon the unwilling, or if a character of the sects form a religious "truce" by which each in the teaching of religion to the children, and in the exclusion of views held by the dissenting sects and unbelievers. It is not necessary in order to have a union between the Church and the State to have that union to consist of a single church and the State.

For want of space we will notice but one more quotation, as follows:—

> Banish them hence over land and sea, and water where they do not belong. While bread is good when taken into the stomach, it should be banished immediately if gotten into the eye. Put alcohol in its proper place, every place where it will accomplish something, although good in its place be banished from the public highways where it does not belong and where it creates disease, and death. Just so with religion: banished from the public sphere where it does not belong and where it creates anarchy.
