REV. T. A. FERNLEY, D.D., is credited by a Philadelphia paper, with the statement that in a recent sermon in which he had said Mr. Blaine, that great Statesman, had said the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday for Duganan reasons and that the country couldn't do better than print "Sermon on the Mount," the best ever spoken, and scatter it broadcast; that so far as we are informed neither the Doctor nor the Secretary has explained the connection between the Sermon on the Mount and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

A CONTRIBUTOR TO *Our Day* says: "In all the West the State Sabbath Reform Association has been strengthening the forces to restore the kidnapped Sabbath. Kansas was the last territorial Legislature, repeatedly repealed. In Utah, the State Association is also awakening to resist the bontsitting against the Sabbath that is therein in the "rest" that comes with Gentile prosperity."

Is it seems that when a Legislature repeals a Sunday law it is guilty of kidnapping! And that the political overthrow of Mormonism, by means of the ballot-box, is a bootlegging, becomes likely to prove dangerous to the Sunday.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *Christian Endeavor* says that Bishop Wesley's reports come so late or the last generation, they develop the church by the position that "religious liberty was, by all means to be maintained, but not with irreligion," and does not surprise, but that this reason cannot surprise when we consider that many of the personal principles deserve themselves by the opinion that "while there should be absolute separation between Church and [page 56] State, there should not be a separation of religion and the State." The sophistry of one is as great as of the other.

There can be no union of religion and the State without a union of Church and State, unless, indeed, the Church and religion are entirely separate, which, however, can never be, though the National Reformers seem determined to make it so in order that they may compass their ends.

In this country the term "religion," when spelled out, means Christianity. It is in this sense that the National Reformers use it. But Christianity is bound up in the Church. The Scriptures declare the Church to be "the pillar and ground of truth;" to "shepherd the flock" that is separated, and to compel religion and the State is also to unite the State and the Church which is "the pillar and ground" of that religion. Therefore, in this as in everything else, National Reform is antichristian.

At a late meeting of the Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union, resolutions of condolence in Colonel Elliot F. Shepard's movement were passed. Arrangements were made for publishing a quarterly journal to be entitled the *American Sabbath Union*, and to hear the in 1891. "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day," under the editorial charge of the already Secretary, the Rev. J. H. Knowles, D.D., with the Rev. James P. Mills, district Secretary of the South as an assistant editor, residing at Chicago. Provisions were also made for the employment of an attorney at law for the prosecution of violators of the Sunday laws. A resolution was adopted declaring against any change in the Sunday laws of New York, and the General Secretary was instructed to forward a copy of the same to the Legislature of that State, at Trenton.

While we have believed, and do still believe, that there is a working from an inward form, and for an object which cannot in the end to any help to the speed of the true Christian religion, we would not ask the religious that have spent some time, and say that they themselves went to look upon this working among Christian men without generous respect. Why should we have a need of God and appeal to courts in order to have established the naturally observed as a day of rest, simply say those that would adopt the methods to secure other religious observances a day of worship" and the religious or would write any doctrines a "definition of a national religion" to have all religious observances based upon the conscience of man, enlightened by the Word of God and quickened by his Spirit. All she is lost except force as far as any religious endeavor is concerned, and such disgraceful, political wrangles as are a disgrace and a Pharisaism, one has the same results of the appeal to the civil law, which appeal carries with it political method.

Another thought suggests itself to us in this connection. It is this: When [page 56] grow a little better toward each other over merely a question of management, what may we not expect their feelings to be toward those who oppose their principles and methods? And does it not go without saying that it would be to intends to extend with the power to coerce their foes?

In his address, at the Philadelphia meeting, before the Sabbath Association, the Union criticized certain labor organizations for holding their meetings on Sundays. At these meetings, people, he was said, harassed by orators, who while flaunting the existence of a God, appeal for the God-given rights of the downtrodden. If the labor organizations, the speaker said, he to make the Sabbath known to these men, it would do a great. "The sinners would be ready to respond to them and to those precious workings of the Bible when going around making trouble. These busybodies would soon be out of work, and there would be no more socialistic life in dust if it were made possible to every man, woman, and child.

The Philadelphia Sabbath Association, the organization of its kind in this country, had, from a memorial of its kind to Howard and Dr. George D. Boardman Howard and Dr. George Howard to Atkinson. At a recent meeting of the Association, a member, objected that in the provost of the secretary's report it in so far as "Said Dr. Boardman and General Howard ally-titled the bell with speech," the objector wanted the following statement, held in this city a few weeks ago, and that the started controversy caused the two gentlemen and missions, and he for he didn't appreciate it. He said he was going to have a meeting held at the First Baptist Church, to explain the object of the Sabbath Association, and Dr. Boardman was in complain to explain the issue about the demand of the Sabbath. "General Howard's talk was full of fill." Mr. McAllister's reply is as follows: "I think that was the most satisfactory meeting ever held in the city. I hope that the Board will never meet held in a church where the pastor is in sympathy with us," to the happy and appointed actions.
