ANIMADVERSIONS upon the King case, the details of which are well known to our readers, that content explorer, the *Colorado Antelope*:—

"Can you believe it, that in this enlightened age, and in the United States of America, a country founded on religious liberty, a fellow-citizen may be sent to jail, and kept there, for working on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, by people getting together with signatures that he should rest on the seventh day of the week! It is actually on the statute books of Tennessee which nation is an offense punishable by imprisonment, for man or woman in this first day of the week.

"Here the Bible dictates to the Adventist, the Seventh-day Baptist, the Jew, and the Agnostic, and compels him to be working, according to civil law, his honest belief to the contrary notwithstanding.

"Its Gospel is as natural as sunshine for us people, as well as for personal liberty, and for this honest cause raises an issue against every attempt made to ecclesiasticism any day to the week, for or against any hobby, on the principle that can step beyond the line of equal and impartial the destruction of all restraint, and the final overthrow of both Church and State and the substitution of anarchy."
