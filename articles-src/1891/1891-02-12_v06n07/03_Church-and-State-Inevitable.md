THIS conclusion is inevitable that the line cannot be too strongly drawn between Church and State. If a solemn act of legislation shall, in one point, either the least or the greatest, yield to the claims of one religion, it may with equal propriety, admit the claims of every religion, or the whole hierarchy of every religious station, and enforce every religious obligation which results in the forms and ceremonies of worship, the endowment of the Church, and the support of the clergy.—*Col. R. M. Johnson.*
