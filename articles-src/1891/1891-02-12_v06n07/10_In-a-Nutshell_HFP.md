EIGHT REASONS WHY A CHRISTIAN CANNOT STAND OPPOSED TO THE SCHEMES OF THE NATIONAL REFORMERS.

**1.** THESE schemes call upon men to do that which is in direct violation of the words of our Lord, where he says: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." And there is not a man among them who, being placed in the position of the other man's shoes, and take the consequences, of their plans with.

**2.** It is taking the sword of the civil power, and Christ has said, "All they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword."

**3.** And in appealing to the civil power, they virtually acknowledge that they have lost the power of the Spirit of God.

**4.** Their position is that "the kingdom of Christ is through the gateway of politics to be entered." He says, "My kingdom is not of this world." "My kingdom is not of this world." "My kingdom of God is within you."

**5.** It exalts the powers of the State above the power of God, and this is directly in opposition to the teaching of the good book which says, "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 8:11-13. And the Apostle Peter, when brought before the civil authorities, made answer, "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

**6.** They are looking for, and endeavoring to set up a theocracy, and to find a theocracy to be established here, and they are working to that end. A theocracy is where God is his own law maker, and appoints his own law administrators. This is again in direct opposition to the words of the prophet. There never was but one theocracy in this world, and that was the theocracy of Israel. And when that theocracy was overthrown by the kingdom of Babylon, God said: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn, and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Ezek. 21:27; so there will be another [page 54] theocracy until Christ comes to claim his own.

**7.** The gospel of our Lord is a gospel of love, and not of force. Based upon love, entirely, it says, come. It was founded in love; it has been carried forward in love; and it can never be carried forward by any other plan. Every experiment of another part, in the direction of force, has been a failure, and it ought to be. It has been a failure because the spirit of force has been in opposition to the spirit of the Saviour, bringing out some of the darkest passions of the human heart. It always will be.

**8.** The credentials for the propagation of the gospel were given by the Church, not to the Church alone. They were never invested the civil power; and any effort to bring about a change in this matter, is but a plan to effect a change in the plans of Heaven. Such an effort must ever result in defeat and disaster to all who give their influence in its favor, as it always has.

A Christianized: "Neither are your practices better."—*Answer:* "There is in part as great as the "pearl of great price," and this effort will result in nothing better than to bring the religion of the Bible, the religion of the Bible itself into the realm of politics. This will be the lowering the standard of Christianity, and bringing grief before people those who will practice it.
