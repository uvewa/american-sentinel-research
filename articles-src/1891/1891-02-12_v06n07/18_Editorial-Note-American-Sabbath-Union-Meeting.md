At a late meeting of the Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union, resolutions of confidence in President Shepard's management were passed. Arrangements were made for publishing a quarterly journal to be entitled the American Sabbath Union, and to bear the inscription "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day," under the editorial charge of the general Secretary, the Rev. J. H. Knowles, D. D., with the Rev. James P. Mills, district Secretary of the Sixth District, as assistant editor, residing at Chicago. Provisions were also made for the employment of an attorney at law for the prosecution of violators of the Sunday laws. A resolution was adopted protesting against any change in the Sunday laws of New Jersey, and the general Secretary was instructed to forward a copy of the same to the Legislature of that State, at Trenton.
