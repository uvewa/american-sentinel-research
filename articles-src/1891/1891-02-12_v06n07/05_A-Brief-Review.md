As a first fact let us remember this:

> Indifference can not be criminal, when it is conversant about objects which are so far from us that we can not be influenced by them. That is of the highest importance.—*Addison.*

"It was with a few like John the Baptist and the Master—and it should be abundantly so now—that the religion of Christ proves its claims not by force, but by the love of Christ, and shows its power to be successfully assailed as under the persecutions of Pagan and Papal Rome."

Religious liberty has been so long enjoyed in this country that most people think it will never can be taken away. But in this very sense of security lurks a terrible danger. "It is the unexpected that happens." Signs are not wanting, obliging the Christian and thinker, watching the current of events, that unless the people awake to the danger a large share of their liberty will have slipped from their grasp ere they are aware that their hold upon it is being loosened in the least. Those who have carefully noted the changes that have taken place during the past twenty years, must admit that not the least among them has been the change in public sentiment touching the subject of governmental interference in matters or directly religious, at least closely akin to religion. The causes which have led to this change are manifold, but by far the greater part of the change is due to persistent, organized effort to bring about in this Nation an alliance between religion and the State.

One agency which has been at work in this country to bring about the indicated [page 50] tion, which was organized nearly twenty-seven years ago. Its avowed object is to secure such a change in the Constitution of the United States as will "place all our Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." This is their own language, and to make this change in the Constitution would be, as they themselves admit, to recognize Christianity as the true religion, and to make the Bible the fundamental law of the land. This they say would not be a union of Church and State, but only a union of religion and the State. But this is making a distinction where there is no real distinction, as we have many times shown in these columns. We will, however, briefly remark on some of these claims, and show that this would be a virtual union of Church and State.

It is certain that if Christianity is to be recognized as the true religion, somebody must define what Christianity is. That definition must be that which somebody recognizes, and the whole question is whether, for the simplest definition of creed or what is to be believed, is to be recognized, not whether there be one article or sixty articles in a creed, it is a creed nevertheless. This is illustrated in the case of the Unitarians, who have reduced their creed to a minimum short of actual infidelity.

Neither does it alter the case if those who, while in forming the creed should insist upon many points not of themselves, for that very reason, we find the fact that in almost all churches we find a multitude of various opinions held upon what are called minor points, or "non-essentials." Churches are formed, at least nominally, by people getting together and agreeing on a few doctrines which they term "essentials." And just as surely with those who favor official recognition of Christianity as a basis of our government, if they ever agree upon what they would deem to be a few "essential" points upon which the majority could agree, that would of itself necessarily be the established religion of the United States. What other denomination [page 50] would be granted to dissenters would probably be determined by circumstances. But we will suppose, and indeed it will probably be claimed by many, that the matter would not be carried so far as we have indicated. Possibly not at first. But suppose it is only carried so far as to make the Scriptures, or the law of God, the fundamental law of the land, how in the case then be very much affected? It would not, for in that event every article of faith, either the courts as at present constituted, or some new tribunal created for that express purpose, would have to decide what legislation had been modeled in accordance with the law of God. This would be absolutely necessary from the fact that even the most strict National Reformers would not wish to have enforced all the laws contained in the Bible. It is held by everybody nearly that many of these statutes were only for the Jews. Hence if the Bible were to be the fundamental law of the land, the courts, or the tribunal created for that purpose, would have to decide what principle of the Bible should be followed in molding our legislation, and then when laws had been passed, it must be disputed, some tribunal would have to decide whether or not these laws were in accordance with the law of God. This the National Reformers have themselves declared they would not permit the courts, as now constituted, to do. The court will have no authority to decide such questions, and then the civil Government would validate their decisions. It may be objected that the National Reformers are comparatively few in number, that their views are radical and slim, and can never be adopted in this country. Let us examine that proposition a little. Twenty-seven years ago, when the National Reform Association was first organized, it was in numbers and exerted very little influence. Since that time it has grown both in membership and in influence, until it numbers among its many vice-presidents, senators, governors of States, judges of supreme courts, editors of newspapers, judges of district courts, presidents of colleges, besides many other leading men. But more than all this, it now has several powerful allies which it did not have five years ago, viz., the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Prohibition party, and the American Sabbath Union, while an inconsiderable part of the Farmers' Alliance is looking in the same direction, as is indicated by the action at the Omaha meeting.*

Perhaps none of these organizations are avowed, in favor of going quite as far as are the National Reformers themselves, but they advocate the same principles, and whether they realize it or not, when

*The National Alliance Plan, we adopt that feature of the industrial program which provides the abolition of the system of using private banks, and that the Government shall establish sub-treasuries or depositaries, and the sub-treasury system, and that the money of the country shall be, as set forth in the Constitution of the United States, and we demand that Government shall make sufficient money to transact the business of the country on a cash basis, and shall issue legal-tender notes to be issued upon the general credit of the Nation and be a full legal-tender for all debts, public and private.

[page 50] union started on the National Reform road will be impossible for them to stop short of the logical conclusion, without repudiating the very principles which they now hold dear. The case of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will illustrate this. They have declared that it is their object to make Christ "this world's king;" "king of its courts, its camps, its politics," and that his will is to govern all. That is nearly putting this in a little more pointed language the declaration of the National Reformers themselves, that the Bible shall be the fundamental law of the land, and everything that logically follows such a course as that would follow the other.

Again, many will object to classing the Prohibition party with the National Reformers; but as we regard it, that is where they belong. They have repeatedly declared in their platform, both State and national, in favor of Sabbath legislation, and for such a recognition of religion as would make it incumbent on the courts to decide religious questions. They have not gone so far, it is true, as either of the other organizations referred to, but they are in a fair way, sooner or later, to reach the same conclusion. In fact, they must either do it or repudiate past utterances.

As to the American Sabbath Union, it is so closely identified with the cause of National Reform that no one can deny that its tendency is in the same direction. It advocates governmental interference in matters of religion; and altogether the organizations named form a gigantic religious combination to effect a political object; and this, a committee of the United States Senate declared in 1828 was dangerous. The question then up for consideration was a petition to suspend the carrying of the mails on Sunday. The committee in reporting on that petition said:—

> Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle, which in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the rights of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not essentially controlled by it.

That was true; it is no less true at the present time nor will it ever be.

But this is not all; if it were, the danger would be small indeed compared with what it really is. It may be thought by some that if even Protestantism were really unable to carry out a scheme of this kind, it would be impossible for Protestantism and Catholicism to unite in it. So it seemed a few years ago, but times change, and people with them, and religious bigotry assumes all politics makes strange bedfellows.

In an article in the *Christian Statesman* of August 31, 1881, Rev. Sylvester Scovel, writing of the desirability of uniting with Roman Catholics for the purpose of securing so-called National Reform, said:—

> We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first efforts to get the bounty of the National Reform. The Roman Church will consent to strike hands with us in maintaining the observance of Sunday as it is. It will also consent to strike hands with us in our effort to make repeated advances, and gladly is given it operates on from a basis to operate and is glad to exhibit it. It is one of the necessities of the situation.

The same sentiment was expressed by Rev. Joseph Cook of Boston, in November, 1884, in these words: "Wherever they [the Catholics] are willing to co-operate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them." Know what Protestants are willing to do. But let us see how the Catholics feel about it. We have shown above on this subject in the Baltimore Congress of 1889. In the platform adopted by that Congress, the Catholics say:—

> There are many Catholic issues in which the Catholic could come together with non-Catholics and shape civil legislation for the public good. In spite of . . . small disputes . . . Protestants and Catholics could work on alliance with the civic virtues.

When two parties are not only willing to meet each other, there can be no question but that they will come together. And for the purpose of "securing" religious "reformation," by which they mean the secular enforcement, or, at least, the civil enforcement, of religious observances, the two forces, the prevailing on this common scale, the two virtual forces of this country, they have the same object in view. And that this working of such a union is not an irrelevant dream, but is not a mere thing, is demonstrated by a fact stated in this paper in January number of *Our Day,* Edited by Joseph Cook.

In the recent Congress, the "Catholics" the Catholic clergy were brought into cooperation with Rev. Joseph Cook, Senators, and other Protestants to secure a day of rest for workingmen.

A Protestant minister, said the author, Secretary of American Sabbath Union, was with other Protestants associated with Catholics to secure fifty thousand Protestants to accomplish a political object, viz., the passage of a Sunday rest law, so those who have been watching the movements can see how much greater is the danger when Catholics and Protestants unite than when they unite in large or larger numbers of Protestants, to endeavor, not only the observance of Sunday and all the Christian and anti-Christian idea of making Sunday, but that the Constitution of this Nation shall be so as that it can be changed to the principles of the church."

There is danger; and not the least danger, as before intimated, lies in the indifference of those who, while not in sympathy with the so-called National Reform scheme, do not actively oppose it, but think that it can never amount to anything. Americans would do well to remember that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."
