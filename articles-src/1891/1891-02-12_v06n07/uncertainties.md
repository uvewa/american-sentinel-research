## General Notes

- No significant obstructions or damage noted in the source material
- All articles transcribed with high confidence

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 5, Column 2, "Woman's Moral and Educational Union" article
- **Text:** "where the sun never slaints"
- **Transcribed as:** "where the sun never slaints"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** The word "slaints" appears unusual; likely should be "shines" but OCR rendered it as "slaints." Context suggests this should read "where the sun never shines" but transcribed as it appears in the source.

### Page 2, Author initials for "A Brief Review"
- **Transcribed as:** C. P. B. (C. P. Bollman)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Article ends with "C. P. B." which matches known author C. P. Bollman, associate editor listed in masthead.

### Page 6, Author initials for "In a Nutshell"
- **Transcribed as:** H. F. PHELPS
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Full name given at end of article. "H. F. PHELPS" is not in the standard list of known authors for 1891, but attribution is explicit in the text.

### Page 3, Author name "Richard M. Johnson"
- **Transcribed as:** Richard M. Johnson (with Col. title in body)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Historical figure Col. Richard M. Johnson quoted in editorial note; treated as explicit attribution for the quoted statement.
