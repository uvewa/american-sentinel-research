It is no means a pleasant task to criticise a document, emanating from a body of women, who, one believes, are animated by the purest of motives.

But inasmuch as the principles enunciated in the late Address of the Woman's Moral and Educational Union, to the Chicago Board of Education are fundamentally wrong, and in direct opposition to the principles of true Government, it becomes necessary to point out some of the vital errors contained in the document itself.

After commending the faithfulness of the Union in the discharge of the duties, in which we heartily join, the Address makes known its response to the Board, in the following words:—

> Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government, the means of education shall be encouraged.

[page 53] It is insisted that this article requires the teaching of religion in the public schools of Chicago. This is a forced construction, and was so regarded by the Supreme Court of Ohio, in the decision in the case of the Cincinnati School Board of *vs. Minor* et al., which was based on this same article now incorporated in the Constitution of Illinois.

At the bottom of page 2, is found the following quotation that "the State demands that the religious and moral interests of the people be educated." The State makes no such demand, and cannot without making of both the State and Federal Constitutions, and the very fundamental principles of justice. The State cannot teach a religion that would not conflict with the views of religion held by some of the citizens, and for it to teach a religion upon unwilling subjects, or exact from them any respect for any religion antagonistic to their own, is a very radical violation of liberty. It may be admitted that religion and morality are necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, but the best service that government can render religion is to keep its secular hands off it.

First, it is not true that "the State demands that the religious and moral interests of the people be educated." The State makes no such demand, and cannot with making of both the State and Federal Constitutions, and the very fundamental principles of justice.

Another strange-sounding statement, coming as it does from a body of Christian women, is found at the top of page 5. It reads as follows:—

> The religion, morality, and knowledge which the children are to be taught in the common schools, and fore-knowledge are the welfare of the city and to the happiness of mankind and the welfare of education.

Can it be possible that this organization of Christian women proposes to prostrate the Holy Bible and its religion to a cause to the mere preservation of the State. The religion of the Bible was revealed to men for the salvation of souls, and any religion which falls short of this is no religion in the sense in which religion is regarded in any orthodox churches, where those ladies hold membership. What is the difference between a "ghostly agnosticism" and a religion which lacks a man just outside the heavenly gate,—in hell? The boy or girl who goes to hell with no religion is no better off than the one who goes without it. Again, what a soul-saving religion which exerts an influence upon a nation and adds to its numbers. Take from religion its soul-saving power, and you get from it its beauty, its reality, and its influence for good upon the individual and upon the nation, and what you have left is a mere form, a religion of hypocrisy, a religion of Phariseeism.

On page 7, is found the following quotation:—

*Stand over.* "The Bible is a sectarian book." "To what sect does it belong?" Should the Nation be a nation of Church and State.— Or what stands with the State?

The writer of the Address regards the question following the above objections as a very weighty one to them, but we think if the King James version is accepted by one limited sects and rejected by a single sect, it is sectarian. As far as the dissenting sect is concerned, and it is a well-known fact that the Roman Catholics do not accept of the King James version.
