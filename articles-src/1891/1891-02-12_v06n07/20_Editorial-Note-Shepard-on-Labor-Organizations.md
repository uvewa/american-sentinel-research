IN his address, at the Philadelphia meeting, the President of the American Sabbath Union criticised certain labor organizations for holding their meetings on Sunday. At these meetings, people were, he said, harangued by orators, who while denying the existence of a God, appeal for the God-given rights of the down-trodden toilers. If the Sabbath Union would organize, said he, to make the Sabbath known to these men, it would do a great work. "The mission work should be carried to them and to those precious walking delegates who go around making trouble. These busybodies would soon be out of work, and their organizations would crumble into dust if it were made possible to enforce Sunday observance."
