RECENTLY say, the city government of Denver, Colorado, passed a Sunday-closing ordinance similar to that which has recently been enacted in Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, and to that which is asked for here. At first, and for a time, there was a show of enforcing the ordinance in the interest of the local press, the law is "a dead letter." It will doubtless be so in this State. The Sunday-closing ordinance will probably not long be enforced in Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, and it would not be here, should it be passed. It would speedily fall into the same condition as the old State Sunday law, for years before its repeal—completely forgotten and disobeyed. As the *Colorado Graphic* says: "Of Sunday law we have either obeyed it, or Sunday law was never enforced thoroughly and permanently."

Especially must this be the case in a country where Church and State are entirely separate, and the civil Government is pledged to protect all religions alike and favor none. Those who observe the seventh day (Saturday) as the Sabbath, have the same right to governmental recognition and protection as those who observe the first day of the week as their religious rest day. Jews and Christians stand equal before the [page 54] law.

analyzed it meant just this. Because the State is rightfully supreme in civil affairs it can therefore dictate in matters of religion to its people. Because the State may compel a man to work his poll tax, it can therefore compel him to do penance. To prove that those principles had led to compel attendance upon church services, the following quotation is submitted:—

No church or sect can set on to the highways and byways of life, or to the channels of trade and insist of worship, hence it is the imperative duty of every government to protect those in this connection without where they are becoming adepts in learning.

In other words, public sentiment is against forcing attendance upon the Sabbath school and church services, therefore we must turn our public schools into Sabbath schools and churches and compel attendance upon them. For the State is ready to send to jail a man until we compel attendance upon religious exercises and religious services, is just as unreasonable as for the religious sects to demand it.

sit as could be imagined. It is so if we should say that an architect in drawing the plans of a building meant to incorporate in a scheme of development in the specifications because no provisions were made for an open court, or, light in the center of the building. It would do as good to recognize the Deity in the Constitution. The people would believe him so more, nor would they honor him more in the national and individual life, nor would he be pleased with their allusions to him, when the reasons for his authority would be no greater with than without them. God knows the heart and temper of nations, and it is not necessary to tell him so that they regard him, nor is what statutes they hold about him. It is safe to say that the people of this Nation care less for the Almighty than they for themselves. They spend much more in the service of the devil than they do in his service. When the people spend $4,000,000,000 for whiskey and tobacco and but $400,000,000 or less for education and the Christian religion, it is a poor thing to begin to boast the claims of religion to special favor in any public place. As long as this State has such little practical faith in God, it had best wait a while before it begins to parade its faith in him before the world. The Pharisees, who have great respect for God of their fashion, but let their duty before them for the good of the nation. We want no national Phariseeism. There is too much in private.—*Penn Improver.*
