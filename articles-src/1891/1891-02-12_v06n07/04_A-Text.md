"A TEXT," says the *Press,* "is in the law to make Erie County of the legal right-owners to advertise. The claim is put up that under an old statute they will thereby forfeit their licenses. If it does so it is not in keeping with the spirit of the age. The physician whose study and experience have made him more proficient in any branch of surgical or medical science, so that he is able to treat the maladies of his fellow-men with greater skill than his less studied physicians, should not be compelled by law to hide his light under a bushel. If he chooses to do so nobody else need complain. That is a [page 50] matter for his own conscience. But the law should not be utilized to compel him not to advertise any more than to compel him to advertise. This is a free country."

With such laws as this referred to by the *Press,* and with some that are proposed, what may we not expect? It is not about time to call a halt and allow to the individual some freedom of choice, some chance to exercise private judgment, without violating a statute of the State?
