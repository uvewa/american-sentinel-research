EIGHT REASONS WHY A CHRISTIAN SHOULD FOREVER STAND OPPOSED TO THE SCHEMES OF THE NATIONAL REFORMERS.

1. THEIR schemes call upon men to do that which is in direct violation of the words of our Lord, where he says: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." And there is not a man among them that would be willing to put himself in the other man's shoes, and take the consequences, if their plans win.

2. It is taking the sword of the civil power, and Christ has said, "All they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword." And in appealing to the civil power, they virtually acknowledge that they have lost the power of the Spirit of God in their work.

3. Their position is that "the kingdom of Christ is through the gateway of politics." Now this flatly contradicts the words of Christ. He says, "My kingdom is not of this world."

4. It exalts the power of the State above the power of God, and this is directly in opposition to the teaching of the good book that says, "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13. And the Apostle Peter, when brought before the civil authorities, made answer, "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

5. They are looking for, and expecting, a theocracy to be established here, and they are working to that end. A theocracy is where God is his own law maker, and appoints his own law administrators. This is again in direct opposition to the words of the prophet. There never was but one theocracy in this world, and that was the theocracy of Israel. And when that theocracy was overthrown by the kingdom of Babylon, God said: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Ezek. 21:37. So there never will be another theocracy until Christ comes to claim his own.

6. The gospel of our Lord is a gospel of love, and not of force. It persuades; it entreats; it says, come. It was founded in love; it has been carried forward in love. And it can never be carried forward by any other plan. Every experiment of the past, in the direction of force, has been a failure, as it ought to be. It has always manifested the spirit that has been in opposition to the spirit of the Saviour, bringing out some of the darkest passions of the human heart. It always will do the same.

7. The credentials for the propagation of the gospel were given to the Church, and to the Church alone. They were never given to the civil power; and any effort to bring about a change in this matter, is but a plan to effect a change in the plan of Heaven. Such an effort must have the disapprobation of Heaven, and will result in defeat and disaster to all who give their influence in its favor, as it ought to.

8. Christ once said: "Neither cast ye your pearls before swine." There is no pearl so great as the "pearl of great price;" and this effort will result in nothing else than to bring the religion of the Bible, and the discussion of Bible truths into the realm of politics. This will be lowering the standard of Christianity, and bringing the gospel before those who will not appreciate it.
