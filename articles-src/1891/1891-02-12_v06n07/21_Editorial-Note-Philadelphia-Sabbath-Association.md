THE Philadelphia Sabbath Association, the oldest organization of its kind in this country, has frowned on General O. O. Howard and Dr. George Dana Boardman. At a recent meeting of the Association, John Alexander, a member, objected to the approval of the Secretary's report in so far as it says "that Dr. Boardman and General Howard ablyfiled the bill with speeches," at the American Sabbath Union anniversary, held in this city a few weeks ago. He said the doctrine enunciated by the two gentlemen was unsound, and he for one didn't approve of it. He said it was wrong to have a meeting held at the First Baptist Church, because Dr. Boardman was not in sympathy with the Association's ideas of the Sabbath. "General Howard's speech was full of heresy," Mr. Alexander said. "I think that was the most unfortunate meeting that I ever attended. I hope that the Board will never meet again in a church where the pastor is not in sympathy with us." The report was amended and approved.
