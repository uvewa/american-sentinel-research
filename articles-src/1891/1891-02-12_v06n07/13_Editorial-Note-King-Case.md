ANIMADVERTING upon the King case, the details of which are well known to our readers, that excellent paper, the Colorado Graphic says:—

"Can you believe it, that in this enlightened age, and in the United States of America, a country founded on religious liberty, a fellow-citizen may be sent to jail, and kept there, for working on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, when he believes with thousands of others that he should rest on the seventh day of the week? There is a law on the statute books of Tennessee which makes it an offense punishable by imprisonment, for man or woman to labor on the first day of the week. . . .

"Here the State dictates to the Adventist, the Seventh-day Baptist, the Jew, and the Agnostic, and compels him to worship according to civil law, his honest belief to the contrary notwithstanding. The Graphic is an earnest advocate for religious, as well as for personal, liberty, and for this honest cause raises its voice against every attempt made to ecclesiasticize any day in the week, for or against any hobby, on the principle that one step beyond the line of equal rights means the destruction of all restraint, and the final overthrow of both Church and State and the substitution of anarchy instead."
