NOTE.—Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invarible, as he is send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.

At the time of closing this paper, the case of R. M. King, the Tennessee Adventist, fined by a court of that State for common labor upon Sunday, has not yet been decided by the United States District Court, to which it was carried on writ of habeas corpus. Two weeks ago, we stated that Judge Hammond had decided that he had no jurisdiction in the matter, but this was, it seems, an error. We supposed at the time that our information was reliable, but the event proved otherwise.
