"CHRISTIANITY," says Blackstone, "is part of the laws of England." But if Christianity is a part of the laws there, then there must be other parts of the laws of England which are not Christian. And of the common law of England as it existed in 1776, was adopted by the Constitution and because of force in the United States, this country received into its legal code that which was modernism as well as that which was Christian. Which part was Christian and which was not?
