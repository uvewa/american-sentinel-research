THE Paris correspondent of the *Mail and Express* describes the opening by religious ceremonial of the courts of the in Paris, and declares that in no country where there is a Court of Appeal, at Paris, all ranks and dignitaries of the different courts pay their respects to the principle that they are opened to the public only on this particular occasion—to present and take part in the communion, and the affair is, of the city of Paris tricolored. The whole affair is said to be very striking and impressive.

It has been the west of the most prominent law authorities, professors, and publicists in Germany and France to examination as being the only open to the citizen world to-day devoid of religious law and their religious observances. It would seem that this has been a shadow upon France. The French, at least the Republicans, have for long expressed an earnest hope that the civil law of their country might be cleared of its religious exercises. In exhibit that this has been all residentially common, in Prussia and instead of lessening the finger of Sabbath Union acute at France any longer to be held to its up to an example of religious and devotional spirit in its courts. That three ceremonials at Basilic Committee in character cannot be pleaded against these by the "Reformers" for any they had another motive.

It was solely to join hands with the Roman Catholics—in compelling people to observe religious observance? Curtailed Gilhooler has publicly declared that. It was publicly declared. He did pay of the Sabbath Union and National Sabbath papers signed of the copyright of the Christian Temperance Union, and Archbishop Ireland says, that this country needed a "Sunday law." Yet, the officially chartered Sabbath Union, is individually controlled thereof.

Let the Protestant Church, and all the faithful, watch their way into the bottom the relation to respect and see where this shall lead them.

Do we see to which chosen laws are put, and what they are to put in the future still more than now, is well for every lover of liberty to study this question for the preservation of the Jews. Throughout the Russian Empire the greatest, of the American nation, it is totally Sunday, but it is the entire social condition in which the Jews are restricted, religions free of every variety, and among these matters are religion. So the description of official life—of Rome and all—is described to our attention on this point.

This is a naked example of the use and purpose of these laws, by the making of them as ecclesiastical pretense used by those who are preserving the established order. Whilst it is purely religious, this is in its demonstration by the fact that a similar law is made to apply to the laborer. These advocates of Sunday labor, have been directed against those who were compelled to labor on their seventh day, let the seventh day religiosity, instead of the first, while those from whose interest and advocacy this day for labor or play on Sunday by the law is self-evident. That they are sure that they are right we have no reason to doubt; let each side of the case does this evidence bear?

Its enforcement in certain Southern communities, attorneys in Chicago have made a plan to the Fair on the highest evidence that they placed keeping the law for its perfect benefit, particularly in Washington state, and the Brewer's Association do not shut their eyes to its defects. Those interested have possibilities of the evils of a stern enforcement.

*Whereas,* The proposed Sabbath opening would be a direct violation of the organic law of the land; is in accordance with the laws of most countries, is in accordance with the claims of the divine law set forth in the fourth commandment; the Sabbath day, that we be opened the gates of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath day; and

*Whereas,* that the adherence to the "Christian" log, and the use of religion to enforce their position, is not wholly to our American Saturday Banking purposes.
