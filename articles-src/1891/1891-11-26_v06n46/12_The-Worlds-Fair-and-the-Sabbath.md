With the foregoing for a subject, the Galveston (Texas) *Daily News*, of October 6, contains the following:—

If the World's Fair is to be closed on the Sabbath day, agreed upon by a majority of the Christian world, then it would seem fair and reasonable that it should be closed by law upon all the Sabbath days in the week. In fact, it would not be in line with the Constitution and spirit of our Government to grant to one community of religious belief a demand that all others would not have an equal right to make. If the management of the World's Fair should agree to close the gates on Sunday they would doubtless be requested to close them on Saturday, the Sabbath of the Jews, of the Seventh-day Adventists, and of others. As we have some Mohammedans in this country, and will have a number of Mohammedan visitors to the Fair, a like request would naturally come to close the gates on Friday; and likewise petitions from the Pharisees, the Theosophists, and probably others, until every day in the week might be consumed. So the question of closing or not closing for Sabbath observance, now being considered by the World's Fair management, broadly viewed, would seem to be not whether the great Exposition shall be opened to all who choose to attend it on Sunday, but whether there shall be any Fair at all. This statement may seem to be a trifle extravagant at the first reading, but when carefully examined in connection with the organic law of the country in which we live, and with plain rules of irresistible logic, it will appear much more reasonable. This is a country in which every citizen has, theoretically, at least, a right to select his own Sabbath, and to worship God by going to the Fair, if he wants to. The Fair should be opened for people who wish to attend it on Sunday. No free American citizen should be forced to attend the Fair on Sunday, and no free American citizen should be prevented on that or any day from going if he wishes to.

The gospel is an invitation to come, not an arbitrary force compelling us against our wishes and desires. And it should ever be kept before the people that Christianity is never advanced by legal suasion or any other forceful methods. And since the World's Fair is gotten up by the State and for the State, and not by the Church, if any considerable number of our citizens wish to keep the Fair open and attend it on Sunday, it is not becoming in Christians to resort to the law to oppose it. Nothing would degrade Christianity more in the eyes of the world than to admit, by the slightest action, that it is in any way dependent on the civil law for its advancement. So if those who believe in Sunday cannot persuade men to stay away from the Fair on that day, do not make a burlesque of Christianity by trying to compel them.
