WITH the foregoing for a subject, the *Galveston (Texas) Daily News*, of October 9, contains the following:—

If the World's Fair is to be closed on the Sabbath day, agreed upon by a majority of the Christian world that is every first day of rest and relaxation, it should be closed by law upon all the Sabbath days in the week. In fact, it would not be in line with the Constitution and spirit of our Government to grant to one community of religious belief a control of the affairs and business of the country, we have to make. If the management of the World's Fair should close on Sunday, its gate on that day, it would doubtless be requested to close them on Saturday, the Sabbath of the Jews, of the Seventh-day Adventists, and of others. As we have some Mohammedans in this country the representatives of Mohammedans visitors to the Fair, a like request would naturally come to close the gates on Friday; and likewise petitions from the Platonists, Theosophists, and probably other sects every day in the week might be consumed. So the question of closing or not closing for Sabbath observance, is not one that concerns the management, broadly viewed; would need to be settled in favor of some particular day, open to all who choose to attend it on Sunday; but we think an official closing for any religious purpose, and may seem to be a little extravagant at the first reading, but strictly applicable and is not consistent with the organic law of the country is in harmony with its law, and while any of the religious logic, it will appear much more reasonable. This is a question to which every one knows, even possesses, at least, a right to utter his own Sabbath, and his own country that to do the Fair, it he wants. The Fair should be opened for people who wished to attend it on Sunday. No force should be employed to compel any one to attend Sunday, and no free American citizen should be forced by law to stay away.

The gospel is an invitation to come, not an arbitrary force compelling us against our wishes and better self. And it should ever be kept before the people that Christianity is never advanced by legal means or any other forced methods at all. If the World's Fair is gotten up by the State and for the State, and not by the Church, if any considerable number of our citizens desire to visit the Exposition on the day of Sunday, it is not becoming in Christianity to react to the law to oppose. Nothing would degrade Christianity more in the eyes of the world than to adultify, by an alleged artiste, that, that is to say, we are dependent on the civil law for its advancement. So if those who believe in Sunday closing cannot persuade men to stay away from the Fair on that day, do not make a burlesque of Christianity by trying to compel them.

"I would have you know, that the bond of every man is Christ. 1 Cor. 11:3.
