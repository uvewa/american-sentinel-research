THE Paris correspondent of the *Mail and Express* describes the opening by religious ceremonial of the courts of law in Paris, and elsewhere in France, wherever there is a Court of Appeal. At Paris, the officials and dignitaries of the different courts pass in procession to the Sainte Chapelle which is opened to the public only on this particular occasion. The choir of Notre Dame and the Archbishop are present and take part in the ceremonies, and the mass of the Holy Ghost is celebrated. The whole affair is said to be very striking and impressive.

It has been the wont of the most prominent worker for the Sabbath Union to hold up California and France to execration as being the only spots in the civilized world totally devoid of religious law and State religious observance. It would seem that this has been a slander upon France. The National Reformers and Sabbath Unionists have long expressed an earnest hope that the civil courts of this country might be opened with religious exercises. It is evident that this has been an established custom in France, and instead of pointing the finger of Sabbath Union scorn at France any longer it must be held up to us as an example of religious and devotional spirit to be imitated. That these ceremonials are Roman Catholic in character cannot be pleaded against them by the "Reformers" for are they not ready, professedly so, to join hands with the Roman Catholics in the enforcement of Sunday and other religious observances? Cardinal Gibbons has publicly expressed himself as in sympathy with the purposes of the Sabbath Union and Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and Archbishop Ireland says, "Thank God we stand together in demanding the faithful observance of Sunday!"

Let the Protestant Church, and let all the people, look before they leap into the bottomless pit toward which these blind leaders are drawing them.
