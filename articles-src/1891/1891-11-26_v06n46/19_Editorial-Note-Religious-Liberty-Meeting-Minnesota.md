THE *Mirror*, of Lake Crystal, Minnesota, reports a meeting of the Religious Liberty Association thus:

"The 'Religious Liberty meeting,' held at Garden City the 5th inst., was a success. Much interest was manifested, and the principle held up was 'equal rights to all, and special favors to none.' If a law is just let it rest with equal force upon every citizen; if it cannot rest with equal force upon all, without invading the 'inalienable rights of man,' erase it from the statutes and let justice have undisputed sway, for injustice is inequality before the law. Are our liberties in jeopardy? Read the decision of Judge Hammond, of the United States Circuit Court, in the case of R. M. King, of Obion County, Tennessee, and draw your own conclusions."
