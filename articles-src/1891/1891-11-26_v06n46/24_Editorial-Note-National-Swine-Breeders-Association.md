THE National Swine Breeders' Association at a meeting in Chicago have made a plea to the Christian world for the acceptance of American pork. As the highest evidence that they could bring of the perfect health, pure blood, and sound morals, of the American hog, they advertised the tender solicitude of the Swine Breeders' Association for the moral character, religious sensibility, and future possibilities of the swine of America, by the passage of this resolution:

> Whereas: The proposed Sabbath opening would deprive the animals on exhibition of the rest which is in accordance with the laws of nature and God's plan in the institution of the Sabbath, and which is so much needed in order that they may appear at their best on the remaining six days, therefore

> Resolved, That we, the members of the National Swine Breeders' Association assembled in Chicago, respectfully and earnestly petition the proper authorities that the Columbian Exposition be closed on the Sabbath day, that we may be spared the state of a conspicuous and flagrant act of disobedience to God.

Henceforth no "Christian nation" can consistently deny admittance to the "Christian" hog, and no citizen of any "Christian nation" can consistently refuse to eat American Sunday-keeping pork.
