An item of news from Toronto, Ontario, has not received the attention which it deserves; it may prove to be the first step of a very important movement.

The Jarvis Street Baptist Church, Toronto, has passed a vote requesting the municipal authorities to assess the church property just as any other property, and to impose taxes upon it. These taxes will amount to about $1,100 a year.

This action is an example of adherence to conviction even when the adherence involves expense. Nor can any one deny that the action is a logical sequence from the doctrine of the entire severance of Church from State—a doctrine which the Baptists were the first to proclaim, and on the basis of which Roger Williams founded his immortal little Commonwealth.

The key to the situation is found in the fact that exemption from taxation, up to any certain amount, is exactly the same in practice and in principle as a grant of money to the same amount. If it is right for the State to grant money to a denominational or religious body, then it is right for the State to exempt such a body from taxation; if not, then not. If my taxes amount to $100, he who gives me a receipted bill or a certificate of exemption gives me the equivalent of $100 in cash. And while the exemption of churches from taxation is erroneous in theory, it is no less harmful in practice. It has all the evils that would attend a grant of money, and it is less honest and above-board. And it all inures to the advantage of the Church which is always asking favors of the State, and never asking in vain. Where the Protestant churches gain one dollar by exemption the Roman Catholic gain at least ten; the amount of their church property is out of all proportion to the taxable property of the individual members. A congregation, scarce any of whose members are taxed, will have a lordly church or cathedral, which receives the care of the State, the benefit of roads, protection from fire, etc., without paying a cost of equivalent.

And the vicious principle once granted, no one can tell where we are to stop. If the Protestant churches in the city, and State of New York, had maintained from the start the only tenable ground, the Roman Catholic churches and schools and protectories and hospitals would hardly have received such lavish endowments from the State and city; and the ground on which St. Patrick's cathedral stands would not have been conveyed by the city for the sum of one dollar.

The objection to church exemption may be stated in a few words: "We do not want to pay our money if we can help it." Here is a church which has a valuable property; but changes in population have left it weak. It would come very hard to pay the taxes. This is quite likely. But exactly the same reason would hold for maintaining the religious establishment in England, in Wales, in Germany, in Russia. If it is said that the churches are not money-making institutions, the same reason would argue the exemption of art galleries, club-houses and, in fact, of all residences that are not productive of direct and visible income.

When this matter was somewhat profusely and warmly discussed eighteen years ago, only two religious papers (if I recollect aright) took distinct and positive ground against the policy of exemption, *The Independent* and *The National Baptist*. It is a source of gratification to those who were then in the minority, and who got a great many more kicks than half-pence, to see that the world is gradually coming around, and that men everywhere are approaching the only tenable, logical position.

It seems to me that there is very often in our utterances an unexpressed, but very real, proviso. Before every election the citizen is exhorted to exercise his liberty as a freeman, with the proviso "Provided you go with the party." We adjure the minister and the theological aspirant to study the Bible, to study it candidly; and we add (in an undertone, as it were), "provided your study brings you out just where we want it to." The merchant says to his traveling salesman, "Be honest with every one; represent everything as it is; do not vary from absolute rectitude, always provided you sell the goods." The owner leases his premises to the saloonkeeper, and says: "Preserve perfect order; do everything for the welfare of the neighborhood; and do not cause any scandal, provided you pay the rent promptly."

The American citizen is asked if he believes in perfect religious liberty and in the severance of Church from State. He replies: "Oh, yes! I do devoutly. I believe in every religious denomination supporting itself without State aid, provided that this does not interfere with our receiving from the State, annually, the amount of our taxes in the form of exemption."
