IN most respects the gubernatorial contest in Iowa, just past, was one of the most remarkable ever held in the State. Never was there so large a vote polled, and rarely had there been so much real earnestness manifested on both sides. Every lack of ground was accumulated with the doggedness of desperation, for each side that battle was a decisive one.

It will be remembered that the issue for the past ten years has been under a prohibition law. In scarcely five of the twenty-nine counties in the State is it conceded that the law has suppressed the open saloon, and in over half of the counties of the State, no liquor can be obtained, except at the drug stores on a written prescription. The larger river towns together with a few inland cities have maintained the law, and on account of popular sentiment (largely among the foreign element) together with the inert character of the officers, prohibition is not enforced in these. So that Des Moines, the seat of government, the Capital of the State, has not one open saloon, though there are "holes in the wall" through them known to the parties controlling the same as their clients. Upper tier also the same in some other places where there are no open saloons, and just like lies, a certain class names raised the query, "Why are these permitted to run without reverence of prosecution, and because of the reproach that has been brought upon the cities, well and honestly of severe criticism, and because of them with some other reasons, there for within the past years been developed quite a large anti-prohibition element who see no way of regulating the sale of intoxicants so effectually as by high license.

The Democratic candidate for Governor boldly took his stand on the side of anti-prohibition and waged the war with Republican candidate, though a prohibitionist, he in practical, was not so aggressive in promulgating his views on this subject as his opponent, and the future began to look pretty dark for the friends of prohibition.

There were other really important reasons why for consideration but has were almost wholly lost sight of in the fight of prohibition, and so many of that that was the issue of this campaign. At this juncture the various firms to "have a finger in the pie," the first to take action being the Methodists, who have in this State eight hundred stationed ministers, and 1600 rural communities. In their State Conference a short time before the election, the ministers, by almost unanimous vote, the Governor in the most consecrated terms, one of the resolutions being as follows:

*Mulberry county—the demand whom. We insist that in the present crisis, our culture and our efforts should be "will shakers before the evil."*

This was all that was needed to kindle the flame, and finally produced early results in the religious body in the State passed similar resolutions and mirrored the spread of interests to a greater or less extent, the Methodists also responded. Even the right to the property of such a time the discussion of which was participated in by the entire *secular press* of the State, of a course almost wholly from a particular standpoint. So largely did the religious element enter into the campaign that one of the transportation men at a supply high proclaimed those words: "We have no Methodist ministers, you have the beast of Aggers!" A reporter remarked to one of the preceding elders at the Methodist Conference that the auditor for the charges being made, and inquired the cause, and was told that the principal reason was that *they did not want their nests to be disturbed.*

Papers that are convinced of a tendency in favor of the petition of the National Religious Liberty Association, or for mixing politics and religion, vigorously opposed this campaign, and the editor of one such paper confessed to the writer that he let it because popular sentiment and the success of his party demanded it. The question of "mixing religion and politics" is that way, every way add a good cause, is a dangerous one.

Because of the portions of the Methodist ministers in conference assembled, we are led to say a word here. It is not a prerogative of the people to take an active, aggressive, partisan part in politics. For the sake of the argument we may grant that they have the right to be politicians. But even if they did those who thus engage are not exceptional. Thus we may infer that there are motives for engaging in the business, or, put it so, the dues are explained for them as well.

Down on these paragraphs as a broad political platform, don't measure the minister who engages in the work of a dissenter, direct or indirect; honor it rather: honor his influence as a soul winner!

Now is it the province of a Judge to direct the admission of the Book whither they are commanded to keep "companion" from the world? Suppose a conference of Catholic priests "personally" or "representatively" declared in politics, and all y discounters with one of its political parties are the ministers here now. These are the resolutions and the aims intended to keep the Church and State separate. In the same set there are other resolutions of such peculiar resolution which virtually make it a test of fealty in the Church and of patriotism in the Nation, should belong to the Republican party, or to jokes and bluebottles. Substitute the Pope being in power to direct the policy of the nation that he—

The precedent of "mixing religion and politics" is that way, every way add a good cause, is a dangerous one. One journal in its editorial on prudential restraint of the mixing of religion and politics will never lead to any bad effects in Iowa or anywhere else, if it never does anything more than to compel men to vote for or by piety, honesty and temperance." But this is a very poor guess that makes this only in fair tidings, it is but the first of what will make in politics, faith and honest lives, and always will be, a detriment both to the Church and to the State. The legitimate sphere of the Church lies outside the domain of dictating how civil affairs shall be administered.

Nothing has ever occurred in this State so thoroughly arousing the people to a consideration of the evils of this official invasion of religious liberty. For religious people to elaborate how civil affairs shall be administered, as the course of the convention itself in this campaign; as let it be hoped that from this a lesson shall be learned that will be of benefit to the nation in days to come.

*Des Moines, Iowa.*
