THE *Herald*, Orleans County, New York, makes a very apt comment on a plank in the platform of the New York State Prohibition Party:—

> The Prohibition Party of the State of New York, in convention assembled, acknowledge allegiance to almighty God as Governor of the Nation.—Prohibition Platform.

"If God is Governor of the Nation, why is it that the prohibitionists are trying to elect one of their own stamp? The prohibitionists, in the above plank, and in their acts, are trying to supersede God."
