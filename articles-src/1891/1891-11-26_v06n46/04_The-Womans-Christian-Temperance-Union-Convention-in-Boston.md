THE Twelfth National World's Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Tremont Temple, Boston, was the most vast and important and significant meetings of its kind ever held in any land, and marks an important era in the blending of religion and politics; and in effect, if not in intent, of Church and State in this country. Delegates were present from every State, and some countries of the Old World were also represented, including both North and Japan.

What first organized the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was that in some instances the influence of Christian women for Christian temperance work, and solely it was that work carried the day in many elections. The idea of such a meeting as that in Tremont Temple without being impressed with the fact that in that within-wide color array of women has forgotten the first love, and is openly seeking an alliance with the civil power similar to that which grew out of the earnest, conscientious zeal which resulted in the establishment of the papacy.

The most prominent feature of the Woman's Christian Union as it exists today is political and not religious; for this political, that, today, trifle of the power of the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ, is invoking the power of the State to effect reform, in such way or by any such means; and means and results which according to the word of God can be effected only by the operation of the divine Spirit upon the individual human heart. This fact stood out most prominently in the Convention. Said Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt, Honorary Life President of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, "I beg of you to bring as women into the Government that not easy to righteousness." Upon this analysis as the foundation and single principle; morals is a sole one; the means that may be rightful and lawful to enforce the gospel of Christ. Of the divine law the Christian will always observe. Of help given which could have given life, vastly above hypothetics should have been the law. But this Scripture bath rendered an inference, that the promise by fail of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe." How able men to talk of bringing in righteousness by political action, when even the divine law in its weak through the flesh, cannot do it.

But this is the underlying principle of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, moral reform by legislative action. The convention of 1891, declared thus:

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Local, State, national and world wide, has one vital, unifying thought, that of Christ in all reforms; seeking nothing, and that to man Christ and all he teaches may—every way be the one governing—in the forefront in our most consecrated terms, one of the resolutions being as follows:—

In its relation of cause and effect—king of the courts, its own governing nature, its own ruling position, it standing—king of its customs and constitution.

The keeping of Christ above this one cause of its few through the power of politics.

The utterances at the Boston convention were in perfect keeping with this declaration. In an address in Tremont Temple, on Sunday evening, November 15, Mrs. Leavitt declared that there were but few divinely ordained forms of government, family government and a theocracy; and deplored the fact that since the time of the Jewish theocracy, a theocratic government had been maintained in only one country, and only for a short time, namely, under Cromwell in England, and by the Puritans in Massachusetts. "The Colony of Massachusetts," she said, "was for a time governed by God!" She is forced to say that under that wicked government, that civil power, free from its—not but by bigoted and awful men in the name of God—Baptists were whipped, Quakers hanished, and inoffensive old women hanged as witches! But she did declare that "the law of God had been strengthened by human enactments," and that should be made to slake to obey an adequate penaline. The student of history knows with what relentless cruelty that like the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is pledged to a movement that can result in nothing short of persecution for the people of God.

Further notice of this convention must be postponed until next week, when we hope to have before us the full text of the resolutions adopted, and of the several papers read and addresses delivered.
