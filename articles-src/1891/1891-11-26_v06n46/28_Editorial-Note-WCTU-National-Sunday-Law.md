In making her report at the late convention in Boston, Mrs. J. C. Bateham, Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, said:—

> We have been holding the question of a national Sunday law in abeyance that we might devote all our energies to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. We expect that that question will be settled, next April, in favor of the Sabbath, which will be greatly in our favor in securing the passage of a national Sunday law.

And this simply proves that which THE SENTINEL has constantly asserted, namely, that the great object sought in the Sunday closing agitation is not to benefit "the poor workingman," but to secure if possible some national recognition of Sunday sacredness.
