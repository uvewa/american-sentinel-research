THE use to which Sunday laws are put, and are to be put in the future still more than now, is well illustrated by the way they are utilized in Russia for the persecution of the Jews. Throughout the Russian Empire the general, legally authorized, market-day is Sunday, but in the towns and cities to which the Jews are restricted, stringent Sunday laws prohibit all buying and selling on that day. So the desecration of Sunday is made legal to those who profess to observe it, while its strict observance is enforced upon those who deny its sacredness.

This is a naked example of the use and purpose of all religious laws, stripped bare of the hypocritical pretense used by those who are promising the legal enforcement of religion in this country. That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that a significantly large proportion of the prosecutions thus far, for Sunday labor, have been directed against those whose conscientious scruples require them to observe the seventh day religiously, instead of the first, while those who formally acknowledge the sacredness of the first day of the week are privileged to labor or play on Sunday as they see fit.

These prosecutions are of record and their animus is self-evident. That they are what they are constitutes strong circumstantial evidence. Upon which side of the case does this evidence bear?
