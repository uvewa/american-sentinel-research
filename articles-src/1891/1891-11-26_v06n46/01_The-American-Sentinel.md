"The Church's weakness has ever been her alliance with the powers of the State; but when holiness has been her law and the Lord her glory, she has triumphed."

IN the matter of education there is a just course for the State to pursue, namely, to provide facilities for giving not a religious, but a purely secular education to all children not otherwise provided for; leaving the care of the Church to the Church, and to the home the teaching of religion. To attempt any other course is to invite a battle religious and destroy our common schools.

AMERICAN Christianity is part of the law of England, but no American lawyer has ever decided whether that Christianity which is said to be a part of the law of the land in this country is Anglican or Roman, if Anglican is it that this is a Protestant Episcopal Nation, and all other denominations are dissenters. Is that the kind of Christianity that the National Reformers would make the "undeniable basis of the fundamental law of the land"? Or, is it not rather the Covenanter creed which they wish to make the fundamental laws of the United States established? The visiting dissenters, from England, of the different branches of the Methodist Church who met at the Ecumenical Conference in Washington, expressed themselves with much astonishment as to the noticeable and enjoyable difference between the religious atmosphere of this country, free from a Church establishment, and that to which they are accustomed, where they must bear up under a title of somewhat oppressive disabilities ecclesiastical as well as their civil and social disabilities entailed by their dissent. Yet, while feeling and expressing as keen an appreciation of full civil freedom of worship, the members of this same Conference passed resolutions in favor of measures which are, and which are intended to be, subversive of this very condition, in religious affairs, which they proposed so appreciating. Those who still realize the unhappy situation of dissent in their own case should be thoughtful of establishing such conditions as will burden others with the evil of dissent from them.
