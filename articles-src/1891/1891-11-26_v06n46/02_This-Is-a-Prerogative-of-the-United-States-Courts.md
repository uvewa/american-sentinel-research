LAST week we showed by unimpeachable proofs from public records, as well as personal and representative documents, that the statements made by Judge Hammond as to the beliefs and wishes of Mr. King and his "peculiar sect" were not true; that in itself this was not a very small matter compared with the principle which is involved, and which caused this action of the Judge's; that, the assumption of the prerogative of defining, and passing judgment upon the beliefs and wishes of citizens of the United States is wrong.

For convenience, we repeat again the question submitted, to which was the answer:—

*Is This a Prerogative of the United States Courts?*

Because of the portions of the Methodist ministers in conference assembled, we are led to say a word here. It is not a prerogative of the people to take an active, aggressive, partisan part in politics. For the sake of the argument we may grant that they have the right to be politicians. But even if they did those who thus engage are not exceptional. Thus we may infer that there are motives for engaging in the business, or, put it so, the dues are explained for them as well.

Down on these paragraphs as a broad political platform, don't measure the minister who engages in the work of a dissenter, direct or indirect; honor it rather: honor his influence as a soul winner!

Now is it the province of a Judge to direct the admission of the Book whither they are commanded to keep "companion" from the world? Suppose a conference of Catholic priests "personally" or "representatively" declared in politics, and all y discounters with one of its political parties are the ministers here now. These are the resolutions and the aims intended to keep the Church and State separate. In the same set there are other resolutions of such peculiar resolution which virtually make it a test of fealty in the Church and of patriotism in the Nation, should belong to the Republican party, or to jokes and bluebottles. Substitute the Pope being in power to direct the policy of the nation that he—

The precedent of "mixing religion and politics" is that way, every way add a good cause, is a dangerous one. One journal in its editorial on prudential restraint of the mixing of religion and politics will never be in favor of the petition of the National Religious Liberty Association, or for mixing politics and religion, or for political papers expressly, and the editor of the journal which is distasteful to his own religious feeling or to his own political sentiment. And the friends of the first, should be set apart by the petition of other public real religious education.

That it said be really believes and wishes, be and the rest, and the rest had testified about seeing his own day of public rest, and his own day to be. The rest complaint, is that his adversaries on this point have the advantage of usage and custom, and the law founded on the usage and custom, not that religious tolerance has been denied to him. He does not belong to the class that would abrogate all laws for a day of rest, because the day of rest is useful to religion, and aids in maintaining good morals. He does not even question the asserting influence of the fourth commandment; the lineal observance of which by himself and all men, is the distinguishing demand of his particular sect.

As before shown, every material statement in this passage, as to the beliefs and wishes of the petitioner and his sect, is directly the reverse of the plain truth in the matter. And in view of this fact, it is evident that the Judge assumed for himself, authoritatively to define for Mr. King and the people with whom he is religiously connected just what "religious feeling" is, and what they really believe and wish, and it is evident also that the Judge considered himself capable of defining for them what their religion is and saying what they really believe and wish, better than they themselves could say it, because that which he declares to be their religious feeling, and what they really believe and wish is directly contrary to what they themselves had formerly and officially declared upon the same points of religion.

Yet does the Judge stop there. Having officially declared for them what their religious feeling is and what they really believe and wish, and so having this point judicially settled, he proceeded to judge them accordingly, and to declare to them "disingenuous,"—"not noble or high-toned," mean, unworthy, or somewhat of "generally artful," in their "demand for religious liberty." And not content with this he must needs apply to the religious cause called dissent Sunday legislation, which he finds faulty in attributing to them the approbrious epithet of "fanaticism."

This is a singular proceeding for a court of the United States. It strongly reminds us of a certain court proceeding in times past, which are worth recalling in this connection. There are many of them, but one will suffice for this occasion. In the year 1715, a certain Mr. White, a Puritan, and "a schoolmaster at Lexden, of good fame and conversation, was presented before an English court, the Lord Chief Justice presiding, who was assisted by the Master of the Rolls, the Master of the Exchequer, a Mr. Powel said, the Dean of Westminster, the Sheriff of London, and the Clerk of the Peace. He stood in parts to all following matters:

*Chief Justice*—Who was this? *White*—

*Master of Exchequer*—

*C. J.*—White sat back on the desk?

*White*—Yes, all the children of God sit on their shoulders. Have him to the Goldsmiths.

*Master of Exchequer*—What scriptures have you to ground your conscience against these governors?

*White*—The whole Scriptures bear for obedience to lawful authority, and everything that belongs to it.

*M. Roy.*—These things were never so tolerated.

*White*—Though they are the same which were allowed by proclamation.

*M. Roy.*—Where is the place where there are forbidden?

*White*—We know that every true believer in God and by God his commands us not to pollute our own soul, and not to raise up our position to—

*Master of the Rolls*—There are no parts of this that belong to such a sect, but you are of another order, and if you will not be ordered, you show yourself dishonest to the law.

*White*—I would not willingly disobey any law, but I would avoid those things that are not warranted by the word of God.

*M. Roy.*—You that are commanded by an act of Parliament, and is disobeying the laws of your country, 'tis all in all a contempt, but of submission, to all no shape I see an end.

*White*—Submission to law is our way.

*C. J.*—There set a remonstrance follow and serve them—

*White*—No, my lord; I do and will obey authority; but a command only of authority—and I rest still a true subject.

*C. J.*—The law is above your conscience and is to make you of her control; to make laws and serve them.

*White*—No, my lord, I am to obey laws that be holy, and on conscience.

*Master of the Rolls*—Have you discovered anything further?

*C. J.*—Very, marry, do ye, and then I will tell him—

*White*—Only God and his laws are absolutely good!

*C. J.*—This is one of White's darlings. I tell you what; I have divers persons in my account: I know this not, setting by this occasion; this not as the wiseheart and such our contemporary opinion has come before me since I sat in this commission.

*White*—No, my lord, may my conscience witness to its honesty by patience?

*Master of Westminster*—You will see him, he is obedient to the shrew's commandment!

*White*—For the discipline of Christ: they have no warrant in the word of God; that are our foes, to obey in man, or woman.

*C. J.*—You would have no laws at all?

*White*—If there were no laws I would live a Christian and do no wrong; if I wronged not, I am innocent of the law.

*C. J.*—There is a rebel.

*White*—No, my lord, I am a tool, then art a very rebel, for thou makest trouble slow my course, and set up thy hand against my prince. If thou served,

and tossed, from one prison to another, subject to law and justice [yet all in "due process of law," observe,] only for not frequenting the parish church," and for "distinguishing the Church of England as is required."

This was and this was needed to kindle the flame, and finally produced early results in the religious body in the State passed similar resolutions and mirrored the spread of interests to a greater or less extent, the Methodists also responded. Even the right to the property of such a time and the discussion of which was participated in by the entire secular press of the State, of a course almost wholly from a particular standpoint. So largely did the religious element enter into the campaign that one of the transportation men at a supply high proclaimed those words: "We have no Methodist ministers, you have the beast of Aggers!" A reporter remarked to one of the preceding elders at the Methodist Conference that the auditor for the charges being made, and inquired the cause, and was told that the principal reason was that *they did not want their nests to be disturbed.*

Papers that are convinced of a tendency in favor of the petition of the National Religious Liberty Association, or for mixing politics and religion, vigorously opposed this campaign, and the editor of one such paper confessed to the writer that he let it because popular sentiment and the success of his party demanded it. The question of "mixing religion and politics" is that way, every way add a good cause, is a dangerous one.

*White*—My lord, I thank my lord of my heart stand: the right reversal God and my prince: and God will prove it. People, though have faith and follow Christ.

*White*—I would speak a word which I am sure will find people, and it will be truth; I have the name of God to taken in vain: if I had done it, it had been wicked: but let God judge between thee and me leave free.

---

*White*—White, White, you are a clerk, a learned said.

*White*—I pray you worship show me some law and I will big pardon and amend it.

*C. J.*—If I say leave it is a matter of charity.

*White*—Pray, my lord, no me have justice of God; my lord let me be presented to judge of Independence and of the Constitution.

---

*White*—our childrenism's chart have now and then got shoulders. Have him to the Goldsmiths.

*C. J.*—Where go you—no, no, you have been in London; that I may be easy he leave.

*White*—I have paid dues and fees in other get this area, and so not in debt; put there in my care.

*C. J.*—Ye marry, shall you this young party.

*White*—I desire to walk glory

*C. J.*—If I will not you twenty, I must, a rebel, before you come out—

*C. J.*—God it will be Soon—Nasty it—Nasty—

Hitherto, it has been supposed by the American people that we had been delivered from such judicial proceedings as we have represented, and that citizens of the United States were free from attacks and abuse from the judicial bench on account of their religious beliefs and wishes. But when we are confronted with the fact that from a judicial bench of the United States thousands of citizens of the United States are fairly charged, to their reproach, and denounced as "disingenuous," and branded with the epithet of "fanaticism" solely on account of their "religious feelings," and their beliefs and wishes in the matter of religious observance, then it is certainly time for the people of the United States to look about them and inquire whether the rights and liberties bequeathed to us by our fathers are indeed all a delusion and a snare?

Of course, this is all consistent with the views of the Judge, of the relationship of religion and the civil power, and the proposition that Christianity is a part of the common-law cure control of legislation, and thus enforce upon all, their own religious beliefs and observances. But, this is this in every usual point of his dicture, the Judges and has become a scent of the Dark Ages that no court of the nineteenth century, and a country dominated by papal principles, instead of one dominated by the principles of the Declaration of Independence, and the United States Constitution. If the protection of the courts of the United States, stands indeed for things religious as well as things civil, and if the judges of those courts really sit in the place of God, and enjoy the infallible prerogative that belongs to such position, then it is proper enough, of course, that they should direct their prerogative to deciding for individuals and sects what their religious beliefs and wishes really are, and whether a religious feeling is fanaticism or not. But if such be not the position of the courts, nor the position of the judges, then they are entirely out of place when they assume to themselves such prerogatives and exercise such jurisdiction and dictation.

And that such is not the position of any court of the United States, nor the position of any judge thereof, is evident from every principle of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution of the United States, and also from the whole history of the formation of that Constitution.

Including we cite a passage from a decision of the Supreme Court of California, is now involving the identical question and principle that was before the court of the United States for the western district of Tennessee. The principles set forth by the California courts are fully as applicable to the United States courts as are to the State. We are sure that upon a comparison between this citation and that from Judge Hammond at the beginning of this article, no one will deny the slightest difficulty in deciding which the two represents the true principles of this true American doctrine. The California court said:—

The protection of the Constitution extends to every individual or to none. It is the individual right that is guaranteed, irrespective of whether the many or the few are concerned. The test is not the number of persons whose right to vote or few would petition or ask petition this as personal any religious right. It does not depend on any sect or sectional religious creed. It is as certain when it invokes the search of religion in the single individual, as when the majority of his fellow men.

We could not inquire into the particular religious profession of the petitioner, or any other individual. This court has no such jurisdiction. We protect religious profession and worship, without reference to numbers, without denomination, without sect or creed. We could not inquire into the fact whether the Sabbatarian was unknown or otherwise. He has the right to profess and worship as he pleases; and, more than this, his right is surrounded by circumstances covering a constitutional privilege no matters what his profession or creed. He has the undoubted right to vote and worship as he pleases and is protected in the enjoyment of any tribunal of the State.—*Ex Parte Newman.*

And let all the people forever say, Amen!
