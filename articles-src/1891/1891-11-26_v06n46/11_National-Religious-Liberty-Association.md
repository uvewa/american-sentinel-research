## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible.

We believe in the civil government as divinely ordained.

We believe in the separation of the Church and State, as taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe that the civil government has no right to make laws respecting an establishment of religion, or to prohibit the free exercise of any religion.

A CORRESPONDENT from Fall River, Mass., writes that a Mrs. Mary Scoffer, living in that place, was recently arrested and tried for doing house cleaning on Sunday and fined by the judge.

HARRY TURNER, of Tippecanoe High School, Harrison County, Mississippi, was this last week brought up as part of the consideration of the cases of TEN SENTINELS, that had been sentenced by Justice Coleman, of Corinth, Mississippi, who says he "quite agrees with the main ideas of the SENTINEL," but thinks "the question of State should be entirely separated, and that the Sabbath truth as it is found in the Bible should be preached as a purely religious truth."

THAT Howard, Ontario County, New York, makes still another Sabbatarian who was arrested by the New York State Prohibition Party that a candidate of the American Prohibition Party, the "Sabbath" Party to the New York, believes that there is Almighty God in Government of the Nation."—*Toledo Blade.*

Since they believe in God's Government of the Nation, why do they call it a political party? Why not candidly call it a church, for that is what it is in fact.

The little journal, the *Christian Statesman*, the official organ of the National Reform Association is "always the same"—always in favor of religious legislation.

One of the prominent statesmen with a regard for the "Patterson of the Pennsylvania Express paper district."

A man may cheat and defraud and do many things which in 1776 the common law called infamous, but one of the acts of 1794, but the keeping open of his store on Sunday, was the only one of which the law of England or of any of the colonies takes judicial notice.

Even the Christians of West Virginia show sense in the premises.

It "falls out"—for their putting it in practice, but there is no bad lessening it should be made. We do not claim that Sunday is not a useful institution, something for ones self or for other help. When we ask the citizens of this Republic, of whatever religious persuasion, not to compel Sunday rest upon others, we appeal to that God, Dr. Crafts that his familiarly more indiganately calls "the Sabbath-breaker"—or rather Sunday-breaker, commonly—"or to work at the Lord's Day." What do they mean by "to work at the Lord's Day"? They mean working for the closure of the institution. They and we believe that Sunday is not the Lord's Day. Read Rev. 1:10.
