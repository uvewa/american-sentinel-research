THAT theory that makes the government the father of the people, and charges it with the oversight of everybody's business is bad enough in all conscience, but in a sermon in Tremont Temple on the last, Inst., Mrs. Leavitt, presumably to please the ladies of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, capped the proposition that the government was also the mother of the people. This, of course, to serve to settle finally the question of the orbit of the opinion, for if the government is both the father and the mother of the people it follows that it is exalted above the people, and of course in the creator of the people. Those who stumble over the real, has contradicted the very "make of one blood all nations of men," who did not find themselves equal to the task of defending the Darwinian theory that man sprang from protoplasm, via the monkey, can now take refuge in this new theory of the fatherhood and motherhood of Government. God may now be left out of the question, and the people have only to "vote" or "decide in the Convention that makes us, and Dr. Lorinier is its prophet!"
