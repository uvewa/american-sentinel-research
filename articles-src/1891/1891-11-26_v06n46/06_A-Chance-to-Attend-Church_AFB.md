SOME Sunday-law advocates are heard while making the ask of a civil law to fill their empty pews, they insidiously deny the accusation and in return, charge the accuser with wilful misrepresentation. There may be a miscalculation, standing, which explained will throw light on the subject of motivation. When it is charged that Sunday-law agitators are working for laws to people their empty pews, we one means to indicate them that they are asking for laws empowering the police to arrest and bring to church unwilling listeners. What is meant is that they are trying to secure laws closing all places of amusement or recreation excepting churches, and thus indirectly to compel people to go to church or else stay at home. That this is their object there is abundant proof. The latest utterances confirmatory of this position are from Rev. Mr. McLearn, Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, who said in the Campbell Park Presbyterian Church, of this city, to stated that this object was to give the people a "chance" to go to church. To this is the reply first to close the theatres. The question at once arises how will closing the theatre give the people a "chance" to go to church? Manifestly by denying them a "chance" to go to the theatres, and thereby reducing their "chances," of being publicly entertained, to a choice between nothing and the church. Again, is the means and, he proposes to stop the running of street-cars on Sunday.

Touching the question of visiting the parks by means of the street-cars, the same gentleman stated, in a perversion of mind, that the objection made by some that the occupants of crowded tenements ought to have an opportunity to visit the parks, and breathe the fresh air, was "sentimentalism without foundation." "There are no tenement houses," he said, "that will not hold all the occupants when assembled on Sunday, and they had better be there than desecrating the Sabbath by going to the parks."

The "chance" to go to church which would result from stopping the running of the street-cars on Sunday is simply a "chance" to decide between a crowded tenement house and a church service in which their persons was to tolerate. In this second case Mr. McLearn might attend to make good to defend in all action in this religion by stating that he had reference to the street-car conductor; who if the streetcars were stopped, would have a "chance" to go to church. The probabilities are that a majority of those who would not attend church services on Sunday if the cars were stopped, but admitting, for argument's sake that they would all attend, where in the name of liberty and of all else, would it be justice to the one thousand persons served by the cars on Sunday, to leave them no chance to get to the parks to have them no chance to get to the parks in order to give the one conductor a chance to go to church; a chance which he already has? Is it he is in consciousness enough to leave his job to follow his conscience?

It is apparent that these Sunday-law advocates are working for laws which shall deprive men of the chance to people take recreation, or to entertain, except at church services, and yet they deny, when they are asking for laws in the interest of church attendance.

Said the same gentleman previously referred to: "Close the Fair [Sunday] and open the churches; let the gospel be preached in song and by the greatest preachers of the land and the world. If this is not an indirect attempt to compel attendance at religious services, what is it? —a tax on idleness? Should the civil law inflict an idleness? Should the civil authorities apply it?

"Being on the property of such a time any of its village may close a church of one denomination and this inauguration and occasions of an opposing creed, would not the friends of the first congregation have reason to believe that it was done in the interest of attendance at the services of the second congregation? They most certainly would, and that is the view many take of this so-called "chance" to "attend religious services." A. F. BALLENGER.
