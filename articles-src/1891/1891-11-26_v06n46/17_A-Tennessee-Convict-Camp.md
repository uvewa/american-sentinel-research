In describing a Tennessee convict camp, the *Sun* of this city says:—

No changes in the closing is changed and chapel and religious services are held. As most of the convicts are negroes, intense excitement is shown times seven of intense religious excitement. It is seen great donations of prison life, and a convict under religious conviction has privileges in the aim of his judges and bodily concentrations are much sought. Aside from this benefit the services a basis. The life of they had another motive can lead to an elevation in religion or morality. It usually leads to a depravity deeper and more degraded.

The idea that conversionment be reached and reclaimed by Christian influences simply because they are convicts, is a mistake. It is a fact, however, that the formation, and primitive religious services passing as religious services to prisoners ought to reform anybody. Conversions among convicts are brought about by personal effort on the part of consecrated men and women who labor for them from a simple love of souls.
