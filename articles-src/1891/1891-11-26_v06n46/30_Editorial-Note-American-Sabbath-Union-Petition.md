According to the *Christian Nation*, the American Sabbath Union is about to act upon a hint given by the aforesaid journal. In its issue of the 12th inst., it says: "A very practical effort to secure the closing of the Columbian Fair is that of the American Sabbath Union. Following up the plan indicated in an editorial of the *Christian Nation* several weeks ago, it has prepared a petition to Congress urging that the additional $5,000,000 loan asked for the Exposition, be granted, accompanied by a condition that the gates shall be closed upon the Sabbath. Fifty thousand petitions are to be mailed this week to as many pastors, with a request for the signatures of their parishioners."
