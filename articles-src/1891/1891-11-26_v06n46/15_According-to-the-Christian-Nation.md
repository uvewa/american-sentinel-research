ACCORDING to the *Christian Nation*, the American Sabbath Union is about to act upon a hint given by the aforesaid journal. In the issue of the 19th inst., it says: "A very practical effect in urging the closing of the Columbian Fair is that of the American Sabbath Union. Following up the plan indicated in an editorial in the *Christian Nation* several weeks ago, it has prepared a petition to Congress urging that the additional $5,000,000 asked for the Exposition, be granted, accompanied by a condition that the gates shall not be opened on Sunday, and ten thousand petitions are to be mailed by week to so many pastors, with a request for the signatures of their parishioners."
