AS an item of news from Toronto, Ontario, that has received the attention which it deserves; it may prove to be the first step of a very important movement.

The Jarvis Street Baptist Church, Toronto, has passed a vote requesting the Government to assess the property of that church on any and all other property, and to impose taxes upon it. These taxes will be about $1,000.

This action is an example of adherence to conviction, which is not without the attention elsewhere. Yet not can any society that this action is a logical sequence from the doctrine of the entire severance of Church and State. The Baptists were perhaps the first to proclaim, and are the heirs of which Roger Williams was himself honored in the history of this Constitution.

The remedy to the situation is found in the fact that exemption from taxation, in the vast majority of cases, the wealth of each certain particular, is exactly the same in its practice and in principle as a grant of money to a denominational school. It is for the State to grant money to a denominational or religious body, then it is right for the State to exempt such a body from taxation; if not, then not. If an annual amount, it may be, on the sum of its occupied bill or a certificate of certain persons, does not a few equivalent of $10,000 in endowment?

And while the exemption of churches from taxation gives them the aid of State, it is no less harmful in practice. It has all the evils that would attend a general and 1600 situation, and is for honest and active and good. And if all insists to the advantage of the Church which is always asking favors of the State, and never asking in vain. Where the Protestant churches can one dollar by exemption the Roman Catholic gains at least two; is it asserted of their church property is out of all proportion to the taxable property of the individual members. A congregation, scarcely any of whose members are taxed, will have a lordly church or cathedral, which masters the care of the State, the beautifully roads, protection from fire, etc., withholding a quota of equivalent.

And the vicious principle once granted, no one can tell where we are to stop. In the Protestant churches in the city, and State of New York, had maintained from the start the only tenable ground, the Roman Catholic charitable institutions and protectorates and hospitals would hardly have received such lavish endowments from the State and city, and the ground on which St. Patrick's cathedral would not have been conveyed by the city for the sum of one dollar.

The objection to church exemption may be stated in a few words: "We do not want to pay money if we can help it." But in a church which does not escape property; but changes in population have left it. If I want a new church, I will pay the taxes. This is quite likely. But exactly the same reason would hold for maintaining the religious establishment in England, in Wales, in Germany, in Russia. If it is said that the Church are not money-making institutions, the same reason would argue the exemption of all galleries, club-houses and, in fact, of all residences that are not productive of money.

When this matter was somewhat prominently brought forward, discussed eighteen years ago, only two religious papers (if I recollect aright) took editorial distinct and positive ground against the policy of exemption, the *Independent* and the *N. Y. National Baptist.* It is a source of gratification to those who were then in the minority, and who got a great many more kicks than half-pence, to see that the world is gradually coming around; that individuals and corporate institutions where approaching the only tenable, because just and equal position.

It seems to me that there is very often not more to make for these rights than is very real, precise. Before every election the citizen is expected to exercise his liberty as a freeman; with the proviso "Provided you go with the party." We adjure the minister and the theological aspirant to study the Bible, to study it candidly; and we add in the words of a celebrated clergyman, "provided your study brings you out just where we are." In the words of a man to his traveling salesman, "Be honest with every cost; represent everything as it is; do not vary from absolute rectitude, always provided you *sell the goods.*" The owner loans his premises to the saloonkeeper, and says: "Preserve perfect order, do everything for the welfare of the neighborhood; and do not cause any scandal; and, above all things, pay the rent promptly."

The American citizen is asked if he believes in perfect religious liberty and in the severance of Church from State, he replies: "Oh, yes! I do devoutly. I believe in every religious denomination supporting itself without State aid, provided that this does not interfere with our receiving from the State, annually, the amount of our taxes in the form of exemption."—*H. L. Wayland, D.D., in the Independent.*
