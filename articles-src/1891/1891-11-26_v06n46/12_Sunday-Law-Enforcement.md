IT does not deny the right of the State to make any day or any number of days national holidays, leaving the individual citizen free to observe or not to observe such days just as he sees fit, as is now the case with the Fourth of July, and other holidays; but to require the observance of such days, or to forbid upon one day, acts which are freely permitted on other days, is an abuse of power of the State.

IN making law report at the late convention in Boston, Mrs. J. E. Rakshan, Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, said:—

We have been laboring the greatest portion of the year on the line that we might address ourselves to the keeping question of this resolution.—We expect that this question will be settled, but it was in front of the footstool, which is greatly to our favor in a securing the passage of that law.

And this simply proves that which *True* Sentinels have for years said, that the real, the great object sought in the Sunday closing agitation is not to benefit "the poor workingman," but to secure a species of some national recognition of Sunday sacredness.

In a subsequent paragraph entitled "Sunday Laws and Vices," the *World* gives expression to a truth worthy the attention of the law-makers of the State when it says:

In time is a thorough revision of our Sabbath laws on this subject. The new Legislature should take up the matter earnestly and give us a body of nineteenth century statutes instead of the almost entirely century Sunday laws we now have. It is not the business of the State to enforce religious observances or to restrain liberty in any of the uncommon manifestations. When the State attempts anything of the kind it makes itself the effective volenter of vice and demoralization.

The *Mirror,* of Lake Crystal, Minnesota, reports the action of the Religious Liberty Association.

"The Religious Liberty meeting," held at Garden City the 8th inst., was a success. Much interest was manifested, and the principle held was 'equal rights to all, and special favors to none.' It does not just in kind our efforts are placed upon every citizen; if it cannot rest with equal favor upon all, without investing that inhabitants' majority signee—the demand whom.

The Christians of Work claim that in the ten Commandments of Sinai a divine authorization has always been made—"between doing or having those assembled first of early and one's own, and keeping against their sins a place for doing the same act on the six." It is true that this discrimination as to days and work is in the ten commandments. In the case of Joseph McCoy, fined for plowing his own farm, Stokes, a Seventh-day Adventist of Arkansas, who was fined for working in his own melon and, of a church building on Sunday, of Allen Works, fined Saturday for working in his own tobacco shop, and the similar case in Arkansas. In Georgia, Day Armstrong for digging his own potatoes. William King fined for working in his own tobacco shop, and other similar cases in Arkansas. In Georgia, Day has done for us in cooking for Sunday washing. H. M. King, of Tennessee, convicted because, he is prosecuted for his family, was not consistent with the claim giving. If he repeated the offense, "We has one at a public place, and done in the sight of others, as would cost the public a breakable Judge"—When who has admitted that it would not be wrong for a jury for a woman to knit in her own home seated in a rocking chair, if she kept quiet and made no complaint was partiger criminal. There is no law defining to this. That is inconsistent in this judicial expression by cutting off the individual from pursuing his own business.

R. M. King, of Tennessee, has just gone to his own as having more free, for plowing his own piece in his own field on the first day of the week, whom he had conscientiously remembered on the seventh of the week that "the seventh day is the Sabbath."

Let us reform the individual rather than the law. Let us go to our own task of that part of bringing God's own moral law to bear upon human enactments.

A correspondent was so kind as to write a rather a surprise to the managers of the convention. They had expected from chosen signatories to express themselves more in harmony with the principles of a law council, rather than to delegate upon the soul power of the gospel to work redemption.
