When Sunday-law advocates are charged with seeking the aid of a civil law to fill their empty pews, they indignantly deny the accusation and in return, charge the accuser with willful misrepresentation. There may be a misunderstanding, which, when explained will throw light on the position of both parties.

When it is charged that Sunday-law agitators are working for laws to people their empty pews, no one means to intimate that they are asking for laws empowering the police to arrest and bring to church unwilling listeners. What is meant is that they are trying to secure laws closing all places of amusement or recreation excepting the churches, and thus indirectly to compel people to go to church or else stay at home. That this is their object there is abundant proof. The latest utterances confirmatory of this position are from Rev. Mr. McLean, Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. In an address recently delivered in the Campbell Park Presbyterian Church, of this city, he stated that their object was to give the people a "chance" to go to church. To do this he proposed first to close the theatres. The question at once arises how will closing the theatres give the people a "chance" to go to church? Manifestly by denying them a "chance" to go to the theatre, and thereby reducing their "chance," of being publicly entertained, to a choice between nothing and the church. Again, to the same end, he proposes to stop the running of street-cars on Sunday.

Touching the question of visiting the parks by means of the street-cars, the same gentleman stated, in a previous address, that the objection made by some that the occupants of crowded tenements ought to have an opportunity to visit the parks, and breathe the fresh air, was mere "sentimentalism without foundation." "There are no tenement houses," said he, "that will not hold all the occupants when assembled on Sunday, and they had better be there than desecrating the Sabbath by going to the parks."

The "chance" to go to church which would result from stopping the running of the street-cars on Sunday is simply a "chance" to decide between a crowded tenement house and a church service in which some persons take no interest. In this second case Mr. McLean might attempt to defend his attitude on this question by stating that he had reference to the street-car conductor, who if the street-cars were stopped, would have a "chance" to go to church. The probabilities are that a majority of them would not attend church services on Sunday if the cars were stopped; but admitting for argument's sake that they would all attend church services if the cars did not run, would it be justice to the one thousand persons served by the cars on Sunday, to leave them no chance to get to the parks in order to give the one conductor a chance to go to church, a chance which he already has if he is conscientious enough to leave his job to follow his convictions?

It is apparent that these Sunday-law advocates are working for laws which shall leave no chance for the people to take recreation, or be entertained, excepting at church services, and yet they deny that they are asking for laws in the interest of church attendance.

Said the same gentleman previously referred to: "Close the Fair [Sunday] and open places where the gospel shall be preached in song and by the greatest speakers of this and other lands." If this is not an indirect attempt to compel attendance at religious services, what is it? Let us illustrate: Should the civil authorities of any village close a church of one denomination and then inaugurate services of an opposing creed, would not the friends of the first congregation have reason to believe that it was done in the interests of attendance at the services of the second congregation? They most certainly would, and that is the view many take of this so-called "chance" to attend religious services.
