The *Union Signal*, of November 5, has the following note:

The Church of Christ of the Christian denominations. Even as the religious agencies of the first prohibition part of its creed and refining influence, it is the most powerful of legislative agencies.

This may be, stated, only the second formation of this kind in this country, but it is not likely to be the last one. Leaders in the popular religious thought of the day are urging in the direction of the teaching as approaching political action through the Church—as a direct course.

In a prayer performed in Tremont Temple, Saturday, November 15, Joseph Cook said—

May our churches knit their whole of small and great resources into a cable of influence strong enough to linger our bill at this will be persistently vote to legal enactments.

Foundly those who practice and advise distinctly political to civil matters are not aware of the fact that they have to that very extent. According to precedent in the matter. According to Senator "A Society" "History of the Christian Church," Vol 5, the Church of Athens, at 311, it is charged "the bishops to take the oversight of such civil magistrates in their respective pews are were church members, and if in the dealings of that time the magistrate were not found consistent with their Christian profession, they were to be turned out of the church. This at once and gave the direction to the civil affairs, for they alone were the judged of what professions are consistent with the Christian profession. And as it was with these consists consist of political action who are actually standing in law of accommodation to compel men to serve them.
