BISHOP TUTTLE, of the Episcopal High Church, St. Louis, Missouri, in acknowledging the receipt of some copies of THE SENTINEL that had been sent him by a member of the Religious Liberty Association, says he "quite agrees with the main discussion of THE SENTINEL, and that Church and State should be entirely separated, and that the enforcing of morals as such, belongs to the former and with the home—not with the latter."
