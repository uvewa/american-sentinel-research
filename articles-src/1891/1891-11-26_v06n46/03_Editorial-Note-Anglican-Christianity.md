ANGLICAN Christianity is part of the law of England, but no American court has ever decided whether that Christianity which is said to be a part of the law of the land in this country is Anglican or Roman, if Anglican it must be that this is a Protestant Episcopal Nation, and all other denominations are dissenters. Is that the kind of Christianity that the National Reformers would make the "undeniable basis of the fundamental law of the land?" Or, is it not rather the Covenanter creed on which they desire to see the fundamental laws of the United States established? The visiting dissenters, from England, of the different branches of the Methodist Church who met at the Ecumenical Conference in Washington, expressed themselves with great unanimity as to the noticeable and enjoyable difference between the religious atmosphere of this country, free from a Church establishment, and that to which they are accustomed, where they must bear up under a title of somewhat opprobrious distinction as well as the civil and social disabilities entailed by their dissent. Yet, while feeling and expressing so keen an appreciation of full civil freedom of worship, the members of this same Conference passed resolutions in favor of measures which are, and which are intended to be, subversive of that very condition, in religious affairs, which they recognized as supremely fortunate. Those who still realize the unhappy situations of dissent in their own case should be thoughtful of establishing such conditions as will burden others with the duty of dissent from them.
