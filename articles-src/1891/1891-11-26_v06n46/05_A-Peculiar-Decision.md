THE *New York Nation* of August 27, 1891, contains an article reviewing a single point in the decision lately delivered in the case of R. M. King, the Seventh-day Sabbatarian, who was convicted for constructing a nuisance by plowing his field on Sunday. It is already well known that this man had been fined and beaten upon the ground that there was no law in Tennessee to justify his conviction, and that he was therefore deprived of his liberty without due process of law. The case was then brought before Judge Hammond, of the Federal court, who examined the decision of the State court.

In this decision opinion Hammond has expressed the belief that the prisoner was wrongfully convicted, but said that the courts of the United States have no power to interfere in the matter, on the ground that they are not tribunal which may review and reverse convictions in the State courts even though such convictions may be illegal, through erroneous judgment, as to what the statutes of the common law of a State may be. If "in, he says, "every conviction in the State courts would be reversible in the Federal courts where the law of any State could be navigated."

The strongest point, however, falls on the way that is not sufficient for the Federal courts not having such power. On the same ground, why may not the State Court throw off its own responsibility in reviewing the decisions of the lower law court, and affirm that, even against a Judge in one of them, through his ignorance of the law, or prejudice against a defendant, charges his jury in a prejudicial way and convicts a man unjustly and wrongfully, that there is no redress for the one thus wrongfully convicted? In these cases courts have no jurisdiction in such matters? Can they not interfere that justice may be secured? If the decision of a lower court is final, then why the need for the higher court; and for the same reason, the lower courts do the work now assigned to the higher.

Judge Hammond decided this case upon the judgment of the Judge of the State court, for he accepted their view as to their knowledge of the common law; for us infirm that those judges are the depositaries of the common law of the respective States, just as the statutes book of the State are of the statute law. In other words, whatever verdict they may give of the common law establishing in just of the statutes are established in the statute books, is settled. Such is his decision book. He makes his decision upon this first point by the following words:— "Was there [this] greater law, to him he established, and how can gainsay it?" If it is true, it is lost in that to know which ground Judge Hammond should declare Mr. King "not wrongfully convicted." For even if when the Judge in Tennessee, in whose court Mr. King was convicted, should by his decision pronouncement as to what constituted common law, and this established, was convicted by a law of Tennessee.

But, on the other hand, has decided of Judge Hammond regarding the infallibility of the decision of State judges was not sustained in fact, and that therefore the same proceeding in the King case was declared by the Court of State, that Mr. King violated no law, and was therefore illegally convicted," for whatever law is, there is no constitution to put. Then what shall be done of the Federal court that renders its decision to remain his law before judges making an innocent man?

If any court judge has the power to establish any point he may express, as law, through whatever he says it is to follow, that a law so could be settled at any case, at the time of the trial, and as to any he might say that all the prejudice of the judge trying the case. But if this state of things is to be admitted, where is the voice of the people in the establishment of the laws by which they are to be governed?

But, although Judge Hammond expressed himself as strongly upon the point that the decision of a State judge establishes common law, he nevertheless is satisfied that there is no such common law as the Tennessee court had declared. And yet Mr. King was remanded by the decision of Judge Hammond himself. If it is not exactly that would that the *Nation* closed its stricture on this point by saying: "We should have been glad to have Judge Hammond state just what rights are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, if it does not protect a citizen against being punished for violating a law which has no existence."

The *Nation* is not the only journal which can see that the underlying question of Judge Hammond's decision. The *Central Law Journal*, of October 10, in commenting on the same points, says:

Without disturbing the character or the correctness of the opinions, which is exceedingly well considered, we are inclined to join with the Nation in this regard that Judge Hammond did not state just what rights are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, if it does to protect a citizen against being punished for violating a law which has no existence. Is it this Government of the people, or is it not?

Is this a Government of the people, or is it not?

The *Nation* is not the only journal which can see the underlying contradictions of Judge Hammond's decision. The *Central Law Journal*, of October 10, in commenting on the same points, says: Without disturbing the character of the correctness of the opinion, which is exceedingly well considered, we are inclined to join with the *Nation* in the regret that Judge Hammond did not state just what rights are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, if it does not protect a citizen against being punished for violating a law which has no existence.

Is this a Government of the people, or is it not?
