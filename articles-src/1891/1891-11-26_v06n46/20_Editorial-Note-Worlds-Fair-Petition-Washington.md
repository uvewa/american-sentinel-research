A REMOSTRANCE against closing the World's Fair on Sunday was circulated here Tuesday and Wednesday, and over 400 signatures were secured on Front Street alone, covering a length of 13 feet of legal cap paper. The petition read as follows: "The undersigned citizens of the United States of America, do hereby insist that this Government of these United States is a purely secular Government, in which all its citizens of whatever religious or non-religious belief have equal rights. That the absolute separation of Church and State should in all matters under the direction of the Government be maintained. That we insist upon the right of all citizens feeling thus disposed having the right to visit such Exposition on Sundays as well as any other day of the week. That all citizens may have an opportunity to visit such Fair on such days as shall not conflict with their particular convictions."
