THE "Washington League" has been organized in Texas for the purpose, as given in its first "address to the American people," of antagonizing the encroachments of the Romish Church upon our public school system. This adds another to the long list of organizations already established for this ostensible purpose. Some of these societies are but wolves in sheep's clothing, covering under the vall of opposition to Rome the intent to establish a Protestant hierarchy just as subversive of pure religion and civil liberty undefiled, as the power to which they offer defiance. With these are joined others who ignorantly worship at the same shrine, deluded with the idea that they are inspired by patriotism or misled by a mistaken but earnest religious zeal. Some of these organizations are secret in character and all are certain, in time to come, to be hot-beds of private and public violence. The secret semi-military Catholic societies are legion; and a higher intelligence, whether Papal or Satanic makes little difference, is fitting them all,—both parties,—for a contest sure to come.

When will these forces give battle, and what will be the result?
