The Boston Daily *Globe* does not hesitate to call the existing statutes and ordinances, upon Sunday observance, "anachronisms in the law," and to suggest that their removal from the statute books is a needed legal reform.

That two great dailies of as much distinction and influence as the New York *World* and the Boston Daily *Globe* should recommend this radical change in existing laws at this time is significant.

The *Globe* expresses itself thus:—

"Outgrown and outworn theories too often find their last stronghold in the law. A vivid illustration of the power of traditions long since outgrown is the recent conviction of a western farmer of seventh day opinions, on the charge of plowing his field on Sunday.

"It is expressly provided in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law establishing any form of religion. To the conscientious man who believes that the seventh day of the week is the true Sabbath, for Christian as well as Jew, the theory that Sunday is in an especial sense the Lord's day is a heresy.

"The keeper of Saturday has an undoubted moral right to his convictions. More than this, his legal right to observe Saturday as a holy day and Sunday as a secular day ought not to be called in question, in free America, by any civil authority. It would not be in doubt for a moment were it not for the existence of legal anachronisms that should have gone out with the witchcraft laws, or at the latest with George the Third.

"That the body of Christians who observe Saturday as the Sabbath is a 'feeble folk,' does not in the least affect the question of national consistency, nor that broader issue of equitable dealing between man and man. If these people numbered but a hundred, the individual rights of each would claim no less justice than now, when their grievance must also be the grievance of the great number of orthodox Israelites throughout the country.

"Upon the statute books of many of our States are still to be found laws that were passed on the theory of government by a theocracy. They are out of harmony with the spirit of the Constitution of this Republic, and altogether repugnant to the spirit of the time.

"Being on the statute books, such enactments must, we suppose, be enforced until they are repealed. The work of reform should begin without delay. The agitation resulting from this conviction of a man who had simply done his duty according to the dictates of his conscience, without trespassing on the rights of others, should result in a general revision of our laws, in the interest of common sense, as well as of freedom of thought and religion."
