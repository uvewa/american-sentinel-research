In the matter of education there is but one proper course for the State to pursue, namely, to provide facilities for giving not an irreligious, but a purely secular education to all children not otherwise provided for, and leaving to the Church and to the home the teaching of religion. To attempt any other course would be to belittle religion and destroy our common school system.
