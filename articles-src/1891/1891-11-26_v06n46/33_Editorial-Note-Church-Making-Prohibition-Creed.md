THE *Union Signal*, of November 5, has the following note:—

> The Church of Christ of the Christian denomination of Elgis, Illinois, has passed resolutions making prohibition part of its creed and refusing fellowship to all who vote otherwise. It is said to be the second church in the country to do this.

This may be, as stated, only the second instance of this kind in this country, but it is not likely to be the last one. Leaders in the popular religious thought of the day are looking in the direction of a far-reaching supervision of political action by the various denominations of the country. In a prayer offered in Tremont Temple, Sunday, November 15, Joseph Cook said:—

> May our churches knot their whips of small cords and drive from their membership not only the liquor seller but all who persistently vote to legalize the traffic.

Possibly those who practice and advocate church dictation in civil matters are not aware of the fact that they have ancient and honorable precedent in their favor. According to Schaff's "History of the Christian Church," the Council of Arles in A. D. 314, charged the bishops to take the oversight of such civil magistrates in their respective sees as were church members; and if in the discharge of their duties the magistrates acted inconsistent with their Christian profession, they were to be turned out of the church. This at once gave the bishops the direction of civil affairs, for they alone were the judges of what action was inconsistent with the Christian profession. And so it will be with these modern censors of political action who are already using the club of excommunication to compel men to do their bidding.
