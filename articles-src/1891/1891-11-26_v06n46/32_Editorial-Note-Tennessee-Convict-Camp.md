In describing a Tennessee convict camp, the *Sun* of this city says:—

> On Sundays the dining room is changed into a chapel and religious services are held. As most of the convicts are negroes, these services are at times scenes of intense religious excitement. It is the one great distraction of prison life, and a convict under religious conviction has privileges in the use of his lungs and bodily contortions that are much sought. Aside from this benefit the services are a farce. The life of the convicts here can lead to no elevation in religion or morality. It usually leads to a depravity deeper and more hopeless than ever.

The idea that convicts cannot be reached and reclaimed by Christian influence simply because they are convicts, is a mistake. It is a fact, however, that the formal, spiritless religious services maintained by civil governments has no power to reform anybody. Conversions among convicts are brought about by personal effort on the part of consecrated men and women who labor for them from a sincere love of souls.
