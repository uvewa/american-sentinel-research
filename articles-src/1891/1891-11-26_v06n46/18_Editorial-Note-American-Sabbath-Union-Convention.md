In a convention of the American Sabbath Union, for Indians, recently held in Indianapolis, one of the speakers on their regular programme, Stanton J. Peele, made use of the following language:

> Let us labor to reform the individual rather than the law. Let us depend more upon that higher law of man's moral nature for restraint, and less upon human enactments.

A correspondent writes that the sentiment was rather a surprise to the managers of the convention. They had expected their chosen speakers to express themselves more in harmony with the principles of law to compel, rather than to depend upon the real power of the gospel to work reform.
