The theory that makes the government the father of the people, and charges it with the oversight of everybody's business is bad enough in all conscience, but in a sermon in Tremont Temple on the 15th inst., Dr. Lorimer, presumably to please the ladies of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, advanced the idea that the government was also the mother of the people. This, of course, serves to settle finally the question of the origin of the species; for if the government is both the father and the mother of the people it follows that it existed before the people, and of course is the creator of the people. Those who stumble over the Bible statement that God "made of one blood all nations of men," but who do not find themselves equal to the task of believing the Darwinian theory that man sprang from protoplasm, via the monkey, can now take refuge in this new theory of the fatherhood and motherhood of Government. God may now be left out of the question, and the people have only to shout "Great is Government that made us, and Dr. Lorimer is its prophet!
