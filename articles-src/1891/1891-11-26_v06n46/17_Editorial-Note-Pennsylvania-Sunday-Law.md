Of the centenarian Sunday law of Pennsylvania, into which the "National Reformers" are now injecting the fervent blood of a renewed youth, Judge Paxson of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court says:—

> A man may shave himself or have his servant or valet shave him on the Lord's day without a violation of the act of 1734, but the keeping open of his place of business by a barber, and following his worldly employment of shaving his customers, is another matter.

Upon this the *Christian at Work* gravely comments:—

> This is called "fine hair splitting" in some quarters, but there is no hair cleavage about it. The few always discriminates between the public act and the private act—between doing or having done something for one's self at one's own home, and keeping open a public place for doing the same acts for the public. It is related of the late Dr. Guthrie that his landlady once indignantly refused him but water for shaving on Sunday, for she would countenance "no work of the Lord's day", but she added that if he wanted hot water for a toddy he could have it. This was in Edinburgh in the twenties. They and we do better now—for if there is more Sunday shaving there is far less Sunday drinking.

This incident of the shaving water and the toddy so naively told marks a characteristic human failing. When artificial religion is carried to a hypocritical extreme a corresponding laxity of conscientious scruple will be found to offset the irksomeness of Phariseeism. The finding of one end of a clue is the best of evidence that the other end exists. The refusing of hot water for shaving is naturally followed by the offer of hot water for a toddy. In the make-up of the "unco guid" the other extreme is sure to be found. In their effort to do away with personal Sunday shaving the Wesleyans, in conference in Michigan, are reported to have voted it sacrilege to shave at all; for these idle cups of hot water Satan will be sure to find some mischievous use.

The *Christian at Work* claims that in the enforcement of Sunday laws discrimination is always made "between doing or having done something for one's self at one's own home, and keeping open a public place for doing the same acts for the public." Is it true that this discrimination is always made? Was it made in the case of Elder J. W. Neales, a Seventh-day Adventist of Arkansas, who was convicted and fined for painting his own church building on Sunday; of Allen Weeks, fined for planting potatoes in his own field on Sunday; of Joseph McCoy, fined for plowing his own farm; James Pool, for hoeing his own garden; James Armstrong for digging his own potatoes; William Fritz for working in his own cabinet shop; and other similar cases in Arkansas? In Georgia, Day Conklin was fined for cutting wood at his own kitchen door, for use in cooking the Sunday morning breakfast for his family, and was threatened with the chain-gang if he repeated the offense. Was his own door a public place, and was he cutting wood for the general public, to cook the public a breakfast? Judge Winn who presided at the trial of this case charged the Grand Jury that for a woman to knit in her own house on Sunday was indictable, and that he who saw the act and made no complaint was particeps criminis. There is no hair splitting in this. That is avoided in this judicial expression by cutting off the whole Sunday breaking head just above the shoulders.

R. M. King, of Tennessee, has just gone to his death while a sentence of fine and imprisonment was hanging over him, for plowing his own corn in his own field on the first day of the week, when he had conscientiously remembered on the seventh day of the week that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord."

The truth is that whatever may be the theory, it is the fact, that in the application of religious laws by their upholders and promoters the only rule of practice is "anything to convict."
