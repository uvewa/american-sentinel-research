The recent National and World's Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Tremont Temple, Boston, was one of the most important and significant meetings of its kind ever held in any land, and marks an important era in the blending of religion and politics, and in effect, if not in name, uniting Church and State in this country. Delegates were present from every State and Territory in the United States, except Alaska. Many countries of the Old World were also represented, including South Africa and Japan.

When first organized the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was what its name implies, an association of Christian women for Christian temperance work, and nobly was that work carried forward. But it is impossible to attend such a meeting as that in Tremont Temple without being impressed with the fact that this whilom noble army of women has forgotten its first love, and is openly seeking an alliance with the civil power similar to that which grew out of the great apostasy of the fourth century, and resulted in the establishment of the Papacy.

The most prominent feature of the Woman's Christian Union as it exists today is political and not religious; for this reason, that, losing sight of the power of the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is invoking the power of the State to effect reforms, which can never be accomplished in any such way or by any such means; reforms and results which according to the word of God can be effected only by the operation of the divine Spirit upon the individual human heart. This fact stood out prominently in the Boston convention. Said Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt, Honorary Life President of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, "I beg of you to bring us women into the Government that we may bring in righteousness." The end sought is a noble one; the means proposed are ignoble and contrary to the gospel of Christ. Of the divine law the apostle says: "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe." How idle then to talk of bringing in righteousness by political action, when even the divine law is too weak through the flesh to accomplish that result. But this is the underlying thought of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, moral reform by legislative action. The convention of 1887, declared:—

> The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national and world-wide, has one vital, organic thought, one all absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm, and that is that Christ shall be this world's king; yea verily this world's king in its realm of cause and effect,—king of its courts, its camps, its commerce,—king of its colleges and cloisters,—king of its customs and constitutions. . . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics.

The utterances at the Boston convention were in perfect keeping with this declaration. In an address in Tremont Temple, on Sunday evening, November 15, Mrs. Leavitt declared that there were but two divinely ordained forms of government, family government and a theocracy; and deplored the fact that since the time of the Jewish theocracy, a theocratic government had been maintained in only two countries, and only for a short time, namely, under Cromwell in England, and by the Puritans in Massachusetts. "The Colony of Massachusetts," she said, "was for a time governed by God." But she forgot to say that under that wicked government—not as she asserted, by God, but by bigoted and selfish men in the name of God—Baptists were whipped, Quakers banished, and inoffensive old women hanged as witches. But she did declare that "the law of God must be strengthened by human enactments," and that men must be made to obey it by adequate penalties. The student of history knows what that means, it means that like the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is pledged to a movement that can result in nothing short of persecution for conscience sake.

Further notice of this convention must be postponed until next week, when we hope to have before us the full text of the resolutions adopted, and of the several papers read and addresses made.
