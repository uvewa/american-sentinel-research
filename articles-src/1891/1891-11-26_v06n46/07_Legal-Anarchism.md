THE *Boston Daily Globe* does not hesitate to call the existing statutes and ordinances, upon Sunday observance, "anachronisms in the law," and to suggest that their removal from the statute books is needed legal reform.

That two great dailies of as much distinction and influence as the *New York World* and the *Boston Daily Globe* should recommend this radical change in existing law at this time is significant.

The *Globe* expresses itself thus:—

"Outgrown and outworn theories too often find their last stronghold in the law. A vivid illustration of the power of obsolete ideas rules long since outgrown in the present conviction of a western farmer of seventh day Adventist faith.

"It is expressly provided in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. The consummation thus set before us will be the consideration of the evils of this official invasion of religious liberty. For religious people to elaborate how civil affairs shall be administered, as the course of the convention itself is this campaign; as let it be hoped that from this a lessen shall be learned that will be of benefit to the nation in days to come."
