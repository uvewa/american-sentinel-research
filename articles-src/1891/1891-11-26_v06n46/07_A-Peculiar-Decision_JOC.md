The New York *Nation* of August 20, 1891, contains an article reviewing a single point in the decision lately rendered in the case of R. M. King, the Tennessee Sabbatarian, who was convicted for committing a nuisance by plowing his field on Sunday. It is already well understood that King sued out a writ of habeas corpus upon the ground that there was no law in Tennessee to justify his conviction, and that he was therefore deprived of his liberty without due process of law. The case was then brought before Judge Hammond, of the Federal Court, who sustained the decision of the lower courts.

In his written opinion Judge Hammond expressed the belief that the prisoner was wrongfully convicted, but said that the courts of the United States have no power to interfere in the matter, on the ground that they are not tribunals which may review and reverse convictions in the State courts even though such convictions may be illegal, through erroneous judgment, as to what the statute or the common law of a State may be. "If so," he says, "every conviction in the State courts would be reversible in the Federal courts where errors of law could be assigned."

The average mind, however, fails to see why that is a sufficient reason for the Federal courts not having such power. On the same ground, why may not the Supreme Court throw off all responsibility concerning the decisions of the courts below it, and affirm that, even though a judge in one of them, through his ignorance of the law, or prejudice against a defendant, charges his jury in a prejudicial way and thus secures a conviction wrongfully, that there is no redress for the one thus wrongfully convicted? Do these courts have no jurisdiction in such matters? Can they not interfere that justice may be secured? If the decision of a lower court is final, then why the need for the higher courts to exist? Why may not the lower courts do the work now assigned to the higher?

Judge Hammond decides that it is not possible for the judges of States to err in their knowledge of the common law; for he affirms that these judges are the depositaries of the common law of their respective States, just as the statute book is the depository of the statute law. In other words, whatever version they may give of the common law establishes it, just as the statutes are established by the way they are expressed upon the statute book. He makes his decision upon this point plain by the following words: "When they [the judges] speak, the law is established, and none can gainsay it." If this be true, it is hard to see on what ground Judge Hammond should declare Mr. King "wrongfully convicted." For if when the judge in Tennessee, in whose court Mr. King was convicted, in rendering his decision pronounced as to what constituted common law, and thus established his utterances as law, then Mr. King was convicted by a law of Tennessee.

But if, on the other hand, the decision of Judge Hammond regarding the infallibility of the decisions of State judges is not sustained in fact, and that therefore there is no common law in Tennessee as was declared by the Court of that State, then Mr. King violated no law, and was therefore illegally convicted; "for where no law is, there is no transgression." Then what shall be said of the justice of the next higher court that renders a decision to sustain the lower courts in punishing an innocent man?

Again, if any State judge has the power to establish any point he may express, as law, simply because he says it is so, it follows that a law could be made to suit any case, at the time of its trial, and in any way that might suit the prejudice of the judge trying the case. But if this state of things is to be admitted, where is the voice of the people in the establishment of the laws under which they are to live, and by which they will be tried in the courts? Is this a Government of the people, or is it not?

But, although Judge Hammond expressed himself so strongly upon the point that the decision of a State judge establishes common law, he nevertheless is satisfied that there is no such common law as the Tennessee court has declared. And yet, Mr. King was remanded by the decision of Judge Hammond himself. It is not so much wonder then that the *Nation* closed its stricture on this point by saying: "We should have been glad to have Judge Hammond state just what rights are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, if it does not protect a citizen against being punished for violating a law which has no existence."

The *Nation* is not the only journal which can not understand the consistency of Judge Hammond's decision. The *Central Law Journal*, of October 30, in commenting on the same point, says: "Without desiring to challenge the correctness of the opinion, which is exceedingly well considered, we are inclined to join with the *Nation* in the regret that Judge Hammond did not state just what rights are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, if it does not protect a citizen against being punished for violating a law which has no existence." And so says every citizen of the United States, who cares for the rights guaranteed to him by the Federal Constitution.
