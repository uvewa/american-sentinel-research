It is stated that the German Socialists threaten to attack the emperor's measures for the suppression of immorality when they come up in the Reichstag. When European crowned heads and Socialists cross swords upon moral issues, the contest is not without interest, but true morality can gain nothing in any event. Morals are not to be mended by legislation.
