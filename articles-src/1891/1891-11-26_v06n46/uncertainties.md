# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 26, 1891 (v06n46)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is quite poor. The text is very small and many passages are difficult to read with confidence. Multiple articles contain passages where the exact wording could not be determined with certainty. A higher-resolution scan would be needed to verify many readings throughout this issue.

## Page 1

### Article: "The American Sentinel" (editorial paragraphs)
- **Location:** Third paragraph, sentence about "invite a battle religious"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "invite a battle religious and destroy our common schools"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "battle religious" reads oddly; may be "battle religion" or another phrase
- **Reason:** Very small text, unclear word boundaries

### Article: "This Is a Prerogative of the United States Courts"
- **Location:** Multiple passages throughout
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW — The entire middle section of this article (the passage discussing Methodist ministers, political platforms, and the Pope) is extremely difficult to read at this scan resolution. Many phrases may be significantly different from what was transcribed.
- **Reason:** Very small text in narrow columns, poor scan quality

## Page 2

### Trial Dialogue (White case)
- **Location:** Full dialogue section, left column
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW — The trial transcript dialogue between White, the Chief Justice, Master of the Rolls, Master of Exchequer, and Master of Westminster is very difficult to read. The speakers' names and their dialogue are compressed into very small type. Many exchanges may contain errors.
- **Reason:** Extremely small type, archaic language makes it harder to distinguish words

### "Christianity, says Blackstone" paragraph
- **Location:** Bottom right column
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "this country received into its legal code that which was modernism as well as that which was Christian"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "modernism" seems anachronistic; may be another word
- **Reason:** Small text, unclear character shapes

### "The Woman's Christian Temperance Union Convention in Boston"
- **Location:** Multiple passages
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

- **Location:** Multiple passages in right column continuing to page 4
- **Second pass completed:** Yes

## Overall Assessment

This issue requires a higher-resolution scan for accurate transcription. Many passages have been transcribed based on best judgment of letter shapes and context, but confidence is generally LOW across the issue. A re-scan at higher resolution is strongly recommended before these transcriptions are considered publication-ready.
