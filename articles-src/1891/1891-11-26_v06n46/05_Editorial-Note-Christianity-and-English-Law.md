"CHRISTIANITY," says Blackstone, "is part of the laws of England." But if Christianity is only a part of English law then must there be other parts of the laws of England which are not Christian. And if the common law of England, as it stood in 1776, was adopted by the Constitution and became of force in the United States, then this country received into its legal code that which was unchristian as well as what was Christian. Which part was Christian and which was not?
