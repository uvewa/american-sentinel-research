In an editorial paragraph entitled "Sunday Laws and Vice," the *World* gives expression to a truth worthy the attention of the law-makers of the State when it says:—

> It is time for a thorough revision of our barbaric laws on this subject. . . . The new Legislature should take up this matter earnestly and give us a body of nineteenth century statutes instead of the sixteenth century Sunday laws we now have. It is not the business of the State to enforce religious observance or to restrain liberty in any of its innocent manifestations. When the State attempts anything of the kind it makes itself the effective minister of vice and demoralization.

The *World* is right in thinking that Sunday laws are remnants of sixteenth century semi-barbarism and that all needed civil regulations should apply as much to one day of the week as to another. There is no legal reform more needed at the present hour than just this for which the *World* calls; but is there a Legislature in the United States which will attempt to expunge from the statute books of its State its unrighteous religious laws, and substitute enactments in consonance with the principles of Christian equity and civil righteousness? There is none!
