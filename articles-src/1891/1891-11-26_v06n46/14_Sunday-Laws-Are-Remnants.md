SUNDAY laws are remnants of sixteenth century semi-barbarism and that all useful civil regulations should apply as much to one day of the week as to another. There is no legal reform more needed at the present hour than that just this for which the *World* calls. Is a single State Legislature in the United States which will attempt to expunge from the statute books of its State its antiquarian religious laws and substitute enactments in consonance with the principles of Christian equity and civil righteousness? There is none.

IT is stated that the German Socialists threaten to attack the emperor's measures for the suppression of immorality when they come up in the Reichstag. European opinions toward Socialism and Socialistic cross swords upon moral issues, the contest is not without interest; let true morality not gain nothing in any truly arena. Morals are not to be mended by law.
