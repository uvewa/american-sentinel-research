## LOOK ON THIS PICTURE, THEN ON THIS.

A. D. 21. Sanhedrim, Jerusalem.

Caiaphas said: "It is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and the whole nation perish not." John 11:50.

**RESULT.**

"Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death." Verse 53. And killed the Prince of Life." Acts 8:15.

***

A. D. 221. Roman Empire.

The bishops of the Christian Church wanted the help of the State to carry out their ambitious plans, and, for this purpose, secured from Constantine a Sunday law. See Neander.

**RESULT.**

The power conferred in order to convert the world, and make all men Christians, almost swept Christianity from the face of the earth. Pagan Rome was for less ferocious against God's people than the "Vicegerent of the Son of God," acknowledged and supported by the civil power.

A. D. 1786.

The popular exponent of nationalism in France, M. Necker, the Minister of Finance, stated his idea of human nature, and philosophical government, in his words to Birnbaum, who proposed an entirely different region: "I can not accept your plans, you would govern by policy: morality is our basis." We will release the people from all restraint; for it is the bondage they groan under that is the cause of all the evil in the Nation. Remove the cause, and the people will instantly be perfect. Their moral nature will assert itself, and they will have no desire to do wrong. All that we need is the law to make the people free.

**RESULT.**

The theory was founded on wrong premises; and didn't work in the way the philosophers, in their simplicity, expected it would. There was a terrible retrograde movement at once. Although Necker had been the idol of the people, his theories brought only confusion, and he was obliged to resign his position and go into temporary exile. Satan was delighted to see law and order laid aside; he hates all law, and delights in chaos. As soon as the restraints were cast off, he led them captive at his will. And the Reign of Terror is a fair sample of Satan's good-will toward men.

A. D. 1787.

In the Hall of the States-General of France, Robespierre said: "Capital punishment is a crime against society, and should never be inflicted." Evidently this was because the punishment generally fell upon the lower orders, and he was "making a bid" for their favor. By and by he had the power to inflict capital punishment.

**RESULT.**

He complained that the heads were not falling fast enough to please the people; he must have one hundred and fifty a day. Finally, his friends had to sentence and execute him to save their own lives.

And it is worthy of notice that the majority of those who were guillotined in that awful

## THE NATIONAL REPUBLIC

A. D. 1887. Convention, Lakeside, Ohio.

Dr. McAllister said: "It is better that a few should suffer, than that the whole Nation should lose its Sabbath."

**WARNING.**

"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Matt. 25:40.

***

A. D. 1885. United States of America.

The Clergy again seek the intervention of the civil power, in order to uphold their waning influence and tottering institutions. God will not help them; they are determined to have their way; and they, too, ask for a Sunday law.

**WARNING.**

Some things are never satisfied. The cry is, and will be, "Give, give."

Says Dr. Crafts, in his "Sabbath for Man," "We want more than this."

***

A. D. 1889.

The new nationalism, based upon the flimsy philosophy of Bellamy, assumes that, pecuniary interests being entirely removed by absence of competition, the people will be entirely free from sectional, selfish, or partisan influences; and the sense of duty and desire of applause will be the guiding motives. Suppress the "brute principle" of competition, and have the new and beautiful principle of "association" instead. Let the Nation provide work, food, raiment, shelter, and pocket money for every individual in the Nation, and if there isn't work for all, why, then, keep the killers from doing unpleasant things by paying them for doing nothing. And this will make a perfect nation. (See Oliver Echo, May, 1890.)

Those who are posted will recognize exactly similar demands by the American Sabbath Union. See Report of Hearing on Breckinridge Bill.

**WARNING.**

Neither constitutions nor laws have power to make men good, not even the perfect law of God. Its design is altogether different. It points out sin, as man's laws point out crime, but can never change the character. Forces within the man must do this. Nothing that the State can do will convert a single individual, but the "embarrassing legislation," so generously promised by the Sunday-law advocates, would make multitudes of hypocrites.

The National Reformers of this generation profess lamblike innocence—"One can but smile at their apprehensions of the success of a movement which would not harm a hair of their heads."—Christian Statesman.

But it don't work that way at all!

Their theory is not practical, so it must be wrong somewhere; and the reader of THE SENTINEL will not have much trouble to find out where that wrong is. See how would-be National Reformers have applied the "embarrassing legislation" of individual States, and see what kind of a smile it would provoke to have similar laws adopted and enforced by
