THE Watertown Sentinel comes to us from Watertown, South Dakota, filled with sound anti-National Reform matter, and asking an exchange, which we gladly grant. The organs of so-called National Reform are multiplying, and why should not the friends of religious liberty be fully awake to the danger, and fully prepared to meet it in every quarter?
