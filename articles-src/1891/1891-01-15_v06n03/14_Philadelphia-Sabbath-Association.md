THE Philadelphia Sabbath Association utterly repudiates the so-called sanitary grounds of Sunday observance, and insists on a distinct recognition of Sunday as a Christian institution. It is offended with Dr. George Dana Boardman, for saying that they would make greater progress if they would look at the Sabbath from a sanitary standpoint. We must therefore understand that this Association, in demanding Sunday laws and their enforcement, is doing it from a purely religious standpoint.
