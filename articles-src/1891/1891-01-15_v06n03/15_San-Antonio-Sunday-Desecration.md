THE clergy of San Antonio of all denominations, headed by Bishop Johnston, are stirring up the people on the subject of the "desecration" of Sunday. They held a public meeting, and resolved to ask the Legislature to enact more rigorous laws.

The Anglo-Saxon Churchman remarks that a "layman who participated in the meeting, with a keen sense of consistency, moved that the clergy set an example of keeping Sunday by ceasing to announce their services in the Sunday papers."
