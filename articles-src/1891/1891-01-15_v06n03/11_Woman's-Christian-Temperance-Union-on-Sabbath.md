THE WOMAN'S Christian Temperance Union column of the Lebanon Rustic, a Missouri paper, has the following:—

> The Sabbath question will never find its proper place in the Nation until its discussion is brought more fully within the realm of conscience. An awakened moral conviction throughout the land must precede civil Sunday statutes, otherwise such legislation will be loose and below the divine standard.

This agrees exactly with what we have repeatedly said, namely, that Sabbath observance is a question of conscience, and that to attempt to regulate it in any way by civil law is only to attempt to coerce conscience. But notwithstanding the Woman's Christian Temperance Union sees this so clearly it seems determined that Congress shall enact laws interfering in this matter.
