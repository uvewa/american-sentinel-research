THE DAILY TIMES: I see by your issue of November 18, that the American Sabbath Union has been regaling the people of San Jose with the beauties of a Sunday law. What a philosophical mind Union's representative seems to think that because a Sundaly congress was held in Paris, and because similar congresses on the subject in a labor congress in Germany, that we must needs have a Sunday law in this State. This line of reasoning would be about as brilliant as for one who thinks we ought to have a reproduction of Julius Caesar in this State. The idea is too absurd on a par; and if California and the United States should be so unfortunate as to have a Sunday law after the pattern designed by this Rip Van Winkle johnny, it would be well to have some Caesarian duplicated before we start.

The Sabbath Union is a New York institution whose chief aim is a national Sunday law; her doling out the reasons of Congress is skirmishion around the country in search of smaller fish and in the hope to strengthen its position on the main issue. It had as much stated that it is the Sabbath that they want and not merely a Sunday—not a religious Sabbath—is all that it aims to have legalized, but in all the speeches and writings of its representatives, the covert intent of a religious Sabbath is constantly apparent. According to the Times' report, the San Jose effort

children, were counted as petitioners, many of them several times over as members of various associations, yet only about 15,000 could be numbered—less than one-fourth of the whole population. That does not look much as though this could be reckoned as a Christian Nation. And the Constitution was purposely designed to prevent saying anything of the kind, leaving all religion on an absolute equality before the law.

Then it is entertaining the enemies of the Sunday law movement, the speaker is asked to wait "First are the individuals who include a great number and variety of thought. They would strangle every effort that tended to the propagation of the gospel." What has a more crisp way to do with the propagation of the gospel?

Again he says: "There are the Seventh-day Adventists, who are very unreasonable in their opposition, for we make exception of those who for religious scruples would adopt another day for their day of worship." All those who are religious on some other day (by petition and "equally" religious civilization) says "unreasonable." This exemption directly places a premium on religion, by granting Sunday indulgence to religion.

This was upon a performer (or, was it that important ?) all money by the speaker to Judge Terry; he was the only preacher who had decided against the constitutionality of Sunday laws, and he was afterwards shot. Simply by other judge fully dare to follow his example in that kind of decisions. The constitutionality question may be contested as well. This speaker further stated: "in the teeth of his (Judge Terry's) adverse decision, the Legislature of this State passed a Sunday law which was upheld by the Supreme Court."

Yes, but did not the Doctor go on and tell the rest of that bit of history. That the State Sunday law, which was passed "in the teeth" of Judge Terry's decision, took the enforcement of that Sunday law look for nearly twenty years, and was forgotten by almost everybody. Finally about the years 1882-83 some zealous preachers discovered the hidden treasure, and determined to dig it up and have it enforced. Complaints, however, failed to secure more than a very few victims, hardly any of whom were of that class described "the greatest curse the country knows."

"And in the teeth" of this apostolic tiruntus, the people spoke in the most emphatic terms. They voted down the Sunday law by an overwhelming majority. The Legislature of 1883 promptly repealed it, and a subsequent Legislature as promptly squelched an effort to revive it. And moreover, the Sunday has been more deferentially observed without a law than

it was with it, and even the most zealous Sabbath Unionists of them all (Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts) has acknowledged the fact in his book on Sunday observance.

I submit, then, what must be patent to all reasonable minds, that if the American Sabbath Union succeeds in foisting the scheme upon the people of California, it will have to induce the Legislature to violate the express will of a large majority of the people of the State.—*San Jose Daily Times, November 29, 1890.*
