WHERE there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, it is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth will lose something by their silence.—*John Stuart Mill.*

The struggle for religious liberty was first begun when the Apostle Peter and John stood before the Jewish council of elders and rulers, and declared, "whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."—*Ritchie's Struggles for Religious Liberty.*

If the Protestants are not careful they will find the public schools absolutely under the entire satisfaction of the Vatican. Be satisfied with the family, church and Sunday school. If those will not preserve your religion, you are in a bad way, religious teaching, are aids to the Roman conquests in our region and, during the past year, should teach American youth to think.—*Loyal American.*

A commissioner of the Independent quoted Rev. R. T. Miller, pastor of the Fifth Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, as follows upon the question of the Bible in the public schools: "The Bible is the most influential word in the public schools. A Bible-less school is almost as-

suredly a godless school. The Church will attend to the religious work. The school is not the best place in which to teach the Bible. I say this though there is not a chapter or verse that is not written in gold in my heart and mind. The American people want fair play. Therefore take the Bible out and the tax-payers their rights."
