"No matter what some people may say or think," says the *Orthodox Herald*, "the American people will not permit the State to be a Nation that forbid religion."

---

One of the conundrums urged in behalf of a "civil Sabbath" Sunday law in California, is, that while one-fourth of the population are boys between sixteen and twenty-one years of age, only one per cent of them belong to any Christian church.

As Episcopal clergyman and editor, in an important Western city, writes: "I do wish I can circulate THE AMERICAN SENTINEL." Of course his own paper is sound upon the question of the separation of the Bible and religion in the public schools, etc.

According to estimates has introduced a bill into the Reichstag to authorize all soldiers of the German Empire, not only a limited but to acknowledge whatever interest, Catholic thought their offerings could with Bismarck's removal, but it may never pass.

---

Accordingly 15 comments made at the Philadelphia session of the Sabbath Union, the railroads are falling into line in behalf of better Sunday observance. "On the last week of November, the Philadelphia and Reading Road announced that they would come to use coal trains on Sunday." It was also stated that "a settlement, so far as the coal train is concerned on Sunday work, and would be willing as to haul perishable freight could an agreement be made with other roads."

---

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union column of the *Lebanon Route*, a Missouri paper, has the following:—

> The Sabbath question will some that its proper place in the Nation and this discussion is enough to awaken sound conviction throughout the land toward proving civil Sunday statute, otherwise no legislation will be less and below the drive among them.

This agrees exactly with what we have repeatedly said, namely, that Sabbath observance is a question of conscience, and that to attempt to regulate it in any way

by civil law is only to attempt to coerce conscience. But notwithstanding, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union sees this so clearly it seems determined that Congress shall enact laws interfering in this matter.

---

The Watertown *Sentinel* comes to us from Watertown, South Dakota, filled with sound anti-National Reform matter, asking for an exchange, which we gladly grant. The organs of secularism, National Reform are multiplying, and why should not the friends of religious liberty be fully awake to the danger, and fully prepared to meet it in every quarter?

---

Its plea for the "civil Sabbath," the *New York Observer* says: "Take off the yoke, and take the rest out." The New York *Observer* more candidly and possibly better now, says: "It is this 'innocent' convention" that destroys the idea of Sunday being a holy day." And that is just the reason that the *Observer* and the religious press generally, demand the enforcement of Sunday keeping by "civil" law.

---

The Philadelphia Sabbath Association utterly repudiates the so-called sanitary grounds of Sunday observance, and insists on a distinct recognition of Sunday as a Christian institution. It is offended at it by George Ross Buonfono, for saying that they would make greater progress if they would look at the Sabbath from a sanitary standpoint. We must therefore understand that this Association, in demanding Sunday laws and their enforcement, is doing it from a purely religious standpoint.

---

The clergy of San Antonio of all denominations, headed by Bishop Johnston, are stirring up the people on the subject of the "desecration" of Sunday. They held a public meeting, and resolved to ask the Legislature to enact more rigorous laws.

---

The Anglo-Saxon *Churchman* remarks that a "layman who participated in the town of down Sabbath Union Association, moved that the clergy set an example of keeping Sunday by omitting to announce their services in the Sunday papers."

---

The *National* Ever very properly thinks that "it is not the business of the public schools to give a complete education, or even an approximate therefore. If religion should be taught, it should be taught by the Church, where each can be imparted in its own way, and where each can be cared for without interference from the other. The public school is the creature of the State, in this country, is inherently and distinctively republican. And hence all who agree in republican government must be asquiel as establish conditions that

simply conform thereunto. And so like schools being creatures of the State, which is itself secular, must be of a secular character; and their secular character must not be tampered with or encroached upon to any religious body, Catholic or Protestant."

The Christmas number of the Oakland, California, *Times*, has the following:—

> Even in New England where the old Puritan stock most rigidly and prayerfully deny Christmas and Sunday recreation together, the people now very generally celebrate these two ancient customs and in much the same general and yet partly religious manner. It must needs betters as and as distinct in the world why it should be otherwise. There is no authority for observing the fourth of December as the birth of Christ any where in Scripture, both were first established as requirements of the State Church in early centuries. The Church has always regarded both with on forlish recognition of the denominational holidays the subject observation, for their beneficent character and excellent uses and Protestantism with a peculiar reason to take a similar view. But the State has no just right to enforce to others the observance of one festival than the other—Sunday than Christmas.

Even the Oakland *Times* says the American Sabbath Union has still much work to do in California to overcome the effect of the revolt of the people for the entomb-dried "civil Sabbath" legislation which has been prepared for them at the Sabbath Union headquarters.
