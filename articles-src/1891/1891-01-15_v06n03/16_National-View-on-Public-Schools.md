THE National View very properly thinks that "it is not the business of the public schools to give a complete education, or even an approximation thereto. If religion should be taught, it should be taught by the Church, where each can be represented in its own way, and where each can be cared for without interference from the other. The public school is the creature of the State, in this country, is inherently and distinctively republican. And hence all who agree in republican government must be supplied with an education that simply conforms therewith. And so the schools being creatures of the State, which is itself secular, must be of a secular character; and their secular character must not be tampered with or encroached upon by any religious body, Catholic or Protestant.
