IN his plea for the "civil Sabbath," Mr. Crafts says: "Take the religion out and you take the rest out." The New York Observer more candid and possibly less wise, says: "It is this 'innocent recreation' that destroys the idea of Sunday being a holy day." And that is just the reason that the Observer and the religious press generally, demand the enforcement of Sunday keeping by "civil" law.
