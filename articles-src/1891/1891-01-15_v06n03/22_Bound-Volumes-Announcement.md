## Bound Volumes.

THOSE wishing bound volumes of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of 1890, should send us their names at once, as only a limited number will be bound, and orders will be filled in the order in which they are received. The prices will be the same as last year, namely, heavy manilla paper $1.50, half roan (cloth, with leather back), $2.50.
