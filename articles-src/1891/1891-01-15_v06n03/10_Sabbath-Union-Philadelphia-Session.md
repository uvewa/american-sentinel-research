ACCORDING to statements made at the Philadelphia session of the Sabbath Union, the railroads are falling into line in behalf of better Sunday observance. "On the last week of November, the Philadelphia and Reading Road announced that they would cease to run coal trains on Sunday." It was also stated that "some of the largest Trunk Lines are cutting down Sunday work, and would be willing to haul only perishable freight could an agreement be made with other roads."
