OUR friend, the Rev. Dr. Osborn, seems to have got into a newspaper controversy upon the above subject, with one Rev. George Shipman Payson. This crossing of steel upon its by two reverend gentlemen, on a Baptist and one a Presbyterian, in the columns of the *Kremzer's Baptist paper.* So far, Dr. Osborn has got the better of the argument. We quote the following from Dr. Osborn's letter:

> We profoundly believe that our freedoms of other times are not established against all present or future dangerous growths; the most dangerous by far, becoming steadily more and more formidable in many States, and become put forward to an influential alliance of Howard University and its denominational and so influential ecclesiastical bodies as the Synod of New York, and other organizations joining in.

> For there may teach religion in schools and supposed by general use, the opponents at once set up for President religion of the bodies comparing that reference, the papist religion of the New York alone, under our system of Government by the most important, will despots the common school altogether of majesty of influence in this State.

> As soon as religions doctrine is taught in schools, the world, which if becomes the most important in the watchfully. Under our system of Government, these who oppose one doctrine have equal rights with those who are the followers of another. It would be so honor then national that the adherent of each doctrine is perpetually pegging away at the school-house door demanding attention. It would be necessary to comply with the demand of the advocates of either, and leave out the advocates of the other doctrine. Now, which would it be?

> If the Government should attempt to answer that question in favor of any one doctrine, there would be a cruel religious war upon its hands wherein the band of brother would be raised against brother. Upon this question the views of the Baptist are far more broad, more liberal, and more sensible than the views of the Presbyterian brother. We believe that the Baptist people have been accused of being narrow-minded, close communion, and of trying to get into heaven with our heart but upon this question, under the lead of Dr. Osborn, the Baptists have taken that liberal position that is notably the

basis of them all in the public conscience. Isn't it staggering that these men will persistently hold forth their pretensions to a civil Sabbath when they can but barely get a complete sentence in reference to it without showing it to be religious and nothing else? And it is yet more staggering that there are so many people who think so much of the form of a "civil Sabbath" pretense betrayed in such blistering pretensions.

Their position is not only liberal but is a position of patriotism, worthy of a great church people.

In our judgment it is not yet time to let us take people into heaven or hell. Religion is a matter of conscience convictions. We can not see nor let us be citizens. It is of his duties to his Maker. Our creeds are under the jurisdiction of the State, but the Christianity of the people of the State is in their own hands—is an inalienable importance, and far too sacred to be mitted by any religious guard. Dr. Osborn is right.—*Osborn Howell.*
