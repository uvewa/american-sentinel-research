## Motto

Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political.—Thomas Jefferson.

## Quotations

WHEN there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, it is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth will lose something by their silence.—John Stuart Mill.

THE struggle for religious liberty was already begun when the Apostles Peter and John stood before the Jewish council of elders and rulers, and declared, "whether it be right, in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."—Early Struggles for Religious Liberty.

If the Protestants are not careful they will find the public schools Romanized to the entire satisfaction of the Vatican. Be satisfied with the family, church and Sunday school. If these will not preserve your religion, you are in a bad way. This agitation for the Bible in schools and religious teaching, are aids to the Roman conspiracy to capture and destroy the schools that teach American youth to think.—Loyal American.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Independent quotes Rev. H. T. Miller, pastor of the Fifth Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, as follows upon the question of the Bible in the public schools: "The Bible is the most inflammable wood in the public schools. A Bibleless school is not necessarily a godless school. The Church will attend to the religious work. The school is not the best place in which to teach the Bible. I say this though there is not a chapter or verse that is not written in gold in my heart and mind. The American people want fair play. Therefore take the Bible out and give the tax-payers their rights."
