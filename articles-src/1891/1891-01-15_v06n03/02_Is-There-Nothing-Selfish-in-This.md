THE third article published by Mr. Crafts in his series in the *Christian Statesman* is under the inquiry, "Are Sabbath laws consistent with liberty?" and he claims that they are not only consistent with it but essential to it; to civil liberty, religious liberty, and personal liberty. He says that centuries ago the Dark Ages were caused by putting rights in the word "Religious Liberty;" and that this means to those that raised it, liberty to do that others might have liberty to pray, and "there is nothing selfish in that." Then he says this well-meaning mother word—"Civil Liberty," and that this means "liberty for its life to multiply its fruits, that succeeding generations might have the liberty of self-government;" and "there is nothing selfish in that." And now, Mr. Crafts in his Sunday-law campaign, professes to be searching for the true motive of the other watchword—"Civil Liberty."

But where has there been in all his arguments any recognition of the right of liberty to do that others might have any benefit from anything that he does or proposes? Why, he does not even exercise the liberty to talk an hour, not even on Sunday, without a previous guarantee of ten dollars in cash, and it must be spot cash, too! And "there is nothing selfish in that," oh, no! That is a personal liberty. But if a poor man should work all day on Sunday for $1.50 or $2.00 to obtain the necessary means to support his needy family, that is such a heinous crime that he must be visited by a penalty of a hundred dollars and he is left with its meaning—

[17]

to go to the spring leader who will prosecute him. And "there is nothing selfish in that." No, no, all that is personal liberty!

Next, he criticises the New York *World* for saying that "the State has nothing to do with the sanctity of Sunday except to protect every citizen equally in his right to use the holiday as seems best to him," and says that "if we use Sunday equally tell it to the theatre-goers and to the actors who have repeatedly pleaded for their rests." "Yes, and the 'Pearl of Days' says that the saloon-keepers also are pleased for their rest-day. Now, it is one of the fundamental principles in the argument of the Sunday-law advocates that the object of the Sabbath is to give physical rest in order that the individual might be better prepared for work on the other days of the week. This argues that all occupations are equally meritorious, and that it is proper that the actors, the saloon-keepers, the gamblers and all such should be granted a day of rest to return to their several energies in order that they may be better fitted for their several occupations through the other nights or days of the week.

Next he says:

> Percy Major Rankin of Elmhurst, New Jersey, made a great promise to concentrate with the movement in favor of the enforcement of the Sabbath, when . . . he said: ". . . those who do wrong on Sabbath are done an injustice by those who are good on the Sabbath. I have noticed in going into our cities often on the Sabbath that frequently a man does often more business on Sunday than on any other two days in the week."

That is to say: That a man who wants to keep Sunday and be religious, is so afraid that the man who does not keep Sunday, cannot do it because he is afraid he will lose a chance in a few cents. And therefore this chance must be secured to him by compelling everybody else to do as he wants to do. And "there is nothing selfish in that," of course.

Again, this argues that the man who wants to keep Sunday and be religious, is willing to only so far as it may be assured by the Nation that it shall not cost him anything. And "there is nothing selfish in that." No, no.

[18]

Yes, it is true, Mayor Rankin did enunciate a great principle—his great principle of selfishness—which is the basis of the Sunday laws.

Again says Mr. Crafts:

> An advocate of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair says that "the Subatarians ought to be at liberty to make himself at home on Sunday in this the most wonderful city."

And to this he replies:

> But why be so generous to Christians who work six days in the week about the Fair have "liberty to be at home on that same day?"

Why, then can we have that liberty easy at once. What to hinder the managers of the Fair simply employing people on Sunday who have not worked the other days of the week and about that Fair? that would be easy enough. We know a street-car company who does that very thing. It would be perfectly easy for the managers of the Fair to let all the people who work six days in the week about the Fair have liberty to stay at home on Sunday. But would that never satisfy Mr. Crafts and his fellow workers. That is not the kind of personal liberty they want to see established. The only kind of personal liberty that they know anything about is that in which everybody is compelled to do as they want to do. And "there is nothing selfish in that." No, no.
