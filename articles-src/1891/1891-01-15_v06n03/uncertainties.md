# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 15, 1891 (v06n03)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from 8 scanned page images (/tmp/as1891n03-1.png through /tmp/as1891n03-8.png). The scan quality is fair but the small print size in two-column format makes many individual words and phrases difficult to read with full confidence. Multiple passes were made on each page.

## Pages 2-4 (pages 18-20)

### Article: "Shall the State Teach Morals?"

- **Issue:** The letter from the Bloomington pastor is partially obscured and the exact wording is uncertain in several places.
- **Confidence:** LOW for the quoted letter text.

- **Location:** Page 3, left column

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — General argument is clear but specific word choices in several sentences are uncertain.

- **Location:** Page 4, left column, about Dr. Schaff
- **Issue:** The paragraph about Dr. Schaff's "connecting links" and the quotes from Madison contain several words that are difficult to read at this resolution.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

- **Location:** Page 4, right column, Madison quotes
- **Transcribed as:** "I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises."

## Page 4-5 (pages 20-21)

### Article: "Striking Parallels"

- **General note:** This article contains a side-by-side comparison table format ("LOOK ON THIS PICTURE" / "THEN ON THIS") where historical and modern quotes are placed in parallel. The extremely small text in this tabular format makes much of the content very difficult to read.
- **Confidence:** LOW for most of the parallel comparison content. The general structure and intent is clear, but specific quoted text within the comparison columns is largely uncertain.

- **Location:** Attribution at end
- **Transcribed as:** "WILLIAM MAY."
- **Confidence:** LOW — The author's name at the end of this article is difficult to read clearly. It could be "WILLIAM MAY" or another name.

## Summary

The primary challenge with this issue is the small print size in the scanned images combined with fair (not excellent) scan quality. Articles with longer paragraphs of body text (pages 2-4 especially) contain multiple passages where individual words are uncertain. The overall meaning and argument of each article is generally clear, but word-level accuracy cannot be guaranteed for many passages. A review against higher-resolution scans or original documents is strongly recommended.
