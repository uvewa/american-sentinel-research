THE "Pitcairn Souvenir," the story of a missionary ship recently launched at San Francisco, for service on the Pacific Ocean, is a most interesting work and a triumph of the printer's art. It is beautifully illustrated and is neatly printed on fine paper. The prices are 25 cents, 50 cents, and $1.00, according to binding. Orders should be addressed to International Sabbath-school Association, Oakland, California.
