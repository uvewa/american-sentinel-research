ARCHBISHOP IRELAND, of St. Paul, in the National Educational Association, favored the theory of compulsory education, and also insisted that the public money should be used for the support of the parochial schools of religious denominations. His solution of the school problem is "to permeate the regular State school with the religion of a majority of the children of the land," and then it "pay for the secular instruction given in denominational schools according to results" attained." This was rejected by very deferent and wholly impracticable theory. The truth is, that there is no religion of the majority, in this country, even with that of the minority, in distinction from that of the minority, in this country. The State, as such, has nothing to do with the religious beliefs of the people one way or the other, beyond affording them as just

and equal protection in the exercise of their religious rights, no matter what may be their religion, and no matter whether it be of one or the Nation.

What is in regard to popular education is to provide, at the public expense, adequate facilities for the secular instruction of the children of the land, and leave all persons and all religious bodies free to provide religious education to do so in their own way and to pay for this out. Their political system admits of no other solution of the school question so far as the State is concerned; and when Catholics and Protestants come to this reasonable conclusion, and content themselves with it, they will see things as they are, and have no school question to quarrel over between themselves. All efforts to make the State a party to their religious preferences are simply efforts to get the State out of its proper sphere, and must at last, and should, rest in failure.
