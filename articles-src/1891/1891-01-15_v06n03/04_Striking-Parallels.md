Give men the power to do evil, and they will be just as certain to exercise it, as the boy is to use his first jack-knife; if for nothing else, he will do it out of curiosity to know how it works; and men will generally find motives fully as powerful as this to prompt them to use their "sword of authority." Moral:—Don't play with edge tools, nor leave them where they can be "played with" by any one else.

The leaders of the National Reform movement are, whether fortunately or unfortunately, many-sided, I had almost said two-faced, in stating the objects which they hope to attain, and the process necessary to secure them. To those who are conservative, and with prudent foresight, warn against the evils religious legislation would bring; they reply, "Surely you can trust us; are we not the representatives of God? Do you not think that God will appreciate the compliment we pay him, by enthroning him in the Constitution of this noble land, sufficiently to prevent evil-minded men abusing the power we ask for? He will not allow those who serve him in the right way, to be injured in any way."

And some are deceived by such assertions. But others, who have an object in view themselves, are approached in a different manner; there is not the reticence with them that is necessary in influencing the unselfish, patriotic heart, so the words are less guarded, and it gives rise to "clashing voices," sometimes, aye, often, clashing statements by the same voice, and not so very far apart, either. Now, as it is sound philosophy to accept the experience of mankind, recorded in history, as the best guide in all important matters in which we cannot be guided by our own practical, personal experience, we present a few parallels from history, asking the readers if human nature has undergone any change for the better since the fall of man? and if like causes will not still produce like effects?
