GIVE an evil to evil, and they will be just as certain to exercise it, as the boy is to use his first jack-knife; it is natural to them; they know it, they only want to know how it works; and men will generally find facilities fully as powerful as this to prompt them to use their "seven edged tools, nor leave them where they can be 'played with'" by any one else.

The leaders of the National Reform movement are, whether fortunately or unfortunately, many things. I had said two-faced, in stating the objects they hope to attain, by the aspirations necessary to secure them. To those who champion law and order, and individual right, wars against the evil religion legislation would bring; they reply, "Surely you trust God that; are not they instruments of God? Do you not think that God himself will do something—we put not him, by enthroning him in the Constitution of this noble land, sufficiently to prevent evil-minded men abusing the power we ask for? He will not allow that which serves him in the right way, to be injured in any way."

Some are deceived by such assurances. But others, who have an object in view themselves, are apprehend it in a different manner; there is not the reference with this to the inclinations. Sounding the unselfish, patriotic heart, so the words "are less guarded;" and it gives rise to statements unsustainable. A summary, say, often clashing statements by the some voices and not so very far apart, either. Now, as it is noted philosophy to accept the experiences of mankind, recorded in history, as the best guide in all important matters in which we can learn, let us, from our own practical, personal experience, we present a few parallels from history, asking the reader if human nature has undergone

any change for the better since the fall of man? and if like causes will not still produce like effects?

LOOK ON THIS PICTURE. | THEN ON THIS.

"Anti-Sabbatarian." "It is expressive of the basest ingratitude to God for the people, and the whole Nation for disregarding his Sabbath." | "In Sabbatarian said," "It is in disregard to God and . . . for the people that the whole Nation should be punished for disregarding his Sabbath . . ."

Their National Ideal July Fourth Oration—1788: "I hold this to be a Government founded by Jesus Christ to teach." "Verash 9 la dons." | "Our call for a day of prayer, our God of our brethren, so let us know that they feared it . . ."

*A. H. Beecher Company Legal.* | *1861, Charles Moore of the State.*

The badinage of the Churchman's says that Christianity once destroyed a great nation; and, for the purpose of controlling the State, the Clergy adopt same doctrine. | The Clergy adopt another; that is capitalism in regard to their waning power. Those who are determined to have a fair Government, must take a broader view to conquer the world, and command the law.

"Vengeance of the Son of God." "Capital punishment." "Death shall end his life." Said of Sabbath-breakers. | "The civil rights of the Son of Man, he that regardeth not God's law . . . let him suffer death for criminal institution."

*National Reform Convention, at Saratoga, N. Y. Endorsed by the W. C. T. U. of America.* | . . .

Some of the wisest political and philosophical men of France, Mirabeau, Sieyes, and philosophical governments — not the Church—represented by absence of opposition to the Sunday advocates . . . | Some philosophy will be the advising principles . . .

. . . | . . .

All who are posted will understand the way and the reason for the agitation by the American Sabbath Union . . . | . . .

The National Reformers of Government of France, Switzerland, this generation produce that effect. . . . | . . .
