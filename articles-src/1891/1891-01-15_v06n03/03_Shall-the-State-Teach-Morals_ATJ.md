THE pastor of a church in Bloomington, Ill., sends us the following letter:—

> No one has had the goodness to send me the paper you mentioned. The *American Sentinel*. I assent to the interest in the great questions of Sabbath observance, and of religion in the common schools, and our convictions are clear and strong that these things are so—in first ground before these schools.

The book could take a positive character and not only herself according as follows, confronted and illustrated by hundreds of the modern nations of entire American communities, mostly. Then shall the editor indorse them. Then shall this institution too, concerned with by topics, above all, with day topics, above all, above advantages, trickery, and moral and physical pollution. Then shall be taught that we should be upright, forgiving, generous, and truthful; that we should lead lives of industry, sobriety, and frugality; and finally, that we should be inspired with sentiments which ennoble society, and such as contribute to our institute for itself that which human nature is apt to institute for itself.

We appreciate the good sense of Thos. B. Sextravish, expressed by our correspondent, for we feel that he does not fully appreciate our position. The plan that he proposes, if carried out, would be a good thing; we might and shall we think, fortunately so. The most pressing examinations by Mr. Hoffman are good. All this, and such much more, should be taught to every child; but it does not follow that these things should be done by the State. Moral precepts cannot be taught dogmatically, and would be of little if thus were taught.

Every moral precept must be based upon some acknowledged authority. Teach other children on matters of duty; that these things must always

[19]

tell the truth, and must always deal honestly with their fellow-men, and the question immediately arises in their minds, Why must we do this? To answer this question in all should be honorably, a genuine path to the law of God, and consequently teach religion. But this is not contemplated in Mr. Hoffman's scheme, neither is it proper for the State to do so.

It has been repeatedly shown in these columns, and it is admitted by very many, that the State cannot teach religion. It has never been commissioned to teach religion, and it is impossible for it to do so. But on the other hand, to teach children that they must be truthful, and that they must be honest, involves the giving of reasons for these precepts; but of the two true reasons can be given, there remains but one to this; that is to quote the familiar maxim that "honesty is the best policy." But this is an abominable principle and is ought to be exploded. Everybody would probably admit that as a general rule "honesty is the best policy." But unless the individual is taught that there is some principle involved, that he is accountable to some superior being, to some authority of and above himself, higher than his fellows, he will be constantly finding what he will deem exceptions to this general rule, and with despair from it whenever in his judgment one of these exceptions will apply, and consequently, for the time being, dishonesty becomes the best policy.

To undertake to teach morals, while eliminating from them all divine authority, is to teach that policy is the criterion, the standard of righteousness; not only that it is a standard, but that it is impossible of any other standard; and it matters not how many examples of good men these examples may be surpassed, every man is apt to feel that he is as good as his fellows, and will be able to judge of righteousness to shape a standard of right for himself; and this standard is sure to be warped and biased by his own selfish interests.

Every man can find a thousand excuses for departing from the straight path of rectitude, of right dealing, in order to attain or save his own interests. And it is just what men do when they forget God and turn away from Him. We have abundant evidence of this in the testimony of the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans. There he tells how men forget God, and exalt themselves in his stead. And what must always be the effect of teaching the utilitarianism suggested by mere corruption. All these things of which Mr. Hoffman says should be taught in the home, in the church, and in the industrial school, and not in the public school. For when they are taught they should be supported by the moral law and an appeal to that one cannot properly be made in the public school. Again, Mr. Hoffman says, that the

[20]

children should be taught to subdue nature, and moral and physical pollution. It is easy enough to teach children to abstain from physical pollution for sanitary reasons, but without religion how can they know what moral pollution is? How shall they understand moral pollution unless it be defined by religion? Our Saviour taught something of the nature of moral pollution in the Sermon on the Mount, but that is entirely outside of, and beyond, anything which the State can properly teach. It involves an examination of the motives of the heart, and this is beyond the jurisdiction of the State. The Saviour showed that hatred is a violation of the sixth commandment, and that lust is a violation of the seventh; but all this is taught in that religion which the public school illustrates and emphasizes the proposition which explains the difference between the two positions. By what shall the appeal to impose upon the mind of the child the fact that he must not entertain evil thoughts? There is absolutely nothing to which he can appeal, without teaching religion. And as before remarked, to teach anything of the kind must result in one of two things: either the teacher in the public school will teach religion and will appeal to the Scriptures to sustain this teaching, or he will establish a human standard, which in the mind of the child, will be the highest authority, and will consequently not only fail in elevating the child and purifying his soul and heart, but will place him in a position that it will be impossible for the teachings of the gospel to reach and elevate him at any subsequent time, because he will be so able to comprehend that there is nothing more objectionable or more desirable than his own conceptions of right.

These are the religio-political institutions of to-day. Every argument or equivalency that they can think of is used to show that Christianity is an integral part of our laws, the recognition as such by the Government a duty, and its haltered to institutions entitled to special protection as such. But these ideas are the gratuitous inventions of the friends of Church and State. It was far from the thoughts of the statesmen who established our national government to give countenance to any such political ideas. Jefferson denied that Christianity was ever rightfully a part of the common law, of even English, much less of this country where no person's has ever been acknowledged religious liberty.

The three "connecting links between Church and State," which Dr. Schaff would establish, are marriage, Sunday laws, and religion in public schools. But the truth is that the first of these is not a religious relation at all (any more than is plowing corn, or selling a bushel of oats, but it is simply a status entered into by a purely civil agreement); and the other two are entirely outside the sphere of our political system, as has positively been proved by quotations from the writings of Madison himself, which are employed by the declarers of the American system.

On account of the "strong bias toward the old error" that there must be "some sort of alliance between civil Government and religion," Madison says:

> "Every new and successful example, therefore, of the perfect separation between civil and religious matters, of the forms ecclesiastical and civil matters, of a connection." It is absolutely impossible to have a "perfect separation" and yet have connected link. Consequently Dr. Schaff's "connecting links" notwithstanding, it is only in the direction of Madison's simpler letter.

The truth is, however, that Madison took the pains to express himself on the "connecting link" of religion being taught in the public schools. In reference to religious professorships, he wrote to Edward Everett as follows:

> . . . with a sectarian pertaining to religious instruction, the legal establishment of a relationship . . . it would be an arena of theological strife . . . in a country of such a various creeds of sects, it would in its worst shape, it may incur, for a time at least, the many dangers of intolerance formation, if not danger. The last difficulty was thought more manageable than either of the others. On this view of the subject the state allowed a school a theological professorship and sectarian seminaries with a relationship.

This imputation of "intolerant tendencies" if religion is not taught, Dr. Schaff surely felt; for he says "a total separation of Church and State is an impossibility, Church and State is an impossibility, unless we want to be a Christian people," and then mentions religion in the public schools as one of the "links" which can be "dispensed with." Madison, however, thought quite differently on the subject. He not only opposed having religion

taught in the public schools because it was outside the sphere of the State, but he always claimed, and with good reason, that it was injurious to religion as well.

"The difficulty," said he, "of reconciling the Christian mind to the absence of religious tuition from a universally established by law, and at the common estimation, is probably best set in those with right. The settled opinion here is that a religious institution is a voluntary support, the government, and exempt from its cognizance; that a connection between them is injurious to both; that there are cases in the human breast which insure the prosperity of religion without the aid of law." And in another letter the year after he said: "We are teaching the world the great truth . . . that religion and its foundation is in greater purity and liberty, than with them, the toils of government."

These same principles founded Sunday legislation, and, accordingly, Madison did not hesitate to express his opinion as to the "perfect equality" of all denominations. In a letter to Dr. De La Motta, a Jewish clerk, he says: "Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights which it secures to every religious sect." Then if the Sabbatarians, who form "seven-tenths of one per cent," have "perfect equality" with the denominations a law compelling all to rest on Sunday is equally unjust with a law compelling all to rest on Saturday.

So, too, if the Jews have a "perfect equality" with Christians, and Madison would emphasize that they do come "fully within the scope of these observations," then the Jews have exactly the same right that any Christian has to have the religion of his choice taught in the public schools, as have the Christians that he is different. They have the same right to have the principles of antichrist taught in the schools, that the Christians have to have the "uncertain principles of Christianity" taught therein. This we see how the schools would become the arenas of theological strife to see all these occupy equally and at the same time have any religious service whatever in the public schools. From this it is evident that Dr. Schaff's "connecting links" are as fatally opposed to the American political system, as expounded by the principal author of the grand work in which is the embodiment of that system. Jefferson's body asserted the following sweeping statement, when speaking of religious tolerations: "I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises."

Nor did those statesmen extend this equality only to the various religions. It was universal equality. No. 1—

doctrine was to be taught in the schools. But were any religious laws of any kind to be enacted that were not equally acceptable to both unbelievers and professors of religion.

There is not a single act of the Government worthy, study, or reverence of any sort that the State has a right to force it upon a single citizen. It is the inalienable right and "it is the duty of every man," Madison, "to render to the Creator such homage, and such only, as he believes to be acceptable to him." Then the unbeliever in the Christian religion has a right, by no means to be ignored or regarded less of the institutions of the Christian religion, than could the Christian be compelled to regard the rites and institutions of Judaism or heathenism, and both equally the right to use their time as they will, but in that use, they must not, and they do not, in any way, interfere with the equal rights of others. Madison says again: "All men are to be considered as entering into society on equal conditions; as relinquishing no more, nor more, and therefore, retaining no less, one than another, of their natural rights; no man's religion of a "perfect equality," and the American system as a "perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters."

The inevitable conclusion must be that the religio-political writers in asserting that "a total separation of Church and State is an impossibility," are mistaken; and that the American political system, when fairly carried out, is a total separation between Church and State. So that not only do not cease to be a Christian people, but "every new and successful example of that perfect separation sequence is showing that religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together," and the American system of Church and State advocates to the contrary, notwithstanding.
