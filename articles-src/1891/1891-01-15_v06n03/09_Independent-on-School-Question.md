What the State should do in regard to popular education is to provide, at the public expense, adequate facilities for the secular instruction of the children of the land, and leave all persons who wish to make provision for their religious education to do so in their own way and to pay the bills thereof. Our political system admits of no other solution of the school question so far as the State is concerned; and when Catholics and Protestants come to this reasonable conclusion, and content themselves with it, they will see things as they are, and have no school question to settle as between themselves. All efforts to make the State a party to their religious preferences are simply efforts to get the State out of its proper sphere, and must at last, and should, end in failure.
