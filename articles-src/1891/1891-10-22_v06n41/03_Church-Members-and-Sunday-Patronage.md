LET the church members and ministers refuse to patronize Sunday cars and Sunday newspapers if they believe that day sacred; let the former in their homes, and the latter from their pulpits, educate the people to reverence what they believe sacred, but let these ministers not be allowed to put upon Congress and the courts the work for which they are paid.
