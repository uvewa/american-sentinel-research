ACCORDING to a government regulation, effective the 8th inst., no freight trains are to be dispatched on Sundays and holidays in Belgium. The regulations would into partial practice last June, but it was only to be operative at the discretion of the railroad authorities. The idea was to make the innovation gradual, but hereafter a rigid adherence to it will be enforced.

COMMENTING upon the outrageous Sunday arrests made some weeks ago in this city, the *Los Angeles Churchman*—

> ...yet some good, but mistaken, Christian people are trying to get California to enact a similar cruel and unjust law. The Constitution of this great and good state the Lord himself seemed to design was— "No, say: Government has not 'a religious opinion,' which, it seems, they are the parties most interested."

The editor of the *Churchman*, Rev. Thomas Haskins, D. D., is rector of Christ Church, Los Angeles, Cal.

A FRIEND in Montana writes thus:—

"I sat down to write an order for THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and incidentally examined the paper, and thought occurred to me that there were some of our prominent members near that subscriber to have a set of that also acceptance of religious liberty. After the impulse of the moment had set and in about three hours obtained twenty sine trial subscription for our ministers in advance."

The SENTINEL has recently been doing similar work, and the result is a very gratifying increase in the subscription list of THE SENTINEL. Our friends here owe most grateful thanks for the substantial assistance rendered, in increasing the circulation of the only paper devoted to the defense of the United States Constitution as it is, and so far as regards religious and religious toleration.

In replying to an editorial in the Boston *Star* relative to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the *Christian Advocate, of* this city, says in the religious paper of which he is the editor: "While we are opposed to the other day, we are bound to stand by those who favor opening the World's Fair on Sunday, because in that matter it is a question of the observance of a day of rest or of a religious day of worship."

The Rev. Dr. Lewis, the best known Seventh day preacher in the United States and worthy of his consequence for ability and learning with which at the clergy, says in the religious paper of which he is the editor: "While we are opposed to this other day, we are bound to stand by those who favor opening the World's Fair on Sunday, because in that matter it is a question of the observance of a day of rest of a religious day of worship."

In this the *Advocate's* real has got the better of its discretion. Rev. Dr. Lewis never used the designation entitled to him, neither did it appear in his paper, the *Outlook*, but in the *Advent Recorder*. The author was Rev. W. C. Titsworth, who subsequently published over his own signature a note in this paper, saying:—

> Will you kindly allow me to mention the responsibility which belongs to the writer of the article on Mr. Piatto, and probably does not present many recommendations. Not having a copy of the Recorder, but having a reviewer has published a criticism which may not represent me to be correct.

The *Advocate* ought to correct its statements and should be more careful in the future. Sunday-closing capital should not be manufactured from whole cloth.

The *Chicago Journal* remarks that there is something almost pathetic, and yet not entirely devoid of ironic fun, in the prayerful efforts of the dear ladies of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union to exhilarate, extenerate and drive away Willard's allegation that the bodiless of a real cure for drunkenness was boomed by the press simply to hurt the Prohibition Party. It appears at length to have dawned upon the minds of these ladies that holding a big cure for drunkenness is not exactly in line with a movement for radical temperance reform." "The trouble with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is that it is working more at politics now than at its temperance work."

"RAV, did you ever notice what an evil noise it makes to saw store-wood on Sundays?"

And have you ever noticed that the noise is tenfold worse when the fellow who saws the wood hasn't belong to your church, and possibly does not recognize the sacred rights of the day? Then, if he happens to keep on some other day, the seventh, for instance, the noise becomes absolutely unbearable. It is wonderful what a microscope bigotry is. Why, only if we should close our eye to the roasting machines operated on Sunday, by Jews in Brooklyn, we should disturb a whole congregation of people in another building! Intolerance is a mighty magnifier of sound.

The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor Committee on Sunday Closing of the Columbian Exposition has sent a circular to the several State and Territorial Executive Committees, calling upon them to exert their influence to secure the decision of the Commissioners in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday. As a practical means, it suggests that the State Executive Committees should seek to influence the State Commissioners from their own State, not only by published legislation, but by private interviews. It is expected that the State and District Conventions discuss the question in their public meetings, care being taken that the matter be presented in a strong, and enthusiastic manner. The suggestion is also made that an effort be requested to "secure the passage by Congress of a bill forbidding Sunday opening. We would not insist upon the application, but the disposition manifested by both the V. P. E. and E. and the C. E. T., to disturb, not only to the world, but to the church, it certainly to be regarded the truth that Isaiah 3:12 has direct reference to them in these organizations: "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O, my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of the paths." This describes the situation.

THE editor of the *Twentieth Century* says in his letter of the 17th ult.:—

> ...We expect to spend last Saturday and to-day in Toronto, Canada, and to see how live a spirit is our new liberated Canadian neighbors are in making to read. Not a store or shop of any kind is allowed to be open on Sunday in Ontario. In the city not even only one railroad train is allowed to run on Sundays. Only one railroad train is allowed to run, and that arrives in the evening, and no unloading of casks of water can be bought. Nothing except medicine of the kind is open any day on Sunday or church. In Sunday the city appears deserted of its inhabitants, and this is what we want here. pleasures are had. If one is rich, however, he may keep all that he may have in his own house, and may order drinks to his own taste. Religion can also has made a history for us those here who happens to enjoy going to church, walking about dressed up, and taking naps.

It is the same old story; Sunday laws always appears to oppress the weak.

The *United Presbyterian* published in his city says:—

> The United Presbyterians published in the various towns in the vicinity of Frostburg, in this county, take proper cognizance of Sabbath observance, and the attention of the party is convicted; a third interesting; the cause they have best served has the former habit here been making their making which the parties most it.

It would be well if all this communism, if not grand grave main argument, religion "under whatever guise their presence liberty," "under whatever guise."
