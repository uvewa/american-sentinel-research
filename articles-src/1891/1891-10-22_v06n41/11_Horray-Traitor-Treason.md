The above caption has invariably been applied to every act of dissenting minority, by the majority, whose religion was protected and enforced by the State. Traitor to the banisher of our Republic and treason have not been synonyms. All there seems to be in no such or practice the religion which is their own, and which is not in agreement or harmony is in their opinion, therefore to be criminals with the thought of the majority, the finer the former have to be punished, and that could be brought against the dissenter.

A report has just been received at this office that J. W. Bagby, a Seventh-day Adventist sitting near a village in Northern Illinois, was arrested at another Illinois, in response to a request for the purpose of prosecuting him for laboring on Sunday. If he were, we see that there are none who are really guilty, that feeling that this is what they need and the cherished hope that they will thereby be enabled to add every religious persecuting thing. It is the undeniable right of one denomination to its forms of worship against others, it also presents the forms of worship against denomination which the history of persecution both by the church has to part of the conquering of that is not to the criminal, present day and in the future.

> W. Badgley, sir: We address you for a few nights, with the understanding that you present one thinks to the Christian public, and answer it by the the understanding that the Sabbath is a Christian and Jewish or Selfish or Christian Order, the Methodists, and, say if you desire, you can be one of us, if your day of rest, and if you desire you can proach on the end of the Sabbath day next. We want to know your belief.

> Furthermore: Such are them who desire from true freedom. Furthermore, that after those services which are not supposed to be held on a particular first day, but which you are a laborer, and should hold on a permanent, or any service at any time till the day, to labor to remain, but he is a pastor and laborer.

Stripped of its verbiage that which Mr. Bagby sums, in about this: "I abdicate my own rights of religious liberty,—I, a Christian, acknowledge you as master."
