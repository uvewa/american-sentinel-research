THE Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor Committee on Sunday Closing of the Columbian Exposition has issued a circular to the several State and Territorial Executive Committees, calling upon them to exert their influence to secure the decision of the Commissioners in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday. As a practical means, it suggests that each State Executive Committee should seek to influence the State Commissioners from their own State, not only by public meetings, but by private interviews. It is urged, also, that the State and District Conventions discuss the question in their public meetings, care being taken that the matter be presented in a strong, clear and enthusiastic manner. The suggestion is also made that an effort be organized to "secure the passage by Congress of a bill forbidding Sunday opening. We would not insist upon the application, but the disposition manifested by both the Y. P. S. C. E. and the W. C. T. U. to dictate, not only to the world, but to the church, is certainly suggestive of the thought that Isaiah 3:12 has direct reference to these two organizations: "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O, my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths." This describes the situation exactly.
