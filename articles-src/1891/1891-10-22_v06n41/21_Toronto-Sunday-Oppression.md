THE editor of the Twentieth Century says in his issue of the 17th ult.:—

> I had occasion to spend last Sunday week in Toronto, Canada, and to see how quiet a city of two hundred thousand inhabitants can be made by religious rule. Not a horse-car is allowed to run. Not a store or shop of any kind is allowed to be open. Not a newspaper is allowed to be printed. Only one railroad train is allowed to pass through the town. Not a postage stamp, or cigar, or glass of soda water can be bought. Few persons are seen on the street except in going to or from church. On Sunday the city appears deserted of inhabitants. If one is poor, no opportunities for pleasure are had. If one is rich, however, he may drive about in a carriage, or if a guest at a hotel, he may order drinks to his room. Religious rule has made Sunday a terror to the poor, unless one happens to enjoy going to church, walking about the quiet streets, reading, or sleeping.

It is the same old story; Sunday laws always operate to oppress the weak.
