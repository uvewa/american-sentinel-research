THE United Presbyterian published in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, says:—

> Some of the larger towns in the vicinity of Pittsburg are showing an awakening on the subject of Sabbath desecration. Slowly and insidiously customs at variance alike with the civil law and the former habit have been making their way, until in some places there seemed to be hardly any limit to this form of lawlessness. The papers report vigorous action on the part of some officers to recover lost ground. The crying of "Sunday papers" is to be prohibited in Uniontown. It would be well for all communities if zealous guard were maintained against the enemies of the rest day, under whatever guise they masquerade.

It would be well also "for all communities, if zealous guard were maintained against the enemies of" religious liberty "under whatever guise they masquerade."
