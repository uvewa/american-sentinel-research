IN replying to an editorial note in the Sun relative to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the Christian Advocate, of this city, said:—

> The Rev. Dr. Lewis, the best known Seventh-day preacher in the United States, and worthy of comparison for ability and learning with any of the clergy, says in the religious paper of which he is the editor: "While we are opposed to the first day, we are bound to stand by those who favor closing the World's Fair on Sunday, because in that matter it is a question of the observance of a day or of no day"—or words to that effect.

In this the Advocate's zeal has got the better of its discretion. Rev. Dr. Lewis never used the language attributed to him; neither did it appear in his paper, the Outlook, but in the Sabbath Recorder. The author was Rev. W. C. Titsworth, who subsequently published over his own signature a note in this paper, saying:—

> Will you kindly allow me to assume the responsibility which belongs to the writer of the article, and say that it does not represent the editor, Dr. Platts, and probably does not represent many Seventh-day Baptists correctly. In fact, the Recorder has published a criticism which may stand as the view of the majority of my people.

The Advocate ought to correct its statement, and should be more careful in the future. Sunday-closing capital should not be manufactured from whole cloth.
