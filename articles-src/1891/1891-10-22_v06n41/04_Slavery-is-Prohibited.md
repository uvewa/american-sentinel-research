EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: You have frequently discussed in your paper the case of Mr. R. M. King, of Tennessee, whose case has been so grossly perverted; and have stated the ground the defense will have when the case is appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. This general of defense, it appears to the reason that it is a very close question to determine, as to whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution give any guarantee of religious liberty further than to be a prohibition against Congress restricting it.

"That Congress restricting it," taken in connection with the Fourteenth which declares that "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States," will most certainly to a firm ground in the defense if it should be approved by the Supreme Court as you construe it, historically, to extend beyond exercising jurisdiction, or control beyond exercising jurisdiction by Congress, but the decision of Judge Hammond upon this point, to my reading of the question every way, shows that opinions on the question vary considerably.

I wish to suggest a line of defense supplemental to the above suggested from the First. It is in taking the First, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments with the preamble to the Constitution, instead of taking only the First and Fourteenth. And taking one portion of the Constitution together, let us see now far it guarantees not only religious freedom, but every form of religion, which is not an act of immorality or an infringement of human rights.

First, the preamble declares that one of the objects of the Constitution is to secure the blessings of liberty to the people of the United States.

Second, the First Amendment specifically prohibits Congress from either establishing or favoring any religion, as the makers of the Constitution were more jealous of this kind of liberty being infringed than of any other kind.

The spirit of the instrument, as reflected in the preamble, is opposed to Congress exercising a power, with the free exercise of any kind of liberty, and it would seem as though that alone should be substantially conclusive.

Now, as to the Thirteenth Amendment, the matter short as it is, Sunday restrictions are treated by the legislation of Congress against the poor. The rich can have their own conveyances, but the poor must depend upon street cars; the rich can spend weeks in the country, but the poor must be satisfied with an occasional glimpse of green fields on Sunday; the rich can have books and magazines of their own, but the poor must depend largely upon the public reading rooms. If Sunday street cars are prohibited, Sunday excursions forbidden, and public libraries closed the poor have but little choice as to how they [page 323] shall be spent. They must spend the entire day at home or else go to church. That the latter is the better way few will deny; but we challenge the right of the State to shut people up to such a choice.

That Sunday restrictions are intended to indirectly compel people to go to church, by making it impossible for them to go anywhere else, is denied by just such one of the ministers of Riverside, either more candid or less wise than his fellows, admits in a communication to the *Planet* that is it is virtually the purpose of the Sunday laws. In answering the question, "Should the Public Library be opened on Sunday?" the gentleman, Rev. Chas. Winbigler, says:—

> Those who would go, par. is, in spending the reading room, is library, or both, on Sunday, if they were open, would be persons who go or can be required to go or go for books, that they cannot during the week or that they come on other business; these things would be, at least, a reason and a strong reason for keeping the library and reading room open on Sunday.

> There are the soldiers and other places in California, where saloons are open on Sunday, and other place of a questionable character, where they spend every their time and give no legitimate excuse reason to be refused; ... those are places it might, of course, if possible, that reflection was in a well furnished library with good available resort to way to be, own then, with its large suite of seasonable places to its open others, with atmosphere of interest education; than at any of them, and places such as these. We can help to establish moral principles by making better environment than at any of them, and places such as these.

It must be a declaration of universal liberty. It must include liberty of soul as well as liberty of body; and it cannot be construed to refer solely to liberty of body in the sense of prohibiting one individual from compelling another individual to labor for him against his will. And in the light of a broad interpretation, in the light of any interpretation not absurdly narrow, can it be possible that "this declaration of universal liberty" includes every form of liberty save religious liberty? and excludes every form of slavery save religious slavery? Truest. Indeed!

First, in the Thirteenth Amendment every form of slavery and involuntary servitude, is prohibited in the United States. The Thirteenth Amendment declares that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, where the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." It must therefore naturally follow that if slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, there can be no further result of their abolishment, and that is the establishment of complete and universal liberty. And further, that this complete and universal liberty is one of those privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States which, being guarded especially against State interference by the Fourteenth Amendment, no State can have any rightful power to abridge, or even pass a legislation for crime, and therefore, to abridge religious liberty I must be shown to be that the free exercise in its criminal in itself. And it is evident that this Thirteenth Amendment imposes restrictions upon the States as to what they shall have power to arbitrarily declare to be crimes, there could be no limit to the evasion of its meaning that might take place, or that it might in this be made to have no practical significance whatever. Some State might declare it a crime for a man's skin to be a certain color, or for a certain form, for which he should be punished with as little respect for liberty and humanity as the State of Tennessee has shown in declaring the color of a man's religion, and his form of worship, is accordant therewith, to be a crime.

No State can justly exercise such arbitrary power. And every citizen of the United States has the undeclared right the complete protection afforded by the Thirteenth Amendment, of which no lesser authority than Cooley says, in his work on Constitutional Law: "While courts be it is existence comparable to the writ of *habeas corpus* and to administer constitutional law remedies, it seems difficult to imagine a case of attempt at a violation or evasion of this declaration of universal liberty shall be wanting in appropriate redress."

If it is true that the Thirteenth Amendment is as much a provision of Congress as the First Amendment, but to set the matter beyond the shadow of a doubt, we have the First Amendment.

It appears to the writer that before the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, the petition and the preamble referred to, and the First Amendment, could only be construed as a guarantee that the citizens of the States shall not have their religious liberties interfered with or abridged by the power of the United States. But with the advent of the Thirteenth and further, the Fourteenth Amendment, we have:

First, in the Thirteenth Amendment every form of slavery and involuntary servitude, is prohibited in the United States. The Thirteenth Amendment declares that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, where of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." It must therefore naturally follow that if slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, there can be no result of their abolishment, and that is the establishment of complete and universal liberty. And further, that this complete and universal liberty is one of those privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States which, being guarded especially against State interference by the Fourteenth Amendment, no State can have any rightful power to abridge, or even pass a legislation for crime; and therefore, to abridge religious liberty I must be shown that the free exercise is criminal in itself. And it is evident that this Thirteenth Amendment imposes restrictions upon the States as to what they shall have power to arbitrarily declare to be crimes, there could be no limit to the evasion of its meaning that might take place, or that it might in this be made to have no practical significance whatever.
