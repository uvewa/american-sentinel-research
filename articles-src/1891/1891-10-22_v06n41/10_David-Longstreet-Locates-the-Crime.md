Readers of THE SENTINEL will remember nothing an item entitled "David Longstreet," a news dispatch announced that David Longstreet, a seventh day citizen of Oakley, Ill., had been arrested on the complaint of the neighbors, on the following charges:—

Jacob Tillow complains that David Longstreet performs secular work upon Sunday and holidays on the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday, by then and there farming and tilling the soil, and by then and there strapping and talking with a loud voice, hallooing, and there dismissed.

As stated in the above mentioned article, the arrest was based on Sec. 261 of the Statutes of Illinois which provides for a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars for disturbing the peace of any private family, "by any noise, rude, or animal behavior."

The complainant failed to prove the charge, the record admitting that Mr. Longstreet was heard but once talking, that on that talking there was no louder than was necessary, no louder than he would talk any other day.

Illinois has another statute which forbids common labor on Sunday, but enumerates "whosoever keeps proper to keep another day as the Sabbath." was found "guilty" in that he had labored on the Sabbath," and was ordered to pay a fine and costs amounting to $7.75. The decision was based on Sec. 261, not referred to the indictment, and not the Sunday law at all.

An appeal was taken, and a representative of the National Religious Liberty Association obtained secure counsel for the defense. After interview with the State's Attorney, Mr. Longstreet was invited to go and ask the State's Attorney to dismiss the case on the ground that there was no cause of action. Accordingly he called on the State's Attorney, and was referred to the Assistant State's Attorney who had prosecuted the case. His admission that Mr. Longstreet should observe the Sabbath each day Sabbath, for some months before he was held to have a right to come and a seventh-day observing seventh day observant, but suspected that Mr. Longstreet was not yet a born Seventh-day Baptist or Adventist, although it was his understanding, that Mr. Longstreet was of Seventh-day Baptist, that he was still a member of the United Brethren Church.

When his attention was called to the fact that a man need not be a member of any church to get the benefit of the exemption, the State's Attorney said he would be willing to dismiss the case if the prosecuting witness, Mr. Tillow, was agreed.

This biggest attempt to coerce an honest man of citizens in the face of both statute and law seems to continue. When Mr. Tillow was seen he was anxious to have the case dismissed, stating that was made when he had Mr. Longstreet arrested, and that Mr. Longstreet's conduct towards him had been entirely satisfactory ever since.

Mr. Longstreet said to "Mr. Longstreet, I don't want any more trouble with you. I don't care what had occurred, and when my wife was taken ill, Mr. Longstreet came over and was a good neighbor. I don't want to prosecute him." Consequently he signed the following communication:—

> DANVILLE, ILL., Sept. 16, 1891.
>
> To James A. Bills, State's Attorney, Champaign Co., Ill.: The charge against David Longstreet, for Sunday work, having been made without sufficient information on the part of the witness, was begun under a misapprehension on my part, therefore, the case being still pending, I do not believe now that Mr. Longstreet should be prosecuted, and ask that the case be dismissed. I do not want to appear against him.

Here lies the secret of all these indolent prosecutions. When Mr. Tillow was not informed, when, his heart was hard, Mr. Longstreet's his Christian heart and his conscience, had the eye only, the crime was transformed into a good for evil, the crime was transformed into an obligation. Where then the crime for which all these Sabbatarians are arrested and prosecuted rests, and in fact has in the hand of the heart of their persecutors; a change of heart, a genuine Christian conversion, takes away all being all this demand for rigid Sunday laws and for Sunday persecution.
