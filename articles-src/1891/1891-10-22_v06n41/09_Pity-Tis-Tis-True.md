In making mention of Miss Willard's fifty-second birthday, celebrated on the 28th ult., the Chicago Evening Journal says:—

> There was a time, years ago, when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union commanded respect. It devoted itself with singleness of purpose and with pious energy to the extirpation of the liquor-traffic; and whatever opinion people entertained on the liquor-question, they all bowed down before the wonderful earnestness and disinterestedness, the prayers, the tears and pleadings of the crusaders. If the institution had maintained until now the characteristics it displayed then, it is possible that prohibition doctrines might have overrun the whole country.
>
> But like everything else human, prosperity has been the bane of this organization. It is now little better than a sorcish. It is a social and political reform-clique, dabbling in everything from new styles of corsets to female suffrage, but especially and always female suffrage, in Church and State. Its singleness of purpose, its lofty motives and its self-forgetfulness are all gone. Nothing is left but the "canker and the worm" of ambition, intrigue, pride, politics and display. As for temperance reform, the ladies have forgotten there ever was such a thing, except as a pretext for female suffrage. The situation is condensed in an amusing interview Miss Willard had not long since, in Washington, with Cardinal Gibbons to whom she had asked to be presented. "Very glad indeed to meet you, Miss Willard," said the Cardinal courteously and innocently, "very glad indeed. I think I have heard that you felt some interest in the temperance question; have I not?"

That the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is mad 'tis true; 'tis true, 'tis pity; And pity 'tis, 'tis true.

"A foolish figure" Miss Willard cut in the interview with the Cardinal, but the whole association of which she is President stands just where she does. The name they bear has become a misnomer; for the Union is now little more than a woman's club, for political, rather than for Christian, purposes. "The glory is departed" from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and by their own grasping after political power they have caused "I-chabod" to be inscribed upon their banners.

"RIGHT wrongs no man."
