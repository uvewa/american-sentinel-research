COMMENTING upon one of the outrageous Sunday arrests made some weeks ago in this city, the Los Angeles Churchman says:—

> And yet some good, but mistaken, Christian people are trying to get California to enact a Sunday law. Let such remember this truth, which will hold good until the Lord Himself returns to reign: "NO CIVIL GOVERNMENT HAS ANY COMMISSION TO ADMINISTER THE DIVINE LAW."

The editor of the Churchman, Rev. Thomas Haskins, D. D., is rector of Christ Church, Los Angeles, Cal.
