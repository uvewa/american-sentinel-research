THERE are only two factors concerned in relation to Sunday rest and worship—God and man. The State is not in it.—*Colorado Graphic.*

THE Associated Press despatch in reference to the appeal of the King case to the Supreme Court of the United States, published in so many papers a few weeks ago, is a marked evidence of the carelessness in the use of language—so common—in the failure to discriminate between the Sabbath and Sunday. And especially is it noticeable in this case, because upon this distinction hangs much of the interest of King's trial. In all of Judge Hammond's decision, occupying four newspaper columns of solid matter, the Judge does not once use the word "Sabbath," but consistently holds to the term "Sunday." Still the Associated Press dispatch reads: "In the celebrated case of R. M. King, the Seventh-day Adventist, convicted in Obion County of Sabbath-breaking;" and the head which some telegraph editors have given the item has been, "King, the Sabbath-breaker." This results in a reversal of the entire matter, if language means anything, for the truth is that King is a Sabbath-keeper, according to the strict injunction of the commandment, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," but he has been convicted of Sunday-breaking. It was through the very fact that King was a Sabbath-keeper that the necessities of six days' weekly toil made him a Sunday-breaker. The name "Sabbath-keepers" is the distinguishing title of the denomination to which King belongs, and for Sabbath-breaking he would be dropped from the church rolls. This heralding a man to the world as guilty of that very sin which the title, even, of the denomination to which he belongs, his religious profession and public acts, and the entire subject matter of his trial, proves conclusively that he was not guilty of, is an example of perversion of language equaled only by the perversion of legal principles, and their false application, through which he was convicted.
