BALTIMORE, the seat of the American Vatican, and Pittsburg, the centre of the National Reform movement, are the two chosen points of vantage from which the promoters of religious legislation are preparing to start their great crusade. At both these cities "already to-morrow walks in to-day." The dramatic unity of this great tragedy of the centuries is preserved in a marked manner, and thus it is that Baltimore, which has been from its earliest settlement the stronghold of Roman Catholicism in America, is the first of the large cities to undertake the thorough enforcement of its Sunday laws.

The Maryland code prohibits all persons from performing bodily labor on Sunday under penalty of five dollars fine, and visits the same penalty upon any one who permits children or servants to work, fish, hunt, or engage in any "unlawful pastime or recreation;" all dealing in, or giving away of, any merchandise whatsoever, except milk, ice, and prescribed medicines, is subject to a fine of from twenty to fifty dollars for the first offense, and for the second not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred, with an imprisonment of from ten to thirty days and the revoking of license to do business for one year, if any has been issued to the party so convicted; a third infringement of the law may be punished by imprisonment of from thirty to sixty days and a fine of not less than twice the sum in which the offender has been previously mulcted. Half of these fines are to go to the State and half to the informer.

The keeping open of a dancing saloon, barber shop, opera house, ten pin alley, or ball alley is finable in a sum of from fifty to one hundred dollars, and, if a person—not a corporation—imprisonment of from ten to thirty days, and for subsequent convictions the same imprisonment with a double fine.

Oyster dredging on Sunday may be visited with a fine of from fifty to three hundred dollars and from three months to one year in the house of correction, or forfeiture of the boat used in the work, at the discretion of the judge.

At Baltimore, on October 2, the Grand Jury addressed a communication to the Board of Police Commissioners in obedience to which notice was given to the police force, and to the public, that after October 4, the laws of Maryland upon the observance of Sunday would be strictly enforced. In pursuance of this order, on October 12 the police reported 176 persons for working or selling on Sunday. Among the offenses charged are blacking boots, selling newspapers, rowing boats, running ferry-boats, letting cabs, selling ice cream, liquor, cigars, fruit, confectionery, cakes, soda water, postage stamps, and stationery.

Not all those arrested, it is said, are to be tried; but individuals from each business represented are to be selected, upon whose cases the law will be tested.

This Baltimore Grand Jury has before made recommendations in reference to the enforcement of Sunday laws, but has not rested until it has made for itself a record of being the first Grand Jury in the United States to systematically undertake to revive the mediaevalism in law which has been permitted to survive upon our statute books.

It will be well that this fact, with all its suggestiveness, should be remembered as this movement progresses.

The National Reformers have selected Pittsburg as the point of departure for their efforts, and W. F. Crafts is reported as saying in a lecture there on Sunday, October 11, that "a movement would be started at an early day that would startle the citizens of the United States," and that Pittsburg had been selected as the starting point of this reform wave which is to sweep the country."

All intelligent citizens should have been startled long ago. It is now "high time to awake out of sleep."
