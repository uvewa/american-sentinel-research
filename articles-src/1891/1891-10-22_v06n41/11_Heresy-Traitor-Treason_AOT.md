The above epithets have invariably been applied to the dissenting minority, by the majority, whose religion was protected and enforced by the State. Thus far in the history of our Republic heresy and treason have not been synonymous. All have been free to teach and practice the religion which their minds and consciences approved. If this belief did not conform with the thought of the majority, the charge of "heresy" was the severest accusation that could be brought against the dissenter.

From the following communication received by Elder J. W. Bagby, a Seventh-day Adventist minister, from a clergyman of a popular denomination in southern Illinois, in response to a request for the use of his church in which to deliver a series of lectures, we see that there are some who are anxiously awaiting the final decision of the King case with the cherished hope that they will thereby be enabled to add the charge of treason to that of heresy.

It is the undisputed right of one denomination to close its house of worship against doctrines which it believes to be false, and it is not this action on the part of the congregation that is to be criticised, but the reason for the action, given at the close of the communication.

HOWELL CHAPEL, Ill., Aug 5, 1891.

> To Rev. Bagby et al., concerned:
>
> We tender you the house for a few nights, with the understanding that you preach such things as are held by the leading orthodox churches of the country, namely, the Baptiste, Freebytortans, Camp bellites or Christian Order, the Methodist, and any others which may be on the same line; and such doctrines as the following: faith, repentance, atonement, and if you desire you can preach on the end of time, with the understanding that you do not preach on the Sunday question.
>
> Furthermore, that when the trustees and members ask you to vacate the house, you will do so at once. Furthermore, that after these services which you are permitted to hold under the above agreement are closed you do not ask for a regular appointment, or any services at any time till the Supreme Court decides the case now pending, which came up from Tennessee, concerning the observance of the Sunday law. And if it is decided in your favor, you will not ask for the use of the house till you have given sufficient proof that you are an orthodox church, and that your church does not conflict with the laws of our land, as we are admonished by the Bible to be obedient to the laws of the land.

By this we are to understand that if the United States Supreme Court decides that King is not compelled to observe Sunday, then if Mr. Bagby can prove that his church is in harmony with the laws on all other religious questions, his request for the use of the church will be considered; but if on the other hand the Court decides that Mr. King must observe Sunday in conformity with the then established State religion touching that point, he need not ask for the use of the church as they cannot harbor a man who preaches that Sunday is not the Sabbath, in the face of a judicial decision that Sunday is the Sabbath, and must be observed by all; for that would be to aid and abet a traitor and give countenance to his treasonable utterances.

Are the missionaries of this denomination in Russia instructed to preach only such doctrines as are declared orthodoxy by the laws of the land? On the contrary they are sent to preach at the peril of their lives, a religion at variance with the laws of the land. To do otherwise would be to cease to act as missionaries. And yet this American clergyman avails himself of Russian methods in closing his doors to the doctrines of another sect.
