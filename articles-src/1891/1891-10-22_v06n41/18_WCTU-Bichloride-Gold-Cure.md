THE Chicago Journal remarks that "there is something almost pathetic, and yet not entirely devoid of innate fun, in the paroxysmal efforts of the dear ladies of the Women's Christian Temperance Union to explain, extenuate and deny Miss Willard's allegation that the bichloride of gold cure for drunkenness was boomed by the press simply to hurt the Prohibition Party. It appears at length to have dawned upon the minds of these ladies that hostility to a cure for drunkenness is not exactly in line with a movement for radical temperance reform." The trouble with the Women's Christian Temperance Union is that it is working more at politics now than at temperance reform.
