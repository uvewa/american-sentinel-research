The *Sunday Post Thickeners*, Barnemaster, the seat of the American Vatican, and Pittsburg, the centre of the National Reform movement, are the two chosen points of vantage from which the promoters of religious legislation are preparing to start their great crusade. Is both these cities "already in-course with to-day." The demand of only a few great tragedy of the centuries is to be preserved, served in a marked manner, and the first is that Baltimore, which has been from the mutual settlement the stronghold of Roman Catholicism in America, is the first of the large cities to undertake the systematic enforcement of the Sunday law.

The Maryland code prohibits all persons from performing Sunday labor or selling under penalty of five dollars fine, and visits the same penalty upon any one who employs children or others in work, hunt, fish, fowl, or engage in any "unlawful pastime or recreation;" all dealing in, or giving away of, any merchandise whatever is also prohibited. The Maryland code further prohibits physicians, apothecaries or other persons, from practicing medicine, in subject to a fine of from twenty to fifty dollars for the first offense, and for the second not less than fifty, and in later not more than five hundred, with an imprisonment of from ten to thirty days and the revoking of his license to practice.

Not all those arrested, it is said, are to be tried; but individuals from the different trades in the town is the vicinity of Frostburg, and from the coal trades, the butchers, bakers, and coal dealers, saloons, tobacconists and other traders, who have been arrested, are to be selected, upon those cases the law will be tested.
