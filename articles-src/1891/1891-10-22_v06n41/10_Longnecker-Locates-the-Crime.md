The readers of the Sentinel will remember noticing an item entitled, "Intolerance in Illinois," which announced that David Longnecker, a seventh day observer of Oakley, Ill., had been arrested on complaint of his neighbor, on the following charge:—

> Jacob Tidrow complains that David Longnecker, of the County of Macon and State of Illinois, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, to wit: on the 19th day of July, A. D., 1891, was guilty of making a great noise, screaming and talking with a loud voice, whereby the peace of the affiant and his family was then and there disturbed.

As stated in the above-mentioned article, the arrest was based on Sec. 262 of the Statutes of Illinois, which provides for a fine of not less than twenty five dollars for disturbing the peace of any private family, "by any noise, rout, or amusement, on the first day of the week, called Sunday."

The complainant failed to prove the charge, he himself admitting, that Mr. Longnecker was heard to speak to his horses, and start and stop them, but not louder than was necessary, nor louder than he would on any other day.

Illinois has another statute which forbids common labor on Sunday, but exempts "whomever thinks proper to keep another day as the Sabbath."

Failing to convict under Sec. 302, Mr. Longnecker was found "guilty in that he had labored on the Sabbath," and was ordered to pay a fine and costs amounting to $17.50. The decision was based on Sec. 381, not referred to in the indictment, and which contains an exemption clause as quoted.

An appeal was taken, and a representative of the National Religious Liberty Association was sent to secure counsel for the defense. After interviewing the witness and consulting a lawyer he was advised to go and ask the State's Attorney to dismiss the case on the ground that there was no cause of action. Accordingly he called on the State's Attorney, and was referred to the Assistant State's Attorney who had prosecuted the case. He admitted that Mr. Longnecker had observed the seventh-day Sabbath, for some months before he was arrested, and that there was an exemption favoring seventh-day observers, but argued that Mr. Longnecker had not as yet joined a Seventh-day Adventist Church (there is none in his neighborhood), that he was still a member of the United Brethren Church, the same as Mr. Tidrow his prosecutor.

When his attention was called to the fact that a man need not be a member of any church to get the benefit of the exemption, the State's Attorney said he would be willing to dismiss the case if the prosecuting witness, Mr. Tidrow, was agreed.

This bigoted attempt to convict an honest man of crime in the face of both justice and law needs no comment. When Mr. Tidrow was seen he was anxious to have the case dismissed, stating that he was mad when he had Mr. Longnecker arrested, and that Mr. Longnecker's conduct towards him since the trial was such that he desired the case withdrawn. Mr. Tidrow said: "Mr. Longnecker treated me as kindly after the trial as if nothing had occurred, and when my wife was taken ill, Mrs. Longnecker came down and took care of her. I don't want to prosecute him." Consequently he signed the following communication and the case was dismissed:—

DELATOR, Ill., Sept. 11, 1891.

> To Isaac R. Mills, State's Attorney, Macon County—DEAR SIR: The case against David Longnecker instituted by myself, as prosecuting witness, was begun under a misapprehension on my part. I am very sorry that the case is now pending. I do not believe now that Mr. Longnecker is guilty of any misdemeanor or crime whatever. He is conscientious in what he does. I do not want to appear against him.
>
> JACOB TIDROW."

Here lies the secret of all these intolerant prosecutions. When Mr. Tidrow was "mad" as he said, when his heart was hard, Mr. Longnecker, his Christian brother had committed a crime; but when his heart was made tender with a return of good for evil, the crime was transformed into a virtue. Where then lies the crime for which all these Sabbatarians are arrested and imprisoned? It exists, not in fact but in the hard intolerant heart of their prosecutors; a change of heart to conform to the heart of the loving Savior would bring all this demand for rigid Sunday laws and their enforcement to an immediate and permanent end.
