RIVERSIDE, California, is gratified over the closing of the Public Library on Sundays. In liberating its opponents a correspondent of the *Planet* says:—

The closing of the library and reading rooms has incurred the criticism from two sides: by those who claim it as an instance of religious legislation, and a determination in favor of the rich against the poor. One may use his own magazines or papers or go to his own private club house at home on Sunday, while the workingman's opportunity is Sunday in the free library and reading room. Library and reading hours, efforts and laws have been the workingman's equipment in the struggle to gain what would have the workingman's equipment in such a way as to constitute the most economical investment; and this Sunday closing of the reading room and library is easily in accordance with all such laws and legislation. Undoubtedly the closing of the library and reading room on Sunday is done in the interest of the Sabbath; but if the churches are unable to furnish libraries that on their own merits an efforts of a larger size can overcome the indifference of so many good citizens to the attractions they hold forth.

The question of the various churches proposed and effected the closing of the reading room on Sunday, is not really entitled to any consideration as a matter of religious legislation. There are ministers in Riverside who have not all the employees but this labor classes under them, who require their present employees captured by Sunday labor else than to hire extra ones the works of position to attend to.

The writer of this paragraph has stated the matter about as it is. Sunday restrictions are treated by the legislation of Congress against the poor. The rich can have their own conveyances, but the poor must depend upon street cars; the rich can spend weeks in the country, but the poor must be satisfied with an occasional glimpse of green fields on Sunday; the rich can have books and magazines of their own, but the poor must depend largely upon the public reading rooms. If Sunday street cars are prohibited, Sunday excursions forbidden, and public libraries closed the poor have but little choice as to how they shall be spent. They must spend the entire day at home or else go to church. That the latter is the better way few will deny; but we challenge the right of the State to shut people up to such a choice.

That Sunday restrictions are intended to indirectly compel people to go to church, by making it impossible for them to go anywhere else, is denied by just such one of the ministers of Riverside, either more candid or less wise than his fellows, admits in a communication to the *Planet* that is it is virtually the purpose of the Sunday laws. In answering the question, "Should the Public Library be opened on Sunday?" the gentleman, Rev. Chas. Winbigler, says:—

> Those who would go, par. is, in spending the reading room, is library, or both, on Sunday, if they were open, would be persons who cannot go or get books, that they cannot during the week. ... These things would be, at least, a reason and a strong reason for keeping the library and reading room open on Sunday.

I do not think that the library and reading room should be kept open on Sunday.
