Just a few days previous to the hearing of Colonel Shepard and party before the Federal Commission of the Columbian Exposition, Rev. W. F. Crafts wrote a letter to the editor of the Chicago Evening News, in which he states that he has counted the petitions that have been sent to the Commission up to July 16, and, to use his words, "there was not 100,000 as was fairly to be expected, but only 1,356." He goes on to state the number sent in by each denomination, and then adds, "Commercial bodies are represented by only two petitions and labor organizations are not in the list, and no temperance organization is represented except the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and only eight Sunday School Conventions have sent in petitions out of more than eighty that have met since the agitation began. Only five colleges have petitioned; worst of all, not more than one-half of the Sabbath Associations of our country have even sent in petitions of their own." He says further that envelopes full of petitions had been "sent out by the Columbian Sunday Association to 50,000 ministers, but these went mostly to the waste basket." And the reason he gives for this fact is a reflection on the intelligence of these pastors.

Mr. Crafts finds consolation in the fact that the effort of the opposition in the matter of circulating petitions was yet more of a fizzle than that of the advocates of Sunday closing.

He concludes this part of his letter with the remark that "something must be done to improve the quantity and quality too, of the petitions."

Many have been led to believe by the statements of the officers of the Columbian Sunday Association in Chicago, that petitions were coming in by the thousand; that laboring men were demanding the closing of the Fair, and that they were almost a unit in their co-operations with the movers of the Sunday closing agitation. The people have also been repeatedly told that the commercial men as a rule favored Sunday closing, but now comes the statement from Mr. Crafts that only two petitions have been sent in by this class, and that labor organizations were not in the list of petitioners; and yet all the men who are now employed by the Exposition Company and probably all who will be during the Fair, as well as other men in whatever capacity, who will perform labor in consequence of the Fair being open on Sunday, are members of labor organizations, some of which hold meetings weekly, some monthly and others semi-monthly. Is it not a little remarkable that not one of these organizations has sent in a petition to be released from this worse than African slavery? although, leaving out the religious phase of the question, they are the parties most interested.

It is quite evident from the foregoing statements of Mr. Crafts, that the commercial and labor organizations either do not appreciate the efforts being made for their emancipation, or are not conscious of the fact that they have the right of petition, and as they are for the most part very intelligent men, this last proposition is not to be entertained for a moment.
