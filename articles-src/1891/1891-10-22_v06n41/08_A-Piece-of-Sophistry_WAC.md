Many and ingenious are the sophistries of those who seek to justify the existence and the enforcement of Sunday laws. This was well illustrated in a lecture given by a Sunday-law advocate, at Hillsdale, Michigan, recently. The speaker's great plea was that Sunday laws could be justified upon sanitary grounds. He asserted that "a normal night's sleep does not balance a normal day's work," and that therefore a man must have one full day's rest in seven or he will run behind in his "oxygen." This is pure assumption. It is contrary to reason and common sense. It might as well and as truthfully be asserted that one day's rest in seven does not compensate for the loss of oxygen in six days' labor, and therefore after every six weeks of labor man must have a week's lay off. On the other hand, if this theory were true, then the man who works very little or none at all would soon have an over supply of oxygen, and the human machinery would become vitalized to such a degree that it would go to pieces in a short time. But such is not the case.

The facts are simply these: While the day, the month and the year are indicated in nature, and the time for physical rest and recuperation by the regularly recurring daily periods of darkness which induce sleep, there is nothing in nature indicating the division of time into weeks: The grass grows as fast, the waves dash as high, the sun shines as bright, the storm beats as fiercely, on the Sabbath as on other days. The Sabbath was instituted by God for worship, for religion, primarily, and not for rest because of physical weariness. God did not intend that man should work himself to death. Man in his primeval condition no more needed one day in seven for physical rest than the birds of the air or the beasts of the forest. The Sabbath was made for spiritual devotion, to keep in mind the Creator, the true God, and the cessation from worldly toil (for that is the meaning of the Hebrew word for Sabbath, "cessation," and not rest) is only a necessary concomitant to that devotion and to the perpetuation of such memorial.

No physician or set of physicians ever have demonstrated, or ever can demonstrate that man in a normal condition needs one day in seven for physical rest simply. But were this theory true, there would still be no ground for laws compelling men to take such rest. All are agreed that men need nightly rest; but who would admit the right of Congress or of the State Legislature to pass a law that everybody must go to bed every night and take so many hours of sleep? The nightly rest is of vastly more importance than weekly, monthly, or yearly holidays can possibly be. No one can go long without daily rest, and not break down. Why does he not plead for a nightly rest law? Consistency would demand it. But the health of the people is not what he is after. There are many other things that are necessary to man's physical well-being besides rest; such as food, sufficient air, bathing, recreation, etc. Why does not this lecturer stir up the people to demand laws that will require all to inhale so much air, or to bathe so often? Simply because he is not laboring in the interests of the health of the people in his harangue for Sunday laws. What he is after is the religious observance of the day. But his method of bringing this about is wrong. People are not going to be made religious by law. As he said, "You might as well try to put handcuffs on the clouds" as to attempt this. But the attempt has often been made, however, though always with the same result—religious persecution. The King case of Tennessee, and others in that State, and the States of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, and Arkansas are convincing proofs that the enforcement of Sunday laws is the making of this very attempt. Sunday laws are dead letters only when they are enforced by the demands of religious bigotry and intolerance. They are most convenient means for one religionist's giving vent to his spite toward another with whom he does not agree. The National Reformer says they are "simply empty aisles between the work benches with no kneeling stools along the side." But no man, no set of men, Congress, Legislature, or municipality has any right whatever to drive men into those aisles. Sunday laws are irreconcilable with civil and religious liberty. And every prosecution under them is an attempt to make men kneel down on those kneeling stools along these aisles of idleness, of which this Reformer say there are none. But he will find, as has already been demonstrated, that, as in the case of those Hebrew captives which Nebuchadnezzar commanded to bow down before the image he erected in the plain of Dura, those at least who observe the Sabbath enjoined in the fourth precept of God's law will not kneel. With them, they will say to whatsoever earthly power or potentate shall make the demand, "Be it known unto thee, O king we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
