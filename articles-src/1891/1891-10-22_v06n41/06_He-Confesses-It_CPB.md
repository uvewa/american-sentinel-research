RIVERSIDE, California, is agitated over the closing of the Public Library on Sunday. In discussing this question a correspondent of the *Phenix* says:—

> The closing of the library and reading room partakes of class legislation, and a discrimination in favor of the rich as against the poor man. The rich man can enjoy his magazine or paper to his heart's content at home on Sunday, while the workingman's opportunity is Sunday in the free library and reading room. Efforts and laws have been made more or less successful to curtail the workingman's Sunday enjoyment in such a way as to compel him to go to church as a relief to the intense *annul* occasioned thereby, and this Sunday closing of the reading room and library is entirely in accordance with all such laws and regulations. Undoubtedly the closing of the library and reading room on Sunday is done in the interest of the churches; but if the churches are unable to draw full houses on their own merits no efforts of a legislative nature can cure the indifference of so many good citizens to the attractions they hold forth.
>
> The question of the extra burdens imposed on employees by opening the library and reading room on Sunday, is not really entitled to any consideration in view of the fact that there are people, even in Riverside who have not all the employment that they desire, even supposing that our present employees objected to Sunday labor with the extra remuneration they would in justice be entitled to.

The writer of this paragraph has stated the matter about as it is. Sunday restrictions almost invariably discriminate against the poor. The rich can have their own conveyances, but the poor must depend upon street cars; the rich can spend weeks in the country, but the poor must be satisfied with an occasional glimpse of green fields on Sunday; the rich can have books and magazines of their own, but the poor must depend largely upon the public reading rooms: if Sunday street cars are prohibited, Sunday excursions forbidden, and public libraries closed the poor have but little choice as to how the day shall be spent. They must spend the entire day at home or else go to church. That the latter is the better way few will deny; but we challenge the right of the State to shut people up to such a choice.

That Sunday restrictions are intended to indirectly compel people go to church, by making it impossible for them to go anywhere else, is denied by many; but one of the ministers of Riverside, either more candid or less wise than his fellows, admits in a communication to the *Phenix* that that is virtually the purpose of Sunday laws. In answering the question, "Should the Public Library be opened on Sunday?" the gentleman, Rev. Chas. Winbigler, says:—

> There would be no harm, *per se*, in opening the reading room, or library, or both, on Sunday, if the demands upon our laboring men are such that they cannot send or go for books, that they cannot go and read the papers and magazines, on work evenings; these things would be, at least, a reason and a strong reason for keeping the library and reading-room open on Sunday.
>
> If this town were like many other places in California, where saloons are open on Sunday, and other places of a questionable character were opened to attract men, to take their money and steal away their time and give no legitimate return, I think it might be well to open our reading-room at least, to counteract, if possible, that serious tendency. The way to win men from questionable places is to open others, with stronger inducements, that are good and respectable. We can help to establish moral principles by making the environment of men good.
>
> Something more than good surroundings for men is necessary to make them good moral citizens. That is met very largely by their hearing and practicing spiritual and moral truth. That is usually done at and in connection with the church. To decrease the opportunities of attending church by establishing a less powerful moral force is not wise. I do not believe in compelling people to go to church nor do I believe in abridging their privileges by substituting something less helpful, unless the circumstances are such that the intermediate expediency must be resorted to as a step to something better.
>
> In the absence of a great demand, as well as the absence of many attractions of a demoralizing tendency in our town, (I wish there were none), and the present opportunities afforded the laboring men to avail themselves of our library and reading-room privileges, and other moral considerations, I do not think that the library and reading-room in Riverside should be open on Sunday.

Stripped of its verbiage that which Mr. Winbigler says, is about this: If saloons were open on Sunday the Public Library should also be kept open to attract as many as possible from the saloons; but inasmuch as the saloons are closed on that day, the library should also be closed on Sunday in order that men may be the more ready to go to church. It is all right for this minister to do all that he can to induce people to attend church, indeed it is his duty as a minister to influence all that he can in that direction, but it is manifestly improper for any minister to seek to use the civil power, either city, State, or national to aid him in his work. That many are seeking to do this however is evident, and now that one of them has plainly declared that such is the case, possibly others may have the grace to be equally candid.
