IN making mention of Miss Willard's fiftieth birthday, elaborately celebrated in the *Woman's National Journal* and the like, there was a time, years ago, when the Woman's Christian Temperance Union was devoted with title, simpleness of purpose and with power in witnessing to the relations of all things; and whatever opinions people entertained on the minor question, they all bowed down before the wonderful earnestness and dimensions of the purpose, the men and gladness of the occasions, and the sincerity of its workers. But now the characteristics it displayed then, it is a changed body, a political machine pure and simple, grown to a whale-like proportion.

In all this transition, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has changed character. That it has expanded, and its property has been the basis of this organization, it can reform a state, dabbling in everything from the science of cooking to spiritualism, all the strange and always female suffrage, in Church and State. Its influences of purpose, money, lobby and in all its conglomeration are all gone. Nothing is the matter with its organization. It has a lobbying, polite, politics and display. As the temperance reform, the ladies have succeeded in it was such a thing, stronger for all the worse and worse. Nobody pays any more attention to its utterances, in Washington, than is paid to the old familiar fog-horn. "I should like to interest you, Miss Willard," said "the Clerk of the House Committee on Education and Labor. I have heard that you have also declared in favor of Sunday legislation."

That the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is a political machine pure and simple. "Yes." And yet, said she to a foolish figure "Miss Willard cast the interview with the Cardinal, but the whole association of which she is at the head stands just where she does. The cause they have best served in the work of late for the Union is now little more than a women's club, for reform." "And rather than for Christian, purposes, "That the glory is departed" from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and by their own grasping after political power they have their banners.
