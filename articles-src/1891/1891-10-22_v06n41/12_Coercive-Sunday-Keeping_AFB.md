EDITOR Tribune.—In your issue of September 29, I noticed a number of resolutions passed by the Rock River Methodist Episcopal Conference favoring the enactment and enforcement of rigid Sabbath laws, with reasons prefaced. Among the reasons are the following:—

"God's blessing ever accompanies its [Sunday's] observance, and his curse follows its violation." Again, "Mammon and pleasure join hands to destroy this God-given day. Legislation has lent her aid to the Christian public, but to a great extent her statutes are a dead letter."

Following the introductory reasons the Conference resolved: "1. That we will use all proper efforts to further legislation which proposes a law to uphold the observance of the Sabbath day, and we will earnestly endeavor to enforce the laws already enacted."

To the writer these utterances seem out of harmony with the American policy of entire separation between Church and State. Stripped of rhetoric and redundancies the demand of the Conference narrows down to this: "We believe that God blesses the strict observance of Sunday as a holy day. Many people do not believe this, and manifest their unbelief by seeking pleasure or profit on that day; therefore resolved, that we force them to believe this, or act as if they believed it, by securing the enactment and enforcement of laws making it a crime to do otherwise."

The writer is not an enemy of the Sabbath. On the contrary he would enjoy seeing it religiously observed by all; but this reform, if brought about at all, must come through moral evasion, as do all other religious practices, and not by means of an appeal to law, dangerous alike to civil and religious liberty.
