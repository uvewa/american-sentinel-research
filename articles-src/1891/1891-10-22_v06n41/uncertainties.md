## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 4, Article "He Confesses It"
- **Text:** "intense *annul* occasioned thereby"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** The word "annul" appears to be an OCR error. Context suggests it might be "ennui" (boredom/weariness), but preserved as transcribed per instructions.

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association section
- **Text:** Image reference with addresses
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Note:** The OCR contained what appears to be a partial image description. Addresses listed but formatting uncertain. Preserved as best interpretation.

### Article "Slavery Is Prohibited"
- **Author identification:** Thomas B. Dixon
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Author initials "TBD" appear at end of article. This is a new author not in the known authors list.

### Article "The Petition Fizzle"
- **Author identification:** Allen Moon
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Author initials "AM" are not explicitly stated but attribution is clear from context and署名 patterns in similar NRLA articles.

## Editorial Attribution Notes

Multiple short items on pages 7-8 were categorized as "editorial" based on their unsigned nature and editorial voice typical of the publication's style.
