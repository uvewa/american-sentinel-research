A FRIEND in Montana writes thus:—

"I sat down to write an order for THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and, before sealing up the letter, the thought occurred to me that there were some of our prominent business men that ought to become readers of that able exponent of religious liberty. Upon the impulse of the moment I went out, and in about three hours obtained twenty nine trial subscriptions for six months each.

Others have recently been doing similar work, and the result is a very gratifying increase in the subscription list of THE SENTINEL. Our friends have our heartfelt thanks for the substantial assistance rendered, in increasing the circulation of the only paper devoted to the defense of the United States Constitution as it is, so far as regards religion and religious tests.
