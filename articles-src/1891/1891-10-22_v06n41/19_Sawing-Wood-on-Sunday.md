"Say, did you ever notice what an awful noise it makes to saw stove-wood on Sunday? We have."—Exchange.

And have you ever noticed that the noise is tenfold worse when the fellow who saws the wood doesn't belong to your church, and possibly does not recognize the sacred claims of the day? Then, if he happens to keep some other day, the seventh, for instance, the noise becomes absolutely unbearable. It is wonderful what a microphone bigotry is. Why, only a few weeks since one or two small sewing machines operated on Sunday, by Jews in Brooklyn, disturbed a whole congregation of people in another building! Intolerance is a mighty magnifier of sound.
