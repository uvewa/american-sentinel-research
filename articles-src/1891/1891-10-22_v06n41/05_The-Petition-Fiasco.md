JUST a few days previous to the hearing of Colonel Shepard and party before the Federal Committee of the Columbian Commission, the Rev. W. F. Crafts wrote a letter to the editor of the Chicago *Evening News*, in which he stated that he has counted the petitions that they have, sent to the commission to obey it; said, to use his words, "there was not 100,000 was fairly to be expected, but only 1,326." He goes on to state the contest less by each denomination, and the states: "Columbian local bodies are represented by only two petitions, and labor organizations are not in the list, and no temperance organization is represented except the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and only eight Sunday School conventions have sent in petitions out of the eight that might have sent into an agitation begin. Only five colleges have petitioned, word of all, not more than one-half of the Sabbath Associations of the country have petitioned on their own." He goes further that every expense full of petitions had been "sent out by the Columbian Sunday Association to 60,000 ministers, but less than weeks mostly to the waste-basket." And he then goes on to say that the fact is a reflection on the ministers.

He concludes that in fact his letter with the simple conclusion in its accordance have done to improve the quantity and quality of this literature.

Many have been led to believe by the statements of the officers of the Columbian Sunday Association in Chicago, that petitions were coming in by the thousand; that laborers on were throwing in their lot; and that they were about closing of the Fair, and that they were all with a unit in their co-operation with the movers of the Sunday closing agitation. The people have also been repeatedly told that the commercial men as a rule favored Sunday closing, but now comes the statement from Mr. Crafts that only two petitions have been sent in by this class, and that labor organizations were not in the list of petitioners; and yet all the men who are now employed by the Exposition Company and probably all who will be during the Fair, as well as other men in whatever capacity, who will perform labor in consequence of the Fair being open on Sunday, are members of labor organizations, some of which hold meetings weekly, some monthly and others monthly. Is it not a little remarkable that not one of these organizations has sent in a petition to be released from the worse these African slavery? almost though, leaving out the religious phase of it entirely, they are the parties most interested.

It is quite evident from the foregoing statements of Mr. Crafts, that the commercial and labor organizations either are not and appreciate the efforts being made for their emancipation, or are not conscious of the fact that they have the right of petition, and as they are for the most part every intelligent men, the last proposition is not to be entertained for a moment.
