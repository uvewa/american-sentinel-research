Ant and ingenious are the sophistries that are employed to justify the existence and the enforcement of Sunday laws. This was well illustrated in a lecture given by a Sunday-law advocate, at Hillsdale, Michigan, recently. The speaker's great plea was that Sunday laws could be justified upon sanitary grounds. He asserted that a normal night's sleep does not bail. That "a normal day's work," and "that a normal man must have one full day's rest in reserve be to will run behind in its reserve." This is pure nonsensical. It is contrary to reason and common sense. It might as well and as truthfully be asserted that one day's rest in seven does not compensate for the loss of oxygen in six days' labor, and therefore after every six days' labor, "one must go off somewhere" to labor. On the other hand, if this theory were true, then the man who works very little or none at all would soon have an over supply of oxygen, and the human machinery would become so saturated to such a degree that it would go to pieces in a short time. But facts as well as experience explode the theory entirely.

The facts are simply these: While the day, the month and the year are indicated in nature, and the time for physical rest and reposed by the regularly recurring daily periods of darkness which indicate, there is nothing in nature indicating the division of time into weeks. The grass grows as fast, the waves dash as high, the sun shines as bright, the storm beats as fiercely, on the Sabbath as on other days. The Sabbath was instituted by God for worship, for religion, primarily, and not for rest because of [page 325] physical weariness. God did not intend that man should work himself to death. Man in his primeval condition no more needed one day in seven for physical rest than the bird of the air or the beasts of the forest. The Sabbath was made for spiritual devotion, to keep in mind the Creator, the true God, and the cessation from worldly toil (for that is the meaning of the Hebrew word for Sabbath), "ceasing," and is not solely or in a sanitary recommendation to that devotion and to the perpetuation of such morality.

No physical or set of physicians ever have demonstrated, or ever can demonstrate that man is a normal condition needs one day in seven for physical rest simply. But were this theory true, there would still be no ground for laws compelling men to take such rest. All are agreed that men need nightly rest, but who would admit the right of Congress or of the State Legislature to pass a law that everybody must go to bed every night and take so many hours of sleep? That might well be "of vastly more importance than monthly, or weekly, or yearly resting, possibly." No one can go long without daily rest, and not break down. Why does he not plead for a nightly rest law? Consistency would demand it. But the health of the people is not what he is after. There are many other things that are necessary to man's physical well being besides rest; such as food, sufficient air, bathing, recreation, etc. Why does not his lecturer stir up the people to demand laws that will require all to inhale a moral air, or to bathe or smile? Simply because he is not laboring in the interest of the health of the people in the harangue for Sunday laws. What is it all after is the religious observance of the day. But this method of bringing this about is wrong. People are not going to be made religious by law. As he said, "You might as well try to put hand-cuffs on the clouds" as to attempt this. But the attempt has often been made, however, though always only this man would reach,—a religious persecution. The King case of Tennessee, and others in that State, and the States of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Georgia, Missouri, and Arkansas are convincing proof that the enforcement of Sunday laws is the making of this very attempt. Sunday laws are dead letters only when they are enforced by the denial of a religious bigotry and intolerance. They are most convenient means for one religion's giving vent to its spite toward another with whom to does not agree. The National Reformer says they are "simply empty rhetoric before the work benches with no kneeling desks along the side." But no man, no set of men, Congress, Legislature, or municipality has any right whatever to drive men from those sides. Sunday laws are irreconcilable with civil and religious liberty. And every prosecution under [page 325] represented are to be selected, upon these cases the law will be tested.

This Baltimore Grand Jury has been made recommendations in reference to the enforcement of Sunday, but has not rested until it has made for itself a record of being the first Grand Jury in the United States to systematically undertake to revive the moribund law in law which has been permitted to survive upon the statute books.

It will be well that this fact, with all its suggestions, should be remembered as this movement progresses.

The National Reformers have selected Pittsburg as the point of departure for their efforts, and W. F. Crafts is reported as saying in a lecture there on Saturday, October 10, that "a movement would be started as an early day that would startle the citizens of the United States." And that Pittsburg had been selected as the starting point of this reform works which is to sweep the country."

All intelligent citizens should have been started long ago. It is now "high time is awake out of sleep;"
