According to a government regulation, since the 20th inst., no freight trains are to be dispatched on Sundays and holidays in Belgium. The regulation went into partial operation last June, but it was only to be operative at the discretion of the railroad authorities. The idea was to make the innovation gradual, but hereafter a rigid adherence to it will be exacted.
