# Editorial Notes

NOTWITHSTANDING the efforts of the Sunday-law hosts, of that State, re-enforced by the American Sabbath Union, California is still free from the thraldom of a Sunday law. It is pretty sure to remain so for two years at least.

Dr. WINDTHORST the leader of the Catholic party in the German Reichstag is dead. Dr. Windthorst had for years virtually held the balance of power in the politics of the German Empire, and it was he who compelled Prince Bismarck to rescind the May laws, which weighed heavily on the Roman Catholics of Germany, and deprived them of privileges enjoyed by the Protestant clergy and people.

"In the western part of Rhode Island are many Seventh-day Baptists. Recently one of the political parties selected *Saturday* as the day for the special election to Congress. Another party alleged that it was done to disfranchise the Seventh-day Baptists. A convention of Seventh-day Baptists, on Monday, February 16, resolved that they could not take part in an election held on Saturday; whereupon one candidate withdrew, declaring that he would not be in an election where any part of the citizens were disfranchised on account of their religious belief. This is probably," says the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, "as peculiar an introduction of religion into politics as has been seen."

It is stated that in a recent sermon on civil and religious liberty, Cardinal Gibbons said that the Catholic Church has always been the zealous promoter of civil and religious liberty, and that "whenever any encroachments on these sacred rights of man were perpetrated by professing members of the Catholic faith, these wrongs, far from being sanctioned by the church, were committed in palpable violation of her authority." This sounds well, but let us see what the Cardinal calls religious liberty. He says:—

> A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to *worship God* according to the dictates of a *right* conscience, and of practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God.

The words which we have set in italics are the key to the Cardinal's real sentiments. A man to enjoy religious liberty must *worship God* according to the dictates of a *right* conscience. The trouble with the Catholic Church is that it has always claimed the right to define worship to God, and to judge the conscience. Certainly the Cardinal has not abated aught from that claim. "Rome never changes," and the Cardinal is a genuine Romanist.

THE first complaint under the law forbidding the sale of cigars on Sunday, says the *Sun*, was heard in the Dorchester District Court, in Boston, a few days ago. Postmaster Jones, of the Dorchester Postoffice, was the purchaser, a druggist was the accused, and a policeman made the complaint. At the trial, the clerk who waited upon Mr. Jones testified that he had previous knowledge that Mr. Jones was a sufferer from bronchial catarrh, and that he sold the cigars to him for purely medicinal use. Mr. Jones corroborated this testimony. Judge Churchill read the law which permits the sale of cigars on Sunday as a drug, gave his decision that Mr. Jones was entitled to his regular medicine, and dismissed the complaint.

Of Sunday observance in Great Britain and Ireland, the New York *Observer* says:—

> Mr. Lawson, M. P., has given notice of a motion for opening museums on Sundays. There are three hundred and fifty-seven museums, galleries, and public libraries in the United Kingdom. After an agitation extending over thirty-five years, twenty-five are opened on the Lord's day, and the attendants are deprived of Sunday rest. At the Guildhall and Liverpool efforts to open the museums and public libraries on Sundays have failed. The attempt of the New York *Herald* to establish itself as a daily newspaper seven days a week in London has signally failed. No daily newspaper in Great Britain publishes a Sunday edition.

Referring to the English Colonies, the same paper remarks that Sydney Sunday concerts for money have been suppressed. In Victoria a law has been passed prohibiting the publication and sale of Sunday newspapers.

The Sunday-law agitation is world-wide and means much more than many think. It is especially significant when we consider the fact that it is *one* thing that Protestants and Catholics are agreed in forcing alike upon Jews, non-religionists, and seventh-day Christians.

It seems not at all improbable that the Reformed Presbyterian Church will be rent in twain over the action of the Pittsburg Presbytery, in suspending seven popular young ministers for holding that it is not a sin to vote under a Constitution which does not recognize God as the source of all power. Writing to the *Christian Nation*, Rev. C. Wylie says:—

> The Reformed Presbyterian Church presents the appearance of two companies of an army engaged in conflict with each other. Time and strength which ought to be employed in combating the foes of Christ and his cause are employed in bitter conflict among ourselves. One stage of the conflict is already past. The result is, seven young ministers have been suspended. The next stage will be reached at the approaching meeting of Synod. The subject in controversy is not local, but concerns the entire church. It is expected that the whole church, ministers, elders, deacons and members will rank themselves on the one side or the other.

This statement being true, the outlook for the Reformed Presbyterians, as a body, is not promising, "Revolutions never go backward," and it is not at all likely that this revolt in the Pittsburg Presbytery can be quelled even by vote of the Synod.

A REPORTER of the *World* has been investigating the matter, and says that the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in this city, is open on Sunday—not indeed to the public, as many, especially of the working people, are painfully aware—but to favored friends of the Trustees. Provided with one of the printed tickets which the Trustees, or some of them, use for the purpose, their friends can visit the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday, and have it all to themselves. Half a dozen employees are kept on duty there on Sunday, at public expense, to open doors and care for the coats of the visitors.

Which only shows that which we have often had occasion to remark, namely, that there is a good deal of humbug about the whole Sunday-closing business. The reporter watched the side door for some time and saw a number of people enter and leave the building. The greatest number seemed to have first attended church somewhere, as some of them carried prayer-books. It would be well if both they and the Board of Trustees would carry their religious studies far enough not only to carry prayer books, and to read the Golden Rule, but to become imbued with its principles. If the Museum is a proper place for a select few on Sunday, it would be a proper place for the general public, especially for those who can not afford the time to visit it upon other days.

THE *Plaindealer*, a Michigan paper, tells of the sentence imposed by the Tennessee court upon R. M. King, for Sunday work, and then says: "There seems a strong probability that these terribly outrageous sentences will soon be the rule all over the country; for, without the most earnest and active effort in opposition by every liberty-loving citizen, fearfully rigid and obnoxious and unjust Sunday laws will be enacted, and vigorously enforced by the general Government."
