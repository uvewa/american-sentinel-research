It is stated that in a recent sermon on civil and religious liberty, Cardinal Gibbons said that the Catholic Church has always been the zealous promoter of civil and religious liberty, and that "whenever any encroachments on these sacred rights of man were perpetrated by professing members of the Catholic faith, these wrongs, far from being sanctioned by the church, were committed in palpable violation of her authority." This sounds well, but let us see what the Cardinal calls religious liberty. He says:—

> A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to worship God according to the dictates of a *right conscience*, and of practicing a form of religion most *in accordance with his duties to God*.

The words which we have set in italics are the key to the Cardinal's real sentiments. A man to enjoy religious liberty must worship God according to the dictates of a *right* conscience. The trouble with the Catholic Church is that it has always claimed the right to define worship to God, and to judge the conscience. Certainly the Cardinal has not abated aught from that claim. "Rome never changes," and the Cardinal is a genuine Romanist.
