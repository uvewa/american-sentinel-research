It seems not at all improbable that the Reformed Presbyterian Church will be rent in twain over the action of the Pittsburg Presbytery, in suspending seven popular young ministers for holding that it is not a sin to vote under a Constitution which does not recognize God as the source of all power. Writing to the *Christian Nation*, Rev. C. Wylie says:—

> The Reformed Presbyterian Church presents the appearance of two companies of an army engaged in conflict with each other. Time and strength which ought to be employed in combating the foes of Christ and his cause are employed in bitter conflict among ourselves. One stage of the conflict is already past. The result is, seven young ministers have been suspended. The next stage will be reached at the approaching meeting of Synod. The subject in controversy is not local, but concerns the entire church. It is expected that the whole church, ministers, elders, deacons and members will rank themselves on the one side or the other.

This statement being true, the outlook for the Reformed Presbyterians, as a body, is not promising, "Revolutions never go backward," and it is not at all likely that this revolt in the Pittsburg Presbytery can be quelled even by vote of the Synod.
