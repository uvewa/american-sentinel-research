On this point, too, Mill emphasizes the assertion made by Jefferson, and utters a warning that should be heeded by every lover of liberty. He says:

"But unhappily there is no security in the state of the public mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution which has lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits. What is boasted of at the present time as the revival of religion, is always in narrow and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and where there is strong permanent leaves of intolerance in the feeling of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of this country, it needs but little to provoke them into actively persecuting those whom this have never ceased to think proper objects of persecution."
