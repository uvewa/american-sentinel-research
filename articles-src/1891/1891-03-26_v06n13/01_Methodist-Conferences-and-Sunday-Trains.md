A WRITER in the *Advance* reports that the General Passenger Agent of an important railroad running into St Louis, and a very good friend, fires at me spontaneously two letters which have just come to him in the regular course of business, appending to them some plain-spoken comments. He says: "You often speak about Sunday trains. Here is the great Methodist Episcopal Church applying from two points on our line for Sunday excursion trains; and they not only want to get the people to the Conference, but want to speculate on it, making something for the benefit of the churches. What can a soulless corporation do under the circumstances?" The enclosed letters are applications for trains to run to the annual Conference only on Sunday, and, as my correspondent says, are both manifestly inspired by the prospect of money-making, being full of questions as to the control of fares, right to pick up way passengers, etc. In response to inquiry I learn that these applications are not unusual, but that some Methodist Conferences get such trains each year.

Well, why should not every Methodist Conference get all of such trains that it can each year? There is no harm in it, and there is no sin in it. That part of the matter is all right, only we wish the Methodist Conference would stop calling for laws to compel people to keep Sunday. If the Methodist Conferences would have such sermons preached all the time as we have heard from some of the Methodist ministers and bishops, we know that the people would get a thousand times more good from the preaching, than they would get harm from the Sunday train that carries them to hear the preaching. Let all the Methodist Conferences join in this good work.
