EVERY discussion of political questions, as a matter of course, stimulates research; and research often brings to light very important contributions to our political literature. As an illustration of this is the new work entitled, "American State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation," compiled and annotated by William Addison Blakely, Counselor at Law, Ann Arbor, Michigan. This octavo volume of nearly four hundred pages, contains some rare documents on religious legislation that have long since been out of print and are only now and then seen in an obscure corner of some large library. These old papers are important not only for the sound political principles enunciated, but also to show the ideas that the founders of the American political system held concerning the relation of civil government and religion.

The question of Sunday legislation is not by any means a new question. The editor of this work has half a dozen or more old reports of Congress on the question, besides a number of memorials and petitions—one from the State Legislature of Indiana—all matter exceedingly interesting to those interested in any way in this question. The following is from a review of the work by the *University of Michigan Daily*:—

> The work contains the ideas and opinions of many of the founders of our American political system upon Sunday legislation, extracts from the national and State Constitutions, and other Government documents bearing on the question. Among others there are the opinions and decisions of Jefferson, Madison, John Adams, Patrick Henry, Col. R. M. Johnson, Chief Justice Terry, Justice Orton, Judge Cooley and General Grant. The editor has made a careful selection of documentary evidence relating to the Sunday question, and has by these extracts and reports not only shown Sunday legislation to be contrary to the spirit of many of our Constitutions and to the judgment of some of our leading statesmen, but he has also made a valuable contribution to the literature of this subject. The copious annotations and foot-notes give evidence of careful and painstaking work.

In addition to the foregoing features, it contains, in whole or in part, the decisions of the Supreme Courts of the States of Ohio, California, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Arkansas, on the question of the constitutionality of Sunday laws, and of the reading of the Bible in the public schools, with numerous notes from various other decisions in England and America.

All the Sunday laws of the United States, together with the provisions of the State Constitutions guaranteeing or restricting religious liberty, are also accurately transcribed in full from the original statute books of the several States and Territories.

This new publication will prove a valuable help to all persons studying the question of the justice of Sunday laws from the standpoint of an American. It is an octavo volume, marginal notes, extra laid paper, vellum cloth, gilt top, uncut edges, price $2.50. A popular edition is also issued which is sold at $1.25. Address the editor, William Addison Blakely, Corresponding Secretary of the Religious Liberty Society, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

No intolerance is equal to religious intolerance. It is just as far removed from the truth, and the freedom and breadth inspired by truth, as the devil is from God. None can afford to place themselves in the clutches of this monster of the Dark Ages, and all should remember that our only protection from it consists in creating and maintaining a clear, full, and sharply defined separation of Church and State, especially in educational work.—*Independent Patriot*, *Lamoni, Iowa.*
