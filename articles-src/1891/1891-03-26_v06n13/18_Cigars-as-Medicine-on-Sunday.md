THE first complaint under the law forbidding the sale of cigars on Sunday, says the Sun, was heard in the Dorchester District Court, in Boston, a few days ago. Postmaster Jones, of the Dorchester Post-office, was the purchaser, a druggist was the accused, and a policeman made the complaint. At the trial, the clerk who waited upon Mr. Jones testified that he had previous knowledge that Mr. Jones was a sufferer from bronchial catarrh, and that he sold the cigars to him for purely medicinal use. Mr. Jones corroborated this testimony. Judge Churchill read the law which permits the sale of cigars on Sunday as a drug, gave his decision that Mr. Jones was entitled to his regular medicine, and dismissed the complaint.
