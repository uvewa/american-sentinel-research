No intolerance is equal to religious intolerance. It is just as far removed from the truth, and the freedom and breadth inspired by truth, as the devil is from God. None can afford to place themselves in the clutches of this monster of the Dark Ages, and all should remember that our only protection from it consists in creating and maintaining a clear, full, and sharply defined separation of Church and State, especially in educational work.
