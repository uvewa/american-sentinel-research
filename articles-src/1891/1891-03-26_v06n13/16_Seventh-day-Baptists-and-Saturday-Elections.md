"In the western part of Rhode Island are many Seventh-day Baptists. Recently one of the political parties selected Saturday as the day for the special election to Congress. Another party alleged that it was done to disfranchise the Seventh-day Baptists. A convention of Seventh-day Baptists, on Monday, February 16, resolved that they could not take part in an election held on Saturday; whereupon one candidate withdrew, declaring that he would not be in an election where any part of the citizens were disfranchised on account of their religious belief. This is probably," says the Christian Advocate, of this city, "as peculiar an introduction of religion into politics as has been seen."
