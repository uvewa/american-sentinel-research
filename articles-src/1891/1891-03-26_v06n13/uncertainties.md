## 10_Editorial-Notes.md

### Page 104, Left Column, Item 1 (California Sunday law)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "It is purely a victory for working people and for two days of rest."
- **Confidence:** LOW — The small text at end of this item is difficult to resolve; the sentence structure is unclear
- **Reason:** The scan quality makes the final sentence of this short item ambiguous

### Page 104, Left Column, Item 2 (Windthorst)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "signalized the triumph of priestcraft enjoyed by the Protestant clergy and people"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "triumph of priestcraft" is a best guess; the phrase is partially unclear
- **Reason:** Small text and scan artifacts make the concluding phrase difficult to read with certainty

### Page 104, Left Column, Item 3 (Rhode Island Seventh-day Baptists)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** 'the first instance in this country, of a city, or "a peculiar as introducing the most and religion as has been seen."'
- **Confidence:** LOW — This closing sentence does not read fluently; the scan quality makes several words in the last two lines very difficult to discern
- **Reason:** The original text likely says something different; the scan resolution in this area is poor

### Page 104, Left Column, Item 4 (Cardinal Gibbons)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "the Cardinal has not abated angel from that claim"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "abated angel" does not make clear sense; possibly "abated aught" or "abated an iota"
- **Reason:** The word between "abated" and "from" is very difficult to read at this resolution

### Page 104, Left Column, Item 4 (Cardinal Gibbons quote block)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience. A form of religious worship must be accepted which enables the believer to most sincerely God according to the dictates of a right conscience."
- **Confidence:** LOW — This quoted passage does not read completely fluently; several words in the middle are uncertain
- **Reason:** The block quote text is very small and the scan quality is poor in this section

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 6 (Great Britain/Ireland museums)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "the annual returns show plenty of rest. At the Edinburgh..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — "show plenty of rest" does not seem idiomatic; likely misread
- **Reason:** Small text in the quoted block is difficult to resolve

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 6 (Great Britain/Ireland museums continued)
- **Transcribed as:** "A colony is allotted a separate seven days a week in London"
- **Confidence:** LOW — This sentence structure is awkward and likely contains misreadings
- **Reason:** The scan is difficult to read in this quoted passage

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 7 (English Colonies)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "the to-day Sunday concerts for money have been prohibited in Victoria a law has been passed forbidding the politicians and sale of Sunday newspapers"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "the politicians and sale" seems wrong; likely "the publication and sale"
- **Reason:** Small quoted text is unclear

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 8 (Reformed Presbyterian Church)
- **Transcribed as:** "suspending seven people young ministers"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "people young ministers" is awkward; likely "promising young ministers" or just "young ministers"
- **Reason:** The word between "seven" and "young" is not clearly legible

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 9-10 (Metropolitan Museum / World reporter)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple sentences in this long passage are uncertain
- **Confidence:** LOW — The entire Museum passage is difficult to read due to small text and scan quality
- **Reason:** Several phrases do not read fluently, suggesting misreadings throughout

### Page 104, Right Column, Item 11 (Michigan judge / R. M. King)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "THE PITTSBURG, a Michigan judge, tells of the sentences..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — "THE PITTSBURG" followed by "a Michigan judge" is contradictory; likely the opening word is different (possibly a person's name or publication)
- **Reason:** The opening of this item is very unclear
- **Also:** "continue and to be done in the name of the country" — likely misread; "trifling civil right obstructions" — uncertain

### Page 103, Left Column, University of Michigan Faculty review — list of names
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Col. R. M. Johnson, Amos Ellicott, Perry, Justice Story, Judge Cooley and General Grant"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "Amos Ellicott" and "Perry" are uncertain; these do not correspond to well-known American founders. The names could be "Oliver Ellsworth" or other historical figures, but the letter shapes in the scan appear to read "Amos Ellicott" and "Perry" as separate entries.
- **Reason:** The review quote is set in smaller type and the scan resolution makes individual letters difficult to distinguish with certainty.

### Page 103, Left Column, final paragraph — "especially international work"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "especially international work"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "international" seems contextually odd in a sentence about separation of Church and State; possibly "institutional" or another word
- **Reason:** The word is in small italic type and difficult to read with certainty at this resolution
