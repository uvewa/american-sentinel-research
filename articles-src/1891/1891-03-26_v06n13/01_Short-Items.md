RELIGION is contented with the freedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the place which it occupies. The empire of religion is never more surely established than when it reigns in the hearts of men, unsupported by aught besides its native strength.—*De Tocqueville*.

As American citizens, we hold to the American doctrine that human government relates solely to external affairs, and does not reach, and is not intended to control, our spiritual relations. Civil government covers the relations of citizens to each other, and to the State. Divine government concerns our relations, both individually and collectively, to the Supreme Being, and does not come under the control of State enactments. The only office of civil government relating thereto is to "hold its hands off."

A WRITER in the *Advance* reports that the General Passenger Agent of an important railroad running into St. Louis, and a very good friend, fires at me spontaneously two letters which have just come to him in the regular course of business, appending to them some plain-spoken comments. He says: "You often speak about Sunday trains. Here is the great Methodist Episcopal Church applying from two points on our line for Sunday excursion trains; and they not only want to get the people to the Conference, but want to speculate on it, making something for the benefit of the churches. What can a soulless corporation do under the circumstances?" The enclosed letters are applications for trains to run to the annual Conference only on Sunday, and, as my correspondent says, are both manifestly inspired by the prospect of money-making, being full of questions as to the control of fares, right to pick up way passengers, etc. In response to inquiry I learn that these applications are not unusual, but that some Methodist Conferences get such trains each year.

Well, why should not every Methodist Conference get all of such trains that it can each year? There is no harm in it, and there is no sin in it. That part of the matter is all right, only we wish the Methodist Conference would stop calling for laws to compel people to keep Sunday. If the Methodist Conferences would have such sermons preached all the time as we have heard from some of the Methodist ministers and bishops, we know that the people would get a thousand times more good from the preaching, than they would get harm from the Sunday train that carries them to hear the preaching. Let all the Methodist Conferences join in this good work.

THE object of the Sunday reform movement is not single—it means more than merely a release from compulsory labor. It would punish voluntary labor, other than laid down by its narrow limits—which is rest and worship. Whenever we enact a compulsory worship law, we shall have turned back the hands of progress and freedom to the days of darkness and horror implied by the "Blue Laws" and the Inquisition.—*Western Herald*.

WHETHER men behave themselves from right motives or from wrong is a point of vital importance from the religious point of view. From the secular point of view, which is that of the State, it is of no consequence whatever.—*New York Times*.
