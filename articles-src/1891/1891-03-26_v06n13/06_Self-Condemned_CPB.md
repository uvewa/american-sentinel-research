SOME months since, in remarking upon the liberality of Thomas Paine, we said:—

> An important difference between Paine and many of his modern disciples, is, that whereas he conceded to others the same freedom of opinion that he claimed for himself, the average "Freethinker" of the present day is about as intolerant as a Jesuit.

The editor of *Freethought* was very indignant at this statement, and called upon us either to cite proofs or else acknowledge that we had made a false statement. We did neither, but simply waited. Now the very gentleman who waxed so wroth over this matter, though no longer editor of the *Freethought*, furnishes us in that paper abundant evidence that our statement was true, at least, so far as he is concerned.

March 7, he says:—

> Most Christians fail and make an assignment to the devil trying to discover any reason why they should oppose religious exercises in the Legislature or anywhere else, and they are excusable in doing so. If religion is a good and beneficent thing, the more places it can be found the better. Only people who know that Christianity is a fraud can have a sufficient excuse for objecting to its enforcement, so long as they advocate the enforcement of anything.

That is to say that in opposing religious exercises in legislative bodies and elsewhere under State patronage, Christians virtually admit that religion is not a good thing; for, says Mr. Macdonald, in substance, *if religion be a good thing it ought to be enforced*. In other words, he admits that did he believe in religion he would be in favor of enforcing it; that is, he would be a National Reformer of the most pronounced type. But he is not a believer in religion, he is an infidel, and furthermore he believes, or, at least, professes to believe, *infidelity* to be a good thing, a very good thing; not simply that it is a matter of indifference what men believe, but that it is very much better for men not to believe in religion, that is, not to believe in the Christian religion. It follows just as naturally as night follows day, and as logically as it is possible for any conclusion to follow a reason, that had the ex-editor of *Freethought* the power he would enforce infidelity upon everybody, at least to the extent of giving it State support, and of putting it everywhere that the State has the power to put it. In short, with him tolerance is not a matter of principle at all, but simply of power.

Does not the ex-editor of *Freethought* stand self-condemned? And if he is a representative Freethinker, did we not well say that "the average Freethinker is about as intolerant as a Jesuit"? We know that there are many noble exceptions, but we fear that as a class Freethinkers are neither more free themselves nor more liberal toward others than are other men, and why should they be? for they deify human nature, and human nature is intolerant.

We maintain that the truth or falsity of religion has nothing whatever to do with the question of the propriety of giving it governmental recognition and support. To be of any value religion must be free; service to God must be voluntary; God has made it so, and men and governments should leave it as God has made it. Indeed, in the very nature of the case, it can not be otherwise without destroying religion itself and the reasons for its very existence. In order for it to remain a good and beneficent thing, religion must be kept separate from the State. Mr. Macdonald should remember the words of Paine:—

> *All religions are, in their nature, mild and benign, and united with principles of morality. . . . How is it that they lose their native mildness, and become morose and intolerant? By engendering the State with the Church, a sort of mule animal, capable only of destroying, and not of breeding up, is produced, called the Church established by law. . . . The Inquisition in Spain does not proceed from the religion originally professed, but from this mule animal engendered between the Church and State.*

To prevent this engendering, the Church and the State must be kept entirely separate, and who has as good a right, or who can so consistently insist that they shall be kept separate as those who above all others are interested in the Church and in preserving its purity? In the Scriptures no sin is denounced more strongly than is the sin of spiritual adultery, and who more than Christians, or who indeed but Christians, can consistently insist that the Church shall not again prostitute herself to the State? that it be not again said of her, "The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her"?
