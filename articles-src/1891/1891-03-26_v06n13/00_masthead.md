Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political.—Thomas Jefferson.

RELIGION is contented with the freedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the place which it occupies. The empire of religion is never more surely established than when it reigns in the hearts of men, unsupported by aught besides it native strength.—De Tocqueville.

As American citizens, we hold to the American doctrine that human government relates solely to external affairs, and does not reach, and is not intended to control, our spiritual relations. Civil government covers the relations of citizens to each other, and to the State. Divine government concerns our relations, both individually and collectively, to the Supreme Being, and does not come under the control of State enactments. The only office of civil government relating thereto is to "hold its hands off."
