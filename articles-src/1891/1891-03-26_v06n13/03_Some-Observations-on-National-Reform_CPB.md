THE following from the *Christian Nation*, an organ of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, will be of interest to the readers of THE SENTINEL:—

> A subscriber has propounded to us a series of questions, asking for our reply to each one.
>
> *Question 1.*—Would it not be the proper way to settle the trouble in the church to leave it to a vote of the church whether members can vote and hold office? Would it not be all right to petition Synod to do this?
>
> *Reply.*—The church has already declared that voting and holding office under an immoral Government is sin.
>
> *Question 2.*—Is not voting and paying taxes the same thing, or on the same principle: one helps to put the man in office while the other pays his salary.
>
> *Reply.*—Government is of God, for the good of those who are under the Government. Because men have made it immoral, does not relieve us, as Christians, from paying our just proportion of its legitimate expenses for promoting the temporal welfare of the people. Neither does our paying this proportion involve us in the sin of the Government. Christ paid taxes for the support of a government which was in open rebellion to him.
>
> *Question 3.*—Does not the Bible tell us to choose out men for office?
>
> *Reply.*—Yes, it does. And when this Government is ordained and established in God's name, as was the government to the citizens of which that instruction was given, we will be ready and happy "to choose out men for office," and take a few offices ourselves occasionally.

We suppose that inasmuch as "the church has said that voting is sin," those who are in "the church" will have to abide by that decision or else get out of "the church." It would seem, however, that it would be altogether more satisfactory to Christians to know what the Bible teaches on the subject than to know what "the church has already declared."

In the eighth chapter of Acts is recorded the baptism of "a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasure." It is related that Philip preached the gospel to this man, and that coming to water he baptized him, but no hint is given that Philip required the eunuch to resign his office. Evidently Philip was not a Reformed Presbyterian. And it is also evident that at that time "the church" had not decided that, "holding office under an immoral Government is sin."

Another thought. Are we to understand from the *Christian Nation* that only "moral governments" are ordained of God? What about the Roman Government under which Paul lived? Is it not much more reasonable and much more scriptural to believe that by the very act of placing social beings, together in this world, God ordained that they should govern one another in social matters? that he ordained that civil government should exist? and that that government should be carried on by the people either directly or by chosen representatives, or rulers, irrespective of their moral characters? To hold otherwise outlaws all government except the Church, or that which the Church shall endorse, and really makes government a thing to be enjoyed only by those who are religious, or at least by those who live among those who are religious. And then only the religious have any right to participate in it, which brings us again to the National Reform conclusion that infidels should be disfranchised, or banished, and that only Christian men should be eligible for office. Well may the National Reformers say: "We will be ready and happy to choose out men for office; and take a few of the offices ourselves occasionally." Certainly they will; they will see to it that the offices are properly filled—by themselves.
