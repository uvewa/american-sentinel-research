TO THE EDITOR: In the *Christian Nation*, of November 19, we find the following:—

> A committee of ministers and laymen, headed by Dr. I. N. Hays, of Pittsburg, Pa., about three weeks ago called on President Harrison and urged that Christ be suitably acknowledged in his forthcoming Thanksgiving proclamation. We regret to place on record that he refused the committee's request, stating that he did not believe it would be in harmony with our institutions.

The same request was made the year previous with like result. Some have always held that the Government of this country is not Christian. This view is confirmed by the President, who, of all men, should understand the character of the Government of which he is the head. Now a question arises: May an individual or nation approach God apart from Jesus Christ the Mediator, and the Governor of nations? It is written, "Thrones and dominions, principalities and powers, were created by Him and for Him." Will the editor please consider it and speak his mind?

SAMUEL ALLEN,
Balm, Pa., Jan. 8, 1891.

This demand for a formal recognition of the sovereignty of Christ appears to have its origin in a looseness of phraseology and a consequent confusion of ideas. It may be well enough in ordinary conversation to call a people who, as a whole, accept the Christian religion theoretically, a Christian nation, because no one is deceived by that expression. But before basing an argument on any word it is necessary to make sure that the word, as used, expresses an exact and correct idea.

Does Mr. Allen really believe, that in the proper significance of the word, the American people are a Christian Nation? And if they are not a Christian Nation how can they possibly have a Christian Government? A Christian, strictly speaking, is a man who believes on the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Saviour, and who, because of his acceptance of Christ, has been adopted into the family of God. Are all the people of this country Christians? Are there even a majority of Christians in the Nation? If not, how can we possibly be a Christian Nation?

Jesus himself said "My kingdom is not of this world." It is no part of his plan under the present dispensation to impose his authority on unwilling hearts. An official recognition of Christ as the ruler of this country would be a recognition of a claim which he has never authorized to be made on his behalf, and would be a misstatement of fact. There can be no question about God's supremacy in all matters to the extent to which he sees proper to interfere; that he overrules even the actions of wicked men to work out his plans is a truth which can not be successfully disputed; but the personal sovereignty of Christ is, as yet, a sovereignty of love only. He reigns by love in the hearts of those who voluntarily receive him as their King.

It would indeed be a glorious thing if Christ was crowned King by even one nation upon earth, but that can only come to pass through the action of the individuals of which that nation is composed. It could not be done by a simple vote of the majority, even if the majority were so disposed.

Would it not be a mockery for the President to announce, officially, that Christ is Lord paramount in this country when every smart schoolboy knows that the devil has a great deal more to do with the Government of the country and with the habits of the people than Christ has?

Brooklyn, the home of the *Christian Nation*'s editor, from which Mr. Allen quotes, is called "the City of Churches." Surely there, if anywhere, the fact of Christ's rulership should be visible. Yet what do we see? Less than 300 Protestant churches and more than 3,000 saloons, not to speak of other establishments whose business it is to promote the interests of the devil's kingdom. The churches are open for business one day in the week, and for an hour or two at different times during the week; the saloons are open for business at least six days in the week and eighteen hours a day. The people who support the churches think they are doing as much as can reasonably be expected of them in subscribing to building funds, paying pew rents, and attending a few stated services; the people who support the saloons go there for their own pleasure and think very little of the money that it costs them. The simple fact is that a very small proportion of Brooklyn's population of 800,000 serve Christ a little, and for the most part as a matter of obligation; a very much larger proportion of the same population serve the devil a great deal and that willingly.

And the other big cities, with the exception of Philadelphia, and, perhaps, Boston, are much worse than Brooklyn. In the country districts there is much less open or visible wickedness, but there is also much less active and aggressive goodness. The difference between the country and the city in the matter of moral and spiritual tone is, therefore, more a matter of intensity than of quality.

Then, look at the character of our governments. In New York City, Tammany Hall reigns, and Tammany is dominated by saloon-keepers, some of them of the most disreputable character; would it not make the devil laugh if our Tammany Mayor should issue a proclamation declaring that Christ is the Supreme Ruler, and that he derives his authority from Christ? Or, to take a step higher up, how would such a proclamation look if issued by Governor Hill, who is in league with Tammany and owes his office to his shrewdness in the use of the most indefensible kind of political tactics?

And, whatever may be the opinion of the reader as to the character of our Federal Government in the hands of those now in charge of it, an official recognition of Christ's over-lordship would be quite as incongruous coming from Washington as it would be if issued from Albany or from our own City Hall; for the difference between the Kingdom of Christ and the government of this world is not a mere matter of degree, but one of kind. His kingdom is a spiritual and not a material one, whether good or bad.

If it were merely a question as to whether goodness or badness was the most prevalent feature, then every Democrat would be bound to assume that the devil is king wherever the Republican party is in power, and every Republican would be bound to assume that the devil is king wherever the Democratic party holds power—that is, if they each believe the accounts of things given in their respective party organs.

The very absurdity of this suggestion is, of itself, a sufficient reply to the demand that Christ should be recognized by a government under the control of one of these parties, or of any other party, as the personal sovereign of this country.

We who do joyfully accept Christ as our Lord and Master, can do better work for him than to demand a formal recognition of his authority from those who in fact, and in their personal conduct, repudiate that authority.

Let us see first that we set his will before us as the one thing to be accomplished in our lives both in our private and public relations. Let us also seek earnestly to do all that we can to encourage goodness and to discourage badness. And above all, let us strive to hasten the coming of the Kingdom of Christ by persuading all whom we can persuade to forsake sin and consecrate their lives to his service.

And as citizens of this "alien country," let us, who are, by virtue of the new birth, natives of the heavenly Jerusalem, seek the peace of the land in which our lot is providentially cast, as the Jewish exiles were commanded to seek the peace of the Babylonian empire while held in bondage there.
