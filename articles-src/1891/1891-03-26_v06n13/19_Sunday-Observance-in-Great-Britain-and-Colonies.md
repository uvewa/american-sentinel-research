OF Sunday observance in Great Britain and Ireland, the New York Observer says:—

> Mr. Lawson, M. P., has given notice of a motion for opening museums on Sundays. There are three hundred and fifty-seven museums, galleries, and public libraries in the United Kingdom. After an agitation extending over thirty-five years, twenty-five are opened on the Lord's day, and the attendants are deprived of Sunday rest. At the Guildhall and Liverpool efforts to open the museums and public libraries on Sundays have failed. The attempt of the New York Herald to establish itself as a daily newspaper seven days a week in London has signally failed. No daily newspaper in Great Britain publishes a Sunday edition.

Referring to the English Colonies, the same paper remarks that

> Sydney Sunday concerts for money have been suppressed. In Victoria a law has been passed prohibiting the publication and sale of Sunday newspapers.

The Sunday-law agitation is world-wide and means much more than many think. It is especially significant when we consider the fact that it is one thing that Protestants and Catholics are agreed in forcing alike upon Jews, non-religionists, and seventh-day Christians.
