A REPORTER of the World has been investigating the matter, and says that the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in this city, is open on Sunday—not indeed to the public, as many, especially of the working people, are painfully aware—but

> to favored friends of the Trustees. Provided with one of the printed tickets which the Trustees, or some of them, use for the purpose, their friends can visit the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday, and have it all to themselves. Half a dozen employees are kept on duty there on Sunday, at public expense, to open doors and care for the coats of the visitors. Which only shows that which we have often had occasion to remark, namely, that there is a good deal of humbug about the whole Sunday-closing business. The reporter watched the side door for some time and saw a number of people enter and leave the building. The greatest number seemed to have first attended church somewhere, as some of them carried prayer-books. It would be well if both they and the Board of Trustees would carry their religious studies far enough not only to carry prayer books, and to read the Golden Rule, but to become imbued with its principles. If the Museum is a proper place for a select few on Sunday, it would be a proper place for the general public, especially for those who can not afford the time to visit it upon other days.
