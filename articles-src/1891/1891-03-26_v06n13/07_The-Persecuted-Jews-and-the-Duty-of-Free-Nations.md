No one who impartially studies the melancholy past of the Jews can rise from the perusal of their history but with the mingled feelings of admiration and commiseration—admiration for their greatness, and glorious achievements, and commiseration for their sad decline and cruel sufferings.

But you say this is a matter of the past and belongs to the dark periods of barbarism! Not so. In the five million Jews who live to-day in Russia we have the most abject subjects of oppression and persecution.

To publish in full the awful experiences suffered by the unhappy victims of the anti-Jewish restrictive laws of Russia would startle the world with some of the most terrible tragedies of martyred innocence, devotion and patriotism ever written in any language.

In order to have an intelligent comprehension of the full significance of these infamous anti-Jewish laws, it is necessary to study the general attitude of the Russian Government toward the Jews. It is well known that Russia retains the worst form of mediaeval darkness and despotism, inasmuch as with her Church and State are identical. Those who do not belong to the orthodox Russian Church are not regarded as true Russians. Jews are, therefore, both heretics and aliens before the Russian laws. But it may be inquired, do not the followers of other creeds suffer with the Jews under the application of the same principle? By no means. This exclusive principle is not carried out in reference to other religionists, because of the fear on the part of the Russian Government that such action might result in serious international complications. And this fear is not without reasonable foundation. But it must be remembered that the Jews in Russia have no natural protectors: No national church can take up their cause, and to no paternal government or fatherland can they make their appeal on the score of obligation. It is, however, above all things, this truly pathetic picture of the helplessness and friendlessness of these persecuted Russian Jews that gives strength and eloquence to the mute appeal of their cruel wrongs and heartrending sufferings.

To show the hideous character of the spirit that animates the whole Russian system, it is only necessary for a Jew to become a convert to the Russian Church, in order to be immediately freed from all the degrading restrictions on his freedom of movement and his choice of a profession. He is also helped pecuniarily by a stated sum down and a release from taxation for a specified term. If he is married, his conversion procures him a divorce.

By a profession of conversion to the Russian faith a Jew may also escape the consequences of any misdeed against a fellow-Jew, for, to quote the Russian code, "in actions concerning Jews who have embraced Christianity, Jews may not be admitted as witnesses if an objection is raised against such admission." All that a Jew, therefore, need do in order to escape any legal process against him by a brother Jew is to be converted to the Russian Church, and his victim is powerless to secure satisfaction. And yet, notwithstanding all these powerful temptations held out to them to abandon their religious convictions and traditions, they still cling to their faith with all the fervor that characterized their ancient devotion.

It is difficult to bring home to the minds of the citizens of free nations the misery and degradation caused by this diabolical system of legislative and administrative persecution of Russian Jews. Our sympathies are stunned at their very source by the awful spectacle of a whole community—an entire race—crushed beneath a system of studied injustice and oppression on the part of a great and so-called civilized government.

It is now high time for the free nations of the world to utter their protest against this system of barbarous despotism, and to demand of the Russian Government that its Jewish subjects shall enjoy at least the elementary rights of human beings, liberty of movement, freedom in choice of a career, and equality with all orderly citizens before the law.
