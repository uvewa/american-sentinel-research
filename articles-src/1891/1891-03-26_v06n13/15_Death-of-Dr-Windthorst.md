DR. WINDTHORST the leader of the Catholic party in the German Reichstag is dead. Dr. Windthorst had for years virtually held the balance of power in the politics of the German Empire, and it was he who compelled Prince Bismarck to rescind the May laws, which weighed heavily on the Roman Catholics of Germany, and deprived them of privileges enjoyed by the Protestant clergy and people.
