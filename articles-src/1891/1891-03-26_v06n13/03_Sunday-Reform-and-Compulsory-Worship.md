THE object of the Sunday reform movement is not single—it means more than merely a release from compulsory labor. It would punish voluntary labor, other than laid down by its narrow limits—which is rest and worship. Whenever we enact a compulsory worship law, we shall have turned back the hands of progress and freedom to the days of darkness and horror implied by the "Blue Laws" and the Inquisition.
