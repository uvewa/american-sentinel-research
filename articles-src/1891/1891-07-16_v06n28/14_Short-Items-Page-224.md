POLICEMAN BUTTERFIELD arrested Saul Kallan, a storekeeper of Mott Broadway, for selling him a glass of milk on Sunday, June 27. Mr. Miller was locked up in the police station several hours before he could obtain bail, when the case came to trial before Justice Ryan he was discharged.

"Say, young man, I just broke my magnified," said Policeman by Bridget to the dry goods store at 11 Division street, one Saturday recently. "Will you give me a new glass?" put a very uncomfortable going passed his way. "When the package not going his wrapping up, he arrested the clerk for violating a Sunday law. The next prisoner before the Justice, was Joseph Kallan, a shoe dealer of 66 East Houston. Policeman Conway hastily entered his place, and said: "Give me a bottle of shoe blacking. I want it for my wife. She's in a hurry to go to church." Kallan gave him the article and he was arrested. The Justice before whom the prisoners were arraigned considered these arresting, saying that "it does not add to the dignity of the police force of this city for patrolmen to be permitted to [page 224]

putting all classes of citizens into traps on Sunday and give to a John Knox church to worship. This would be mild revolution, and the harm done could easily be repaired without loss of limb or life. Honest treatment of the Sabbath situation is freedom of the responsibility and citizen of preservation. Give a full a big dose of his own medicine if you wish to protect yourself from his reform notions.

This would be an exceedingly dangerous experiment. It is sometimes very difficult matter to secure the revolted crowd in half, as has been demonstrated in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Both of these States have Sunday laws of the worst description, and in both there have been cases of genuine persecution for conscience' sake, yet such is the strength of religious bigotry and intolerance that all efforts to secure a repeal of the injustice laws have failed. There is danger in the plan proposed by the *Graphic.*

MANY years ago the English clericals, to enforce a nonsensical interpretation of Law; in it, exceed the necessities of a law forbidding a man to marry the sister of his deceased wife. Notwithstanding repeated efforts to secure the repeal of the law which ought not to have been enacted in the first place, it is still upon the statute books of England, a living witness to the folly of all religious legislation.

> Boys in a violation of law to play ball and marbles on Sunday, and we would suggest you to kindly warning into your one, that if you indulge in them any more on, on the Sabbath you will be pulled and fined. Now don't you do it.

> These boys must belong to the same family as Mr. Crafts' "little enthusiasts," and they are not to be restrained by the Sunday school injunction, "Children, don't do it, you'll be pulled and fined."

The trustees of THE SENTINEL will be interested in the following extract from the record of the proceedings of the City Council of Bradford, Pennsylvania, as published in the *Bradford Era*, of the 7th inst.—

"A joint committee submitted the following report on the Sunday observance ordinance:—

"Your committee to whom the within ordinance and petition was referred report adversely for the following reasons:

"The ordinance is framed in accordance with the act of 1794, and we believe that such a law belongs to the Dark Ages, and never should have been enacted by this great Commonwealth; united by a majority the petition be not granted.

"We believe such a law is antagonistic to the spirit and genius of our Republican form of government, and if enforced, deprives all laboring people of recreation, and furthermore, that it is, in its tendency on the liberty of men, women and children.

"We believe the majority of those who signed this petition did so in ignorance of the fact that the act of 1794, which is dead letter on its the statute [page 224]

given, gives them the same power, this ordinance asks for. The only effect, city legislation can have is to transfer the burden of enforcing this statute from the petitioners to the city, thereby shifting the themselves of the responsibility and citizen of prosecution the offenders against this law. 'Your committee does it course in place such responsibility and express this city.

"We commend to the good people of Bradford that they can best secure the closing of all business, by individually refusing to trade with or purchase on that day. No buyers, no sellers."

In the New York *World*, of June 14, the editor draws at some length on the subject of "Sunday Outings." After enumerating some of the parks as fine places to stay a Sunday in recreation, he says:

Go make the plans for your Sunday outings now, for now is the summer time. Gather your dear ones, walk with you on every spot, rest on the grass and observe and be happy.

But the Sunday-law advocates tell us that no amusement is in harmony with its graceful of that day. If their arguments should carry, it might be possible that even the parks would be closed on Sunday, especially as the early papers have reported one of the commissioners as saying that if he had his way everything would be closed.
