The Sentinel, though opposed to the liquor traffic and to intemperance in every form, has always insisted that Sunday closing laws were of little or no value as a temperance measure. This has been demonstrated in almost every place where Sunday closing has been attempted. The situation in this city is well described in the following editorial from the *Sun*, of July 7:—

"The Grand Jury, in the Court of General Sessions, recently made a presentment on the subject of the excise laws, in which it criticised the methods adopted by the police for their enforcement. 'Nearly all of the excise cases investigated by the Grand Jury during the past month were dismissed,' says the presentment, because 'the officers who made the arrests offered no evidence of the violation of the law,' and very many of the cases showed 'a spirit of persecution rather than a desire to fully discharge duty.'

"That has a familiar sound. For years past presentments by the Grand Jury have dealt with the same subject in very much the same way. Most of the time of the inquest is occupied with the consideration of these excise cases, the great majority being charges of violation of the Sunday closing law, and sensible men on the Grand Jury must be tired of going through the farms of investigating them.

"Everybody knows that the saloons and bar-rooms generally are open on Sunday as a matter of course. The jurymen have only to walk the streets to see for themselves that the sale of liquor goes on with little obstruction. Beer saloons are crowded on Sunday night with Germans and other citizens of respectability. The corner liquor saloons admit thirsty customers through side doors, and the business proceeds throughout the town. Yet a large number of arrests are made for the violation of the Sunday closing law, as if it were actually and vigorously enforced, and these cases come before the Grand Jury to consume its time. If indictments are found convictions under them rarely follow, and as this presentment says, most of the cases are dismissed in the Grand Jury room because of the lack of evidence. Meantime the sale of liquor continues Sunday after Sunday, and the vendors seem to have little or no fear of disturbance. If every barkeeper who violates the law was apprehended, the station house could scarcely contain the crowd.

"Of course, the arrests are a mere sham. They are, apparently, of small dealers, for the most part, and the evidence obtained against the alleged offenders seems to be usually of a very flimsy sort.

"Naturally, the Grand Jury resents being made a party to such a humbug. It also has a sense of justice and it is outraged at the discrimination in the arrests. It sees that the opportunity afforded for the arbitrary exercise of power encourages gross injustice, and tends to the demoralization of the police, otherwise distinguished for fidelity to their trust. The police know that the law is a farce, that it is not sustained by public sentiment, and that it cannot be enforced universally and equally, and they are diverted by it from the serious performance of their duty and tempted to favoritism, persecution, and injustice.

"The presentment demands that the police regulations shall be made to conform to the law; but there never has been such conformity, except for brief periods and as a sporadic exhibition of activity. It was tried very thoroughly under Mayor Hewitt, but after a few Sundays it was abandoned as hopeless. To enforce the law absolutely, invariably, and continuously would require that the whole attention of the police be given to that single effort. It would have to be made, too, against the strong opposition of public sentiment, not the sentiment of the drunkards and the lawless, but of the sober, the respectable and the law abiding; for most of the Sunday drinkers are quiet and orderly people, Germans for instance, who consume their beer daily.

"Hence new police regulations will not be of any avail. The police have distinguished themselves for their vigilance in other directions. They have driven criminals out of New York and lessened the amount of actual crime. No city in the world has a better police. But they have not been able to stop Sunday liquor selling. They cannot enforce the Sunday Excise law, and they have never enforced it from the day of its passage until now, unless by a special effort which could not be continued. A business which the law makes unlawful proceeds with the support and countenance of public sentiment.

"The only reasonable presentment on the subject which the Grand Jury can make, therefore, is a denunciation of the law as impossible of execution, and demoralizing to the people and the police. That is the conclusion to which Mayor Hewitt came after his earnest attempt to enforce the law. The sale of intoxicating beverages on Sunday will go on, law or no law, and the regulation of the traffic should be recognized as inevitable.

"The outrage of the arbitrary and discriminating Sunday arrests is far worse in its effects upon the popular respect for the law, and the popular sense of justice, than any evils which would come from the freest sale of intoxicating beverage on that day."
