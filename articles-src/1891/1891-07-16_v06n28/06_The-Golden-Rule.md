# The Golden Rule.

MR. CRAFTS says, "The Golden Rule: *He* us *our rest* let *rest on the rest day.*"

Very well; if it desires to rest on Sunday let he is free to do so; and those who choose to work on that day will not object, but will let him rest. But this is not what he means. He wants a law to compel all to rest in order that he and his class may worship.

Suppose that one wishes to rest on Saturday. Ought all to be compelled to rest on that day in order for let him rest. It is a bogus golden rule: this that will not work both ways. "But the great majority choose to rest on the first of the week; they are free to do so. And then those who live by the Golden Rule will freely accord to the smallest minority the equal right to rest when they please, or to rest at all, if they so choose."

B. V. CORRMAN.
