REV. W. C. SELLECK spoke in Denver, Colorado, June 28, on the subject of Sunday dissertation. The Sunday newspaper, excursions, ball games, and like topics were considered. He said there was no doubt a public demand for these things. But the editors of the papers, and those furnishing the amusements, were prompted wholly by the desire for money. Mr. Selleck did not advocate law as a remedy for the evil, but made a strong appeal, especially to editors, to have a higher object than to simply make money. The good we may do should ever have the precedence, and our love for gain be kept in the background.

If all the ministers would make their appeals to the hearts of individuals, trusting in God to move them by his Spirit to lead righteous lives, instead of demanding so much civil law, their work would be much more in harmony with Him whom they profess to serve.
