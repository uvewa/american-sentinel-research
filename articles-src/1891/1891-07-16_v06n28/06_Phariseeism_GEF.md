Jesus said to the Pharisees, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. . . . ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness."

This is the Saviour's description of ancient Phariseeism, and it is therefore the best and truest that can be given.

It is the design of this article to discuss ancient Phariseeism only long enough to show that there is a modern revival of the same detestable thing in all its hideous deformity. The thing is not only the same, but the cause is the same.

What was the cause of the Phariseeism of the time of Christ? It was the result of a false theocracy. It was God's purpose to rule over the Israelites himself, and at first he did so.

The kingdom of Israel was then a true theocracy, the only one the world has ever seen. This is, and must ever remain the perfect ideal of government.

God is infinite in goodness and in wisdom. Because he is infinite in goodness he always desires what is best for the people, and what is best for them is always the best for his own honor and glory. Because he is infinite in wisdom, he always knows just what is best—knows it better than any one man in the nation, and better than the majority of men in the nation. Therefore, a true theocracy, to every devout believer in God, must ever remain the ideal of government, far in advance of monarchy or republicanism.

The redeemed saints will be ruled over thus by God, but even God himself could not, by force of outward law, change the man inwardly, and therefore, to his ancient people, and all the way along, he gave the gospel—a revelation of his infinite love—to win the hearts of men to him, and purify them from sin. It is the gospel only that can purify the heart from sin. Man can not do it himself, and no outward force of law or public opinion can accomplish it for him. Saith the Lord, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Jer. 13:23.

The Israelites rejected God as their king, and demanded a king like the nations around them. For a time these kings submitted partially to the direction of God's inspired prophets, and so the government still remained, in a partial sense, a theocracy. Finally they rejected God, and put to death his prophets, and still the rulers claimed the right to govern and dictate in all things, both civil and religious, as God had once done. Thus was the prerogative of moral government taken out of the hands of God, who alone can read the heart, and know its moral or immoral intent, and put into the hands of feeble man; and thus was the kingdom of Israel transformed into a false theocracy, the worst kind of a despotism.

The Israelites also rejected the gospel, the only means of changing the heart, and depended wholly upon the law, which could only enforce outward observances. See Heb. 4:3, and Rom, 9:30 to 10:3. Thus they made clean the outside of the cup and platter, and were like whited sepulchres. They multiplied outward observances, and forgot the weightier matters of the law—justice, mercy, and truth. In their greed of gain, they devoured widows' houses, and for a pretense made long prayers. All this is the logical and unavoidable result of trying to make men righteous simply by law. Phariseeism was but a false theocracy gone to seed.

Because they had thus abused the theocratic form of government, God destroyed the Israelitish nation, and declared there should never be another true theocracy till the everlasting kingdom of Christ was set up on the redeemed world, as foretold by all the prophets, Eze. 21:25-27. Every theocracy that can exist prior to that time, must therefore be a false theocracy—some man or men ruling in the place of God. Such was the Papacy and such the government of Calvin in Geneva, and of the Puritans in Massachusetts; and such will be the result when the National Reformers and their allies, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, shall have accomplished their object. The same cause will produce the same effect. As every false theocracy has produced a hypocritical Phariseeism of outward forms, so will this. Just as every other man-made theocracy has persecuted those who have walked in the light of God, and by their holy lives, have condemned the prevailing hypocrisy, so will this.

No wonder the Bible speaks of perilous times in the last days, because men have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. Every appeal to the State to make men moral by law, and to teach them Christianity, is a public denial of the power of the Christian Church to do what God commissioned it to do; and yet almost all these appeals are made by those who have a form of godliness. The Church of God, clothed with the power of God is the only thing that can really do the work of changing the hearts of men to make them truly moral. The State at best can only touch the outward act. The whole religio-political movement of the day, is not in the interest of Christianity but in the interest of a Phariseeism which builds whited sepulchres, and makes clean the outside of the cup and platter. It does not need a prophet's eye to discern already this result. The literature of every organization connected with the movement is full of the idea that if men but keep Sunday strictly, and go to church regularly, they are really religious. Such outward observances, in their eyes cover a multitude of sins. Even the saloon-keeper, if he shuts up on Sunday and goes to church, is respectable to say the least; and he may carry on his iniquitous business six days in the week without losing that respectability. In fact, if he gives a little of his ill-gotten gain now and then to support some church, or some missionary enterprise, he is almost religious.

By the combined efforts of the American Sabbath Union, and the Massachusetts Sabbath Association, a Sunday-law convention was held at Lowell, Massachusetts, June 2. Delegates were present from some twenty different cities. As usual, nearly all of them were ministers. After the opening exercises, and the address of welcome, the first speech on the programme was by Rev. W. W. Evarts, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, on the subject of "Sabbath Desecration."

Mr. Evarts spoke of the Pharisaical idea of the Sabbath as a false idea, alluding to their various traditions concerning it. They taught that it was breaking the Sabbath to eat an egg that was laid on that day. They taught that it was wrong to travel beyond a certain distance on the Sabbath, and wrong to carry a handkerchief if it was not pinned to the other garments, because it was bearing a burden on the Sabbath day. All schools agreed that it was wrong to walk on the grass, on the Sabbath day, for fear you might thrash out some of the seed, and that would be work.

After the speaker had finished, the address was discussed in a number of five minute speeches by the delegates, they being instructed by the presiding officer, to especially mention the various forms of Sabbath desecration most prevalent in their respective districts. One of these ministers, with a distressed look on his face, said that in his town, the fathers and mothers would get up on Sunday morning, and put on their good clothes, and take the children, baby and all, and go out in the front yard in a cool place, and sit down on the grass, and chat and read with no thought of their duty to attend church. "Such Sabbath desecration as this ought to be stopped." The ministers seemed unconscious of the resemblance between this and the Phariseeism which in the very paper under discussion, had been represented as false. Perhaps even the Pharisees would have allowed them to sit on the grass, if not to walk on it. Another minister said that he and his wife sat on the front porch the other Sunday, in a cool place, and such numbers of bicycles and carriages came by, that they felt they were breaking the Sabbath to look at them, and so had to go into the house, and shut themselves in. He said a good lady in Lynn, whose house was near the beach, said she had to do that every Sunday, else she felt guilty.

Of course such traveling on Sunday, beyond the usual Sabbath day's journey to church and back, ought to be stopped by law, so that these poor people need not be compelled to thus shut themselves up.

Specimens of this modern Phariseeism might be multiplied, but it is inevitable, as both reason and history show, that such must be the result of all religious laws, and these are sufficient to prove that even now, such result is apparent.
