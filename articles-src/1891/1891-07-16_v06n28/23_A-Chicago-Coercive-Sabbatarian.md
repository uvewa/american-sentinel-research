UNDER the heading, "A Chicago Coercive Sabbatarian," the *Chicago Tribune*, of June 23, says:—

At a church meeting Sunday night the Rev. Mr. Meloy, of the First United Presbyterian Church, made some remarks in favor of the rigid prevention by the civil authorities of all work on the first day of the week, called Sunday, which he persisted in calling the Sabbath, which is the seventh day of the week.

Mr. Meloy's words are quoted with severe strictures, and the fact called to his attention of which he and his kind seem so willfully ignorant, that

in Illinois, as everywhere else in the United States, the Church and State are separated, and the former can not use the powers of the latter to enforce obedience to its theology.
