# The Fourth Century over Again.

THE following information is sent out under the heading, "A Systematic Crusade against Sunday Opening of the World's Fair," dated at Chicago, May 14:—

These different religious organizations propose to get the trends against the present and prosperous commerce of America, with might and main. Every secretary in this country as well as in Canada. Bishop McCloskey has drawn a letter to the National Commission and the Board of Directors setting out that the Fair be closed on Sunday, adding, every interesting exhibit, no matter what country it is in be personally addressed and to make him or her contribution continues keep them closed. In addition to this, Christian workers throughout the world are to be asked to bring there together to bear upon the same undertakings during the next few months.

In this we see simply history repeating itself. Nowhere tells us that at a church convention held at Carthage, in 401, the bishops passed a resolution to send up a petition to the emperors requesting that the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday and from feast days to some other days of the week." And the reason, let us, why they passed this resolution, was not that they feared the shows would be a financial failure if open on Sunday, or that the strangers would come to ruin thereat, but "the people congregate more to the circus than to the churches," and it is not letting that Christians should gather at the spectacles, since among the spectators there are contrary to the precepts of God; and if they are not open, let us have no pretext for going on Sunday.

So in this latter case, this International Young Men's Christian Association that is soliciting the co-operation of "Christian workers throughout the world" in an effort to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, is not afraid that the Fair will be a failure if open on Sunday, or that Christians or others will come to ruin by visiting it, but its leaders are afraid, if opens, it would be much better patronized than the churches; and hence they wish the Fair closed on Sunday, and thus compel the results of this of a day's rest work, and which demands such means to get people to be self religiously. Will, if necessary to carry its point, resort to compulsory measures of office to do what those it cannot do for that but ungovernable lodges of the fourth century resulted in a union of Church and State, so will the like efforts of these latter churchmen in the nineteenth century result in the same thing.

No civil government has any commission to administer the divine law.
