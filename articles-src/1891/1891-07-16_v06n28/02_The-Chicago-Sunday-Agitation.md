It is stated that the Columbian Sunday Association during the last two months has spent six hundred dollars in postage alone. Their weekly postage bill on articles sent out to papers in the Sixth District of the American Sabbath Union is forty dollars. Mass meetings are held weekly in different parts of Chicago to discuss Sunday closing in general and World's Fair closing in particular. These meetings are assuming the nature of patriotic gatherings where the ministers teach that the American Republic rests on the foundation of the American Sabbath, and that the American Sabbath can not be preserved without law. The agitation is indeed becoming interesting.
