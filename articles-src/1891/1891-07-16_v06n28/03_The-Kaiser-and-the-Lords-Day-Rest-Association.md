THE London dispatches of June 29, say:

> In view of the outcry made by the members of the Lord's Day Rest Association, and others, to the proposed visit of the Kaiser Wilhelm on Sunday, July 12, to the naval exhibition in London, the German Kaiser has consented to postpone that visit to some day during the week commencing July 12.

The National Reformers might make an interesting logical deduction from this, if only it were the Czar instead of the Kaiser, for as the Czar is an absolute monarch he is the government in himself, and should he officially acknowledge the authority of the "Christian Sabbath" the Russian nation, in his person, would become a "Christian nation," and one hundred million of people be Christianized at one fell swoop.
