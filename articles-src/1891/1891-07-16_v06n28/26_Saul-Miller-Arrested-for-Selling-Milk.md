POLICEMAN SIMMERMEYER arrested Saul Miller, a storekeeper of East Broadway, for selling him a glass of milk on Sunday, June 27. Mr. Miller was locked up in the police station several hours before he could obtain bail; when the case came to trial before Justice Ryan he was discharged. What can be said of laws which are a sufficient excuse for so frivolous an arrest?
