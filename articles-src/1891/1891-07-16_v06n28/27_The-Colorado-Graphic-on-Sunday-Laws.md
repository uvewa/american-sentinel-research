THE Colorado *Graphic* is endeavoring to set its neighbors right upon the matter of Sunday laws. Of one of them it says:—

If the Pueblo Chieftan is sincere in its denunciation of "this tireless crusade against Sunday newspapers," it must take the Graphic's broad platform and object to all Sunday legislation as religious in character, and consequently contrary to the fundamental principles of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence.

In this the *Graphic* is quite right. Sunday legislation is utterly opposed to that religious liberty guaranteed by the National Constitution and ought to be opposed by every friend of that matchless instrument as it is in this regard. But our contemporary falls into an error in proposing a possible remedy for the evils of such laws. It says:—

The Graphic is opposed to revolutions, believing that in America equal justice is guaranteed all citizens in religion, in law, in business, in labor, etc., and that in time the scales will be readjusted; but the mechanic finds it necessary now and then to strike a sharp blow even at the risk of breaking the faulty article in his vice, and so it may be necessary now to teach the weak a lesson by the passage of an old fashioned John Knox law, compelling all classes of citizens to shut up shop on Sunday and go to a John Knox church to worship. This would be mild revolution, and the harm done could easily be repaired without loss of limb or life. Heroic treatment of the Sabbath delusion is demanded to-day. Give a fool a big dose of his own medicine if you wish to protect yourself from his reform notions.

This would be an exceedingly dangerous experiment. It is sometimes a very difficult matter to secure the repeal of even a bad law, as has been demonstrated in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Both of these States have Sunday laws of the worst description, and in both States there have been cases of genuine persecution for conscience' sake, yet such is the strength of religious bigotry and intolerance that all efforts to secure a repeal of the iniquitous laws have failed. There is danger in the plan proposed by the *Graphic*.
