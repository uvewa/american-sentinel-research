THE readers of THE SENTINEL will be interested in the following extract from the record of the proceedings of the City Council of Bradford, Pennsylvania, as published in the *Bradford Era*, of the 7th inst.:—

The Ordinance Committee submitted the following report on the Sunday observance ordinance:—

"Your committee to whom the within ordinance and petition was referred report adversely for the following reasons:

"The ordinance is framed in accordance with the act of 1794, and we believe that such a law belongs to the Dark Ages, and never should have been enacted by this great Commonwealth, settled by William Penn and his Quaker friends.

"We believe such a law is antagonistic to the principles of this Republic, knowing that it would, if enforced, deprive all laboring people of recreation; and, furthermore, that it is an infringement on the liberty of men, women and children.

"We believe the majority of those who signed this petition did so in ignorance of the fact that the act of 1794, which is a dead letter on the statute books, gives them the same powers this ordinance calls for. The only effect city legislation can have is to transfer the burden of enforcing this statute from the petitioners to the city, thereby relieving themselves of the responsibility and odium of prosecuting the offenders against this law. Your committee deem it unwise to place such responsibility and expense upon the city.

"We recommend to the good people of Bradford that they can best secure the closing of all business places on Sunday by declining to purchase anything on that day. No buyers, no sellers."

Mr. Howe, a member of the Council, moved to amend by striking out the word "adversely" and all that comes after it, and substituting "favorably." There was no second to this, and the report was adopted as read.
