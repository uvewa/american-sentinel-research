The agitation making for the bolstering up of Sunday observance by special legislation is felt throughout the colonies, as well as in this country and Europe and America. The Colonial Secretary having been appealed to by the Superintendent of Missions to Seamen in Hong-Kong regarding Sunday labor in the harbors of the Eastern Crown colonies, addressed some inquiries on the subject to the governors of these colonies. The Governor of Hong-Kong did not see his way to enforce the compulsory observance of Sunday in these cases, while the Governor of the Straits brought the matter to the notice of the employers with a view to minimize this class of labor as much as possible. Subsequently the Governor of Hong-Kong did the same, but the local Chamber of Commerce was unable to suggest any scheme for the purpose, while the answer from Singapore was much to the same effect.

Thereupon Lord Knutsford addressed a circular to the governors of all the colonies, inquiring whether there was Sunday labor in the docks and wharves of their ports, and whether there was any prohibitive legislation on the subject. In the majority of the colonies there is no legislation against Sunday labor, but in fact the loading and discharging of steamers is not carried on save in cases of urgency, or of mail steamers. In some colonies this is prohibited by local ordinance, unless the customs authorities consent. In several colonies the well-known Act 29 Charles II., c. 7, "for the observation of the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday," is in force by virtue of local laws, or enactments of a similar character exist. But whether there are such laws or not, labor in the docks and wharves on Sunday in urgent cases is permitted, and nowhere does there appear to be any combination amongst the workmen against it. Lord Knutsford having suggested to the Governor of Hong-Kong the insertion in all government contracts of a provision that work under them should not be carried out on Sundays except in very urgent cases and under special authority, Sir William des Voeux replied that he has done so, although he does not approve of the suggestion. It deprives laborers, whose wages are already scanty enough, of the results of a day's work a week, and forces idleness upon them. The consequence, he predicts, will be an increase in crime. On the whole, Lord Knutsford's efforts do not seem to have been very successful. The manager of one great dock in Singapore quotes for his admonition a passage from "England's Greatest Historian," on the mischief of governments interfering in private enterprise, and the Governor of St. Helena tells him that the Act against Sunday labor existing there ought to be repealed, and that the colonists think so.—*Present Truth, London.*
