The views of a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, on the Sunday question, were published in the *Spokane Falls Review*, of March 28, 1891, as follows:—

To the Editor of the Review: We know there is great opposition to the Sunday question and we expect there will be, but that does not daunt us. There was a great deal of opposition to the ten perance educational work in its earliest days, and an unlimited supply toward the department of narcotics when that was first assumed. Of the former, wise men said that it was a species of oppression; that parents not in sympathy with the movement could not be compelled to buy books for their children to study what they did not care to have them know. And when, in a district of Illinois, where beer-brewing was the order of the day, the teacher was ordered to take a glass of the foaming beverage (?) into the school and to give an object lesson on it and portray its merits, croakers said: "Didn't we tell you so? You are only making the matter worse; better have kept still." But the Woman's Christian Temperance Union worked right on. To-day the District of Columbia, all the Territories, the military and naval schools, and thirty four States have temperance teaching enacted by law, and the other ten States are being vigorously worked toward the same result. The work against the tobacco habit was antagonized by the idea that if we succeeded we would destroy a great industry, and alienate many who would otherwise be our friends, especially in the South. But the women said, "Better destroy a great industry than our boys," and kept the thing going. To-day "narcotics" is one of our "most approved" departments, for right is right, and that is what we want. So now, on this Sunday question.

This is significant. The women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union worked on, undaunted by the opposition they met, until they secured "temperance teaching," or the teaching of hygiene and physiology, enforced by law, in most of the States and Territories. Now that was a legitimate move; for it was a civil question. But the idea of their carrying out the same plan regarding the Sunday question (for she says: "So now, on this Sunday question") is wrong, because it is not a civil but a religious question. It comes within the doors of the Church; takes up a matter pertaining to our worship or duty to our God, and enforces by law upon the people religious views not in accordance with their consciences; and as some of the States have compulsory school laws many would be compelled to refrain either from obeying the statutes of the States, or from following the dictates of their own consciences.

Is it right for man to be thus situated? Is it right for such textbooks to be placed in the common schools? Have Protestants any more right to teach their doctrines in the public schools than the Roman Catholics and Mohammedans have to teach theirs?
