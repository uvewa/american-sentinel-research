# That "Civil" "Sacred" Day.

QUESTION number three and its answer, of that important document, Leaflet No. 81, National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Sabbath Observance Department, are as follows:—

> 3. Should not the ordinary Sunday rest-day require *only* a secular day, and not preserve any *sacred* character for Sunday?

> Answer.—The law could never be enforced on this basis. For the law cannot settle the question why the day was Sunday, and it is impossible to choose any one of the six working days as a rest day and give to any other day the recognition by the vast majority as a sacred day, rather than one so held by less than one-half or one-third or one-fifth of the people. The bill speaks of the first day of the week without including the word "Sunday."

If the day of rest which they require be only of a civil character, why must the rest be only for sanitary reasons, then why is it that a law cannot be enforced, simply requiring rest on one day of the week, and with no reference to any particular day? It would be just as easy to enforce any other law as that an it would be to enforce a law demanding that Sunday alone has been observed as a rest day. For the truth of the statement that such a law could never be enforced we have only the bare word of Mrs. Bateham to that effect. But so to say it is so, she offers no direct proof whatever. Yet in the words which follow, there is indirect proof as to why such a law could not be enforced, and that is that it is not the *civil* rest day at all that they want enforced, nor is it in any sense for sanitary reasons.

"It is a sacred day," and that only, that they want laws enforcing the observance of a *day of rest;* and it is for *religious* reasons only that it is demanded. And [page 217] forced requiring the observance of simply one day of the week as a day of rest without reference to any particular day. If such a law as that were enacted there would be no recognition of any particular "day" as a "sacred day;" and therefore those who demand the enforcement of a sacred day would have no heart to enforce such a law, and those who care nothing for it in the first place would not enforce it. Consequently then, and then only, is it true that such a law "could never be enforced." Therefore, as it is a sacred day which the Sunday-law workers want recognized by the Government, and as the observance enforced, this is, and this alone, is the reason why the day must be uniform.

The reason which Mrs. Bateham gives why it must be uniform is that "it is impossible to choose a civil rest day, the day which is recognized by the vast majority as a *sacred* day." That is to say, the State must adopt the ideas as to a *sacred* day entertained by a part of the people, and enforce upon all the people the observance of those ideas of sacred things. This is simply stating in another form the question and answer which we noticed last week, that the things *religiously* considered *holy* shall be adopted and enforced by the Government as such, and that no discrimination whatever be made upon that will apply fully to this. If a thing is truly *sacred*, it is easy to get people to respect it as such, without any effort on that part of that which is political to compel the recognition of the sacredness. Any such effort certainly produces its sacred; even just as far as the effort is concerned.

[page 218] spect and observance of; and if it is not sacred, then it ought not to be either respected or observed by anybody; and any attempt to compel the respect or observance of it is simply an attempt to compel that which is wrong in itself, to compel them to sin, to compel them in a sense to commit idolatry in that it compels them to respect and observe and to recognize as a sacred, a holy thing, that which has no such character.

Again, it has been proper to say that if a thing be sacred indeed, it needs no help whatever. Its sufficiency is in itself, and if it is not sacred, then no sufficiency ought to be manufactured if it not suffice to. Let the lack of sacredness be discovered and exposed as soon as possible, and the sooner the better for all concerned, and the more honor to him who does the most to most completely help. But this is just the trouble with the Sunday institution. It has no sacredness—it is of the kind to which appeal can be made, or which can be urged upon the conscience of men, and this these people know. We have given, in these columns their own statements, that there is no record of Christ's declaring it to merit or to deserve its sacred observance. The only basis which Mrs. Bateham has presented for it is the probability that Christ spoke about it in the forty days he was with his disciples after the resurrection, but of which there is no record whatever; and the only basis which the American Sabbath Union has given for it is "a spontaneous growth" "in the minds of early Christians." They gave it that it has no sacredness, and marking being in itself unholy, never can give to anything any shadow of a sacred character. And yet these, and realizing their inability to secure respect for it as a sacred thing upon any such basis, they demand that the Government shall declare that is sacred, that it is holy, and shall exert the political power of the country to compel all men to recognize, respect, and observe, the enforced sacredness. Such is only to cause the Government to usurp the place and prerogative of God to re-establish and exalt the office of Pontifex Maximus, which in this while world be merged in a religion into national, observe a pure.

The last mention of the answer is of much the same character as the first one. It says that "the bill speaks of the first day of the week without including the word question to which is the Sabbath." That is to say the bill proposes to declare that Sunday is a sacred, holy day, and the only one, and shall compel people to observe it as such, and yet to dodge avoidals, not only the vexed question, but any question at all as to which is the Sabbath. In other words, the law is to declare that this day, and it only, is the Sabbath; and everybody must recognize and observe it as such without any question. Government, at the dictation of the Sunday-law lobbies folks is to decide that, and the thing is to be the law and all.

Now, let us say again that we do not object at all to anybody observing this thing day. Every man has a right to observe between two days as to which shall be observed and those who desire and those who observe the seventh day do not the any government recognition or the thing at all, yet not any requiring anybody to observe it in any way what. They not only know but that they know that the Seventh-day Adventists in itself, absolutely deny the right of any government to legislate in any way whatsoever relating to, upon the so-called recognition, it is easy or the matter of requiring in a Sunday law any such exemption as that which the Sunday-law workers have so very "generously" offered. Therefore it is not honest for any of them to state even by implication that the observance of the seventh day give reason, much less requires, any governmental recognition or enforcement of such observance either upon themselves or anybody else.
