# A Woman's Christian Temperance Union Member's Views.

THE views of a member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, on the Sunday question, were published in *The Soque Falls Review*, of March 30, 1891, as follows:—

TO THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW: We know there is a great opposition to the Sunday question and we respect them will so, but they don't see not to read about in a thoughtful spirit against the points the presenters and also some beautiful educational work in its earlier days, and an opportunity offered in the work at the beginning when that was first assumed. Of the former, we have said that it was a good suggestions, the human part in not in impossible with the movement will not be compelled to buy books he does not destroy to do what they did not care to have them either. And, when, in a district where the Sunday beer buying was the order of the day, the teacher steps up (and takes in school and to give no object lesson in physical injuries by choice of picture, creedism—"and I tell you yes! You are only making the same errors worse, some better have kept still. But as the District of Columbia, all the Territory, and twenty-three of the States and many States have temperance teaching enacted by law, shall we not go ahead? Our women have worked toward the same trend. The work against the saloon was antagonistic to the day; if we succeeded we would destroy a great industry, almost many men who would otherwise be our friends, especially in the South. But the women said, "unless destroy a great industry than our boys," and kept the thing going. To-day "remove" and we are nearly is fair question. And we must do right is right, and that is what we want. . . . —on the Sunday question!"

This is significant. The women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Member's Views follow the text entirely the right to note that by his Spirit to [page 220] lead righteous lives, instead of demanding so much civil law, their work would be much more in harmony with Him whom they profess to serve.

Under the heading, "A Chicago Observer Sabbatarized," the *Chicago Tribune*, of June 23, says:—

At a meeting Sunday night the Rev. Mr. Moley, of the First United Presbyterian Church, denounced what he termed the effort of city legislation by the civil authorities of all work on the first day of the week. He said: "If God ever intended in exalting the Sabbath, which is the seventh day."

Mr. Moley's words are quoted with entire approval, and yet he is said called to his attention of which he and his had been so willingly ignorant, that

in Illinois, as in every other State in the United States, the Church and State are separated, and the former can not use the powers of the latter to enforce obedience to its theology.
