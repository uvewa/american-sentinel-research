IN its edition of June 25, the *Christian Statesman* says that the National Reform Association "has always held that the only foundation for the law of Sabbath rest is found in the law of God." It therefore follows that in enforcing it by civil law man is attempting to enforce the law of God, and the National Reform Association is assuming to itself that prerogative.
