Mr. Crafts says, "The Golden Rule bids us rest and let rest on the rest day." Very well; if he desires to rest on Sunday he is free to do so; and those who choose to work on that day will not object, but will let him rest. But this is not what he means. He wants a law to compel all to rest in order that he and his class may rest.

Suppose that one wishes to rest on Saturday. Ought all to be compelled to rest on that day in order to let him rest? It is a bogus golden rule that will not work both ways. "But the great majority choose Sunday as the day of rest." Well, they are free to do so. And those who live by the Golden Rule will freely accord to the smallest minority the equal right to rest when they please, or not to rest at all, if they so choose.
