CHICAGO has a formidable array of societies to look after its Sunday observance. They are the Sixth District organization of the American Sabbath Union; the Ministerial Committee for the closing of the World's Fair on Sundays; the Columbian Sunday Association; and the Chicago Sunday Best League. The latter association claims to be exclusively a civil society. To these should be added the Law and Order League, which has its headquarters in Chicago.
