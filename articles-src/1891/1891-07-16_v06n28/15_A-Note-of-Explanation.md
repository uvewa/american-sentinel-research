# A Note of Explanation.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL: In the *Sabbath Recorder* about the time the question of sending the Exposition has offered Seventh-day Baptists in reference to the question of opening the Columbian Exposition on Sundays, to a statement which upon me as it might faintly be construed as a disparagement of the Seventh-day Baptists, you will kindly state that the Seventh-day Adventists, and also that which belongs to the writer of the article, and that it does not represent the interests at all, Dr. Platts, and probably does not at all represent the views of Seventh-day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists generally. In fact the *Recorder* has published a certain article, which may state in the views of the majority of my people. So please adjust the night and the *Recorder* has that which I am simply an editorial, communicate.
