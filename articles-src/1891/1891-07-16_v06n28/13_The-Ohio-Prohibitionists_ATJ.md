# The Ohio Prohibitionists.

THE Ohio, Prohibitionists, in their late Convention, have this preamble to their platform:—

> The Prohibition Party of Ohio recognizes God as the source of all just government.

This is presumably equally true in all cases in Ohio except Christians. No man who is infidel or atheist in his belief has any right to the same panty's equal than platform. . . . And any one can see that if a political party adopting such principles comes into power it would become a bona of a form and manner of Christian. What will the Prohibition Party of Ohio do with such? Will it disfranchise them and still tolerate them in the country, or will it drive them on? If God tolerates them here, and wouldn't it not be well for the Prohibition Party to consider this before resorting to radical measures of a careful consideration of such a matter should lead men to see the foolishness in a political party adopting such principles. The civil power that not protect all its citizens, regardless of religion or belief, who considers themselves citizens, involves itself into a persecuting despotism.

They also place the following plank in their platform:—

> All men are protected by law in their right to one day of rest in seven.

Why say it as the advocates for Sunday laws mean it? All men are protected by law in their right to one day of rest in seven, but we want to compel them the recognition of either their rights or not.

## The next Convention passed the following:

> *Resolved*, That we condemn the action taken by the Board of Control of the Columbian Exposition in opening their gates on Sunday, and demanded that the Congress of the United States shall forbid each opening upon the Sabbath day expressly.

A. T. J.
