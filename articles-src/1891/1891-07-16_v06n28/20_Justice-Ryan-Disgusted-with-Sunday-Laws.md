SUNDAY evening, June 21, a policeman in citizen's clothes entered a New York grocery store and asked for a penny candle, it was furnished him and he arrested the proprietor for breaking the Sunday law. At the arraignment, in the Essex Market Police Court, Justice Ryan said,—"I get disgusted with these cases. I am very sorry that I must hold you, Steckel, I would discharge you if I could." A volume of comment would not add to the plain teaching of such an incident as this.
