THE Ohio Prohibitionists, in their late Convention, have this preamble to their platform:—

The Prohibition Party of Ohio recognizes God as the source of all just power in government.

This preamble completely excludes from the Prohibition party in Ohio, any except Christians. No man who is infidel or atheist in his belief has any right in the party under that platform. And any one can see that if a political party adopting such principles comes into power it would be nothing short of a hierarchy. Infidels and atheists have the same civil rights as Christians. What will the Prohibition Party of Ohio do with such? Will it disfranchise them and still tolerate them in the country? or will it drive them out? God tolerates them here, and would it not be well for the Prohibition Party to consider this before resorting to radical measures? A careful consideration of this subject should lead men to see the foolishness in a political party adopting such principles. The civil power that will not protect all its citizens, regardless of religious belief, who conduct themselves civilly, resolves itself into a persecuting despotism.

They also placed the following plank in their platform:—

All men should be protected by law in their right to one day of rest in seven.

Why not say it as the advocates for Sunday laws mean it? All men are protected by law in their right to one day of rest in seven, but we want to compel them to rest regardless of either their rights or desires.

The same Convention passed the following resolution:—

Resolved, That we condemn the action taken by the Board of Control of the Columbian Exposition in opening its gates upon Sunday, and demand that the Congress of the United States shall prohibit such opening upon the Sabbath day.
