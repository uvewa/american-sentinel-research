TO THE EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.—My dear sir: I wrote the article in the *Sabbath Recorder* about the duty of Seventh-day Baptists in reference to the question of opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday. As this article has been copied in your columns and commented upon there as if it might fairly represent the editor of the *Recorder* and the Seventh-day Baptists, will you kindly allow me to assume the responsibility which belongs to the writer of the article and say that it does not represent the editor, Dr. Platts, and probably does not represent many Seventh-day Baptists correctly. In fact the *Recorder* has published a criticism which may stand as the view of the majority of my people. So please cudgel me and not the *Recorder* for which I am simply an editorial writer.

Yours,
W. C. TITSWORTH.

Dunellen, N. J.
