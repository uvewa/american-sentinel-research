AT Erfurt, Germany, the members of a club which attended an atheistic lecture, in a body, have been indicted, it is said, at the instance of the Emperor, on the plea that their action was "to the scandal of all true believers." Emperor William should be elected an honorary member of the National Reform Association, forthwith.
