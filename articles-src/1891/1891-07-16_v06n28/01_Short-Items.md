The London dispatches of June 27, say:

> In view of the outcry made by the friends of the Lord's Day Rest Association, and others, to the proposed visit of the Kaiser Wilhelm to the naval exhibition at Hamburg, July 11, to the naval exhibition in London, the German Kaiser has consented to postpone that visit to some day during the week commencing July 13.

It won the Czar lasted the [page 217] Kaiser, for as the Czar is an absolute monarch he is the government in himself, and should he officially acknowledge the authority of the "Christian Sabbath" the Russian nation, in his person, would become a "Christian nation," and one hundred millions of people be Christianized at one fell swoop.
