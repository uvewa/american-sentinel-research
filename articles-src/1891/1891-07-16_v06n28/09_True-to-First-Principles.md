# True to First Principles.

INDEPENDENT, of June 25, says that on Thursday, June 11, the Rev. S. Hopkins Emery, of the Massachusetts Historical Society, being the oldest clergyman, and the oldest member of the House, offered the following, which was unanimously adopted:—

> *Resolved*, Massachusetts has always been true to the pilgrim spirit, which planted the Old Colony and laid the foundation of the grand Republic.

> Therefore, be it known that in the coming World's Columbian, in the city of Chicago, the State should make manifest to the world a every possible manner the prevailing sentiment of the people that one day in the seven should be by common consent set apart to religious purposes, and it should not be made the occasion of mere passing shows.

There can not be a sentiment quite more directly in the point in the minds of a godly may not only be closed on Sunday, and the so-called American Sabbath idea finds daily accession to the visitors from the Old World, but all will have a single effort in them, then break down all their infidelity, and bring them at once to acknowledge the all-sufficient good to found in Christianity. If the managers of the Exposition see fit to close its gates on Sunday no one can, properly, object. If the majority of the exhibitors see fit to close, it is certainly their unquestioned privilege. But if the State as a whole is to maintain its old-time religious dogma, by closing the gates on that day, one falls to see where the great impression or security will be deeply impressed upon the mind of the visitor to the Fair, especially as he sees so much intolerance and general debauchery and wickedness, not only in Chicago, but in all the cities of our commonwealth. It might answer for the washing of the outside of the cup and platter, or the garnishing of the tombs of the failures, but it would only make the outcritions and create that abundant every where all the more apparent; because the thinking man would be sure to contrast the hypocrisy of such a scheme with the abounding wickedness seen in every part of our land.
