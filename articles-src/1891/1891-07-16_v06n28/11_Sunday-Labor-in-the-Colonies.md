# Sunday Labor in the Colonies.

THE agitation making for the bolstering up of Sunday observance by special legislation is felt throughout the colonies, as well as in this country and Europe and America. The Colonial Secretary's views have been expressed by the Superintendent of Mission to Seamen in Hong Kong—Japan.

About Sunday labor in the harbour of the colony, Lord Knutsford addressed a circular to the governors on the subject to the governor close the colonies. The Governor of Hong Kong did not in the Way to enforce the compulsory closing of Sunday in these colonies, while the Governor of the Straits brought the matter to the notice of the municipal with a view to the minimum of close of labor as much as possible. Subsequently the Governor of Hong Kong, on the report, but the local Chamber of Commerce was unable to suggest any scheme for the purpose, while the answer from Singapore was much to the same effect.

Subsequently Lord Knutsford addressed a circular to the governors of the colonies, requesting the opinions of all the old-day labor in the docks and wharves of their ports, and whether there was any probability legislation on the colonies. In the majority of the colonies there is no legislation against Sunday labor, but in fact the loading and discharging of steam, it is not carried on any course of the colonies or is prohibited by local ordinances, and the colonies have obtained restrictions that, in revised actions, in certain colonies, and to Ch. 8, "or for due observance of the Lord's Day, commonly called Sunday," or to be fined by civil and other laws, or commands of a similar character etc. But whether there is legislation or not, labor in the docks and wharves of Sundays is as prevalent.

In Singapore no special cause is permitted, and no where does there appear to be any combined action, the recognized, was agreed in. Lord Knutsford having suggested to the Governor of Hong Kong the insertion in a government contracts of conditions that work under them should not be called upon to work on Sundays except emergency and under special authority. Sir William Des Voeux replied he does not approve of the suggestion. It deprives employers, whose ships are already smartly delayed, where are already smartly delayed, of the results of a day's work a week, and consequent loss is serious, and in some cases, he predicts, will be an increase in efforts on the week. Lord Knutsford's officers of his last have not been has very extensive. The language of one great dock at Singapore quotes for its administration a passage from "England's Greatest History," on the "mischief of governments interfering in private enterprise, and the Governor of St. Helena has said the Act against Sunday labor existing there ought to be repealed, and that the colonies think so in every direction upon them.
