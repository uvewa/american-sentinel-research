In the *Christian Nation*, of June 3, is the following:—

In September last the Prince of Wales, with a few friends, was the guest of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Wilson. Baccarat was played every evening. The stakes were limited to one hundred pounds. The Prince of Wales was banker. Sir William Gordon-Cumming, a personal friend of the Prince, cheated, was detected, and has sued his accusers for slander. The trial came on in London this week, and the world has been treated to the spectacle of the future ruler of the British empire "by divine right," admitting on the witness stand that he is the associate and friend of professional gamblers, and cheating gamblers at that.

This paragraph is not reprinted for the purpose of informing the readers of *The Sentinel* that the Prince of Wales has had an unusual experience, growing out of his celebrated game of baccarat. But it is to call attention to the evident sneer couched in the quoted phrase, "by divine right," in the above paragraph. One hardly knows what to conjecture from reading it. Has the *Christian Nation* been converted to the sound principles of civil government, through reading the various accounts of the game scandalously played by the heir apparent to the throne of England? It is to be wished that such were the case. No doubt the Prince of Wales is prince as much "by divine right" as any prince that the world has ever known. God has certainly decreed that men should establish civil governments. It is necessary that there should be civil power to suppress incivility. But the *Christian Nation* advocates the necessity of having God recognized in the laws of the land, as the supreme Ruler in civil affairs, and that princes should rule "by divine right."

England has this recognition in her laws, and has had it ever since the days of Henry the Eighth. He became enraged at the Pope of Rome because he would not give him a divorce from his lawful wife, in order that he might marry another that was more to his fancy, and assumed to himself the prerogatives of head of the church in England. Every thing that law could do to cause England to conform to the ideas of National Reform has been carefully done. And yet the Prince of Wales, who, according to the law, will be head of the Church of England, should he ever come to the throne, was not deterred by all these National Reform principles from gambling, and being one of the chief factors in a leading scandal among the modern nobility. It would seem that a glimmer of light had broken in upon the Christian Nation. It is to be hoped that it may continue to ponder this question, till it will not only see men as trees walking, but till it will be able to see clearly.
