The following information is sent out under the heading, "A Systematic Crusade against Sunday Opening of the World, s Fair," dated at Chicago, May 14:—

The International Young Men's Christian Association proposes to go into the crusade against the opening of the World's Fair on the Sabbath day, with might and main. Every secretary in this country, as well as in Canada, has agreed to address a letter to the National Commission and the Board of Directors asking that the Fair be closed. In addition, every intending exhibitor, no matter in what country, is to be personally addressed and asked to make his or her participation contingent upon Sunday closing. In addition to this, Christian workers throughout the world are to be asked to bring their influence to bear upon the responsible authorities during the next twelve months.

In this we see simply history repeating itself. Neander tells us that at a church convention held at Carthage, in 401, the bishops passed a resolution to send up a petition to the emperor, praying, "that the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday and from feast-days to some other days of the week." And the reason, he says, why they passed this resolution, was, not that they feared the shows would be a financial failure if open on Sunday, or that the empire would come to ruin therefor, but "the people congregate more to the circus than to the church, and it is not fitting that Christians should gather at the spectacles, since the exercises there are contrary to the precepts of God; and if they are not open, the Christians would attend more to things divine."

So in this latter case, this International Young Men's Christian Association that is soliciting the co-operation of "Christian workers throughout the world" in an effort to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, is not afraid that the Fair will be a failure if open on Sunday, or this Government come to naught if it should be, but its leaders are afraid, if open, it would be much better patronized than the churches; and hence they wish the Fair closed on Sunday, and thus corral the people in the churches. But the spirit which demands such means to get people to act religiously, will, if necessary to carry its point, resort to compulsory measures; and as the efforts of the ambitious but unregenerate bishops of the fourth century resulted in a union of Church and State, so will the like efforts of these later churchmen in the nineteenth century result in the same thing.

No civil government has any commission to administer the divine law.
