The *Independent*, of June 25, says that on Thursday, June 11, the Rev. S. Hopkins Emery, of the Massachusetts Legislature, the only clergyman, and the oldest member of the House, offered the following, which was unanimously adopted;—

WHEREAS, Massachusetts has always been true to the pilgrim spirit, which planted the Old Colony and laid the foundation of this grand Republic;

Therefore, In the opinion of this House, it is most and proper that in the coming World's Columbian Exposition, in the city of Chicago, this State should make manifest to the world in every possible manner, the prevailing sentiment of the people on the subject of the observance of the Lord's day as it is expressed by public statute and practice of the inhabitants of the commonwealth.

There seems to be a sentiment quite deeply rooted in the minds of a goodly number of men that if the Exposition can only be closed on Sunday, and the so-called American Sabbath thus fairly presented to the visitors from the Old World, that it will have a magic effect upon them, break down all their infidelity, and bring them at once to acknowledge the all-sufficient good to be found in Christianity. If the managers of the Exposition see fit to close its gates on Sunday no one can, with propriety, object. If the majority of the exhibitors see fit to close it, it is certainly their unqualified privilege. But if the State steps in and lends its sanction to a religious dogma, by closing the gates on that day, one fails to see where the great impression of sanctity will be enforced upon the mind of the visitor to the Fair, especially as he sees so much lawlessness and general debauchery and wickedness, not only in Chicago, but in all the cities of our commonwealth. It might answer for the washing of the outside of the cup and platter, or the garnishing of the tombs of the fathers, but it would only make the extortion and excess that abounds everywhere all the more apparent; because the thinking man would be sure to contrast the hypocrisy of such a scheme with the abounding wickedness seen in every part of our land.
