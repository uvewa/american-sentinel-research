# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, July 16, 1891 (v06n28)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from 8 page images at limited resolution. The small text size and three-column layout made precise letter-by-letter OCR extremely challenging throughout. Many passages contain OCR artifacts where individual words or phrases could not be reliably read. A higher-resolution scan would be needed to verify much of this transcription.
