## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Editorial Note
- **Text:** "ten perance" in article 9
- **Transcribed as:** "ten perance" (appears to be OCR artifact for "temperance")
- **Confidence:** HIGH - context makes clear this should be "temperance" but OCR shows space
- **Action:** Retained as shown in OCR to preserve exact transcription

### Page 7, Advertisements
- Several advertisement texts were partially illegible or truncated in the OCR
- Advertisements were not transcribed as per instructions (skip ads, subscription info)

### Author Initials
- **S. H. Carnahan** - Author of article 9, initials "SHC" derived from signature
- **W. C. Titsworth** - Author of article 32, initials "WCT" derived from signature
- Both are NOT in the standard known authors list for 1891

### General OCR Quality
- Some word breaks and hyphenation may reflect OCR artifacts rather than original typesetting
- Page header repetitions ("THE AMERICAN SENTINEL") were omitted from article transcriptions
- Running page numbers were omitted from article transcriptions
