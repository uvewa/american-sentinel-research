"SAY, young man, I just broke my suspenders," said Policeman Kelley of the seventh precinct, to the clerk in the dry goods store at 37 Division Street, one Sunday recently. "Will you give me a new pair? Its very uncomfortable going around this way." When the package had been wrapped up, he arrested the clerk for violating a Sunday law. The next prisoner before the Justice, was Joseph Kellhart, a shoe dealer of 96 East Broadway. Policeman Conway hastily entered his place, and said: "Give me a bottle of shoe blacking. I want it for my wife. She's in a hurry to go to church." Kellhart gave him the article and was arrested. The Justice before whom the prisoners were arraigned condemned these arrests, saying that "it does not add to the dignity of the police force of this city for patrolmen to be permitted to enter small shops on Sunday and make purchases to entrap the clerks into violating the Sunday laws." About the only thing that could possibly add to the dignity of a police force made up in part of men capable of such methods, would be to degrade them from the force and then shun them as one would a deadly pestilence. Is it any wonder that anarchists multiply upon every hand, when laws are thus abused by those appointed to administer them?
