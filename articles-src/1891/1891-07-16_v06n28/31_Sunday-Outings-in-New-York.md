In the *New York World*, of June 14, the editor dwells at some length on the subject of "Sunday Outings." After mentioning some of the parks as fine places to enjoy a Sunday in recreation, he says:—

These are the places for your Sunday outings. Take your own sandwiches, wear flannels and straw hats, walk till you are tired, rest in the ample shade of old trees and be happy.

But the Sunday-law advocates tell us that no amusement is in harmony with the spirit of that day. If their measures should carry, it might be possible that even the parks would be closed on Sunday, especially as the city papers have reported one of the commissioners as saying that if he had his way everything would be closed.
