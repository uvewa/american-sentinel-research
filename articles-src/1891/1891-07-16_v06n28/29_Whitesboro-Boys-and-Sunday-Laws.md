THE editor of the *Whitesboro News*, Whitesboro, Texas, is evidently an apt student of W. F. Crafts as shown by this warning which he gives the children of Whitesboro:—

Boys, it is a violation of law to play ball and marbles on Sunday, and we would whisper a little friendly warning into your ear, that if you indulge in this sport any more on the Sabbath day you'll be pulled and fined. Now, don't you do it.

These boys must belong to the same family as Mr. Crafts's "little enbeazlers," and they are all to be connected by the Sunday school injunction, "Children, don't do it, you'll be pulled and fined."
