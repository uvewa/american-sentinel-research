# Phariseeism.

JESUS said to the Pharisees, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also." And again, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness."

This is the Savior's description of ancient Phariseeism, and it is therefore the best and truest that can be given.

It is the design of this article to discuss ancient Phariseeism only long enough to show that there is a modern counterpart as near damnation a thing in all its hideous deformity. The thing is not only the same, but the cause is also the same.

What was the cause of the Phariseeism of the time of Christ? It was the result of a false theocracy. It was God's purpose to rule over his own government, and at first he did so.

The kingdom of Israel was then a true theocracy, the only one the world has ever seen. This is, and must ever remain, the only truly theocratic government; for God is infinite in goodness and in wisdom. Because he is infinite in his wisdom, he always does know what is best for the people, and what is best for them is the way that is best for them even from a long range. Because he is infinite in wisdom, he always knows just what is best; because, in other words he sees that the majority of men do the Theocrats, is a theocracy, to honestly govern believers in God, must ever remain the ideal of government, far in advance of monarchy or of the republic.

The enforced saints will be ruled over true by God, but even God himself could not, by force of arm or enactments of government, make a man inwardly, and therefore, truly, a theocrat; for they gave the gospel—a revelation of his infinite love—and said: "This is my beloved Son, and purify them from it. If a the gospel only that can *get* rightly the heart from. No man can do it himself, and no outward form of law or political power can accomplish it for him. Saith the Lord, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Jer. 13:23.

The Israelites rejected God as their king, and demanded a king like the nations around them. For a time they served God, and put to death his prophets, and all those rulers claimed that right to govern and dictate in all things, both civil and religious, as God had once done. This was the prerogative of moral government taken out of the hands of God, who alone can read the heart, and know the motive or [page 218]

[page 219] immoral intent, and put into the hands of foolish men; and thus was the kingdom of Israel transformed into a false theocracy, the worst kind of a despotism.

The Israelites also rejected the gospel, the only means of changing the heart, and depended altogether upon the law, which could only enforce outward observance. See Heb. 8:1, and Rom. 9:30 to 10:3. Thus they made clean the outside of the cup and platter, and this was the effect of their sepulchres. They multiplied outward observances, and forgot the weightier matters of the law—justice, mercy, and truth. In their greed of gain, they devoured widows' houses, and for a pretense made long prayers. All this is the logical and unavoidable result of trying to make men righteous simply by law. Phariseeism was but a false theocracy gone to seed.

Because they had thus abused the theocratic form of government, God destroyed the Jerusalem nation, and declared there should never be another true theocracy till the everlasting kingdom of Christ was set up on the redeemed world, as foretold by all the prophets, Eze. 21:25-27. Every theocracy that does not exist prior to that time, must therefore be a false theocracy—other men or men ruling in the place of God. Such was the Papacy and such the government of Calvin's Geneva, and of the Puritans in Massachusetts; and such will be the result the National Sabbath Union and their allies, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, shall have accomplished their object. The same causes will produce the same effect. As every false theocracy has produced a hypocritical Phariseeism of outward forms, so will this. Just as every other man-made theocracy has persecuted those who have walked in the light of God, and that truly love, have condemned the prevailing hypocrisy, so will this.

If the Bible speaks of perilous times to come in the last days, these men have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof, is it not something significant to cause men moral by law, and to teach them Christianity, is a polite demand of the power of the Christian Church to do what God commanded it to do; and yet almost all the appeals are made by those who have a form of godliness. The Christ, of God, declared with the power of God is the only thing that can really do the work of changing the hearts of those to make them truly moral. The State at best can only touch the outward act. The religious political movement of the day, is not in the interest of Christianity but in the interest of Phariseeism which in this while world be merged into a political religion, into national, creedism, combine—"and I tell you yes! You are only making the same old errors worse, some better have kept still. But as the District of Columbia, all the Territory, and twenty-three of the States and many States have temperance teaching enacted by law, shall we not go ahead? Our women have worked toward the same trend. The work against the saloon was antagonistic to the day; if we succeeded we would destroy a great industry, almost many men who would otherwise be our friends, especially in the South. But the women said, 'unless destroy a great industry than our boys,' and kept the thing going. To-day 'remove' and we are nearly is fair question. And we must do right is right, and that is what we want. . . . —on the Sunday question!"

This is significant. The women of the Woman's Christian Temperance [page 219]

regularly, they are really religious. Such outward observances, in their eyes cover a multitude of sins. Even the saloon-keeper, if he shuts up on Sunday and goes to church, is respectable to say the least; and he may carry on his iniquitous business six days in the week without losing that respectability. In fact, if he gives a little of his ill-gotten gain now and then to support some church, or some missionary enterprise, he is almost respectable.

By the combined efforts of the American Sabbath Union, and the Massachusetts Sabbath Association, a Sunday-law convention was held at Lowell, Massachusetts, June 2. Delegates were present from some twenty different cities. As usual, nearly all of them were ministers. After the opening exercises, and the address of welcome, the first speech on the programme was by Rev. W. V. Krauth, of Haverhill, Massachusetts, on the subject of "Sabbath Desecration."

Mr. Evarts spoke of the Pharisaical use of the Sabbath as a false, alluding to their various traditions concerning it. They taught that it was breaking the Sabbath, to sow and to reap that was laid on that day. They taught that it was wrong to travel beyond a certain distance on the Sabbath, and wrong to carry a handkerchief if it was not pinned to the other garments, because it was bearing a burden on the Sabbath day. All along their object was that it was wrong to walk on the grass, on the Sabbath day, for fear you might tread some seed of the grass, and that would be work.

After the speaker had finished, the audience was dismissed in a number of five minute speeches by a different speaker, being instructed by the presiding officer, to especially mention the various forms of "Sabbath desecration most prevalent in their respective districts. One of these ministers, with a dolorous look on his face, said that in his town, the fathers and mothers would get up on Sunday morning, and put on their good clothes, and go out in the front yard to a cool place, and sit down on the grass, and chat and visit with no thought of their duty to attend church. "Such Sabbath desecration as this ought to be stopped." The ministers seemed unconscious of the resemblance between the man and the Phariseeism which in the very paper under discussion, had been reprobated as false.

Just even the Pharisees would have allowed them to sit on the grass; it not to walk on it. Another minister said that he and his wife on the front porch the other Sundays, in a cool place, and a number of bicycles and carriages and bicycle, that they felt they were breaking the Sabbath to look at them, and so had to go into the house, and shut themselves in. He said a godly lady in Lynn, whose house was near the beach, said she had to do that every Sunday, she also felt guilty.

Of course such teaching on Sabbath-keeping will go to make the observance of God's actual Sabbath, day's journey church and back, ought to be stopped by law, so that those poor people need not be compelled to thus shut themselves up.

Specimens of this modern Phariseeism might be multiplied, but in inasmuch as a both common and religious history, that must, must be the result of all religious laws, and these are sufficient to prove that even now the leaven works.
