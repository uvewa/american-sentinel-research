# Desecrating Sunday in New York.

THE *Sentinels*, though the Court of General Sessions, recently made a judge's charge on the subject of the excise law, in which it entitles the methods adopted in the police for saloon-keepers on Sunday. "And all of the excise cases investigated by the Grand Jury during the past month were dismissed," says "the report, because 'the officers who made the arrests offered contradictory evidence as to the violations of the law,' and not only gives verdict of a spirit of 'persecution rather than a desire to fully discharge duty.'"

"The charge in this particular case is, that past presentments by the Grand Jury dealt with the same subject in very much the same way. Most of the time of the Grand Jury must insured in disposing of charges is occupied with the considerations of Sunday excise cases, the great majority being charges of violations of the Sunday closing law, and monthly some time the Grand Jury must be tired of going through the same thing again and again.

"Everybody knows that the saloons and bar rooms generally are open on Sundays in a matter of course. The policemen are in the vicinity. The people are free to walk the streets on the outward and thousands that walk or liquor of shops with little disturbance. Beer houses are open as usual; on Sunday night of comment, and other elements of respectability. The corner liquor saloon almost silently customers through side doors, and the business proceeds throughout the town. Yet a large number of arrests are made. Are the violations of the Sunday closing law, as if it were actually and vigorously enforced, and these cases come before the Grand Jury to consume time in the courts. The defendants are found conviction under the merely follow, and as this present, ment, most of the cases are dismissed in the Grand Jury room because of the field of evidence. Manifest by [page 219]

[page 220] liquor continues Sunday after Sunday, is not in itself to the innocent seems to have little or no fear of disturbance. If every lawkeeper who violates the law was apprehended, the courts alone could scarcely contain the crowd.

"Of course, the arrests are a mere sham. They are, apparently, of small benefit to the most part, and the evidence obtained against the alleged offenders seems to be usually of a very flimsy character.

"The Grand Jury means, evidently, being made a party to such a humbug. It also has a sense of justice and it is not regard as the discrimination in the arrests, so as to see that the opportunity offered alike the arbitrary exercise of power encourages gross injustice, and tends to the demoralization of the police, otherwise distinguished for fidelity to their trust. The police know the law is a farce, that it is not sustained by public sentiment, and that it cannot be enforced universally, and are equally, and they are diverted by the same from the serious performance of their duty and tempted to favoritism, persecution, and injustice.

"The presentment demands that the police regulations shall be made to conform to the law; but there never has been much conformity, except for brief periods and as a sporadic exhibition of activity.

It was tried very thoroughly under Mayor Hewitt, and after a few Sundays was abandoned as hopeless. To enforce the law absolutely, universally, and continuously would require that the whole attention of the police be given to that single effort. It would have to be made, too, over the strong opposition of public sentiment, and the sentiment of the churches and the law firms, but of the police, the respectable and the law abiding, for most of the Sunday-strikers are quiet and orderly people; Germans for instance, who consume their beer daily.

"Of hasty police regulations will not be of any avail. The police have distributed themselves for their regulations they set its neighbors right upon the border of Sunday laws. One of them is right."

If the *Puck's* Children is shown in its demonstration of, a leader established Sunday school services in the churches and have character, and consequently country to the fundamental principles of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence.

It is the Oracle is quite right. Sunday legislation is utterly opposed to that religious liberty guaranteed by the National Constitution and ought to be opposed by every friend of that and that institution as it is in His regard. But our contemporary falls into an error in proposing a possible remedy for the evils of such laws. It says:

"To practical, intelligent, informing believe that in America equal justice is guaranteed all men irrespective of religious or other beliefs, etc., and that in time the scales will be readjusted, but not practically, it is necessary and wise and time to strike a sharp blow even at the risk of breaking the faulty article in his vice, and so it may be necessary now to teach the weak a lesson by the precept of an old fashioned John Stuart law. The sale of intoxicating beverages on Sunday will go, the law, and the regulation of the traffic should be recognized as inevitable.

"The outrage of the arbitrary and discriminating Sunday arrests is far worse in its effects upon the popular respect for the law, and the popular sense of justice, any evil which could come from the freest sale of intoxicating beverages of that day."
