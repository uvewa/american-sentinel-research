Could shops on Sunday and make purchases; to torture the clerks into violating the Sunday laws." About the only thing that could possibly add to the dignity of a police force made up in part of men capable of such methods, would be to circulate them from the force and then shrove them as one would a deadly pestilence. Is it any wonder that sacredness multiply open every hand, when laws are made close by those appointed to administer them?

In its edition of June 25, the *Christian Statesman* says that the National Reform Association "has always held that the only foundation for the law of Sabbath rest is found in the law of God." It therefore follows that is in enforcing by civil law rest is attempting to enforce the law of God, and the National Reform Association is assuming to itself that prerogative.

SUNDAY evening, June 21, a policeman in citizen's clothes entered a New York grocery store and asked for a penny cigar. It was furnished him and he arrested the proprietor for breaking the Sunday law. At the arraignment, in the Essex Market Police Court, Justice Ryan said:—"I got disgusted with those cases. I am very sorry that I must hold this Shylock. I would discharge you if I could." A viction of contempt must not add to the plain teaching of such an incident as this.

CHICAGO has a formidable array of notices to look after its Sunday observance. They are the Sixth District organization of the American Sabbath Union; the International Committee for the closing of the World's Fair on Sundays, the Columbus Sunday Association; and the Chicago Sunday Association; with the latter proposes to elect exclusively a civil society. To these should be added the Law and Order League, which has been headquarters on hand.

REV. W. C. SELLECK spoke in Denver, Colorado, June 28, on the subject of Sunday desecration. The Sunday newspaper, excursions, ball games, and live topics their platforms.

He was consulted. He said there was no doubt a public demand for these things; but the editors of the papers, and those furnishing the amusements, were prompted wholly by the desire for money. "Mr. Selleck said not advocate law as a remedy for the evil, but made a strong appeal, especially to editors, to have a higher object than to simply make money. The good we may do should ever have the precedence, and our love for gain be kept in its background."

If all the ministers would make their appeals to the hearts of individuals, trusting it to note them that by his Spirit to [page 222]

lead righteous lives, instead of demanding so much civil law, their work would be much more in harmony with Him whom they profess to serve.

Under the heading, "A Chicago Observer Sabbatarized," the *Chicago Tribune*, of June 23, says:—

At a meeting Sunday night the Rev. Mr. Moley, of the First United Presbyterian Church, denounced what he termed the effort of city legislation by the civil authorities of all work on the first day of the week. He said: "If God ever intended in exalting the Sabbath, which is the seventh day."

Mr. Moley's words are quoted with entire approval, and yet he is said called to his attention of which he and his had been so willingly ignorant, that

in Illinois, as in every other State in the United States, the Church and State are separated, and the former can not use the powers of the latter to enforce obedience to its theology.
