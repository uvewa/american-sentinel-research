## The Right Ring.

The *Los Angeles Churchman,* a monthly periodical, devoted to the interests of the Episcopal Church in Southern California, is doing some good work in opposition to so-called National Reform and American Sabbath Union ideas. The following, from the December number, will bear repeating:—

"For sterling honesty and common business sense, with a clear conception of the proper functions of civil government, we commend the late message of Mayor Grant of New York City to the Sunday closing ordinances. It has the right ring.

"The Mayor may have erred in judgment in not signing the ordinances, in which we think he did, but that he is right on the matter of Sunday closing is not a shadow of doubt. The agitation set on foot by the National Reform Association to secure such an amendment is misconceived also.

"'Moreover a principal object, undoubtedly *the* principal object, National Reformers have in view when demanding the establishment of the Christian as the State religion, is the furtherance and promotion of it; they want to make the State subservient to the interests of the Church,— they want to advance the cause of Christianity by the aid and at the expense of the State. The kingdom of Christ is not to be advanced or sustained through the aid of the civil power, but through the word of God and through the proclamation of that word. Christ, when sending his apostles to the world, did not say to them: "Plant my church and extend its limits by calling to your assistance the civil magistrates to the different countries of the globe;" but what did He say? He spoke very plainly to them on this point. He said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned." Mark 16: 15, 16. Compare Matt. 28: 19, 20.

"'The preaching of the gospel and the administration of the holy sacraments, and the divine institution of the ministry, the divinely appointed means through which Christ establishes, enlarges, and preserves his Church upon earth. And these means contain in themselves the sufficiency for the accomplishment of what they are to accomplish. The employment of every other means for the establishment and preservation of the Church of Christ is an insult to the Spirit of God, and is virtually declaring that the means furnished by Christ are not sufficient. Repressive and demanding of civil government to further the interests of Christianity is therefore unscriptural, consequently the agitation to secure a constitutional amendment is unscriptural, and such an amendment, if secured, would be unscriptural also.'

"We want to see the saloons closed every day; we want them utterly abolished from the land, but not to go to the root of the matter; to have them closed merely on Sunday under penalty of fine and imprisonment to satisfy the clamor of religionists, is a piece of Puritan fanaticism which is plainly branded with the mark of the beast of religious tyranny, the worst of all tyrants, and the deadly foe of free and enlightened civilization.

"The saloons are not only the flag of the defiance of a people possessed of the devil, they are also the sign of the Church's sin of covetousness, and of the Church's slothful impotency. The saloons in any city would all be closed within a year if the Christians within it would do their duty in their families first as Christians. But as the saloons are they are not as bad as modern Christianity trying to hide its shame and nakedness under a cloak of Sunday laws.

"We want the Nazarene in the modern temple to cry: 'Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.'"
