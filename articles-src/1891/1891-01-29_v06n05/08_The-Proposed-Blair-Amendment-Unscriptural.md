The following paragraphs are from an excellent article which appeared some time since in the Lutheran Witness, St. Louis, Missouri:

"The aim and object of the National Reform Association, is the establishment of the Christian as the State religion of the Republic in which we have the privilege of living. The accomplishment of this object would be considered by National Reformers as the greatest triumph of Christianity and the Bible. Yet the striving after the accomplishment of this object is radically unscriptural. For in order that the desired object might be brought about, it would be necessary for the State, as such, to concern itself with spiritual and religious things, and to legislate concerning them as it does concerning civil affairs, and by doing this it would step outside of its own province and meddle with affairs which are foreign to its very essence and to the object of its existence.

"What is the State? The State is an institution, a worldly institution, a divinely ordained institution, if you please, which has for its object the governing of the people within its limits according to a certain standard, the maintaining of law and order, and the protection of its inhabitants in external and temporal affairs. Religion belongs to an altogether different province, to the province of the Church, just as the care of children belongs to the province of the family. All three, the State, the Church, and the family, have their own peculiar provinces, in which to live, and move, and act; have their own peculiar duties to perform, their own peculiar affairs to conduct.

"God has instituted the State, the civil government, and requires of it a faithful performance of the duty it has as a civil government; so, he has also instituted the family and demands of it a faithful discharge of the duties it has as a family; in the same manner the Church is a divine institution and is expected to faithfully and scrupulously administer its own affairs in compliance with the rules and regulations laid down in the Bible, and is accountable to its Lord and Master for such administration. Civil government is not responsible for what the Church does, nor is the Church responsible for the doings of the State, nor is the family responsible for the doings of either or both, but the Church, civil government, and the family, are responsible each for its own peculiar doings in its own peculiar sphere. The State should remain within its own sphere, as should also the family and the Church remain within their own province; none should overstep the divinely constituted bonds, nor intrude on the premises of the others, nor presume to interfere with the affairs of the others. As soon as any such interference occurs, then the interfering institution becomes a transgressor. 'Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's'—Matt. 22:21.

"Caesar, or what is the same thing, civil government, and God, or the Church of God, are two radically different things: each has certain claims in every individual. Let each individual, therefore, so conduct himself towards civil government and towards the Church as his specific duty towards each requires. This implies that civil government should not interfere with religion, and vice versa, the Church should not interfere with the administration of State affairs. The interference of one with the affairs of the other is impliedly forbidden in this scripture passage. That Christ our Lord was in earnest when he said 'Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's;' that he really meant that civil government should not interfere with the affairs of the Church, and that the Church should not meddle with State matters, he plainly set forth by his own example, when on a certain occasion he refused to play the part of a civil magistrate, saying, 'Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?' Luke 12:14.

Now, if the United States, which, in the case before us, is civil Government, would add an amendment to its Constitution, establishing the Christian as the State religion, such action would be an interference on the part of the State with religious matters; for by such amendment our Government would enjoin upon every citizen a belief in the Christian religion and would virtually declare every inhabitant a Christian. Just this very thing the State has no right whatsoever to do, and this is forbidden in Scriptures. Therefore the proposed constitutional amendment respecting religion, if adopted, would be unscriptural; and the movement set on foot by the National Reform Association to secure such an amendment is unscriptural also.

"Moreover a principal object, undoubtedly the principal object, National Reformers have in view when demanding the establishment of the Christian as the State religion, is the furtherance and promotion of it; they want to make the State subservient to the interests of the Church; they want to advance the cause of Christianity by the aid and at the expense of the State. . . . The kingdom of Christ is not to be advanced or sustained through the aid of the civil power, but through the word of God and through the proclamation of that word. Christ, when sending his apostles out into the world did not say to them; 'Plant my church and extend its limits by calling to your assistance the civil magistrates in the different countries of the globe;' but what did he say? He spoke very plainly to them on this point. He said, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.' Mark 16:15, 16. Compare also Matt. 28:19, 20.

"The preaching of the gospel and the administration of the holy sacraments, and the divine institution of the ministry, are the divinely appointed means through which Christ establishes, advances, and preserves his Church upon earth. And these means contain in themselves the sufficiency for the accomplishment of what they are to accomplish. The employment of every other means for the establishment and preservation of the Church of Christ is an insult offered to the Son of God, and is virtually declaring that the means furnished by Christ are insufficient. Requesting and demanding of civil government to further the interests of Christianity is therefore unscriptural; consequently the agitation to secure a constitutional amendment to this affect is unscriptural, and such an amendment, if secured, would be unscriptural also."
