WE have received another letter from Rev. H. O. Hoffman, of Bloomington, Illinois, which will appear next week. Mr. Hoffman takes issue with us upon the question of moral instruction in the public schools. Those interested in the matter would do well to preserve his former letter and our answer to it, which appeared in No. 3, of the current volume.
