on the assent of every man. We do not claim those under the charter of king or legislature, but under the King of kings.

As we come down further in our national history it is just as strongly maintained, and even more emphatically stated. Colonel Johnson, in his Birthday mail report to the Senate (Representative, 1830), said:—

The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is this consciousness which, in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and in flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their consciences. It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate.

The logic or the pride of his abilities may lead him into the dark and dreary provinces of atheism; the heart of man cannot be made an atheist. Still groping after its kindred spirit, it turns its eager gaze beyond the visible horizon and longs for a communion with its Creator.—*Extract from a speech by Senator Morrill, of Vermont, against Sunday mails.*

The conditions of this doctrine, however modified or stated, rest upon the same principle in the capital hands of Herbert Spencer. Speaking of this innate sense, Spencer says:—

There exist in man what may be termed intuitions of natural rights, or feeling which, even though there may not be in a given state of natural privilege as is claimed by observers, finding that leads him to expect anything like an enforcement upon which he thinks the appose of national feelings. By these primary impulses, individuals, or units of the social mass, acquire in nature his relationships with the name of another, surrender as the one to fifty other respective assumption of qualities as well as of attraction. ... Let us refer to one or two manifestations of the depend upon the free balance of these forces.

And here we note, first, the opinion of a so-called philosophical politician, who arrived with certain convictions as to the existence of these rights, and those are his ideas incurred by government. As a citizen of Bordeaux, constitution requires them to do this. Accordingly, although it does violence to the time ancient perception, they toddle this to enter among these particular—entirely. They nevertheless perpetually bring a belief in the doctrines which they preferably reject. They inadvertently talk about, purely, partially when it concerns their selves, in much the same style as their opponents. They draw the same distinction between law and equity that other people do. They applaud Johnson and have sorry, quite ignoring their dictum about law; they also perceive, that when an act that is assailed, or wrongly imprisoned, they exhibit the same indignation, the same abhorrence of the aggressors; trine the same demonstrations of sympathy, the same loud demands for redress as the assertors of the rights of man. By way of explaining such inconsistency it is indeed alleged, that the feeling thus manifested is nothing but the result of a gradually acquired habit of thinking and believing; that like other habits, it naturally besets few more some kinds of action, and excites from other action; and is and that the sympathy, pathos and antipathies respectively contracted towards these, exhibit themselves as a love of justice, and a hatred of injustice. To which supposition, it was by inquisitive elsewhere replied, that it would in the first place, be needful to show that these feelings are not referable to a consciousness arising from a conviction of the benefit of voting; or that each man has as much right to act for himself as any other.

But this is amusing when, after all, it turns out that the ground on which these philosophers have taken their stand, and from which with such skill they compliment they shove their sarcasms, is nothing but an adversary's mine, destined to blow the vast fabric of conclusions they have based on it into nonentity. This so solid-looking principle of "the greatest happiness to the greatest number," needs but to have a light brought near it, and it is discovered to contain the astounding assertion, that all men have equal rights to happiness; an assertion far more sweeping and revolutionary than any of those which are coupled with so much scorn.

When we see, that an instinct of personal rights manifests itself irrepressibly in opinions and actions of their very opponents we have every reason to trace the recollection of this instinct to experience. Tracing however, this instinct to experience, we trace it to a conviction and to a persuasion of the degree of those who most stoutly deny that there are any natural rights. For coming to this observation from it, we find ourselves in possession of the strongest possible evidence of its acceptance in the testimony of all parties. We are therefore justified in maintaining that existence as a self-evident truth.

—*Social Statics, chapter 4, sections 2, 3.*

In examining the position of the "Christian party"—party—of those who deny the rights of man—*Spencer says:*—

"But that we possess such a sense is in the last place provable by evidence from the lips of those who deny it."—*Id., chapter 5, section 4.* ... And besides Benthamites unwittingly derive his initial proposition from the very doctrine he condemns. If every man has a right to happiness, then every man has a right which he assures he is appraised by its others. For what is meant by saying that a man has a "right" say to have a thing made on purpose to tell him what it is and not to wrong him. ... For if each has a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right and what is wrong, a moral sense, a moral arbiter; and then, as he goes to work at his task, and says you are not such a thing as right; and such a thing is wrong. Why? "Because my moral sense tells me so." But your Benthamite should have no other authority for his own assertion than this same moral sense, authority you despise for him. Yet on putting that nature into material heads, with cool assurance sets to the building. Let us look on.

And as you "think," says the patriotic, "that you got your rule about the greatest happiness from the greatest number. ...

Well, now, let us see what your principle of values. Suppose unto to be, as they very commonly are, at variance on a future one—some of them sions and suppose that from forming the larger party you will receive a certain amount of happiness from the adoption of one course; whilst from forming the smaller party will receive the same amount of happiness each, from the adoption of the opposite course, what must be done?

"The greatest happiness," replies your formula guide, it must follow, must it not, that the larger body shall have their way?

"Certainly."

That is if say, if you, the people, are a hundred, and fifty-one of you have wished one way and forty-nine preferred, should our wishes clash, and should the two sides be equal?"

"Exactly."

"Exact it is a maxim involves that.—"

"So then it means, that, as in such a case, you do not claim a preponderance for any theory; if not, you assume that the happiness of a member of the one party, is equally important with that of a member of the other."

"Therefore, if reduced to its simplest form, your doctrine cuts to be to the assertion that all men have equal claims to happiness; or, applying it as you virtually, that you have as good a right to happiness as any one else."

"No doubt I have."

"Well but, that is exactly what you call the rights of man, that I thought you ... and if you feel at;—"

Tell me who told you this—show me this—and if it—whence you derived it.—

Whereupon, after many shuffling, our petitioner is forced to confess that he has arrived to understand his own feelings—that his simply is an innate perception of that is. In other words that his moral sense asserts him so.—

In truth, writes but his committed by accepting as a social theory, that faith is freedom, no every man with the worship of one's a family. Every man is free.

These statements have been constant signs of the influence which happily thicken as our own country has increased in population, and now in its protests against oppression, and its demands for the correction of social abuses, when there was as decided partly at its magnitude. In its strength lay moreover in the fact that it has made men who could not and would not cower. These are indeed, who feel and know, how their contents with pepper and by it were Huguenots who were martyrs. Martyrdom, who insured immense freedom of judgment in the teeth of armed secular power. It claimed Moor's "Utopia, Roger William's 'Island of Universal Printing!'" It piloted the Pilgrim Fathers to the World's West. It reared the colonies. It forced George Fox under fines and imprisonment. It raised the cry "no taxation without representation" clearly of 1802. In latter days it existed with the name of Clarkson, Wilberforce, and others who brought themselves flooding of sensation and slavery. It stamped out and the flu, to the worldlings of the persecutors and persecuted alike, was an unintelligible proposition. It was its least, too, which warmed all who struggled on behalf of the people into dignity of their oppressors. Erst in question—"what is the source of the rights of man?"—promoted the effectiveness of a reform.

By the passage of an article content in that terms of anthropology, which classes him amongst the natural sequence the nature its medicine and policy of that make its rights of man. It is true that the proposed it puts on the garb of anti-Church-and-State to the contrary of political and mental sections for the extension of popular self has the Government for liberty. By the act of Parliament, political association in all of England denied. In spite nothing the rights of the people, made impossible all those conventions, reforms to the spirit of our selves alike both in the reign of George III, and makes on historically, and thruths with prosperity the Huguenots and so on of nations, the National Woman's Christian Temperance and its balanced "rights" not as but the full article of the Seventh-day Adventist and fundamental freedom rights of the others. As soon as any such interference from them, then an equally fundamental institution becomes a transgressor. "Render unto Caesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Christ. Matt. 22:21.

"Carry, at what is the same thing, civil government, and God, or the Church of God, are two entirely different things; each has certain claims in every individual. Let each individual, therefore, so conduct towards each his own life, and towards the Church as his specific duty to each of such requires. This implies that civil government should not interfere with religion, and vice versa, the Church, the Provinces, must.

What is self-evident in the right of one with the affairs of the other is there legally forbidden in this scripture passage: But Christ our Lord is not in wants it be said 'Render unto Cesar the things that are Cesar's and to God the things that are God's;' that he really meant that civil government should not interfere in the affairs of the Church, and that the Church should not interfere in the affairs of nations, he plainly set forth by his own example, when at a certain occasion he refused to play the part of a civil magistrate, saying, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? Luke 12:14.

Now, of the United States, which, in that, has been as to civil Government, to form and add an amendment to its Constitution, establishing the Christian as the State religion, which action would be a State interference on the part of the State with civil matters; for by this amendment our Government would upon every citizen a belief in the Christian religion and would virtually declare every individual, must be a Christian. Just this very thing the State has no right whatever to do, and this is forbidden in Scripture. Therefore the proposed constitutional amendment respecting religion, if adopted, would to be incontrovertibly, and its adoption more
