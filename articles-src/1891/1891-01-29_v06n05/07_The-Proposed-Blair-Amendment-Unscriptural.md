## The Proposed Blair Amendment Unscriptural.

The following paragraphs are from an excellent article which appeared some time since in the *Lutheran Witness,* St. Louis:—

"The aim and object of the National Reform Association, is the establishment of the Christian as the State religion of the Republic in which we have the privilege of living. The accomplishment of this object would be considered by National Reformers as the greatest triumph of Christianity and the Bible. Yet for striving after the accomplishment of this object is radically *unscriptural.* For in order that the desired object might be brought about, it would be necessary for the State, as such, to concern itself with spiritual and religious things, and to legislate concerning them as it does concerning civil affairs, and by doing this it would step outside of its own province and meddle with affairs which are foreign to its very essence and at the object of its proper work and purpose.

"What is the State? The State is an institution, a worldly institution, a divinely ordained institution, if you please, which has for its object the governing of the people within its limits according to a certain standard, the maintenance of law and order, and the protection of its inhabitants in external and temporal affairs. Religion belongs to an altogether different province, to the domain of the Church, just as the care of children belongs to the province of the family. All these, the State, the Church, and the family, have their own peculiar province, in which to live, and move, and act; have their own peculiar duties to perform, their own peculiar affairs to administer.

"God has instituted the State, the civil government, and requires of it a faithful performance of the duty it has as a civil government; so, he has also instituted family and demands of it a faithful discharge of the duties it has as a family; in the same manner the Church is a divine institution and is expected to faithfully and scrupulously administer its own affairs in compliance with the rules and regulations laid down in the Bible, and in accordance to its Lord and Master for such administration. Civil government is not responsible for what the Church does, nor is the Church responsible for the doings of the State, nor is the family responsible for the doings of either or both, the Church, civil government, and the family, are responsible each for its own peculiar doings in its own peculiar sphere. The State should remain within its own sphere, as should also the family and the Church; remain within their own province; none should overstepping the divinely constituted bounds, nor intrude on the premises of the others, nor presume to interfere with the affairs of the others. As soon as any such interference takes place, then an institution itself becomes a transgressor. 'Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.' Matt. 22: 21.

"Clearly, what is the same thing, civil government, and God, or the Church of God, are two radically different things; each has certain claims in every individual. Let each individual, therefore, as counseled forward by our divine Saviour, towards the Church as his inspires duty towards each requires. The impulse of civil government should not interfere with religion, and *vice versa,* the Church should not interfere with the administration of civil government. The intermingling of one with the affairs of the other is absolutely forbidden in this scripture passage: 'My chief Lord and our Nation be sworn to' he said 'Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's;' that he really mean that civil government should not interfere in the affairs of the Church, and that the Church should not interfere with State matters, he plainly set forth by his own example, when at a certain occasion he refused to play the part of a civil magistrate, saying, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? Luke 12: 14.

"Now, if the United States, which, in fact, has never been, so to say, a civil Government, would add an amendment to its Constitution, establishing the Christian as the State religion, each section would be an interference on the part of the State with matters of the Church; for by such amendment our Government would usurp upon every citizen a belief of the Christian religion and would virtually dictate every individual what to believe. Just this very thing the State has no right whatsoever to do, and this is forbidden in Scripture. Therefore such proposed constitutional amendment respecting religion, if adopted, would be unscriptural; its enactment, and its acceptance would be unscriptural."
