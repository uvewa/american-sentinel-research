The introduction of religious measures in Congress and in various State Legislatures, within the last few years, is the cause which led to the organization of the National Religious Liberty Association. Certain men, observing the nature of these measures, and seeing in them a menace to the inherent rights of citizens as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, decided to raise a note of warning, and present to the people the dangerous nature of religious legislation, and, at the same time, to disseminate a knowledge of the true principles of religious liberty, and show the relation which the civil Government sustains to it.

The first organized form which this movement assumed, was in the appointment of a Press Committee of seven, for the purpose of securing the publication of articles on the subject of religious liberty in the public press. This was in January, 1889. The efforts of the Committee were well received by the public, and as the work increased, it was seen that a more thorough organization, with well defined principles, was needed. Accordingly, July 21, 1889, the National Religious Liberty Association was organized, a Declaration of Principles set forth, and a Constitution and By-Laws adopted. Since that time the Association has,—

1. Sent its representatives to appear before committees of Congress, and State Legislatures.

2. Secured the publication of numerous articles in many of the leading daily and weekly papers, and in hundreds of local papers throughout the land.

3. Published and circulated over 6,000,000 pages of leaflets and other documents.

4. Defended those who have been prosecuted for non-compliance with religious enactments, and is now (January 1, 1891) carrying a case to the Supreme Court of the United States, to test the constitutionality of Sunday laws.

5. Presented petitions to Congress against religious legislation, to the number of 300,000 bona fide signatures of adult residents of the United States.

6. And has had the satisfaction of preventing the passage of religious laws, both by Congress and by several State Legislatures.
