## Origin and Work of the National Religious Liberty Association.

The introduction of petitions for religious legislation in Congress and in various State Legislatures, within the last few years, is the cause which led to the organization of the National Religious Liberty Association. Obtaining them, securing the attention of these measures, and seeing to them a response to the inherent rights of conscience as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, decided to make a note of warning, and present to the people an impartial nature of religious legislation, and, at the same time, to disseminate a knowledge of the true principles of religious liberty, and the relation that the civil Government sustains to it.

The first organized form which it assumed, was in the appointment of a National committee, whose chief purpose of securing the publication of articles on the subject of religious liberty in the public press. This was in March, 1886. The efforts of the Committee thus put forth were so well received by the public at large, and of such valuable assistance to the cause of religious liberty, it was seen that a more thorough organization, with well established headquarters, would be desirable. Accordingly, July 31, 1889, the National Religious Liberty Association was organized, a Declaration of principles set forth, and a Constitution and Articles adopted. Since Jan. 1890, it has published a paper.

Since its organization it has—

1. Sent its representative to the committees of Congress, and State Legislatures.

2. Secured the publication of numerous articles in many of the leading daily and weekly papers throughout the country.

3. Published and circulated over 500,000 pages of leaflets and other documents.

4. Defended those in trouble for honest religious conviction, having served as counsel for non-compliance with religious enactments, and is now (January, 1891) carrying a case to the Supreme Court of the United States, to test the constitutionality of Sunday laws.

5. Presented petitions to Congress against religious legislation from all States, of about 100,000 and about 466 signatures of adult residents of the United States.

6. And has had the satisfaction of preventing the passage of religious legislation, recommended by Congress and by several State Legislatures.
