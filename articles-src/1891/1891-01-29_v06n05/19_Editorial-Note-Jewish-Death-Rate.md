THE claim so confidently made by the advocates of the so-called "civil Sabbath" that a failure to regularly observe a stated weekly rest shortens human life, is strongly discredited by facts recently published by Dr. Billings, of the United States Army, who conducted an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining certain characteristics of the vital statistics of the Jewish population of the United States. "This material," says the Press, of this city, "was gathered by Mr. A. S. Solomons for the Census Office, and shows the social condition of nearly eleven thousand Jewish families in the United States, representing in all something over sixty thousand persons. The general result of this inquiry shows that the Jewish race in the United States has the advantage over the average population, of a lower death rate." This is significant in view of the fact that a vast majority of the Jews really observe no regular weekly rest. Their greed of gain prevents them from keeping the ancient Sabbath, and they have no regard for Sunday, and so devote the day either to business or to pleasure, as opportunity offers.
