It is stated that "the Imperial Tribunal of Leipsic has decided that henceforth a refusal to rise and participate in a toast to the health of the Kaiser shall constitute high treason." This is about on a par with some of the measures proposed in this country. It really seems that the sun of liberty has passed the zenith and is gradually sinking toward its setting.
