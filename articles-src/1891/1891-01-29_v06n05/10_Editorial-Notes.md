## Editorial Notes.

SENATOR W. H. BLAIR has been defeated for re-election to the United States Senate.

---

THE provisions of the Brazilian Constitution, which forbids the several States of that republic to "aid or hinder the exercise of any religious worship," is certainly an improvement upon our own Constitution.

---

MR. CRAFTS says that the Jew is left abundantly free to observe the seventh day, but insists that a Sunday law is necessary to guarantee to the Christians perfectly free to keep Sunday. Will he kindly explain how that can be?

---

ACCORDING to statistics prepared by Dr. H. K. Carroll, of the *Independent,* in the leading Pedobaptist Denominations, sub-divided into seventy-six divisions, number a total of 8,067,873, including children.

The number of Roman Catholics is put at about the same figure.

THE case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, who was arrested and fined for plowing on Sunday, has been heard before a Federal Court. The case was first appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, which confirmed the judgment of the lower court. It was then brought before Judge Hammond, of the Federal Court, on a writ of *habeas corpus.* Judge Hammond holds that he has no jurisdiction to pass on a decision of the State courts.

THE assertion so confidently made by the advocates of the so-called "civil Sabbath" that a failure to regularly observe a stated weekly rest shortens human life, is strongly discredited by facts recently published by Dr. Billings, of the United States Army, who conducted an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining certain characteristics of the vital statistics of the Jewish population of the United States. "This material," says the *Press* of this city, "was gathered by Mr. A. S. Solomons of the Census Office, and covered the social condition of nearly eleven thousand Jewish families in the United States, representing in all something over sixty thousand persons. The general result of this inquiry shows that the death rate in the United States has the advantage over the average population, of a lower death rate." This is significant in view of the fact that a vast majority of the Jews really observe no regular weekly rest. Their greed of gain prevents them from keeping the ancient Sabbath, and they have no regard for Sunday, and so devote the day either to business or to pleasure, as opportunity offers.

WE have received another letter from Rev. H. O. Hoffman, of Bloomington, Illinois, which will appear soon. Mr. Hoffman takes issue with us upon the question of moral instruction in the public schools. Those interested in the matter would do well to preserve his former letter and our answer to it, which appeared in No. 3, of the current volume.

THE *Independent,* in the issue of the twenty-second, publishes twenty-eight editorial and ministerial replies to the letter sent out by that paper asking opinions relative to the Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition. Of those replies which are from members of the Cabinet, members of Congress, and Governors of States, thirteen are in favor of opening the Exposition during, at least, a portion of Sunday; the same number are in favor of closing at that day, while two are non-committal.

MAJOR RAGGS, a Georgia lawyer, has discovered that the preachers of that State are required by "law to read from their pulpits, four times a year, an act regarding the observance of Sunday. That act was framed by the Colonial Assembly in 1762, section 10 reading as follows." And he it further enacted, that this act shall be read yearly, and every year, and at least four times in each year the said sermons begun; and every minister is thereby required to read the same in the respective place of divine worship." The act provides penalties for its violation, pecuniary, imprisonment, and for not "keeping holy the Lord's day commonly called Sunday." Mr. Crafts should make a note of this as another proof of the purely civil (!) character of Sunday laws.

THE *Mail and Express,* the New York daily of National Reform tendencies, complains that a Protestant is imprisoned in Callao, Peru, for a purely religious offense, and that he was not arrested at the instance of the civil authorities, nor with any belief on their part that he was a dangerous man, against whom society needed to be guarded, but that he was apprehended for purely religious reasons. "It is," says our contemporary, "simply a case of religious persecution and intolerance, and the whole responsibility for this outrageous violation of personal liberty rests with the bishops and priests of the Roman Catholic Church, who are straining every nerve to prolong his imprisonment." We have not a doubt of the correctness of this statement, and think the conclusion and the measure just, but why is it that the *Mail and Express* was so indignant over such wrongs in Peru, but says never a word when a similar outrage is perpetrated in our own country? Is the *Mail and Express* in favor of religious liberty only for its friends?

IT is stated that "the Pope has appointed a commission to study the religious situation of the South American republics, with the view of reorganizing the episcopacies on a system similar to that prevailing in Brazil, which is based on common law and religious liberty, and that the Pope is of the opinion that the Church has everything to gain by claiming simply a reign of liberty for all." If it is also true in Peru to liberate the man whom he has been restrained of his liberty, and kept in a dungeon for merely what is really but serious allegations brought against him by the Roman Catholic authorities, for no other offense than preaching the gospel in a private house and administering other Christian rites according to his convictions of truth, the world might believe him sincere; but the probability is, that the Pope is actuated by motives that the crafty Leo has not yet come to that conclusion.

"RELIGION Enforced by State Laws," and "Shall California Have a Sunday Law?" — are the titles of two tracts, copies of which we have received, and which, being scattered in California, will do much good in that State. They are just the thing to create a wholesome sentiment against enactment of a Sunday law in California.

---

THE *Christian Statesman* predicts that "the Nation will go on developing its Christian temper and institutions, and bringing her laws every where into closer conformity with the Christian conception of government, and even in the National Constitution shall find expression."

---

FRIENDS of religious freedom in Texas are making an earnest effort to secure the repeal of the Sunday law of that State. It is to be hoped that they will be successful. Sunday statutes are contrary to and indigenous to the free soil of the Star State, and ought to be easily killed.
