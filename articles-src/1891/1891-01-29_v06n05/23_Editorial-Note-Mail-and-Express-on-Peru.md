THE Mail and Express, the New York daily of National Reform tendencies, complains that a Protestant is imprisoned in Callao, Peru, for a purely religious offense, and that he was not arrested at the instance of the civil authorities, nor with any belief on their part that he was a dangerous man, against whom society needed to be guarded, but that he was apprehended on complaint of the priests. "It is," says our contemporary, "simply a case of religious persecution and intolerance, and the whole responsibility for this outrageous violation of personal liberty rests with the bishops and priests of the Roman Catholic Church, who are straining every nerve to prolong his imprisonment." We have not a doubt of the correctness of this statement, and think the conclusion and the censure just; but why is it that the Mail and Express waxes indignant over such wrongs in Peru, and says never a word when a similar outrage is perpetrated in our own country? Is the Mail and Express in favor of religious liberty only for its friends?
