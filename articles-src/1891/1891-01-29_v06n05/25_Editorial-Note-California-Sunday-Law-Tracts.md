"RELIGION Enforced by State Laws," and "Shall California Have a Sunday Law?" are the titles of two tracts, copies of which we have received, which are being scattered in California. They should have a wide circulation, as they are just the thing to create a wholesome sentiment against religious legislation. The first contains four pages, and sells for twenty-five cents per hundred; the second has eight pages, and sells for fifty cents per hundred. Those desiring a supply should order them of A. L. Ingels, 1059 Castro Street, Oakland, Cal.
