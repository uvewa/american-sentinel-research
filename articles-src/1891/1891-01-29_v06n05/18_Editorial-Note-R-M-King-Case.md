THE case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, who was arrested and fined for plowing on Sunday, has been heard before a Federal Court. The case was first appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, which confirmed the judgment of the lower court. It was then brought before Judge Hammond, of the Federal Court, on a writ of habeas corpus. Judge Hammond holds that he has no jurisdiction to pass on a decision of the State courts.
