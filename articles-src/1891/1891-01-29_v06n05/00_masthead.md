Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political.—Thomas Jefferson.

In our individual character we all entertain opinions, and pursue a corresponding practice, upon the subject of religion. However diversified these may be, we all harmonize as citizens while each is willing that the other shall enjoy the same liberty which he claims for himself.—Col. Richard M. Johnson.
