## The Baptists and Religious Liberty.

EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL:

*Dear Sir:* In your issue of December 18, 1890, you published a very good article from a Baptist paper, in reference to religious instruction in the public schools. I have always admired the sound principles of the Baptist Church; and that the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, may receive further instructions from the Baptists in reference to religious liberty, I send for publication the following selection, copied from works written by Baptist ministers, and published for years by the Baptist Publishing House, No. 1420 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.

The struggle for religious liberty was already begun before the Pilgrims of the *Mayflower* landed at a Jewish resort of olives and vines, and decided, "whatsoever it is; it is right to obey God; . . . neither owe you more than unto God, judge ye; for we ourselves also are compelled to appeal unto Caesar."

Many of these quotations are very old, and yet they have been verified by the editors.

In 1611, nine years before the landing of the Pilgrims, there appeared in London the first English publication of the present English version of the Bible, and the publication of articles on faith and order by a Baptist minister disclaiming religious liberty. In 1614 there appeared in London the English Bible Baptists redeeming the doctrine of religious liberty which had been taught by their brethren in Holland, but was not, as has been often erroneously asserted, in England *400* years before, asserted by a Baptist in England. Neither civil magistrate or matters of conscience, nor compel men to this or from of religion, because Christ is the King and Lawgiver of the Church and conscience.

In 1620, 100,000 Minutes Baptists, a *Baptist* magazine, is in the East as well as the West, born in its turn baptized others—somewhat irregular, it is true. But it is a fact.—*Weekly Examiner,* 1886. The first Baptist Church in America.

Roger Williams, in 1631, went to England calling out from the town, and became banished from Boston. In March, 1644, he obtained the charter for the Colony of Rhode Island, incorporating in it a declaration of religious liberty, in September, 1644, under that charter was established in Providence the first civil government in America based on the principles of religious liberty.

Baptist ministers, as in it Anconany times were arrested and imprisoned as repeatedly, were posted down from the senate, banished and whipped, and many were imprisoned for preaching God's Word to the people.

Will this condition find some parallel comparison at the present time? Listen to the following: "I simply ask my friends of their plea or say or write what they say, in condemnation of religious persecution in former times, and apply the same principle to the present, as a Baptist minister, in Virginia, to a Prison, and R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, in a Henry City."

"The sword of the Baptists is laying at the side of religious freedom. The Baptists are the real *Israelites.* The *Fruits and Forests* stand for religious liberty."—*The Baptists* by *Thos. Curtis,* vol. 2, p. 371, London edition.—*American Sentinel,* 1890, pp. 12, 17. *"Spirit of the Pilgrims,"* pp. 358, 359.

The first organized form which embodied the principles of religious liberty, the principles of Baptists, many claim was presented by them. We refer to the Constitution of the Colony of Rhode Island. Dr. James Knowles states, "Baltimore has often been claimed to have been the earliest exponent of this idea of religious liberty in America; but an examination of facts shows that this, witnessed their suffering, was one of all or of the instances occupied by time, and that in their colony the same kind of spirit prevailed which found expression in Virginia and Massachusetts, and causes the cross of conscience, and brought the Quaker to the whipping-post, and Thomas Jefferson was also among those compelled into exile. Among those who were active in the early agitation against persecution in the Constitution of Virginia Baptist, special mention should be made of the minister of the first English and American Baptist churches; *note, ministers in prisons and their trials and sufferings,* advocates for religious freedom, and their petitions, and appeals. The "General Committee" of Virginia Baptists, "as a Committee were earnest in the abolition of the established church; to taxation all denominations, and to obtain a bill of rights, and incorporated it; and to have all church property removed forever from the control of the State; they were willing to give their lives for the freedom of all. They proclaimed their old doctrine in bold letters above the entrance to their church at Fredericksburg, *Fruits of the Second Baptist Church,* Fredericksburg."

It is recorded of Eld. M. Frost. Point that when in the days of persecution in Virginia, he was arrested and imprisoned, and when fined 600 to leave the court, rode some sixty miles horseback and visited the trail; that when whipped as a malefactor, he resumed his preaching as soon as he was released; that he was driven into exile, and his family scattered as they were able; and again as his brethren were burned or elsewhere arrested as malefactors to Virginia law. When the Presbyterian ministers came over from Scotland, to Virginia Baptist ministers went over to Virginia. When the Presbyterian and Baptist ministers in New England were also sent to Virginia, Leland, Barton, Fristoe Henry, and other Baptist ministers, were condemned; yet soon afterward Mrs. Dolly Madison wrote to Mr. Jefferson these words about the persecuted Baptists, who had given the people the information to the government, as I learned this honor, for the paper making objection to the religious establishment of Virginia, was the Baptists' paper—"I hope the people's attorney of this Colony has framed an independent declaration upon the broad basis which you approved these conditions and facts, as the improved these conditions and facts, as the Baptists requested the Bill of Rights."

Notwithstanding this persecution of Baptists, this church, for years did not fail, or for a moment abandon its rights for a united state of affairs, but as recorded in their country's history and taught them a national right, more toleration they have as taken away from every citizen.

Among the principles always held by Baptists are the separation of Church and State; that the control over the Lord for the churches of Christ, and our Saviour unto them; the obedience to the laws of the land, "except in the plain command of God; that each Baptist territory "faith cannot be forced," obedience, "to the civil authorities ought to be borne by Christians, and where the duties of a Christian clash, the kingdom of Christ is not civil but spiritual, and its weapons are not carnal but spiritual;" that while supporting the laws to Nation the field, the sword of spiritual law, teaching for centuries the commandments of God, supporting the constitution of the United States.

"Through long centuries of anguish and conflict they contended for the great principles of religious liberty." "They fought not to obtain it for themselves alone, but for all, with a reference to every living soul to observe and preach the gospel, and for every citizen to enjoy civil and religious liberty, without molestation, only to find that's facts denied or forgotten, their historic reputation stolen, their principles rejected to preach, and they only called "Seers."—*Belknap Lib.* Coll. vol. 1, p. 354. *The Fruits and Forests of Religious Liberty.*

Although there may be some of Baptist profession who, forsaking those principles of truth taught by their forefathers, have lost the power of God, and are now swelling the cause of civil government, instead of the sword of the Spirit, to command them to the observance of the papal Sabbath of the popes and the Sabbath, the vast majority of them would repudiate such an idea.

Don't charge that sin to the Baptist people!

ISAAC MORRISON.
