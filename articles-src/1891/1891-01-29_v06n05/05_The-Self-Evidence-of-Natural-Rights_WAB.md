That there is an inherent sense of our natural rights is a fundamental principle of the American political system. The idea is not only asserted in the Declaration of Independence and alluded to in the Constitution, but is repeatedly affirmed in the writings of our early statesmen. It has, in fact, been a prominent doctrine in the development of Anglican liberty from Shaftesbury down to Spencer.

Jefferson, in the Declaration of Independence, said: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." And in a letter to Dr. John Manners, dated at Monticello, June 12, 1817, he again asserted his idea upon this question, saying: "The evidence of this natural right [expatriation], like that of our right to life, liberty, the use of our faculties, the pursuit of happiness, is not left to the feeble and sophistical investigations of reason, but is impressed on the sense of every man. We do not claim these under the charters of kings or legislators, but under the King of kings."

As we come down further in our national history it is just as strongly maintained, and even more emphatically stated. Colonel Johnson, in his Sunday mail report to the House of Representatives in 1830, said:—

The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. Reasoning was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our own bosoms. It is the consciousness which, in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and in flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their consciences. It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate. The bigot in the pride of his authority, may lose sight of it, but, strip him of his power, prescribe a faith to him which his conscience rejects, threaten him in turn with the dungeon and the fuger, and this spirit which God has implanted in him rises up in rebellion and defies you.

The soundness of this doctrine, however, is best seen in the development of the principle in the critical hands of Herbert Spencer. Speaking of this innate sense, he says:—

There exists in man what may be termed an instinct of personal rights—a feeling that leads him to claim as great a share of natural privilege as is claimed by others—a feeling that leads him to repel anything like an encroachment upon what he thinks his sphere of original freedom. By virtue of this impulse, individuals, as units of the social mass, tend to assume like relationships with the atoms of matter, surrounded as these are by their respective atmospheres of repulsion as well as of attraction. And perhaps social stability may ultimately be seen to depend upon the due balance of these forces.

There exists, however, a dominant sect of so-called philosophical politicians, who treat with contempt this belief that men have any claims antecedent to those indorsed by governments. As disciples of Bentham, consistency requires them to do this. Accordingly, although it does violence to their secret perceptions, they boldly deny the existence of "rights" entirely. They nevertheless perpetually betray a belief in the doctrines which they professedly reject. They inadvertently talk about justice, especially when it concerns themselves, in much the same style as their opponents. They draw the same distinction between law and equity that other people do. They applaud fairness and honor, quite as if they thought them something more than mere words. And when robbed, or assaulted, or wrongly imprisoned, they exhibit the same indignation, the same determination to oppose the aggressor, utter the same denunciations of tyranny, and the same loud demands for redress, as the sternest asserters of the rights of man. By way of explaining such inconsistencies, it is indeed alleged, that the feeling thus manifested is nothing but the result of a gradually acquired conviction that benefits flow from some kinds of action, and evils from other kinds; and it is said that the sympathies and antipathies respectively contracted toward these, exhibit themselves as a love of justice, and a hatred of injustice. To which supposition it was by implication elsewhere replied, that it would be equally wise to conclude that hunger springs from a conviction of the benefit of eating; or that love of offspring is the result of a wish to maintain the species!

But it is amusing when, after all, it turns out that the ground on which these philosophers have taken their stand, and from which with such self-complacency they shower their sarcasms, is nothing but an adversary's mine, destined to blow the vast fabric of conclusions they have based on it into nonentity. This so solid-looking principle of "the greatest happiness to the greatest number," needs but to have a light brought near it, and lo! it explodes into the astounding assertion, that all men have equal rights to happiness—an assertion far more sweeping and revolutionary than any of those which are assailed with so much scorn.

When we see, then, that an instinct of personal rights manifests itself unceasingly in opinions and institutions; when further we find that the attempt to trace the munitions of this instinct to experience, betrays us into an absurdity; and when, lastly, the dogma of those who most sturdily deny that there is such an instinct, proves to be only another emanation from it, we find ourselves in possession of the strongest possible evidence—if its existence—the testimony of all parties. We are therefore justified in considering that existence as sufficiently proved.

—Social Statics, chapter 3, sections 2, 3.

In examining the position of the "expediency" party—of those who deny the existence of innate and inalienable rights—Spencer says:—

But that we possess such a sense, may be best proved by evidence drawn from the lips of those who assert that we have it not. Oddly enough Bentham unwittingly derives his initial proposition from an oracle whose existence he denies, and at which he sneers when it is appealed to by others. "One man," he remarks, speaking of Shaftesbury, "says he has a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right and what is wrong; and that is called moral sense; and then he goes to work at his ease, and says such and such a thing is right, and such and such a thing is wrong. Why? Because my moral sense tells me it is." Now that Bentham should have no other authority for his own maxim than this same moral sense, is somewhat unfortunate for him. Yet on putting that maxim into critical hands, we shall soon discover such to be the fact. Let us do this.

"And so you think," says the patrician, "that the object of our rule should be 'the greatest happiness to the greatest number.'"

"Such is our opinion," answers the petitioning plebeian.

"Well, now, let us see what your principle involves. Suppose men to be, as they very commonly are, at variance in their desires on some given point; and suppose that those forming the larger party will receive a certain amount of happiness each, from the adoption of one course, whilst those forming the smaller party will receive the same amount of happiness each, from the adoption of the opposite course; then if 'greatest happiness' is to be our guide, it must follow, must it not, that the larger party ought to have their way?"

"Certainly."

"That is to say, if you, the people, are a hundred, whilst we are ninety-nine, your happiness must be preferred, should our wishes clash, and should the individual amounts of gratification at stake on the two sides be equal."

"Exactly; our axiom involves that."

"So then it seems, that as, in such a case, you decide between the two parties by numerical majority, you assume that the happiness of a member of the one party, is equally important with that of a member of the other."

"Of course."

"Wherefore, if reduced to its simplest form, your doctrine turns out to be the assertion that all men have equal claims to happiness; or, applying it personally, that you have as good a right to happiness as I have."

"No doubt I have."

"And pray, sir, who told you that you have as good a right to happiness as I have?"

"Who told me?—I am sure of it; I know it; I feel it; I—"

"Nay, nay, that will not do. Give me your authority. Tell me who told you this—how you got at it—whence you derived it."

Whereupon, after some shuffling, our petitioner is forced to confess that he has no other authority but his own feeling—that he has simply an innate perception of the fact; or, in other words, that "his moral sense tells him so."

In truth, none but those committed to a preconceived theory, can fail to recognize, on every hand, the workings of such a faculty. From early times downward there have been constant signs of its presence—signs which happily thicken as our own day is approached. The articles of Magus Charta embody its protests against oppression; and its demands for a better administration of justice. Serfdom was abolished partly at its suggestion. It encouraged Wickliffe, Huss, Luther, and Knox, in their contests with popery: and by it were Huguenots, Covenanters, Moravians, stimulated to maintain freedom of judgment in the teeth of armed eoclesiasticism. It dictated Milton's "Essay on the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing." It piloted the Pilgrim Fathers to the New World. It supported the followers of George Fox under fines and imprisonment. And it whispered resistance to the Presbyterian clergy of 1662. In latter days it emitted that tide of feeling which undermined and swept away Catholic disabilities. Through the mouths of anti-slavery orators, it poured out its fire, to the scorching of the selfish, to the melting of the good, to our national purification. It was its heat, too, which warmed our sympathy for the Poles, and made boil our indignation against their oppressor. Pent-up accumulations of it, let loose upon a long-standing injustice, generated the effervescence of a reform agitation.

By the passage of its subtle current is that social electrolysis effected, which classes men into parties, which separates the nation into its positive and negative, its radical and conservative elements. At present it puts on the garb of anti-State-Church associations, and shows its presence in manifold societies for the extension of popular power. It builds monuments to political martyrs, agitates for the admission of Jews into Parliament, publishes books on the rights of women, petitions against class legislation, threatens to rebel against militia conscriptions, refuses to pay Church-rates, repeals oppressive debtor acts, laments over the distresses of Italy, and thrills with sympathy for the Hungarians.—Social Statics, introduction, pages 33–36.

It was the recognition of this sense of natural and inalienable rights—the just claim that every man has under the law of nature,—that made the founders of our Government so careful to throw around these rights every protection that government can afford. The Constitution expressly states that it is formed to "establish justice," and justice is only conformity to natural law—the recognition of rights—and these rights are what are, as Jefferson says, "impressed on the sense of every man. We do not claim these under the charters of kings or legislators, but under the King of kings." Any other theory is un-American; and not only un-American, but contrary to reason and to the feelings which every living man has felt in his own breast.
