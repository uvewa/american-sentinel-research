MAJOR BACON, a Georgia lawyer, has discovered that the preachers of that State are required by law to read from their pulpits, four times a year, an act regarding the observance of Sunday. The statute was framed by the Colonial Assembly in 1763, section 10 reading as follows: "And be it further enacted, that this act shall be read yearly, and every year, and at least four times in each year before sermon begins; and every minister is hereby required to read the same in his respective place of divine worship." The act provides penalties for vice, profanity, immorality, and for not "keeping holy the Lord's day commonly called Sunday." Mr. Crafts should make a note of this as another proof of the purely civil (?) character of Sunday laws.
