## 05_Religious-Persecution-in-Peru.md

### Page 4, Column 1, Paragraph 3
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "The order has now arrived that the late Peruvian President a day or two before the expiration of his terms of office"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "order" is my best reading but the phrase structure is awkward; the sentence seems to be saying an order has arrived/been revealed that the late president (just before leaving office) directed the arrest, at the instigation of the Roman Catholic priesthood
- **Reason:** "order" fits context better than "editor" which was my first reading

### Page 4, Column 1, Final paragraph (Mons. St. Foix quotation)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Mons. St. Foix"
- **Confidence:** LOW — the name is difficult to read; could be "Mons. St. Foix" or "Mons. St. Fois" or another rendering
- **Reason:** The name appears in a quotation about the dying words of a French figure addressing Georges Ticknor; historical context suggests this may be a known figure but the name is hard to confirm from the scan

### Page 4, Column 1, Last line before attribution
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "shall it ignore and neglect on South American soil its Republic?"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "soil its" is my best reading of what initially appeared as "sides"; the sentence asks whether American liberty, active in Europe, should neglect the republic on South American soil
- **Reason:** Context and letter shapes support this reading

## 06_The-Right-Ring.md

### Page 4–5, Paragraph transition
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "The Mayor may have erred in judgment in not signing the ordinances, in which we think he did, but that he is right on the matter of Sunday closing is not a shadow of doubt."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the page break makes the transition difficult; the grammatical structure is unusual but appears to mean "He may have erred (and we think he did), but his rightness on Sunday closing is not in doubt"
- **Reason:** Cross-page reading; the break falls in mid-sentence

### Page 5, Column 1, Mark reference
- **Transcribed as:** "Mark 16: 15, 16"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — could also be "Mark 15: 15, 16" but Mark 16:15-16 is the Great Commission text that matches the quotation
- **Reason:** Mark 16:15-16 contains "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature" which is exactly what is quoted

## 07_The-Proposed-Blair-Amendment-Unscriptural.md

### Page 4–5, Fourth paragraph of quotation ("Clearly, what is the same thing...")
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "My chief Lord and our Nation be sworn to"
- **Confidence:** LOW — this passage is very difficult to read; the text in this paragraph is dense and the scan quality makes several phrases unclear. The entire paragraph about "the intermingling of one with the affairs of the other" contains multiple uncertain readings
- **Reason:** Small font, dense text, and possibly archaic phrasing combine to make this paragraph very difficult

### Page 5, Same paragraph
- **Transcribed as:** "Let each individual, therefore, as counseled forward by our divine Saviour, towards the Church as his inspires duty towards each requires. The impulse of civil government should not interfere..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — this sentence does not read grammatically; the original likely says something different but the individual words are very difficult to distinguish
- **Reason:** Dense text, small font, scan quality

### Page 5, Same paragraph ending
- **Transcribed as:** "that the Pope is actuated by motives that the crafty Leo has not yet come to that conclusion"
- **Confidence:** LOW — uncertain reading in closing of article
- **Reason:** Text at edge of column is difficult to read

## 08_The-Baptists-and-Religious-Liberty.md

### General note
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM throughout — this article by Isaac Morrison is extremely dense, in very small font, and contains numerous historical references, dates, quotations, and citations. The scan quality makes many individual words and phrases very difficult to read. Multiple passages are uncertain.
- The article contains references to Baptist publications, historical events (Roger Williams, Rhode Island charter, persecution in Virginia, etc.) that help confirm some readings through context, but many specific phrases remain uncertain.

### Page 5, Column 2, Early paragraphs
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "a Jewish resort of olives and vines"
- **Confidence:** LOW — this phrase seems out of place in context; likely a misreading
- **Reason:** Small text, possible scan artifact

### Page 5, Column 2
- **Transcribed as:** "In 1611, nine years before the landing of the Pilgrims, there appeared in London the first English publication of the present English version of the Bible, and the publication of articles on faith and order by a Baptist minister disclaiming religious liberty."
- **Confidence:** LOW — the phrasing is awkward; "disclaiming" may be wrong (perhaps "proclaiming" or "reclaiming")
- **Reason:** The historical context suggests Baptists were *advocating* for religious liberty, not disclaiming it

### Page 5, Column 3 / Page 6, Column 1
- Multiple passages about Baptist history, persecution in Virginia, Dolly Madison's letter to Jefferson, etc. contain numerous uncertain readings
- **Confidence:** LOW for many specific phrases
- **Reason:** Very small, dense text with historical references that are hard to verify from the scan alone

### Page 6, Column 1-2, Multiple passages
- **Transcribed as:** various passages about Baptist principles and history
- **Confidence:** LOW — many specific quotations and citations within this letter are uncertain
- **Reason:** The letter quotes extensively from Baptist historical sources in very small print

## 09_Origin-and-Work-of-the-National-Religious-Liberty-Association.md

### Page 6, Column 3, First paragraph
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Obtaining them, securing the attention of these measures, and seeing to them a response to the inherent rights of conscience as guaranteed by the Constitution"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the sentence structure is somewhat awkward; "response to the inherent rights" may not be the exact wording
- **Reason:** Dense text in small font

### Page 6, Column 3, Point 5
- **Transcribed as:** "about 100,000 and about 466 signatures of adult residents"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "100,000 and about 466" seems like an odd number combination; possibly "100,000 adult signatures" or "100,466 signatures"
- **Reason:** The numbers are difficult to read clearly

## 10_Editorial-Notes.md

### Page 8, Column 1, Crafts note
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "abundantly free"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — initial reading was "almostfully" which is not a word; "abundantly" fits context and letter shapes
- **Reason:** Word partially obscured

### Page 8, Column 2, Major Raggs note
- **Transcribed as:** "MAJOR RAGGS"
- **Confidence:** LOW — the name is difficult to read; could be "BACON" or another surname
- **Reason:** Small text, unclear letters

### Page 8, Column 2, Colonial statute quotation
- **Transcribed as:** "The act provides penalties for its violation, pecuniary, imprisonment"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "its violation" is my interpretation; the original text may read differently (possibly "for this—pecuniary" or "for it, pecuniary")
- **Reason:** Small text, archaic legal language

### Page 8, Column 3, Pope/Peru note
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "If it is also true in Peru to liberate the man whom he has been restrained of his liberty, and kept in a dungeon for merely what is really but serious allegations..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — this entire passage is very difficult to read and the sentence structure as transcribed is awkward
- **Reason:** Dense text, small font, complex argumentation

### Page 8, Column 3, California tracts note
- **Transcribed as:** "RELIGION Enforced by State Laws"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — initial reading was "REMOVE"; "RELIGION" makes more sense as a tract title about Sunday laws
- **Reason:** First word of title partially unclear
