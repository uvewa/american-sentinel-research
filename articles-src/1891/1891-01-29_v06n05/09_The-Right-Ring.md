The Los Angeles Churchman, a monthly periodical, devoted to the interests of the Episcopal Church in Southern California, is doing some good work in opposition to so-called National Reform and American Sabbath Unionism. The following, from the December number, will bear repeating:—

"For sterling honesty and common business sense, with a clear conception of the proper functions of civil government, we commend the late message of Mayor Hazard to the Council on the Sunday-closing ordinance. It has the right ring.

"The Mayor may have erred in judgment in not signing the ordinance at once, we think he did, but that he is right on the matter of Sunday closing we have not a shadow of doubt.

"We want to see the saloons closed every day; we want them utterly abolished from the land, but not to go to the root of the matter, to have them closed merely on Sunday under penalty of fine and imprisonment to satisfy the clamor of religionists, is a piece of Puritan fanaticism which is plainly branded with the mark of the boast of religious tyranny, the worst of all tyrants, and the deadly foe of free and enlightened civilization.

"The saloons are not only the flag of distress of a people possessed of the devil, they are also the sign of the Church's sin of covetousness, and consequent divine impotency. The saloons in any city would all be closed within a year if the Christians within it would do their duty to their brother men as Christians. Bad as the saloons are they are not so bad as modern Christianity trying to hide its shame and sin under the cloak of Sunday laws.

"We want the Nazarene in the modern temple to cry: 'Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!'"
