THE Independent, in its issue of the twenty-second, publishes twenty-eight additional replies to the letter sent out by that paper asking opinions relative to the Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition. Of these replies which are from members of the Cabinet, members of Congress, and Governors of States, thirteen are in favor of opening the Exposition during, at least, a portion of Sunday; the same number are in favor of closing it on that day, while two are non-committal.
