"We are reminded," says a California paper, "of a time-honored custom by reading that each branch of our Legislature has appointed a chaplain, and that the chaplains have prayed that the deliberations of their respective bodies shall be directed by the Lord. Two years ago the same prayer was sent up, but did not seem to be in the least effective. One, Christopher Buckley, had more to do with directing legislation than any body else, and there is no doubt as to his identity. If better results do not follow this year, they had better try something else."

Prayer would undoubtedly be a good thing for members of the Legislature, as well as for everybody else, if each one would only pray for himself secretly that the Lord might help him to be an honest man, and then co-operate with the Lord in the answer to his own prayers by being honest. But we fear that the perfunctory prayers of the average chaplain never rise higher than the mouth of the one who is paid for uttering them. As Shakespeare says:—

"Their words fly up, their thoughts remain below: Words without thoughts never to Heaven can go."
