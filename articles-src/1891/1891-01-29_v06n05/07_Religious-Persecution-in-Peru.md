The recent case of religious persecution in Peru is of considerable importance to the United States. It seems that the Rev. Francis Penzotti was arrested and confined in prison in Callao, on the 25th of July last, and has been detained in prison with common criminals up to the present time.

The only charge against him was that of violating the laws of the land by the sale of the Holy Scriptures and by holding public worship. The manner of Mr. Penzotti's arrest and his subsequent treatment show that the case is one of religious persecution pure and simple.

The order for his arrest was issued by the late Peruvian President a day or two before the expiration of his term of office, and it was clearly at the instigation of the Roman Catholic priesthood.

It is a source of great gratification to us to know that the United States Government at once made an earnest effort to secure an immediate trial of the case, and a vindication of this noble missionary's innocence.

During the time of his imprisonment a consignment of books, sent to Mr. Penzotti by the American Bible Society, of this city, was detained in the Custom House in Peru, and would have been confiscated but for the prompt action of the representatives of our Government.

It now appears that while Mr. Penzotti has been tried and acquitted by the court at Callao, he is still detained in prison on account of some peculiar rules of practice in the Peruvian courts.

Mr. Hicks, United States Minister at Lima, has appealed to our State Department for its co-operation in effecting the immediate release of this much abused man.

Our Government cannot refuse to take cognizance of this case. Our relations with Peru have become more intimate of late, and we cannot afford to sacrifice our principles by even an apparent indorsement of such practices as savor of the horrors of the Dark Ages.

In 1865 we refused to recognize in Mexico other than republican institutions. Daniel Webster voiced the American protest against the wrongs which Greece suffered at the hands of the Turks, and Lewis Cass gave utterance to the distinctive principles of our Government when he denounced one of the South American States for refusing sepulture to American citizens, from some superstitious idea that their country was consecrated ground, and forcing the carrying out and lowering into the ocean of our dead. In the name of America Mr. Cass demanded that such practices should stop.

The day has passed when such cruel persecutions are to be permitted.

The opinion of the enlightened nations of the earth is against such practices, and the dark spirit that animates these bigots should be hurled to the bottomless pit of universal execration.

As the vanguard of the free nations of the earth, the United States should always take the initiative and demand the observance of religious toleration in all nations with whom she has intimate and friendly relations. Such action on the part of all free nations would effectually crush this demon of religious persecution.

Mme. de Stael, with faltering voice, addressing George Ticknor, who held the hands of the dying woman, said: "America is the vanguard of the nations; the future of the world is yours."

While the spirit of American liberty is abroad in Europe, shall it ignore and neglect our South American sister Republics?
