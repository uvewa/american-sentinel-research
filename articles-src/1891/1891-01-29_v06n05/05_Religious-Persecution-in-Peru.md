## Religious Persecution in Peru.

The recent case of religious persecution in Peru is of considerable importance to the United States. It means that the Rev. Francis Penzotti was arrested and confined in prison at Callao, on the 25th of July last, and has been detained in prison with common criminals up to the present time.

The only charge against him was that of violating the laws of the land by the sale of the Holy Scriptures and by holding public worship. The manner of Mr. Penzotti's arrest and his subsequent treatment show that the case is one of religious persecution pure and simple.

The order has now arrived that the late Peruvian President a day or two before the expiration of his terms of office, and this is clearly at the instigation of the Roman Catholic priesthood.

It is a matter of great gratification to us to know that the United States Government at once made an earnest effort to secure an immediate trial of the case, and a vindication of this noble missionary's innocence.

During the time of his imprisonment a consignment of books, sent to Mr. Penzotti by the American Bible Society, of this city, was detained in the customs in Callao, in Peru, and would have been confiscated but for the prompt action of the consul of our Government.

It now appears that while Mr. Penzotti has been tried and acquitted by the court at Callao, he is still detained in prison on account of some peculiar rules of practice in the Peruvian courts.

Mr. Buck, United States Minister at Lima, has appealed to our State Department for its co-operation in effecting the immediate release of this imprisoned man.

Our Government cannot refuse to take cognizance of this case. Our relations with Peru have become more intimate of late, and we cannot afford to sacrifice our principles to any powers or supposed benefits of such practices as savor of the horrors of the Dark Ages.

In 1868 we refused to recognize in Mexico other than republican institutions. Daniel Webster voiced the American protest against the wrongs which Greece suffered at the hands of the Turks; and Lewis Cass gave utterance to the distinctive principles of our Government when he denounced the conduct of the Austrian authorities in their refusing passports to American citizens, from some superstitious idea that their country was consecrated ground, and forcing the carrying out and casting into the ocean of our dead. In the name of America Mr. Cass demanded that this practice should stop.

The day has passed when even small persecutions are to be permitted.

The opinion of the enlightened nations of the earth is against such practices, and the dark spirit that animates these bigots should be buried in the bottomless pit of universal execration.

As the vanguard of the free nations of the earth, the United States should always take the initiative and demand the observance of religious toleration in all nations with whom she has intimate and friendly relations. Bold action on the part of all free nations would effectually crush this demon of religious persecution.

Mons. St. Foix, with faltering voice, addressing Georges Ticknor, who held the last hand in his dying weakness, said: "America is the vanguard of the nations; the future of the world is yours."

While the spirit of American liberty is almost in Europe, shall it ignore and neglect on South American soil its Republic?
