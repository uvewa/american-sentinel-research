It is stated that "the Pope has appointed a commission to study the religious situation of the South American republics, with the view of re-organizing the episcopates on a system similar to that prevailing in Brazil, which is based on common law and religious liberty; and that the Pope is of the opinion that the Church has everything to gain by claiming simply a reign of liberty for all." If the Pope would instruct his minions in Peru to liberate the man in Callao who has been restrained of his liberty, and kept in a dungeon for nearly six months, on allegations brought against him by the Roman Catholic authorities, for no other offense than preaching the gospel in a private house and administering Christian rites according to his conviction of truth, the world might believe him sincere; but the history of the Papacy is such as to justify suspicions that the crafty Leo has an ax to grind.
