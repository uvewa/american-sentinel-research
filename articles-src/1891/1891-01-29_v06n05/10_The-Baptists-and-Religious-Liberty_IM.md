EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL—

Dear Sir: In your issue of December 18, 1890, you quoted some "sound opinions" from a Baptist paper, in reference to religious instruction in the public schools. I have always admired the sound principles of the Baptist Church; and that the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL may receive further instruction from the Baptists in reference to religious liberty, I send for publication the following selections, copied from works written by Baptist ministers, and published for years by the Baptist Publishing House, No. 1420 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia:—

The struggle for religious liberty was already begun when the Apostles Peter and John stood before the Jewish council of elders and rulers, and declared, "whether it be right, in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard."—Early Struggles for Religious Liberty.

In 1611, nine years before the landing of the Pilgrims, two significant events occurred in England—the publication of the present English version of the Bible, and the publication of articles of faith by English Baptists reiterating the doctrine of religious liberty which had been taught by their brethren at the beginning of the Reformation, eighty years before, and reasserted in England fifty-one years before, saying that "the magistrate is not to meddle with religion or matters of conscience, nor compel men to this or that form of religion, because Christ is the King and Lawgiver of the Church and conscience.

In March, 1639, Williams became a Baptist, and was baptized by one of his own members; and then he in turn baptized others,—somewhat irregular, it is true, but from necessity. Thus was organized the first Baptist Church in America. . . . Roger Williams, in 1645, went to England, taking ship from New York, because banished from Boston. In March, 1644, he obtained the charter for the Colony of Rhode Island, with power for the Colony to make its own laws; and in September, 1644, under that charter was established the first government on earth that granted full religious liberty.

Some Baptist ministers, as in Accomac County, were arrested and imprisoned as vagrants; some were pulled down from the stands, insulted and whipped, and many were imprisoned for preaching the gospel not according to the established church. . . . While thus confined they preached through the grated windows of their prisons to crowds who gathered around. The father of Henry Clay was thus imprisoned, as a Baptist minister, in Virginia, as I was informed by Rev. Porter Clay, a brother of Henry Clay.

They even accused the Baptists of trying to break up the Union, when they merely asked for religious liberty.—The Trials and Victories of Religious Liberty in America. By Rev. G. S. Bailey, D.D., 1776.—A Crutewield Memorial, 1876, pp. 12, 22, 23, 40.

Gradually, by the persecutions, the preaching, and the principles of Baptists, many others were convinced and enlisted. James Madison lived among them, witnessed their sufferings, was one of the advocates engaged by them, and throughout was employed to prepare memorials, advocate bills and other measures, and sustain the cause of conscience, and he did it well and from the heart. Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson were also among those engaged in this cause of religious liberty. The General Association of Virginia Baptists appointed commissioners to attend the sessions of the State Legislature and conventions. They employed counsel, engaged attorneys, sent supplies to prisoners and their families, and gave no rest from their memorials, remonstrances, petitions, and appeals. The "General Committee" was busy year after year in the work. They demanded the abolition of the established church; no taxation whatever for religion; no privileges; no compulsion for any, but free, full, and permanent liberty of conscience for all. They proclaimed their old doctrine of centuries.—Religious Liberty and the Baptists. By Rev. C. C. Bitting, Pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Richmond, Va., pp. 48, 49.

It is recorded by Dr. John M. Peck, that about the year 1770, when three Baptist ministers were to be tried at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Patrick Henry, the great orator, rode some sixty miles to attend the trial, and unexpectedly entered the court-room as the indictment was being read. He listened as they were accused "of preaching the gospel of the Son of God," contrary to Virginia law. When the indictment had been read, and the prosecuting attorney opened the case, Patrick Henry, having glanced over the indictment, arose and addressed the Court:—

"May it please your worships: I think I heard read by the prosecutor, as I entered this house, the paper I hold in my hand. If I have rightly understood, the king's attorney of this Colony has framed an indictment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by imprisonment three inoffensive men, before the bar of this court, for a crime of great magnitude, as disturbers of the peace. May it please the Court, what did I hear read? Did I hear it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own? Did I hear an expression as if a crime, that these men are charged with? What! For preaching the gospel of the Son of God'?" Swinging the indictment three times around his head, he exclaimed: "Great God! May it please your worships, in a day like this, when Truth is about to burst its fetters, when mankind are about to be aroused to claim their natural and inalienable rights; when the yoke of oppression that has reached the wilderness of America, and the unnatural alliance of ecclesiastical and civil power are about to be dissolved; at such a period, when liberty—liberty of conscience—is about to awake from her slumberings and inquire into the reason of such charges as I find exhibited here to-day in this indictment! . . . Our fathers left the land of their nativity for settlement in these American wilds, for liberty,—for civil and religious liberty,—for liberty of conscience,—to worship their Creator according to their conceptions of Heaven's revealed will. . . . They placed their feet on the American continent, and in the deeply imbedded forests sought an asylum from persecution and tyranny. . . . Heaven decreed that men should be free,—free to worship God according to the Bible. Were it not for this, in vain have been the efforts and sacrifices of the colonists, in vain were all their sufferings and bloodshed to subjugate this New World, if we, their offspring, must still be oppressed and persecuted!—The Trials and Victories of Religious Liberty in America, pp. 42, 43.

Many historians, from political or religious bias, ignore or pervert most significant events. White writes the reign of George III., and makes no mention of Wesley or the rise of Methodism. A more prejudicial mistake would be to write the history of Virginia, or of the United States, or of Christianity, without giving prominence to the prolonged and gigantic contest in this State for religious freedom, or the restoration of the Christly principle of spiritual worship."—Struggles and Triumphs of Virginia Baptists. A Memorial Discourse, by J. M. L. Curry, p. 4.

## INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ON RELIGION ITSELF.

But what has been the influence of religious liberty in this country upon religion itself! It has taught and developed the spirituality of the kingdom of Christ. It has unsecularized the Church, and made religion stand upon its own divine truth, and not upon the enactments of human Government,—made it defend its fortresses and win its victories by its appropriate spiritual weapons, and not by the sword of the magistrate. In this respect, religious liberty has done grand service to religion itself, and freed it from a great disgrace and reproach. Religious liberty has thrown man upon his own responsibility to God, and taught him that religion is a personal matter,—that he must attend to its claims, and not rely on forms or rites or ceremonies or conformity to human laws for salvation; but needs to make it a matter of personal, individual, concern. It has thrown religious benevolence upon the hearts of Christians, and taught them to sustain their ministry, build their churches, endow their colleges and theological schools, and send forth its missionaries, by voluntary contributions.—The Trials and Victories of Religious Liberty in America. By Rev. G. S. Bailey, D.D., 1776.—A Centennial Memorial, 1876, pp. 59, 60.

They [Baptists] have stood firmly up for religious freedom when no other people even recognized it. . . . I should state, as among the very chiefest of the achievements of the Baptists, the part they have borne in winning soul liberty. They have been, as a people, scarcely less zealous champions for civil liberty, though in this they have not stood alone, as they long did in respect to religious freedom. Their New Testament principles have made them democratic.—The Baptists: Who They Are, and What They Have Done. A Memorial Series. By Rev. Geo. B. Taylor, D.D., pp. 7, 9, 10.

Religious freedom now generally prevails. All in our land rejoice, and would not have it otherwise. If it can be shown that the Baptists fought the battle and won the boon for all, should not all be willing to award them the meed of praise which is their due!

I submit three propositions:—

I. The Baptists have suffered from the violation of religious freedom by others.

II. The Baptists, and the Baptists alone, of all Christian denominations who have existed for the period under consideration, have never violated religious freedom.

III. The Baptists, in every particular, stand forth pre-eminent as the champions of religious freedom.

Suffering themselves for religion, they never persecuted others. . . . It is hard to prove a negative, but the challenge is confidently made to find a single instance in which the Baptists persecuted others. It cannot be done. Persecuted by others, they have themselves never in the slightest degree violated the great principles of religious freedom. While their own blood has been freely shed for their opinions, their hands are innocent of the blood of others. No martyr blood stains their garments, nor have they ever assumed any position or held any tenet subversive of soul liberty.

In Virginia, in 1784, when the Baptists had well nigh conquered in their struggle for religious freedom, a compromise was proposed in the form of the favour assessment bill. Every one was to be taxed to support religion, but to have the liberty of saying to which denomination his tax was to be applied. The Baptists saw that this was an alliance of Church and State, and that in it lurked the germ of persecution,—that it was, in fact, persecution; and though they had as much to gain by it as any other people, inasmuch as their principles were rapidly spreading, they not only declined for themselves, but earnestly protested against and opposed it; and though part of the time—yea, in the pinch of the conflict—they stood as a denomination almost alone, they succeeded in defeating it.

In Georgia, in 1785, a law for the establishment and support of religion was actually passed, through the influence of the Episcopalians. It embraced all denominations, and gave all equal privileges; but the very same year the Baptists remonstrated against it, sent two messengers to the Legislature, and it was promptly repealed. In both ministers and members they were the most numerous denomination; and their ministers might have lived on the public treasury, and occupied every neighborhood, but they knew that Christ's kingdom is not of this world, and preferred to pine in poverty, as many of them did, rather than consent to the unholy marriage of Church and State.

Their views of the individuality of religion and the spirituality of Christ's kingdom, compel them to be the champions of religious freedom. Just as they would not baptize an unconscious child, so they would not compel an adult to profuse either religion, or any form of it; regarding both as essentially inconsistent with the individualism of religion and the unworldliness of Christ's church. It is impossible for those imbued with and holding Baptist sentiments to be other than in favor of soul freedom.—The Baptists and Religious Liberty. By Rev. Geo. B. Taylor, D.D., pp. 6, 8, 22, 24, 25, 26.

For many centuries governments have impiously arrogated their competency to judge of religious truth, and, "by an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation," have employed religion as an engine of civil policy. Not content with relying on learning and argument, they have used coercion and repression to enforce conformity to the religion of the State.

One of the anomalies of history is that Protestants, coming out of the Roman Catholic Church and protesting against her tyrannies, should so readily have copied and emulated her repressive measures.—Struggles and Triumphs of Virginia Baptists. A Memorial Discourse by J. L. M. Curry, pp. 7, 11.

## THE CONFLICT FOR A BIRTHRIGHT.

"With a great sum obtained I this freedom."—Roman Chief Captain.

"I was born free."—Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ. Acts 22:28.

Religious liberty is not mere permission to enjoy religious opinions, doctrines, and worship; it is the right of conscience responsible only to God, and beyond control or regulation by any human power. Toleration is mere permission, endurance, sufferance, and implies the right to grant or to withhold, to control or to regulate. The one is a demand and an independence; the other is a concession and a subjection. Liberty of conscience for every human being, Baptists have always demanded as a religious and an inalienable right, mere toleration they have as often repudiated as usurpation.

Among the principles always held by Baptists as taught in the Word of God are these: there is but one Lord in the churches of Christ, and one Lawgiver over them; the churches have no human masters, "for one is your master, even Christ, and all ye are brethren;" faith cannot be forced; obedience, to be valid, must be voluntary; a church of Jesus Christ is a community of personal and professed believers; the kingdom of Christ is not civil but spiritual, and not of this world; persuasion, not power, is the means of influencing men to follow the truth, the sword of the spirit not of the State; God alone can authorize ordinances for churches, for, "in vain do they worship him, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men;" and, in all cases of conflict, we ought to obey God rather than men.

Through long centuries of anguish and conflict Baptists have toiled, at every tread detailing martyrs to dungeons or to death, and faltering not until victory dawned. With a welcome to every living soul to share the sweet results of their conflicts, they returned to build their waste places, and to enlarge their borders, only to find their deeds denied or forgotten, their history culminated, their very name a target for reproach, and they only called "bipots."—Religious Liberty and the Baptists. By Rev. C. C. Bitting, Pastor of the Second Baptist Church, Richmond, Va.

Although there may be some of Baptist profession who, forsaking these principles of truth taught by their forefathers, have lost the power of God, and are now calling for the sword of civil government, instead of the sword of the Spirit, to convert men to the observance of the gospel precepts and the Sabbath, the vast majority of them would repudiate such an idea.

Don't charge that sin to the Baptist people!
