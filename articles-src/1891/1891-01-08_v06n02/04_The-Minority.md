FANATIC! the insect hissed, till he taught them to understand.

That the highest crimes may be written in the highest law of the land.

"Disturbct and dreamer!" the Philistines cried, while he preached an ideal creed,

Till they learned that the men who have changed the world, with the world have disagreed;

That the remnant is right, while the masses are led like sheep to the pen,

And the instinct of equity slumbers, until roused by instinctive men!

—John Boyle O'Reilly.
