WILLIAM ALLEN BUTLER say that because Blackstone declares "Chr. unity to be part of the law of the land," therefore it is a part of the law of the United States. The next position for William Allen Butler to take is, that the President of the United States never dies, and can do no wrong. When the Papal Monopoly League has elected its candidate for the Presidency of the United States, Mr. Butler will doubtless be called upon to advocate this theory to the people at large.
