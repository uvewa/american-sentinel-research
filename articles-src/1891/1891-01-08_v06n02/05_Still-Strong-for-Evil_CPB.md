IMMEDIATELY following the Second Annual Session of the American Sabbath Union, held in Philadelphia, December 8 and 9, 1890, we wrote a notice of the said meeting, closing it with these words: "Jealousies and dissensions are weakening it, and unless wiser counsels prevail in the coming year, than appeared in the Philadelphia meeting, their bond of union may prove a rope of sand." Nevertheless, we do not believe, nor would we wish our readers to understand that we expect to see any division in the ranks of the Sunday advocates that will seriously weaken, or even greatly retard their movement. The matter of difference in the Philadelphia meeting was wholly as to methods and management. It was in fact almost a personal matter between Mr. Crafts, the founder of the Union, and Mr. Shepard, its principal financial supporter and its President. Upon the question of the enforcement of Sunday observance by civil law, there was no difference of opinion expressed, and we believe none entertained. The meeting was unanimously in favor, so far as any expression was concerned, of securing and enforcing Sunday laws. True, there might have been, and probably was, some difference of opinion as to the basis of these laws, but that is merely technical. Sunday is a religious institution, and the zeal of these men for its observance, springs wholly from their regard for the day as a religious institution.

The basis of the American Sabbath Union is the fourth commandment, which is wholly religious. It is true that in his work for the Sabbath Union, Mr. Crafts has made a special plea for Sunday laws on what he calls the "civil basis," that is for sanitary and economic reasons, but he has also declared: "Take the religion out and you take the rest out," and refuses persistently to accept any compromise proposed, which will eliminate religious features from Sunday laws. It is evident, therefore, that his plea for the so-called civil Sabbath, is made simply to enlist in behalf of his movement the co-operation of that class known as the "working-men." His wish is to array upon the side of Sunday laws, the men who carry tin pails, and dinner baskets, and to this end he pleads for what he claims would be a law giving the laboring man a weekly rest day.

We are in favor of everything tending to improve the condition of the toiling masses, but we are not in favor of so hedging every man in by civil law, that he would be compelled to rest, whether he desires to do so or not. Nor do we believe that it is necessary to pass laws compelling a weekly rest. The trend of the age is in the direction of shorter hours of labor, and more frequent holidays. The eight-hour movement is gathering force with each passing year, and is only a question of time, when tradesmen and laborers in many departments of industry, will work only eight hours per day, and as a general thing only six days per week. This will be true whether laws are passed declaring that it must be so or not.

But that which we started to say was that instead of being weakened, the Sunday advocates are constantly growing stronger, because their forces are being augmented, and their numbers increased constantly. The work of organization is being carried rapidly forward. It was stated in the Philadelphia meeting, that more has been done within two years in awakening a sentiment in favor of Sunday laws than in the last quarter of a century. The West especially has been thoroughly organized in the interests of the American Sabbath Union. Almost every Western State has its State association, and many county associations have also been formed. Numerous secretaries have been appointed, and these are pushing the work in every quarter. Papers already established have been enlisted in the movement, and new ones have been started for the express purpose of voicing the sentiments of these organizations. This is briefly the condition of things in the West.

In the South, not so much has been accomplished, but this is owing, not to a lack of sentiment favorable to the object of the American Sabbath Union, but rather to prejudice against the President of the Union because of his intense political partisanship. As Mr. Crafts said to a reporter of a Philadelphia paper, "the South hates Colonel Shepard, and abominates his paper." But this does not weaken, in the least, the feeling of the South favorable to rigid Sunday laws.

Indeed the worst Sunday laws to be found in the United States, are upon the statute books of some of the Southern States, notably, Tennessee; and the South may safely be counted upon as being strongly in favor of the object of the American Sabbath Union, namely: the securing of Sunday observance upon the basis of the fourth commandment, and that by civil law so far as is necessary. The friends of religious liberty and of freedom of action and conscience, have nothing whatever to hope for because of the differences which have sprung up between leading men in the American Sabbath Union. It still remains true, even in this, that "vigilance is the price of liberty."
