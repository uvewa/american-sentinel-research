At the annual Sabbath Reform Convention of the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, held in the Eighth Street Reformed Presbyterian Church, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, November 18, Mr. Crafts said:

New England ought to be near the head of the class in Sunday observance, but it is nearer the other end. The Puritanical spirit has left it and is now springing up in the West. The Rocky mountain Sabbath is improving, while the New England Sabbath is retrograding. Through the Sabbath Association we have secured good observance of the law in Boston and other cities. But there they run Sunday trains to carry milk to the babies and newspaper trains to carry scandals to the men. We have reason for encouragement in the enforcement of law in New York, Brooklyn, Baltimore and all the large cities of the country. Pennsylvania observes Sunday the best of any State, and Pittsburg and Philadelphia the best of any cities, but there is room for improvement. Only three States are now without Sunday laws, and they are California, Idaho, and Wyoming. In these States we are making war and will force the issue. We want to enlist the solid men in every community. We advocate no violence, but want to repress the base sort of foreigners who would pervert our American Sabbath.

In reading this statement the question naturally arises, if Sunday laws are so potent for good as Mr. Crafts teaches that they are, how comes it that New England, having on its statute book such laws, is retrograding, not only in Sunday observance but in morals generally?
