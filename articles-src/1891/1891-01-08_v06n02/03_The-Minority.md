# The Minority.

*Fanatic! the insect hissed, till he taught them to understand*
*That the highest crimes may be written in the highest law of the land.*
*"Disturber and dreamer!" the Philistines cried, while he preached an ideal creed,*
*Till they learned that the men who have changed the world, with the world have disagreed;*
*That the remnant is right, while the masses are led like sheep to the pen,*
*And the instinct of equity slumbers, until roused by instinctive men!*

—*John Boyle O'Reilly.*
