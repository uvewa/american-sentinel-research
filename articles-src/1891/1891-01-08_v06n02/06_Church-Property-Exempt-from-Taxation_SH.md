# Church Property Exempt from Taxation.

PRESIDENT GRANT, in his message of December, 1875, used these words:—

> In connection with this important question I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil, that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble before the close of the nineteenth century, namely the accumulation of vast amounts of untaxed church property. In 1850, I think the church property of the United States, which had paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000. In 1860 the amount had almost doubled. In 1875 it is $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Government, without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The accumulation of so vast a sum to be held and operated by a class of people who are not responsible to the civil authorities, and yet through broad sweeping provisions of tax on all our property might easily be made, is a matter that should engage the attention of all who are interested in the proper administration of the law. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation.

I would be well if all could realize the truth of these words, and the results that ought come from such a course, if constituted, in the future; or even realize the imposition on the tax-payers of to-day. The Church has the protection of the State from the onslaught of her enemies; she is protected by civil law, but, in her worship from disturbance by disbelievers or hoodlums without a word of Christian objection; just the same benefit as the individual, between corporation, society, or of color pays taxes for the support of the State and national Government under which we live.

I am a believer in the religion of Jesus Christ, and would not say or do anything to bring it into disrepute or cast it down. But I do think it is only right and proper that any society, religious or otherwise, having the benefits derived from the national government, should be equally taxed; and further, when any individuals or organizations are exempt from taxation by law, it falls upon the remaining inhabitants and corporations to make up the required amount of tax.

Therefore there is not only a class receiving the benefits derived from the Government without paying their share for such benefit, but, on the other hand, the masses are compelled to pay indirectly not alone for this protection, but also for the support and upholding of religious sects, and thereby religious institutions which they cannot maintain.

As an example, I will mention the Catholic Church, as it is the greatest in numbers in the United States. Just see the millions of dollars worth of property owned by her, not taxed. The same with other churches, but to a less extent. In this justice I say, No. We would accept, say, with James A. Garfield, in his words to Congress, June 22, 1874, as follows:—

> The divorce between Church and State should be absolute. It should be so far absolute that no Church property anywhere, in any State, in the Nation, should be exempt from equal taxation. If you exempt the property of any Church organization, this must you not equally exempt all the property of every citizen?
