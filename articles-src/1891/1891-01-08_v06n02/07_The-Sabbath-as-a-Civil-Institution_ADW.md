# The Sabbath as a Civil Institution.

UNDER the above heading, the official organ of the American Sabbath Union some time since published an article written by the Hon. E. F. Packer, of New York. He begins by saying,—

> The Christian Sabbath or Lord's day, as established in the United States of America on a moral and religious basis and both the morality and religion of its observance it is protected as a civil institution.

The writer calls it "the Christian Sabbath," and says "the day is" "protected as a civil institution." Christian institutions are not civil institutions, and no State has any moral right to treat them as such. Yet this is what is required.

The writer contends that Christianity has received the Government and its institutions should be regulated and enforced by the government of the States. The Sabbath is therefore, a civil institution also; that is the claim.

All the writer says, throughout his entire article, to prove that the Sabbath is a civil institution, is the fact that Legislatures have regulated and enforced the observance of it by law. On this principle, all the institutions of Christianity could be turned into civil institutions simply by passing laws for their enforcement. Adopt and regulate Christian baptism and the Lord's supper by law, and they would at once become civil institutions according to the principle of the American Sabbath Union. When Charlemagne compelled the Saxons to receive "Christian baptism," then by the same reason, Christian baptism became a "civil institution," just as the "Christian Sabbath" is now.

How nicely this principle was applied in the Dark Ages by the men who continued the article just noted. When they burned and slew at the stake for opposing the laws they had passed to regulate and enforce what they called the institutions of Christianity, all they had to do was to say, "This is not religious persecution, because we are not trying to force people to be religious, we punish them merely for refusing to recognize the civil institutions of the State."

To be sure, these are the institutions of Christianity, but the Holy Roman Empire has passed laws to regulate and enforce them, and this has made them civil institutions. Of course it is the duty of the State to protect its own institutions, consequently it is right to burn them who refuse to submit, and it cannot be called religious persecution, for certainly "no interference is intended with," that. The Church never persecuted nor punished anybody, and never put any body to death. The Church merely excommunicated them, and the State punished them for violating State laws.

Further, this writer says:—

> American judges have held that it is not a violation of the rights of the Jew to enforce the Sabbath of the people, the day set apart by common consent and usage, from the first settlement of the country, under the police power, that is the common law of the State or the earth, and especially those who are in the cities as an economical measure should be required by law to observe the same provided the present be deemed necessary.

To desecrate a thing is to treat it as though it was not sanctified; and, hence, to prevent its desecration is to prevent people from treating it as though it was not. But if they are not allowed to treat it as though it was not sanctified, they will be obliged to treat it as though it were sanctified. The object, therefore, of Sunday legislation is to force people to recognize the sanctity of Sunday. Civil institutions are not sanctified. Only religious institutions are sanctified, and only such can be desecrated. The Sabbath, being sanctified, is a religious and not a civil institution. To treat a religious institution as God directs is to observe its sanctity; to refuse in any different ways is to desecrate it. Further, to regard the immorality of anything is religious worship; and since the object of Sunday legislation is to compel people to observe the sanctity of Sunday, it is therefore proved that the object of Sunday laws is to secure religious worship.

The fact that civil judges have decided that Sabbath laws are no infringement upon the rights of conscience does not prove that this is so. The fact is, civil judges are usurping the prerogatives of God when they assume jurisdiction over such questions, and hence the whole discussion amounts to nothing. Christ said, "Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's." This shows that Cæsar has no jurisdiction over the things which belong to God, and the Sabbath is one of these things. "It is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." It is Christ, and not Cæsar, who is Lord of the Sabbath; and hence the right of any civil power to undertake to regulate that which belongs to Christ, and thus constitute himself lord of the Sabbath in Christ's stead.

This writer next says:—

> The existence of the Sabbath as a civil institution being conceded the right of the Legislature to control and regulate is in a necessary sequence.

This would be true provided it was "conceded" by the proper authority. But Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, and the only one that has any authority to make such a concession. Christ, however, has never conceded any thing; hence the concession does not follow.

Again, the article says:—

> If precedents were necessary to establish the right to legislate upon the subject, they could be cited from the statutes and ordinances of every government nearly or nominally Christian, and from the decisions of our courts.

This statement is certainly true; but it is just as true that, if precedents could establish the right of a thing, there is hardly an abomination on the face of the earth that cannot be established by that. Liquor drinking, polygamy, slavery, and religious persecution have for ages been defended by law; but this does not prove them to be right. Of course there are precedents for Sunday laws. Every State point to the other ones for their examples, the older States point to the Colonies, the Colonies point to Protestant England, she in turn to Catholic England, with the other European countries, while all these point to Papal Rome, the original and fountain of all Sunday laws. But Rome had a union of Church and State, and Sunday laws were a part of that system. Hence, wherever such laws are enacted, it is a step, not toward, but in a union of Church and State. It establishes a precedent for religious legislation, and that is what the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Union are trying to do. They may call it a "civil Sabbath," and tell us they do not intend to enforce any part of the Christian religion, but they cannot conduct an argument of any length without proving the contrary before they get through. In further illustration of this fact, we will offer one more quotation from this same article confirming. Mark this well:—

> Christianity has not only enough moral power, but a sufficient amount of humanity to be entitled to claim the laws which protect it in their exercise.

This shows the purpose of the whole movement. It is not to protect the workman or anybody else, but to protect the "sacred day" for the benefit of Christianity. And yet they tell us that Sunday laws are purely civil, and have nothing to do with religion. "By their fruits ye shall know them." Remember this is in the "Pearl of Days," the official organ of the American Sabbath Union.

But the fact that Christianity has already been shown that its vitality and vital power is superior to humanity, and is self-supporting, seeks no protection from the state. Christianity did stand alone. It can do so, and has no legitimate connection with any State; and whatever it may be entitled to, one thing is certain, it never has claimed nor does any protection or support or defense by the State.
