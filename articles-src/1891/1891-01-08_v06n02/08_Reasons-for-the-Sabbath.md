# "Reasons for the Sabbath."

"REASONS for the Sabbath" is a recently published tract of the Pacific Coast Committee of the American Sabbath Union. Do the friends of the American Sabbath Union admit that the extension of its principle over all days of the week, and stop work altogether! Concede to the Legislature the power to bar men from honest toil, and who will limit the power.

But the Union's organ cites the fact that the "precedents are manifold." I submit that "precedents are manifold" for all manner of usurpation and tyrannies by legislative bodies. Precedents do not make right. There are precedents for every crime in the calendar of crimes. There precedents for the rack, and the thumb-screws, and the dungeon, and the stake, and the Inquisition, to make men religious according to the law, but that does not make such methods right, nor does it make right a principle which, perverted, lead to such methods.

The Union further asserts that, "The Legislature in most every case prescribes the hours of work, declaring that eight, or nine, or ten hours shall be a legal day's work." This has never been questioned in law, yet "it is upon the same principle that the Sunday law is enacted."

There is no parallel between the Sunday laws and the laws specifying how many hours shall constitute a day's work. There is not a law in any State which prescribes what particular hours of the day shall constitute a day's work. There is no law that prohibits adult persons from working more hours than are prescribed as a legal day's work. If the legal day's work be eight hours per day, the law prevents no adult person from working two such days every twenty-four hours, if the proprieties of the work be willing. Even where the law prescribes a certain number of hours in the twenty-four for a legal day's labor, they do not specify what particular hours they shall labor.

Another so-called reason is: "The object is to afford all who rest an opportunity, and even those who could not otherwise obtain it."

Then why not confine it to those who need to rest and who cannot otherwise obtain it? There are plenty of men who rest half of the time or more. They do not need a law to compel them to rest. There are thousands of others who need to rest on that day; they do not have regular work on other days; and girls and to get work at any time to support themselves and families. Who compel them to rest when they have a much greater need for work?

The Union says, "To protect labor is one of the highest offices of the law." But the Sunday law is especially and entirely directed to prevent labor—to compel men to be idle. The Union says, "The Sunday law treats of business matters—not religious duties." But if we get such a law as is proposed by the American Sabbath Union for California, it will treat of religious duties; for it makes an exemption for such as religiously observe another day as a day of rest. It does not propose to make Sunday-observance religious, but to propose that those who observe any other day shall be religious. Why? Because, it says, they are the minority, and must do as the majority says. The man who is the majority may make it rest-day, a day of divine worship "if" he chooses. The man in the minority must be religious on his rest-day whether he chooses or not. Such are a few of the many absurdities connected with the Sunday-law proposition.—*Signs of the Times.*
