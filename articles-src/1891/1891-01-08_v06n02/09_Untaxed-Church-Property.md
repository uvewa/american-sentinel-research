# Untaxed Church Property.

BUT few of our citizens realize what a marked distinction exists between this and most of the other States of the Union in the matter of exempting church property from taxation.

In California real estate held by a religious society is assessed and taxed the same as other real estate; so no difference being made between that and other property, which is as it should be—set apart from taxation being an indirect subsidy and a far support of the Church by the State. Now, take the State of Illinois and contrast the exemptions in closing them in this respect. In the city of Chicago alone nearly two hundred millions (in value) are held by Catholic and Protestant Churches. A moderate estimate of the value of which is over $50,000,000. All of this property is entirely exempt from taxation by the laws of Illinois, though much of it is not used for church purposes, but is either unimproved or occupied by tenants who pay a rental. Although the Protestants are in the majority, the Catholics alone have one thousand one hundred and eight to the Protestants' eight hundred and thirty-six. St. Columbkill Sisters of Mercy alone own sixty-six lots, and the Jesuit Church of the Holy Family holds more.

When it is remembered that the value of these exempt properties is increasing rapidly, and that the "disinherited" therefore will make the societies that own them enormously wealthy in process of time, the gross injustice of the whole thing can be properly estimated.

It is a matter of satisfaction that the public press in Chicago, which is equal to the conscience of religion and having equal rights, is waking up to the importance of the matter, and calling for such a change as has been taken in California. That the repeal of the law in this State exempting church property from taxation has not worked to the injury of the churches is evident, as their property has been far greater since, than before.—*Oakland (Cal.) Daily Times.*

A man is faithful to truth, truth will be faithful to him. He need have no fears. His success is a question of time.—*Professor Phelps.*
