Rev. W. F. CRAFTS urges the friends of Sunday laws all over the Nation to write to their respective Congressmen urging immediate action upon the Sunday bills now pending. He says:—

Let writing to Congressmen about pending legislation become the people's habit. That is the way to make "Government of the people, by the people, and for the people" something more than a pretty saying. Legislators tell me that they seldom get any letters that are not selfish—if not applications for office, at least for seeds. A letter that urges attention to a great moral question from philanthropic motives is "as rare as a day in June," that is, there are only about thirty such in a Congressman's big mail in a year. They are, therefore, influential, though badly written. Such letters have been quoted in the Senate as evidence of the workingmen's interest in pending bills. The Sunday-rest bills for the Capital and for all under the jurisdiction of Congress, would doubtless become a law during this Congress, and the pending temperance bills also, if every one who believes in them would at once write to his two Senators and his Congressman, the stockholders in the national corporation, thus informing the directors of their wishes.

This shows that no stone is to be left unturned to secure the legislation demanded in the interests of Sunday sacredness.
