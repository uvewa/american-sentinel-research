It was with a kiss that Judas betrayed his divine Master; and we should all be admonished no matter what our faith may be, that the rights of conscience cannot be so successfully assailed as under the pretext of holiness.—*Col. Richard M. Johnson.*

Apropos to our statement made last week, that it is self-evident that every man has, so far as his fellow-men are concerned, an inalienable right to perfect liberty of conscience, is the following from Col. Richard M. Johnson, which came to our notice after our article was written. In his report to the House of Representatives, March 4, 1830, Mr. Johnson said:—

"The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. *Reasoning was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious of it in our bosoms.* It is this consciousness, which in defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tortures and in flames. They felt that their duty to God was superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no authority over their consciences. *It is an inborn principle which nothing can eradicate.* The bigot in the pride of his authority, may lose sight of it, but, strip him of his power, prescribe a faith to him which his conscience rejects, threaten him in turn with the dungeon and the fagot, and this spirit which God has implanted in him rises up in rebellion and defies you."
