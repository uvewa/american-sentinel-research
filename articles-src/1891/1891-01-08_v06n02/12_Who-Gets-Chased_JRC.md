In his late meetings in Rome, New York, Mr. Crafts made three statements as follows, that I would like the readers of THE SENTINEL to compare:—

1. He said that brave, God-fearing men, who stand for the right regardless of consequences, are a power. One such man would chase a thousand of cringing slaves.

2. Again, he said that there are twenty-six thousand Adventists, and twenty-six millions of his party. This would make one to a thousand.

3. Again, he said his people could not stand before the Seventh-day Adventists in an argument on the Sunday question; that the Adventists could, and usually did, completely rout them in less than five minutes.

Now let us condense the three statements.

1. A brave, God-fearing man will chase a thousand.

2. There is one Adventist to one thousand Sunday Union men.

3. The Adventists completely rout the Crafts party in less than five minutes.

**QUESTION.**—Who are the "God-fearing men"?
