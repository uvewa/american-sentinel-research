# Who Gets Called?

AT the late meetings in Berne, New York, Mr. Crafts made three statements as follows, that I would like the readers of THE SENTINEL to consider:—

1. He said that brave, God-fearing men, do the right for the right's sake, regardless of consequences, are a power. One such man would chase a thousand of them before a straw.

2. Again, he said that there are twenty-five millions of his party. This would make a considerable army.

3. Again, he said his people could not stand before the Seventh-day Adventists in an argument on the Sunday question, that the Adventists could, and usually did, completely upset him in less than five minutes.

Now let us condense the three statements into one.

A brave, God-fearing man will chase a thousand.

There is one Adventist to one thousand Sunday-observing men.

The Adventists completely upset his party in less than five minutes. The editor continued:

Question:—Who are the Adventists?
