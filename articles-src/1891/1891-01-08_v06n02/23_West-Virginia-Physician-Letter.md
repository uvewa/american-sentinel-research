A PHYSICIAN in West Virginia writes as follows:—

EDITORS AMERICAN SENTINEL: I am receiving your paper regularly, by the kindness of some friend unknown to me, to whom I am very grateful for it. What you and the National Religious Liberty Association advocate is certainly vital to true American patriotism. Were I financially able, I would like to show you my sympathy in cash; but a poor country practice and a large family prevent me. I have had warm friends in Dakota, who belonged to the Seventh-day Baptists, who worshiped with me in a regular Baptist Church. I learned from them that that denomination sincerely love the Bible. I see, too, that you love the dear book, and am glad of it.
