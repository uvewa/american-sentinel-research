This is the title of an article in the monthly document of the Pacific Coast Department of the American Sabbath Union. As a matter of fact, there are no reasons for a Sunday law, but it is proper to notice some of the pretexts for such legislation. In the article referred to, it is asserted that "the Legislature has the right to establish a day of compulsory rest, and it has the right to select the day. This is a sort of common-law right and the precedents are manifold."

That assertion is true only on the principle that the power to do any act makes it right. The Declaration of Independence, which contains the foundation principles of our Government, says that all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." Although not directly specified, it is universally conceded that the specifications—"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"—include the right to honest toil. If the Creator has endowed men with the inalienable right to labor, what Legislature has the right to deprive them of their God-given privilege? If men abuse this privilege by laboring for themselves during the time which God's law has declared to be holy, then they are amenable to God, and not to any human Legislature.

It is conceded on all hands that the Legislature has no right to compel men to labor, only as a punishment for crime; then, on the same principle where does it get the right to compel them to rest, except as a punishment for crime? If the Legislature has the right to compel men to refrain from working one day in the week, it may do so on any or all days. Would the American Sabbath Union admit the extension of its principle over all days of the week, and stop work altogether? Concede to the Legislature the power to stop men from honest toil, and who will limit the power?

But the Union's organ cites the fact that the "precedents are manifold." I submit that "precedents are manifold" for all manner of usurpations and tyrannies by legislative bodies. Precedents do not make right. There are precedents for every crime in the calendar of crime. There are precedents for the rack, and the thumb-screws, and the dungeon, and the stake, and the Inquisition, to make men religious according to the law, but that does not make such methods right, nor does it make right a principle which, persistently followed up, would necessarily lead to such methods.

The Union further asserts that, "The Legislature in most every State prescribes the hours of work, declaring that eight, nine, or ten hours shall be a legal day's work. This has never been questioned in law, yet it is upon the same principle that the Sunday law is enacted."

There is no parallel whatever between Sunday laws and the laws specifying how many hours shall constitute a day's work. There is not a law in any State which prescribes what particular hours of the day shall constitute a day's work. There is no law that prohibits adult persons from working more hours than are prescribed as a legal day's work. If the legal day's work be eight hours, there is no law which prevents an adult person from working two such days every twenty-four hours, if the proprietor of the work be willing. Even where the laws prescribe a certain number of hours in the twenty-four for children to labor, they do not specify what particular hours they shall labor.

Another so-called reason is: "The object is to afford rest to those who need it, and who otherwise could not obtain it."

Then why not confine it to those who need to rest and who cannot otherwise obtain it? There are plenty of men who rest half of the time or more. They do not need a law to compel them to rest. There are thousands of others who need to work on that day; they do not have regular work on other days, and are glad to get work at any time to support themselves and families. Why compel them to rest when they have a much greater need for work?

The Union says, "To protect labor is one of the highest offices of the law." But the Sunday law is especially and entirely directed to prevent labor—to compel men to be idle. The Union says, "The Sunday law treats of business matters—not religious duties." But if we get such a law as is proposed by the American Sabbath Union for California, it will treat of religious duties; for it makes an exemption for such as religiously observe another day as a day of rest. It does not propose to make Sunday observers religious, but it does propose that those who observe any other day shall be religious. Why? Because, it says, they are the minority, and must do as the majority says. The man who is in the majority may make his rest-day a day of divine worship "if he chooses." The man in the minority must be religious on his rest-day whether he chooses or not.

Such are a few of the many incongruities connected with the Sunday-law proposition.—Signs of the Times.
