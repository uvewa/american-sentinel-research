# Editorial Notes.

*New York, January 8, 1891.*

**Note.**—Any one receiving THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invariable rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.

*A key enclosed in this paper will indicate that we have sent it as a sample copy and are simply inviting attention to its contents.*

THE *Sun* has the following sensible words on the school question: "The introduction of religion in the schools means the overthrow of the whole public-school system. They cannot be State schools unless they are purely secular, and they cannot be religious schools without becoming purely Church schools."

SOME months since the *Oberlin Herald* took occasion to speak on the question of opening the mails in the public schools. Now it endorses the position taken by the *Register* of this State, which is substantially the same as our own. We are glad to note this evidence that the *Herald* has become a convert to the faith which it once opposed. Such papers are a good deal nearer the people than the great city dailies, and have their own sphere much influence in molding public opinion.

JUDGE ALLEN BUTLER, of the Syracuse *Blackstone* declares "Christianity, only" to be part of the law of the land! The best position for William Allen Butler to take, is that the President of the United States over one, and has done wrong. When the *Paper Money Congress* has elected its candidate for the Presidency of the United States, that individual will doubtless be called upon to advocate this theory to the people at large.

A CORRESPONDENT of a New York City paper writing from an Eastern city deplores the fact that in and about any city are penal institutions of various kinds. Some are benevolent and some are wicked. Being under semi-judicial control of some, nothing is done for these men and women in the line of spiritual work. Braves if they are branded at all, it must be by interested parties without demanding. I am glad to say, less from time to time we hear. Private individuals visit varied times, carrying religious literature, singing and praying with the inmates, and as opportunity offered preaching the Word. But this was felt to be most irregular; and so there has recently been formed the establishment of a Prison Association on a broader basis. It is unsectarian and inter-denominational. Its president is a Presbyterian woman, its vice president is a Methodist clergyman, while a Congregational minister is its efficient secretary. Associated with these is a Board of Directors, composed of five ladies and five gentlemen. Already a missionary has been employed, and efforts are now making to bring the whole matter to the notice of the Christian and other charitably disposed people of the city. With such co-operation, with the assistance which good Christian people everywhere can give to the needs of the faithful and indefatigable labors of our mission are, it is expected that even in a little city of ours, much good may be accomplished. May God grant it.

And this is just the sort of work that ought to be done by Christians everywhere to public charitable and penal institutions. Can any one doubt that such effort put forth, with the honest desire to do good, would be infinitely better than any attempt of State-paid chaplains?

*The Christian Register* publishes the following incident:—

Mrs. A. and her nine year old daughter recently had a Jewish neighbor, having a pretty bitter religious difference in public sympathy. His condition appealed very strongly to little Miss A., and she tried to co-determine the number of the abuses. It would be to daily fare to have from the house of another nature. Mrs. A., with the idea of not interfering with the charitable impulses of her daughter, you wouldn't have a Jew for a brother would you? She thought you wouldn't speak to him any more, but couldn't you speak him and make friends.

"This little girl," says the *Register*, "was simply putting into childish phraseology the spirit and method of centuries illustrated again and again in the history of the Christian Church."

A PREACHER in Western New York writes:—

EVERY AMERICAN SENTINEL, I am receiving your paper regularly, by the kindness of some friend unknown to me, and I must say I am very grateful for it. What you and the National Religious Liberty Association are doing is certainly vital to true American patriotism. Were I financially able I would like to show my own sympathy in cash; but a poor country practice and a large family prevent me. I have had warm friends in Baden, who belonged to the Seventh-day Baptists, who worshipped with me in a regular Baptist Church. I learned from them that that denomination sincerely love the Bible. I see, too, that you love the dear book, and the fact that certain New York papers were minded to advertise beforehand in the furtherance of their Sunday editions, articles from more or less eminent clergymen of different denominations, and setting forth the reasons for his particular faith. "Such stuff," says the *Advocate*, "on the part of ministers encourages the buying of Sunday papers, and is so designed by those who prescribe and advertise them." "Most intrude upon the Sabbath," it remarks, "are provoked as much by professed Christians as by antagonists of the gospel and irreligious men." In the light of this statement, which is certainly true, it looks very much as though the demand for more rigid Sunday laws, springs, in part at least, from a desire to compel the ministers to live up to their professions.

A WESTERN dispatch says that one of the chief contentions of the Catholics' attorney in the school case there, was, that they should be free from the necessity of supporting schools other than their parochial institutions. The judges held that the law does not abridge their right to have separate schools, but as the public schools are non-sectarian there is no reason why the Legislature cannot compel everybody to contribute to their support. If that is the case of the Catholics, they have a poor case.

AT the annual Sabbath Reform Convention of the Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, held in the Eighth United Reformed Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, November 18, Mr. Crafts said:—

New England ought to fear to lose the hold of the class in Sunday observance, but it is more in the other direction. The Portland spirit has it and it is now springing up in the West. The Rocky mountains has had fortifying, while the New England Sabbath Association is strengthening. Through the English Sabbath Association at Liverpool and the American Association at Boston and other cities. But there may be Sunday trains run over ready to visit the Salines and newspapers to be purchased almost in the center. We have scarcely done less than to give it earnest in the enforcement of the law against the violations of the Sabbath in certain portions of Virginia and the country. Pennsylvania observes Sunday better of any State, and not only because it is here, at the head of any cities, but there is reason for improvement. Sunday is more securely safeguarded by the laws, and they are Catholics, Indians, and Settlers, and to those there who are making any and we will furthermore. We want to enlist the whole mind of the country at the Washington Convention in February and to repress the base act of those citizens who would be willing.

In reading this statement the question naturally arises, If there are such good texts for good as Mr. Crafts teaches that they are, how comes it that a State Legislature, having on its statute book such good extravaganzas, set not only its people but its Legislature itself generally?

The *Advocate*, directed by a rather modern colony, under the sobriquet "Planets," is the very last publication in this country for those interested in science, as a father can give his young son no better present than a year's reading of that journal.

It is stated that "there are here in this land eight associations working in behalf of the
