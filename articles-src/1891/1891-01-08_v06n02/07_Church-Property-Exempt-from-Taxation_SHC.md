PRESIDENT GRANT, in his message of 1875, said:—

In connection with this important question I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil, that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble before the close of the nineteenth century. It is the acquisition of vast amounts of untaxed church property. In 1850, I believe the church property of the United States, which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $87,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled. In 1870 it was $354,483,587. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Government, without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a country, where real estate values enhance so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The accumulation of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority, and through blood. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally.

It would be well if all could realize the truth of these words, and the results that might come from such a course, if continued, in the future; or even realize the imposition on the tax-payers of to-day.

The Church has the protection of the State from the onslaught of her enemies; the protection, by the civil law, in her worship from disturbance by disbelievers or fanatics without a cent of remuneration; and just the same benefit as the individual, business corporation, society, or order that pays taxes for the support of the State and national Governments under which we live.

I am a believer in the religion of Jesus Christ, and would not say or do anything to bring it into disrepute or cast it down. But I do think, nevertheless, and it is true, that any society, religious or otherwise, having the benefits derived from the Government, should be equally taxed.

And further, when any individuals or corporations are exempt from taxation it falls upon the remaining individuals and corporations to make up the required amount of tax.

Therefore there is not only a class receiving the benefits derived from the Government without paying their share for such benefit, but, on the other hand, the masses are compelled to pay indirectly not alone for the protection, but also for the support and upbuilding of religious sects, and thereby religious which they cannot espouse. As an example, I will mention the Catholic Church, as it is the greatest in numbers in the United States. Just see the millions of dollars worth of property owned by her, not taxed. The same with other churches, but to a less extent. Is this justice? I say, No. We ought all to say, with James A. Garfield, in his words to Congress, June 22 1874, as follows:—

The divorce between Church and State ought to be absolute. It ought to be so absolute that no Church property anywhere, in any State, or in the Nation, should be exempt from equal taxation; for if you exempt the property of any Church organization, to that extent you impose a tax upon the whole community.
