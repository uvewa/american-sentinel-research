SOME months since the Orleans Herald took issue with us upon the question of teaching morals in the public schools. Now it indorses the position taken by the Baptists of this State, which is substantially the same as our own. We are glad to note this evidence that the Herald has become a convert to the faith which it once opposed. Such papers are a good deal nearer the people than the great city dailies, and have in their sphere much influence in molding public opinion.
