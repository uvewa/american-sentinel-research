Under the above heading, the official organ of the American Sabbath Union published some time since an article written by the Hon. E. S. Fancher, of New York. He begins by saying:—

The Christian Sabbath is observed and well established in the United States of America as a day of rest and religious worship; and both by the common law and by statutory legislation it is protected as a civil institution.

What right has the Government to protect as a civil institution that which is not a civil institution? The writer calls it "The Christian Sabbath," and yet he says "it is protected as a civil institution." Christian institutions are not civil institutions, and no one has any moral right to treat them as such. Yet this is what the American Sabbath Union is organized to do. The writer continues:—

In all the States of the Union the principles of the common law prevail, and in nearly all of them the Sabbath of Christianity is regulated by laws passed to secure the peace and good order of the community.

Notice that it is the "Sabbath of Christianity" which is "regulated by laws." This is what the American Sabbath Union upholds. But what right has the civil Government to regulate Christianity by law? When the Roman Empire regulated Christianity by law, they had a union of Church and State; and wherever Christianity is established or regulated by law in this country, we have a union of Church and State. But when this is so, and every person is compelled to conform to such regulations, how can any man worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience?

It has always been the plea of those who regulated religion by law that it was absolutely necessary "to secure the peace and good order of the community." That is the old story. But no Sunday laws are needed to secure the peace and good order of the community. There are laws to secure peace and good order on every day, Sunday included; and if these laws can be enforced on all of the days, there is no need of Sunday laws for that purpose. When, therefore, the American Sabbath Union asks for Sunday legislation, it must be for some other purpose than the one here given. Again, the writer says:—

Sabbath observance was enjoined and regulated by colonial laws before any organization of the Government of the States. The Sabbath is, therefore, a civil institution older than the States.

All the writer gives, throughout his entire article, to prove that the Sabbath is a civil institution, is the fact that Legislatures have regulated and enforced its observance by law. On this principle, all the institutions of Christianity could be turned into civil institutions simply by passing laws for their enforcement. Enjoin and regulate Christian baptism and the Lord's supper by law, and they would at once become civil institutions according to the principle of the American Sabbath Union. When Charlemagne compelled the Saxons to receive "Christian baptism," then by the same token, Christian baptism became a "civil institution," just as the "Christian Sabbath" is now.

How nicely this principle was applied in the Dark Ages by the men who condemned the martyrs to death. When they burned men at the stake for ignoring the laws they had passed to regulate and enforce what they called the institutions of Christianity, all they had to do was to say, "This is not religious persecution, because we are not trying to force people to be religious; we punish them merely for refusing to recognize the civil institutions of the State. To be sure, these are the institutions of Christianity, but the Holy Roman Empire has passed laws to regulate and enforce them, and this has made them civil institutions. Of course it is the duty of the State to protect its own institutions, consequently it is right to burn these men who refuse to submit; and it cannot be called religious persecution, for certainly nobody's conscience is interfered with." Thus the Church never persecuted nor punished anybody, and never put anybody to death. The Church merely excommunicated them, and the State punished them for violating State laws.

Further, the writer says:—

Judicial decisions have held that it is not a violation of the rights of conscience of any, that the Sabbath of the people, the day set apart by common consent and usage, from the first settlement of the land, as a day of rest, and recognized by the common law of the State as such, and expressly recognized in the Constitution as an existing institution, should be respected by the law-making power, and provision made to prevent its desecration.

To desecrate a thing is to treat it as though it was not sanctified or sacred, hence to prevent its desecration is to prevent people from treating it in that way. But if they are not allowed to treat it as though it was not sanctified, they will be obliged to treat it as though it were sanctified. The object, therefore, of Sunday legislation is to force people to recognize the sanctity of Sunday. Civil institutions are not sanctified. Only religious institutions are sanctified, and only such can be desecrated. The Sabbath, being sanctified, is a religious and not a civil institution. To treat a religious institution as God directs is to observe its sanctity; to treat it in any different way is to desecrate it. Further, to regard the sanctity of anything is religious worship; and since the object of Sunday legislation is to compel people to observe the sanctity of Sunday, it is therefore proved that the object of Sunday laws is to secure religious worship.

The fact that civil judges have decided that Sabbath laws are no infringement upon the rights of conscience does not prove that this is so. The fact is, civil judges are usurping the prerogative of God when they assume jurisdiction over any such question, and hence their decisions amount to nothing. Christ said, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." This shows that Caesar has no jurisdiction over the things which belong to God, and the Sabbath is one of those things. "It is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." It is Christ, and not Caesar, who is Lord of the Sabbath, and we deny the right of any civil power to undertake to regulate that which belongs to Christ, and thus constitute itself lord of the Sabbath in Christ's stead.

This writer next says:—

The existence of the Sabbath as a civil institution being conceded, the right of the Legislature to control and regulate it is a necessary sequence.

This would be true provided it was "conceded" by the proper authority. But as Christ is Lord of the Sabbath, he is the only one that has any authority to make such a concession. Christ, however, has never conceded any such thing; hence the conclusion does not follow.

Again, the article says:—

If precedents were necessary to establish the right to legislate upon the subject, they could be cited from the statutes and ordinances of every government really or nominally Christian, and from the earliest period.

This statement is certainly true; but it is just as true that, if precedents can establish the right of things, there is hardly an abomination on the face of the earth that cannot be established as right. Liquor drinking, polygamy, slavery, and religious persecution have for ages been defended by law; but this does not prove them to be right. Of course there are precedents for Sunday laws. The new States point to the older ones for their example, the older States point to the Colonies, the Colonies point to Protestant England, she in turn to Catholic England, with the other European countries, while all these point to Papal Rome, the original fountain of all Sunday laws. But Rome had a union of Church and State, and Sunday laws were a part of that system. Hence, wherever such laws are enacted, it is a step, not toward, but in a union of Church and State. It establishes a precedent for religious legislation, and that is what the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Union are trying to do. They may call it a "civil Sabbath," and tell us they do not intend to enforce any part of the Christian religion, but they cannot conduct an argument of any length without proving the contrary before they get through. In further illustration of this fact, we will offer one more quotation from the article under criticism. Mark this well:—

Christianity has surely done enough toward the elevation of humanity to be entitled to claim that the laws which protect its sacred day shall be maintained.

This shows the purpose of the whole movement. It is not to protect the workingmen, or anybody else, but to protect a "sacred day" for the benefit of Christianity. And yet they tell us that Sunday laws are only for the enforcement of a "civil Sabbath." Remember this is in the "Pearl of Days," the official organ of the American Sabbath Union.

But the fact that Christianity has elevated humanity shows that in vitality and power it is superior to humanity, and consequently needs no protection from that source. Christianity can stand alone; it does not have to depend on the civil power. And whatever it may be entitled to, one thing is certain, it never has claimed that any protection was expected or desired by the civil law.
