But few of our citizens realize what a marked distinction exists between this and most of the other States of the Union in the matter of exempting church property from taxation.

In California real estate held by a religious society is assessed and taxed the same as other real estate, no difference being made between that and private property, which is as it should be—exemption from taxation being an indirect subsidy and so far a support of the Church by the State. Now, take the State of Illinois and contrast the condition of things there in this respect. In the city of Chicago alone nearly two thousand lots (1,991) are held by Catholic and Protestant churches. A moderate estimate of the value of which is over $2,000,000. All of this property is entirely exempt from taxation by the laws of Illinois, though much of it is not used for church purposes, but is either unimproved or occupied by tenants who pay a rental. Although the Protestants are in the majority, the Catholics have one thousand one hundred and eight lots to the Protestants eight hundred and sixty-six. St. Columbkill Sisters of Charity have sixty-eight lots, and the Jesuit Church of the Holy Family eighty. When it is remembered that the value of these mostly unoccupied lots is increasing rapidly, and that the "unearned increment" will make the societies that own them enormously wealthy in process of time, the gross injustice of the whole thing can be properly estimated.

It is a matter of satisfaction to observe that the public press in Chicago, which is the conservator of religious liberty and equal rights, is waking up to the importance of the matter, and calling for such a change as has taken place in California. That the repeal of the law in this State exempting church property from taxation has not worked to the injury of the churches is evident, as their prosperity has been far greater since, than before.—Oakland (Cal.), Daily Times.
