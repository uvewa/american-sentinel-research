To people generally in this country the thought that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" seldom occurs. Everything is apparently running along smoothly; their business is not interfered with, direct taxes do not burden them, they have no royal family to support, and none are called to account to an Inquisition or a Star Chamber for their religion. But in this very feeling of security, this indifference unless there is some barefaced aggression upon their liberties, there is danger. It is not when a householder is watching and prepared for attack that the thief puts in his appearance. But it is when, after long continued freedom from molestation, a false sense of security from danger is felt that he comes in at the unfastened door or open window. So in the numerous cases of embezzlement throughout our land, it is not the openly dishonest persons who are always regarded with suspicion that do the work; but it is he who is intrusted with funds without due care being taken to see that he faithfully executes his trust.

Likewise in the case of the Nation, if the citizens do not regard their liberties with a jealous care, if they do not vigorously oppose the first indication of despotism, if they do not resist the first steps in unjust taxation, if they do not antagonize the minor violations of the principle of religious equality, the time will come, and it may not be very far distant, when the rights of the people will be trampled in the dust. This is a danger that has been seen and emphasized by the greatest of our American statesmen. It is a trait of human nature too manifest to escape the observing mind. Some of the most important of the writings of our early statesmen utter this warning to the American people, and the truth of their words is so evident to the lover of our free institutions that we cannot disregard them with impunity.

Among these documents is Madison's famous memorial and remonstrance to the Legislature of Virginia; and in that remonstrance he says, "It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question by precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians in exclusion of all other sects?—that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?"

Think of these words, and then think of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are annually appropriated to sectarian institutions out of the treasuries of municipalities, States, and Nation; and then ask yourself if it is not time that the American people were awaking to the dangers which threaten us, and opposing these illegitimate appropriations and further aggressions in the same line proposed by the pending constitutional amendment providing for the teaching of the "unsectarian" principles of Christianity in our public schools. Is it not time for the people to be aroused to these flagrant violations of American principles? It is the repeated transgressions of rights that strengthen the hands of despotism; and in a republic it is only by indifference to the first aggressions upon a people's rights that they can be entirely disregarded.

Another danger against which the American people in the past have been repeatedly warned is our legislation on the Sunday question. If this religious question is decided, why can we not decide other religious questions? "If the principle is once established," says the United States Senate report on Sunday legislation, of 1829, "that religion, or religious observances, shall be interwoven with our legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum." And again: "Extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. This first effort of the kind calls for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the committee, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence.

"All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequence."

But, says the report, "though the committee would hope that no portion of the citizens of our country would willingly introduce a system of religious coercion in our civil institutions, the example of other nations should admonish us to watch carefully against its earliest indication."

Jefferson also saw clearly how apt the people were to become wholly absorbed in business affairs while laws were being enforced subversive of their rights. In his "Notes on Virginia," query xvii, he says:

Besides, the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion.

To watch our representatives with a jealous eye, and to resist "the first experiment upon our liberties" is, as Madison says, "the first duty of citizens." In harmony with this statement of the "father of the Constitution," Herbert Spencer argues as follows:

Lastly, the supremacy of this same faculty [the faculty responding to the law of equal freedom—the moral sense] affords the only guarantee for the stability of a democracy. On the part of the people it gives rise to what we call a jealousy of their liberties—a watchful determination to resist anything like encroachment upon their rights: whilst it generates amongst these in power such a respect for these rights as checks any desire they may have to aggress.

Conversely, let the ruled be deficient in the instinct of freedom, and they will be indifferent to gradual usurpation of their privileges so long as it entails no immediate inconvenience upon them; and the rulers in such case, being deficient in sympathetic regard for these privileges, will be to a like extent unscrupulous in usurping. Let us observe, in detail, the different modes in which men thus contradistinguished comport themselves under a representative form of government.

Amongst a people not yet fitted for such a form, citizens, lacking the impulse to claim equal power with each other, become careless in the exercise of their franchise, doubt whether it is of any use to them, and even pride themselves on not interfering in public affairs.* Provided their liberties are but indirectly affected, they will watch the passing of the most insidious measures with vacant unconwern. It is only barefaced aggressions that they can perceive to be aggressions at all. Placing, as they do, but little value upon their privileges, they are readily bribed. When threatened, instead of assuming that attitude of dogged resistance which the instinct of freedom dictates, they truckle. Meanwhile, in accordance with that law of social homogeneity lately dwelt upon, those in authority are in a like ratio ready to encroach. They intimidate, they bribe, they plot, and by degrees establish a comparatively coercive government.

On the other hand, amongst a people sufficiently endowed with the faculty responding to the law of equal freedom, no such retrograde process is possible. The man of genuinely democratic feeling loves liberty as a miser loves gold, for its own sake, and quite irrespective of its advantages. What he thus highly values, he sleeplessly watches; he quickly detests any attempt at diminution of it; and he opposes aggression the moment it commences. Should any one assume undue prerogatives, he straightway steps up to them and demands their authority for so doing. Transactions that seem in the remotest degree underhand awaken his suspicions, which are not to be laid so long as anything remains unexplained. He scents out an abuse with instinctive sagacity, and having found one never rests until it is abolished. If in any proposed arrangement there be a latent danger to the liberties of himself and others—any germ of irresponsible power—he instantly discovers it, and refuses his consent. . . . Thus is he ever on the watch to extirpate incipient oppression; to nip abuses in the bud; or, if such an expression is allowable, to stop encroachment before it begins. And when a community consists of men animated by the spirit thus exemplified, the continuance of liberal institutions is certain.—Social Statics, chapter xx., section 10.

Thus plainly is the importance of an enlightened public opinion and a jealous regard for our liberties set forth. Let no one think that legislation in the wrong direction is of little or no importance because the bill in question will entail no hardship. It is well to remember that precedents are sometimes more powerful than the most evident principles; and that legislation once started on the downward course is like a huge boulder rolling down a mountain side—already difficult to check, but which, before we know it, attains such a velocity that it is beyond human power to affect its progress in the least, and it rushes uncontrollably on in its terrible career, crushing all before it, leaving naught but death and desolation in its path. Little do the inaugurators of religious legislation seem to realize the results that must necessarily follow the departure from the American principle of absolute separation of religion from the State. But as little as this danger is generally realized, it was emphatically declared sixty years ago, during the Sunday mail agitation of 1829–30, in the following strong words in a report to the national House of Representatives against any legislation upon the Sunday question by that body:—

If the measure recommended should be adopted, it would be difficult for human sagacity to foresee how rapid would be the succession, or how numerous the train of measures which would follow, involving the dearest rights of all—the rights of conscience.

These words should arouse the American people to a sense of the danger involved in the enactment of Sunday laws, either State or national. Aye, more than this: having seen their injustice and their dangerous tendency, they should never rest till the last vestige of a Sunday law is abolished, and every cent of the people's money is safe from appropriations to sectarian uses. Maintain the integrity of the Federal Constitution—that noblest and greatest of all political documents—at all hazards, and at whatever cost.

*As an illustration of this, note the behavior of the Prussian electors following the revolution of 1848; or observe the attitude of the colored population of our own country. Also note the elevating tendency that self-dependence and self-government has upon individuals,—a strong argument for universal emancipation.
