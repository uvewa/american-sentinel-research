A CORRESPONDENT of the New York Observer writing from California says:—

In and about our city are several institutions in which are gathered the poor, the lame, the halt, the wicked. Being under municipal control, of course nothing is done for these men and women in the line of spiritual work. Hence if they are reached at all, it must be by interested parties without. Something, I am glad to say, has from time to time been done. Private individuals have visited them, carrying religious literature, singing and praying with the inmates, and, as opportunity offered, preaching the Word. But this was felt to be inadequate; and so there has recently been formed the "Prison and Hospital Religious Association."

It is unsectarian and inter-denominational. Its president is a Presbyterian elder—a thoroughgoing business man, its vice-president is a Methodist clergyman, while a Congregational minister is its efficient secretary. Associated with these is a Board of Directors, composed of five ladies and five gentlemen. Already a missionary has been employed, and efforts are now making to bring the whole matter to the notice of the Christian and other charitably disposed people of the city. With such co-operation, with the assistance which good Christian workers from the various churches will give, and the faithful and indefatigable labors of our missionary, it is expected that not a little good will result. May God grant it.

And this is just the sort of work that ought to be done by Christians everywhere in public charitable and penal institutions. Can any one doubt that such effort put forth, with the honest desire to do good, would be infinitely better than any number of State-paid chaplains?
