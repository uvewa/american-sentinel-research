THE Christian Advocate deplores the fact that certain New York papers are enabled to advertise beforehand in the interests of their Sunday editions, articles from more or less eminent clergymen of different denominations, each setting forth the reasons for his particular faith. "Such conduct," says the Advocate, "on the part of ministers encourages the buying of Sunday papers, and is so designed by those who procure and advertise them." "Most inroads upon the Sabbath," it remarks, "are promoted as much by professed Christians as by antagonists of the gospel and irreligious men." In the light of this statement, which is certainly true, it looks very much as though the demand for more rigid Sunday laws, springs, in part at least, from a desire to compel the ministers to live up to their professions.
