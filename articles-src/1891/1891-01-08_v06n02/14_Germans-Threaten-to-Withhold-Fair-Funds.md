It is stated that a number of prominent Germans refuse to pay their subscriptions to the World's Fair fund until such time as they are given positive information as to whether the Exposition is to be closed on Sunday or not. It is not strange that the Germans take such action, but in view of the anti-foreign feeling which is developing so rapidly in this country, it is very likely to give impetus to the Sunday-closing movement rather than the contrary.
