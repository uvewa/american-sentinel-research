A WINNIPEG dispatch says that one of the chief contentions of the Catholics' attorney in the school case there, was, that they should be free from the necessity of supporting schools other than their parochial institutions. The judge held that the law does not abridge their right to have separate schools, but as the public schools are non-sectarian there is no reason why the Legislature cannot compel everybody to contribute to their support. If that is the case of the Catholics, they have a poor one.
