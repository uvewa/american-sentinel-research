THE Christian Register publishes the following incident:—

Mrs. A. and her five-year old daughter recently had a Jewish neighbor die, leaving a pretty boy-baby orphan dependent on public sympathy. His condition appealed very strongly to little Miss A., and she tried to convince her mother of the advantages it would be to the baby to have them for mother and sister. Mrs. A., with the idea of setting the matter, said, "But, Mabel, he is a Jew, and you wouldn't have a Jew for a brother would you?" Mabel thought for a moment and then said, "No, mamma; but couldn't you spank him and make him believe in Christ?"

"This little girl," says the Register, "was simply putting into childish phrase the spirit and method of coercion illustrated again and again in the history of the Christian Church."
