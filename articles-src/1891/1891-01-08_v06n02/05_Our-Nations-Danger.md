# Our Nation's Danger.

To people generally in the country the thought that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" seldom occurs. Everything is apparently running along smoothly; their business is not interfered with, directly; direct taxes do not burden them; they have no royal family to support, and none are exiled on account of an Inquisition or a Star Chamber for their religion. But in the very feeling of security, this indifference, there is the most danger; for when there is some barefaced aggression upon their liberties, there is danger. It is not upon a bombardment in full view, and prepared for, that the chief peril in battle lies; it is in the unexpected surprisal. But it is when, after long continued freedom from annoyance, a false sense of security from danger is felt, that the thief comes in at the unbarred door or open window. So in the immense course of government throughout our land, it is not the openly dishonest persons who are always regarded with suspicion that do the work, but it is he who is intrusted with funds without due care being taken to see that he faithfully exercises his trust.

Likewise in the case of the State, if the citizens do not regard their liberties with a jealous care, if they do not vigorously oppose the first intimations of invasion, if they do not resist the first steps in the minor violations of the principle of religious equality, if they do not antagonize unequal legislation, the graver violations may not be very far distant, when the rights of the people will be trampled in the dust. This is a danger that has been seen and emphasized by the greatest of our American statesmen. It is a trait of human nature too manifest to escape the observing mind. Some of the most noted examples of the writings of our early statesmen utter their warnings to the American people, and "the truth of their words" is as evident to the lover of our free institutions that we cannot disregard them with impunity.

Among those documents is Madison's famous memorial and remonstrance to the Legislature of Virginia; and in that remonstrance he says, "It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment over our civil and religious rights. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question by precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christianity in exclusion of all other sects—that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?"

Think of these words, and then think of the hundreds of thousands of dollars that are annually appropriated to sustain institutions and of the treasuries of municipalities, States, and Nation; and then ask yourself if it is not time that American people were waking to the dangers which threaten us, and opposing those illegitimate appropriations and further aggressions in the lines thus far proposed by the pending national amendment providing for the teaching of the "unchristian" principle of Christianity in our public schools. Is it not time for the people to be aroused to a knowledge of the danger of a politico-religious despotism? It is the repeated transgressions of rights that strengthen the hands of usurpation, and in a republic it is by indifference to the first aggression upon a people's rights that they may be entirely disregarded.

Another danger against which the American people in the past have been repeatedly warned is that of religious combinations in civil affairs. If this religious question is decided, why can we not decide other religious questions? "If the principle is once established," says the United States Senate report on Sunday mails (1829), "that religion, or religious observances, shall be interwoven with our legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum." And "extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. The first effect of the kind must be for the establishment of a principle which, in the opinion of the community, would lay the foundation for dangerous innovations upon the spirit of the Constitution, and upon the religious rights of the citizens. If admitted, it may be justly apprehended, that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually controlled, by the same influence."

"All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences."

But, says the report, "though the committee would hope that no portion of the citizens of our country would be willing to introduce a system of religious coercion in our civil institutions, the example of other nations should admonish us to watch every encroachment upon our civil rights with jealous attention."

Jefferson also saw clearly how that the people were to become wholly absorbed in their business affairs while laws were being enforced subversive of their rights. In his "Notes on Virginia," he says, it is by no means certain. Besides, the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united.

To watch our representatives with a jealous eye, and to recall, "the first experiments upon our liberties," as Madison says, "this first duty of citizens." It is the acknowledgment of the supremacy of the same faculty that secures the peace and good order of the Constitution," Herbert Spencer attested.

Conversely, the ruled to be definitely at rest in the undisturbed possession of their privileges are as being so far from danger as to be inconsiderate. Those rights as checks any desire they may have to be unrestricted.

Maintain the integrity of the Federal Constitution—that noblest and greatest of all political documents—at all hazards, and at whatever cost.
