ANY attempt to legislate on the subject of morals, is an attempt to confound moral rights with civil rights. But there is a difference between moral rights and civil rights as there is between the moral and [59] the civil law. No human tribunal is competent to tell whether a man's thoughts and actions are consistent with the principle of love.

A moral law is the expression of the principle of love to God and man; so civil law is the expression of the principle of justice. As justice demands a perfect equality of rights, and the largest amount of liberty consistent with the principle of self-preservation. That government which applies the constant to the demands of justice in protecting citizens in the exercise of their rights, is the one most in harmony with the will of God. When a government violates the principle of justice, the responsibility rests upon those who enact and enforce the law. In a free public like ours, responsibility attaches to everyone who has not by every proper means opposed the unjust measure.

All responsibility is ultimately personal responsibility. A person is individually responsible for his observance of the moral principle of love; and he is individually responsible to the State for violation of the civil principle of justice. The moral principle includes the civil, but the civil does not include the moral. A person who was perfectly moral would never be unjust; yet any person may be civil who will not be called moral. They refrain from injuring their followers, but not from violating the motive of love. The principle of love comes from God, and can be supplied only by him. It comes through faith in Jesus Christ, hence no power to be desired by any earthly government. As a moral principle is more comprehensive than the civil, it follows that an individual may have the civil right to do a great many things that he has no moral right to do. As a member of society, a servant of the State, he has the right to do any thing which does not infringe or invade the rights of his fellows; but as a servant of God, he has no right to do anything which will infringe the principles of perfect love, not to do anything less than perfect before God. He must be filled with the righteousness of God which is by faith. Yet far away from this perfect moral condition to God, he is in responsible moral duty.

A man has the right to be immoral, but he has neither the moral nor the civil right to be unjust. He can be civil by his own effort; but he can be moral only by the help of God. The sole object of Christ's sacrifice was to make men moral, to bring them back into harmony with the moral law. The State has no right to hold the citizen responsible for anything which he can not do without the help of God. "The carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;" and as the State has no power to bestow a carnal mind or change the heart, the evil object of God in his creative work, shall accomplish his destiny by remaining himself to rest.

From whatever standpoint this question is viewed, the conclusion is irresistible, first, last, and all the time, that with moral rights or duties, civil government can have nothing to do; that a person has the civil right to do anything that is not immoral; no matter how immoral it may be; that God alone has the right to require morality, because he alone can change the carnal mind and make men moral; and that it is he only one who has the right to punish immorality, because he only can measure the guilt of the transgressor of his law.
