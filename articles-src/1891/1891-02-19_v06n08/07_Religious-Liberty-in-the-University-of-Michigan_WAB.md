It may be interesting to the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL to hear something of the interest taken in religious liberty in the largest university in America. There are here about twenty-five hundred students, and all the different departments are well-filled. There are between five and six hundred in the law department, and more than a thousand studying the arts and sciences. The popularity of the university is rapidly increasing from year to year, and even the most remote States are well represented.

Taking advantage of the discussion which has been raised in reference to a national law compelling the closing of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, a large number were canvassed to ascertain their views on the question. The result of the canvass showed that about two to one were in favor of allowing each exhibitor to conduct his own affairs, and did not believe in the Government interfering with the question of religion, in 1893, any more than in any other year. The force of the First Amendment declaring that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," seems to be appreciated. The opposition is not to closing the World's Fair on Sundays, but to the interference of the Government in the matter. Every one knows that every exhibitor will have the privilege of closing if he so desires, and a law on the subject is simply an attempted interference with the private affairs of the exhibitors. Every one should be left free to follow his own choice in the matter. A law interfering with the same freedom of will by compelling exhibitors to keep open on Sunday, would receive the opposition of the same persons, for the same reasons.

A more recent movement is the formation of a society for the discussion and dissemination of the underlying principles of religious liberty. The following quotation from the Constitution of the Society will show its object and character:—

**ARTICLE II.—OBJECT.**

The grand object of this Society shall be to aid in the maintenance of American principles—the total separation of religion from civil Government and the conservation of religious liberty in its broadest sense—by means of lectures, discussions, and the dissemination of literature.

**ARTICLE III.—CHARACTER.**

This Society shall be strictly unsectarian and non-partisan in both principles and methods.

**ARTICLE IV.—MEMBERS.**

Any person may become a member of this Society upon receiving a three-fourths vote, by paying the membership fee and signing the Constitution.

A more clearly defined idea of the Society may be obtained from the following announcement which has just been issued by it:—

Members of the university, believing that they might stimulate thought by a discussion of the principles of liberty, characteristic of the American political system, organized the "Religious Liberty Society" on the thirty-first of January last. It is the purpose of this Society to maintain American principles, without compromise, and to apply them to all the functions of Government—insuring to every one the equality to which he is entitled.

Various tendencies or movements favoring governmental preference or aid to one or another religion or cult, justify anew the discussions which led to the establishment of our constitutional guarantees of religious liberty. The recent decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in reference to reading the Bible in the public schools, the case of R. M. King, being prosecuted for Sunday work, now in the Federal Courts, the Sunday bills in Congress, and other religio-political measures, present a fruitful field for political discussion.

Believing the doctrine asserted by Madison, that "among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights, a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters," the Society is sure, as Madison was, that "religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together."

"We are teaching the world," he continued, "the great truth that Governments do better without kings than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson: that religion flourishes in greater purity without, than with, the aid of government."

In view of these considerations, it is believed that there is a legitimate sphere for such a society among the others which grow up around a great school, and it is also believed that these purposes will merit the approval of all liberal minds.

The Corresponding Secretary of the Society has just issued a book which contains public documents on religious legislation—especially the Sunday phase—and the writings and public addresses of some of our greatest statesmen in reference to the question. The editor's preface to the work sets it forth in the following light:—

Political history is a most interesting study; and of all the political history of the world no other has been so full of interest, so filled with matter for thought, as that of America for the last two centuries. The irrepressible spirit of liberty in the early Americans, and the philosophical ideas on government characteristic of the times, united to bring forth a Government more grand, more in accordance with human rights, more in harmony with the principles of Christ, than any the world had ever before seen.

There is, however, a reaction taking place. And the revival of the religio-political ideas of mediaeval times, the practical operation of which, as declared by the United States Senate, "has been the desolating scourge of the fairest portions of the Old World," calls for the republication of American State papers which have marked the successive steps in our political history.

The influence of Roger Williams, of Washington, of Jefferson, of Madison, and of their fellow-statesmen has been first throughout the world. The free institutions established by them have made the name "America" a synonym of liberty. Bartholdi's famous "Statute of Liberty," presented to America by France, is a fitting tribute to the Utopia of nations.

The world has marked with astonishment the unprecedented advancement of American institutions, founded, as they are, upon theories now in accordance with the principles of absolute civil and religious liberty—theories which previous to the establishment of American institutions had existed only in the schools of philosophy;—theories evidently deducible from the principles of abstract justice and incontrovertible logic, but which had never had practical application.

A new Nation, proud of Anglican liberty,—proud of such Englishmen as Locke, and Sidney, Hampden and Pym, Milton and Cromwell—proud of insuring to the minority their rights, was the first to free itself from the superstitious ideas which had made governments restrict or entirely destroy rights which they were instituted to protect. In striking contrast with the older governments has America stood before an astonished world as a refuge for the persecuted, a home for the oppressed, the land of the free. Shall these institutions, which, have thus benefited humanity, be supplanted in this enlightened age by the Church and State dogmas of past centuries?

It is true that some of the States have never given up the idea that religion and the State must have some connection. But, in contrast with this, our national Government declares that "the United States of America, is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion." The American Government is founded upon human rights, upon the rights given to every man by his Creator, upon the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the free exercise of one's faculties. Pagan, and Mahommedan, Gnostic and Agnostic, Jew and Gentile, Catholic and Protestant, are all entitled to the unrestricted exercise of their equal rights, and to an impartial protection from the Government in such exercise. These are the principles characteristic of American institutions, these were the principles of the founders of our Government; these are the principles of Anglican liberty, and the ideals of Anglican philosophy.

As an outgrowth of these principles, we have in America "Liberty enlightening the world." But this liberty will exist only in name, if we enact and enforce laws that are contrary to our constitutional rights and unworthy a free and enlightened people.

It is to set forth the true American idea—absolute freedom of religion from the State—absolute freedom for all in religious opinions and worship—that these papers are collected and republished.

But the Religious Liberty Society is not, by any means, the only instrumentality that is aiding in the dissemination of these views. The leading societies of the literary and law departments give considerable attention to the discussion of the fundamental principles of our Government; and the Blair bills, State rights, centralization of power, individual rights, the Bennett law, and kindred topics, frequently receive attention by independent thinkers.

The clergymen also are friendly to the well-established American idea of religious liberty, and as opportunities are presented, give expression to their views.

With all these influences, together with the powerful lessons from history that are taught every day in the year, a liberal spirit is implanted here that will make its influence felt wherever students from the University of Michigan may go.
