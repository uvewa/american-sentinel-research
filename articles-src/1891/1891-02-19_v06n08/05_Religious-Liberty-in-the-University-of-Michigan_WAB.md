IT may be interesting to the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, to learn something of the interest taken in religious liberty in the largest university in America.

There are here about twenty-five hundred students, and all of the different departments are well-filled. There are between thirty and a hundred in the law department, and more than a thousand taking the arts and sciences. The popularity of the university is rapidly increasing from year to year, and even the most remote towns are well represented.

Taking advantage of the discussion which has been raised in reference to a national law compelling the closing of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, a large number were canvassed to ascertain their views on the question. The result of the canvass showed that about two to one were in favor of allowing each exhibitor to conduct his own affairs, and did not believe in the Government interfering with the question of religion, in 1893, any more than in any other year. The force of the First Amendment declaring that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," seems to be appreciated. The opposition is so far as going to the World's Fair on Sundays, but to the interference of the Government in the matter. Every one knows that every exhibitor will have the privilege of closing if he so desires, and a law on the subject is simply an attempted interference with the private affairs of the exhibitors. Every one should be left free to follow his own choice in the matter. A law interfering with the same freedom of will by compelling exhibitors to keep open on Sunday, would overcome the opposition of the same person, for the same reason.

A more recent movement is the formation of a society for the discussion and dissemination of the underlying principles of religious liberty. The following quotation from the Constitution of the Society will show its object and character—

> The great object of this Society shall be to aid in the maintenance and defense of the constitutional and total separation of religion from civil government in the United States of America, by discussion, the printed essay—by means of lectures, discussions and the dissemination of literature.

> ART. III.—CHARTER.

> This Society shall admit of all persons to participate in its purposes and methods.

> Any person may become a member of this Society upon application of membership fee and signing the Constitution.

A more clearly defined idea of the Society of American Freedoms may be obtained from the following announcement which has just been issued:

> Members of the university, believing that they might properly though be a discussion of the principles of liberty, characteristic of the American principles, organized the "Religious Liberty Society" on the thirty-first of January last. It is the purpose of this society to advocate those principles, without compromise, and to apply them at all the functions of Government, standing that ever on the equality by which it is national.

> Various moderate or movements favoring religion or civil, justify now the discussions that may be awakened upon the subject of the civil status of religion liberty. The recent decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin with reference to the Bible in the public schools, the case of R. M. King being prosecuted for Sunday work in Tennessee, the Breckinridge Sunday Bill, the Federal Courts, the Sunday bills in Congress, and the religious question present a fruitful of field for political discussion.

Referring the doctrine asserted by Madison, that "among the features peculiar to the political systems of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights, a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters," the Society is one in Madison was, that "religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together," fully trusting that the truth which is in the principle will result in truth that Government do better without State support than with them. The most of the wisdom to be by the other basis: that religion flourishes in greatest purity without, thus with, the aid of government.

A new Nation, purer of Amphion's lyre,—equal to the faith of Jefferson, of Madison, and of their fellow-statesmen and countrymen at whose hands the free institutions established by them have made the name American—has inaugurated and organized a national "Status of Liberty" presented in America by France, is a fitting tribute of free foreign appreciation.

The world has marked with astonishment the unparalleled progress of this free form of American Government, and more than any living generation has been called upon to witness its principle put into practice with the principles of religious liberty so vividly expressed by the founders of American Union, to write into what which is the backbone of all philosophy—elevate merely—and which may be called the experimental philosophy of free government with that is expressed in the preamble to the Constitution of the United States in a most venerable logic, but which had never had practical application until—

> [61] As an enlarges of these principles, we have in America "Liberty enlightening the world." But this liberty will exist only in name, if we enact and maintain legislation that restricts religious liberty and usurps a free and enlightened people.

It is in and for the American ideas—absolute freedom of religion from the State—absolute freedom for all its religious opinion and worship—that these aims are achieved and expanded.

But the Religious Liberty Society is not, by any means, the only instrumentality we shall aid in the discussion of these views. The leading societies of the literary and law departments give considerable attention to the discussion of the fundamental principles of our Government; and the Blair bills, State rights, centralization of power, individual rights, the Bennett law, and kindred topics, frequently receive attention by independent thinkers.

The clergymen also are friendly to the well-established American idea of Religion and, as opportunities are presented, give expression to their views. From all these influence, together with the powerful lessons from history that continue every day in the year, a liberal spirit is implanted here that will make its influence felt whenever students from the University of Michigan may go.
