CHARLES BRADLAUGH, the English atheist, who so distinguished notoriety and not a little sympathy because of being refused for years from Parliament as an outcast of his faith, is dead. A few days before his death, the House of Commons expunged from the records of that body the resolution of expulsion. Commenting upon this fact, the *Baptist Observer* of this city says:—

> This curious action of that body, the resolution has been expunged from the records, has enabled the House of Commons to establish its jurisdiction. That body permanently gives power in such matters, there being no appeal from its decision except, as in this case, to appeal to a House from which passed any government of a House that had from time to get over. Nevertheless, it was wanted to decorate themselves, excluding from its membership a man legally chosen to represent them by the voters of Nottingham. The contest was that of Wilkes, who was elected again and again to a Parliament that refused to admit him to his seat. "In the end the people and good sense prevail in such a contest."

Of Mr. Bradlaugh's character, the same paper says:—

> In all his dealings with men he was actuated by the sentiment "I need have no reason to put myself not to say how it is want to himself and to that God anything he should mention."

That is one view of the matter, however, presented by the *Christian Statesmen*, is the reason for expunging from the record of the House the resolution of expulsion. It says:—

> These reasons are sound and good in themselves though of not well applied. But it is no reason for a petition of a justification for a national Legislature to exclude from its membership one who does not believe in the being of God and holds no allegiance to that higher law which, more even written Constitutions founded to the State. If an earthly government will not admit to its councils men who hold to Inquisition, or to the violation of human life and natural liberty; who thus deny or refute the corporate principles of existence alive, and do not conform to the existing rules on these the thing of states?

We quote these two opinions merely to show the contrast between the spirit of genuine Christianity, and the spirit of the Christianity perverted by National Reform Christian. The *Observer* is one of the first Baptist papers of the land; it cannot be suspected of any sympathy whatever with atheism, but it is not yet drenched with the wine of the wrath of the churches' fornication committed by unholy alliance with its civil power. The *Christian Statesman* is thus drunken; that is the difference between these two papers: one believes the gospel and it would be done by it, while the other holds that atheists have no rights which Christians are bound to respect; the one would dishonorably depart, equally set out initial, the other would grant to every one who conducted himself as a good citizen, all the rights and privileges of citizenship without regard to his religious belief or non-belief.

We abhor atheism, we are as plainly the English sense of justice lies again superior to religious bigotry and intolerance, and disorderly. All atheism fastens upon injustice on the part of those who bear the Christian name, than those many of the veneer of that malice under the religion from the Golden Rule.
