It is very strange that a State professing to treat its citizens equally in the matter of religion, the book from which is drawn the religion of a numerous body of its citizens should be met and a memorial of worship in schools for the people, supported by taxing the entire body of citizens. This is a palpable invasion of the province which the State professes to guard—the rights of conscience. If the religious book of one portion of the people is to be paid for by the State, the other portions with justice claim that their books should also have State sanction. If the Christian has his Bible read as a religious book, not simply as literature, in the schools supported by all, equal justice may the Chinaman demand the reading of the Koran, the infidel the reading of the "Mistakes of Moses," and so on. Agreeing the reading of Spurgeon and Harvey? But the majority rules, it is said, and these others are but in minorities; in simple propriety, the Bible should be used in the way of the majority. No, in this matter the majority does not rule, for in lives under a form of Government which guarantees Church and State, and declares that a man shall not have an obnoxious religion forced upon him or his children, though to be in a minority of one. Moreover, no practical man of religious spirit should avoid a broad and enduring basis that shall avoid the dangers of controversy and disposition on the question of religion in religious matters.—*Henry M. Moore, in Christian Union*.
