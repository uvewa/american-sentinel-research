Any attempt to legislate on the subject of morals, is an attempt to confound moral rights with civil rights. But there is as much difference between moral rights and civil rights as there is between God and man, or between God's government and man's government. When we say that a man has the right to do this or that, we should be particular to state whether it is the moral right or the civil right to which we refer. A neglect to do this shows a want of knowledge on our part, or a willful determination to treat things alike which are entirely different.

The law of God is a statement of moral duties from which moral rights are derived. "For where no law is, there is no transgression." As all moral duty is summed up in two principles—supreme love to God, and love for man equal to that which we have for ourselves, it is evident that every one has the moral right to do anything not inconsistent with these principles. And as God is the author of moral law, and has given to man all the moral rights which he has, it is doubly certain that no human authority can ever regulate, define, or restrict those rights. And as the law of God takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart, it is also evident that no human authority is competent to tell whether a man's thoughts and actions are consistent with the principle of love.

As moral law is the expression of the principle of love to God and man; so civil law is the expression of the principle of justice to man. Justice demands a perfect equality of rights, and the largest amount of liberty consistent with the principles of civility. That government which approaches the nearest to the demands of justice in protecting citizens in the exercise of their rights, is the one most in harmony with the will of God. When any government violates the principle of justice, the responsibility rests upon those who enact and enforce the law. In a republic like ours, responsibility attaches to every citizen who has not by every proper means opposed the unjust measure.

All responsibility is ultimately individual responsibility. A person is individually responsible to God for violating the moral principle of love; and he is individually responsible to the State for violating the civil principle of justice. The moral principle includes the civil, but the civil does not include the moral. A person who was perfectly moral would never be uncivil; yet many persons are civil who can not be called moral. They refrain from injuring their fellowmen, but not from the motive of love. The principle of love comes from God, and can be supplied only by him. It comes through faith in Jesus Christ, hence can never be bestowed by any earthly government. As the moral principle is more comprehensive than the civil, it follows that an individual has the civil right to do a great many things which he has no moral right to do. As a member of society, a servant of the State, he has the right to do anything which does not infringe upon the equal rights of his fellows; but as a servant of God, he has no right to do anything that will infringe the principle of perfect love, nor to be anything less than perfect before God. He must be filled with the righteousness of God which is by faith. Yet for any lapse from this perfect moral condition before God, he is responsible solely to God.

A man has the civil right to be immoral; but he has neither the moral nor the civil right to be uncivil. He can be civil by his own effort; but he can be moral only by the help of God. The sole object of Christ's sacrifice was to make men moral, to bring them back into harmony with the moral law. The State has no right to hold the citizen responsible for anything which he can not do without the help of God. "The carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;" and as the State has no power to remove the carnal mind or change the heart, it is therefore certain that the State can never enforce the moral law, or hold any one responsible for an act, simply because it is immoral.

From whatever standpoint this question is viewed, the conclusion is irresistible, first, last, and all the time, that with moral rights or duties, civil government can have nothing to do; that a person has the civil right to do anything that is not uncivil, no matter how immoral it may be; that God alone has the right to require morality, because he alone can change the carnal mind and make men moral; and that he is the only one who has the right to punish immorality, because he only can measure the guilt of the transgressor of his law.
