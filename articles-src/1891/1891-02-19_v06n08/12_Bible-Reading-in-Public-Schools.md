It seems strange that in a State professing to treat its citizens equally in the matter of religion, the book from which is drawn the religion of a numerous body of its citizens should be used as a manual of worship in schools for the people, supported by taxing the entire body of citizens. This is a palpable invasion of the province which the State professes to leave to the individual conscience. If the religious book of one portion of the people is to be used by the State, the other portions may with justice claim that their books should also have State sanction. If the Christian has his Bible read as a religious book, not simply as literature, in the common schools, with equal justice may the Chinaman demand the reading of Confucius, the Turk the reading of the Koran, the infidel the reading of the "Mistakes of Moses," and the Agnostic the reading of Spencer and Huxley. But the majority rules, it is said; and as these others are in a hopeless minority, the Bible should be used as the choice of the majority. No, in this matter the majority does not rule; for it lives under a form of Government which separates Church and State, and declares that a man shall not have an obnoxious religion forced upon him or his children, though he be in a minority of one. Moreover, our public school system should be put on a broad and enduring basis that shall avoid the dangers of controversy and of changing opinion in religious matters.
