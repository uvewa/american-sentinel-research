> It is evident that civil government can not, if it would, enforce morality on a moral basis. It takes cognizance of overt actions only. It cannot sway the conscience; it cannot reform the conscience; it cannot renew the heart. If it attempts to usurp the conscience, it usurps authority which belongs alone to God, the supreme moral Government.

> In its attempts to do so, it may not provoke, it may make a class of its citizens act the part of hypocrites, but it cannot reach the heart on matters of morality, and much less on those of religion.—*Watchman* (S. D. B.) *Sentinel*.

> As a part of more ordinary usage many are to be made in the present Legislature to enact a compulsory Sunday law. The American Sabbath Union officials—of the National Reform Association—is at all times of the movement, and will leave no means untried to accomplish its end, and that end is the amalgamation of Church and State—all one altogether forcing obedience to the Constitution of the United States, thus guaranteeing to all the right to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences. To compel people, who do not believe that the first day of the week is the Sabbath, or even the day of Sabbath, to observe that day, is to deprive them of their constitutional right. Is this in accord with the American boast of freedom? Hardly, we think. Though we were brought up to reverence the first-day Sabbath, we do not feel that we have the right to force our belief upon others who hold just as honest convictions to the contrary. We of California need no Sunday law. There is no part of the world where religious and religious worship is more highly respected, or better protected than in California. This is as it should be; it is a established feature of our State. But when a religious institution, such as this American Sabbath Union, undertakes to dictate what all shall observe; the orderly as well as the disorderly—shall do or not do on any day of the week, it is time to call a halt.—*Herald of Oak, Escalon.*

## Self-Preservation and Enforced Lordship.

ON account of travelling from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and one thing on the way back again, we had lost the connection in the number of the *Christian Statesmen* in which Mr. Crafts is communicating to the public his wisdom in relation to Sunday laws. Now, however, we have gathered up the copies of the *Statesmen*, have made the connection, and are again ready to relate to the people the stock of interest to the public, regarding the Sunday-law campaign.

In number three of his contributions, Mr. Crafts declares that

> the Republic is bound in the law of self-preservation to protect the Sabbath as a weekly rest for all.

There is not a particle of truth in this assertion. And for two reasons: one is that our Republic has nothing to do with moral culture. This Republic is not a moral institution; it is a civil Government. The Republic has no question to ask whether the people are moral or not. All it wants to know is whether they are civil, and its offices are rightly exerted to that purpose and no other. The church and the churches are the institutions, and the only ones in this world, that can have to do with moral culture. And when a demand is made that the State shall enact Sunday laws, or enforce those already enacted, or do anything else in the interests of moral culture, or when the State [58] is asked to work, or is asked to work, in the interests of the Church, and the union of Church and State is the result. So everybody does a union of Church and State who favors in every phase of Sunday laws, and in every plea in their behalf.

The other reason is, that this plea for self-preservation, *in the way or whatsoever it is meant*, is a fraud. Mr. Crafts, however, is not the only one who is guilty of making this fraudulent trick with words. It is impossible for the State to preserve itself from supposed dangers which threaten from the delinquencies of a majority of the people. The State is composed of the people. When the majority of the people are doing what they think or even what they know to be wrong, laws against such things are a nullity. This applies practically, actually; to the majority of the people. If the majority of the people are doing wrong, and laws are enacted prohibiting the wrong things which they are doing, they being the majority, can disregard the law without fear. And that is what is discernible in not only a handful of laws; therefore, is not only a nullity, but the general disrespect of that law tends only to cultivate a disregard of all laws; every attempt of the State at self-preservation in any such cases will only carry it farther toward the destruction which it endeavors to escape. It is the same as if a man of the mass endeavoring to pull himself out of the quicksand into which he had fallen.

Another thing: if in all such cases, it is not only one made of the laws so enacted, to be by major, who use them as an occasion or means of venting their spite upon their neighbors.

This is precisely the situation in the matter of Sunday laws. In a previous article we have given abundant and strong testimony of the fact that the great majority, even of church members, do not observe Sunday as they profess to believe it ought to be observed. Coming then with the people in this country who are not church members, and care even less than the church members do for Sunday observance, and it is found that the [58] vast majority of the people of the United States care very little or nothing at all for Sunday observance. And this is thrown in the face of the fact that all the State except three or four there are strict Sunday laws. Now what is the use of making more Sunday laws when there is such a universal disregard of those already enacted? And especially what is the use of making more Sunday laws when even the church members who make the plea for Sunday observance to be right, so generally disregard both their own profession and the Sunday laws which are already made? How is it possible that there can be any self-preservation on the part of the State in the enactment of additional Sunday laws whether State or national? In the existing condition of things every additional Sunday law will not only be disregarded, but the general disregard of laws already, short but surely, perfectly at each modify the spirit of disregard of all laws, even those which are sound and for the public good.

There is such a thing as not only the right, but the necessity of self-preservation on the part of the State; but it is self-preservation against intrusion, encroachment, and trespass. And it is literally impossible for the State to exercise this preservation against the moral delinquencies which inhere in the individuals who compose the State. More than this, it is wholly impossible for the State to exercise this prerogative even against the civil delinquencies of those who compose the State if those delinquencies located a majority of the people. In such cases it is simply the endeavor of each man to compel himself by a law to do what he will not do.

All this is but the statement in other words of the familiar observation that laws, to be of any force, or of any whatever, must be emanated by public sentiment. If public character does not maintain the law, then that law is nothing more than a legal form, and the more laws that are made under such circumstances, the worse it is for all. There is a true doctrine of the right of the self-preservation of this State, but this doctrine set forth by Mr. Crafts in his plan for Sunday laws, and by others upon other subjects, is just as false as it well can be.

THE SENTINEL has constantly charged that this Sunday-law movement is a religious movement, and not of the reasons on which we have given, for so charging, is that the prime movers, the orges, sers, and the real workers in it every way are totally or entirely religious, led by preachers. This charge, and the entire reason made of the charge, has been made against the movement by none of those who support it. Mr. Crafts attempts to answer it, the following manner:

> In this as in the jurisdiction of Sunday laws always, be honest the point entirely. The object of ministers and religious people in establishing such institutions as these is entirely benevolent, and we wish them God-speed everywhere. But of them some ministers and religious people who have established these institutions should now start a movement to get other men to secure the State governments, or the national Government, or both, to protect those institutions from destruction, and to support them by public force; to enact such rules as public laws, we should change, and the charge would be just, that that was a move of the religious movement to get the State enlisted in the interests of religious and their institutions.

Let the religious people and the preachers establish the observance of Sunday or whatever other church days they please, and just as strictly as they please. Let them do so of themselves and keep it confined to themselves, without any call upon the State Government, or the national Government, to support or enforce it, and THE SENTINEL will never have a word to say against them or their movements. If they had done so, there would never have been THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. But as it is, we do charge, and the charge is just, and fully sustained by proofs, that the Sunday-law movement carried on as it is, by religious people, led by preachers, is wholly a religious movement to secure the control of the civil power, to enforce upon all the observance of their own peculiar religious institution.

Again, Mr. Crafts puts himself in a box, by the following words.

> God gave families each both labor and rest. To take away either one is a made robbery of him as it is to take on the Sabbath. The man who in the name of God or in the name of country six days doth take their labor, or he of the top of trees, breaking the fourth commandment as surely as he who does not rest, and he too, on the rest day.

Now in this, "The Sabbath, the day of rest," Mr. Crafts says of those people who observe the seventh day and work on Sunday, "The man who in the name of God," yet toward those who desire to keep a Saturday Sabbath is no evidence rather than a need for a day of enforcement. Infinitely it has been done by religious people, led by preachers, it is wholly to be the insignificantly small minority of law-observing people to rest on Saturday, the law that the fourth day is "the Sabbath."

By this it is evident that there was still in the Crafts foundation, for we reason to Sunday-law makers performed, he could compel those whom he "could" not keep Sunday; and thereby gratify their adopting for commandeered. He says doth take their labor." Therefore by his own words it is demonstrated that he proposes by his system of Sunday laws to compel people to labor on the day that God set apart and claims to be the fourth commandment of God; and that he would do it if he had the power. "Self-preservation" and enforced lording go well together.

There is another point in this too. Sup- [59] pose a man does voluntarily break the fourth commandment, what has the State to do with that, if it is true that the State has nothing to do with religious questions and morals? The fourth commandment is wholly religious. The institutions guaranteed by that commandment is religious only. Then as certainly as any State attempt to take cognizance of the actions of any man with reference to that commandment, so certainly does that State assume to deal with religious questions.

This is also shown again by Mr. Crafts's own words in the article under consideration. He proposes Sunday and enforced observance as the day enjoined by the commandment. It is true, that is not the day enjoined by the commandment; but that is neither here nor there as far as this particular argument is concerned. He argues that it is, and we here simply answer his argument as it is given. He then counts the fifty-two Sundays as fifty-two "sacred" rests, and "in his Sunday-school also," each his Sabbath rest. While a man draws a parallel between the act of Bel-shazzar polluting the sacred vessels of the house of God, and the action of every one irreverent in desecrating these "fifty-two sacred" rests he would call "Sabbaths."

"Yes," says he, is rather the weekly sentiment as to which we keep in memory the God of our fathers. And that is how he would have the civil Sabbath observed, and all this enforced and supported by the Government.  A. T. J.
