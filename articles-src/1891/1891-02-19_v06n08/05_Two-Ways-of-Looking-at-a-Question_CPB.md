CHARLES BRADLAUGH, the English atheist, who obtained considerable notoriety and not a little sympathy because of being excluded for years from Parliament on account of his faith, is dead. A few days before his death, the House of Commons expunged from the records of that body, the resolution of expulsion. Commenting upon this fact, the Baptist Examiner of this city, says:—

By almost unanimous action of that body, the resolution has been expunged from the records, on the ground that the House of Commons had exceeded its jurisdiction. That body possesses autocratic power in such matters, there being no appeal from its decisions except, as in this case, to appeal from a House drunk with passion and prejudice, to a House that has had time to get sober. Nevertheless, it clearly exceeded its theoretic powers, in excluding from its membership a man legally chosen to represent them by the voters of Northampton. The contest was like that of Wilkes, who was elected again and again to a Parliament that refused to admit him to his seat. In the end the will of the people must prevail in such a contest.

Of Mr. Bradlaugh's character, the same paper says:—

In all his dealings with men he was actuated by a high sense of honor and integrity; if he was unjust to any one it was to himself and to that God which he studiously ignored.

That is one view of the matter. Another is presented by the Christian Statesman. Of the reasons for expunging from the record of the House the resolution of expulsion, the Statesman says:—

These reasons are sound and good in themselves but not applicable in such a case. It is no excess of jurisdiction for a national Legislature to exclude from its membership one who denies the being of God and holds no allegiance to that higher law which, more than any written Constitution, is fundamental to the State. If an earthly government will not admit to seats in its Legislature those who refuse allegiance to its own authority, how can it welcome those who deny and refuse the corporate allegiance which the State owes to the King of kings?

We quote these two opinions merely to show the contrast between the spirit of genuine Christianity, and the spirit of Christianity perverted by National Reform theories. The Examiner is one of the first Baptist papers of the land; it cannot be suspected of any sympathy whatever with atheism, but it is not yet drunken with the wine of the wrath of the churches' fornication committed by unholy alliance with the civil power. The Christian Statesman is thus drunken; that is the difference between these two papers; one believes in doing as it would be done by, the other holds that atheists have no rights which Christians are bound to respect; the one would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel, the other would grant to every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, all the rights and privileges of citizenship without regard to his religious belief or non-belief.

We abhor atheism, but we are glad that the English sense of justice has again risen superior to religious bigotry and intolerance, and discomfited it. Atheism fatten upon injustice on the part of those who bear the Christian name, but loses much of its venom under the benign reign of the Golden Rule.
