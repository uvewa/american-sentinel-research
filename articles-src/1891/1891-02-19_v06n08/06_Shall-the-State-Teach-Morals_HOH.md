To the Editor: I find myself in such hearty agreement with THE SENTINEL on so many important questions, that I am almost sorry I am compelled to dissent on the question of morals in our public schools.

What I would like to say in this brief closing paper, I will put into the most condensed form consistent with clearness. I shall not reply to THE SENTINEL's detail of criticism, but gather up the issue into a common focus and write to that.

Shall the State teach morals? THE SENTINEL says, "No;" your correspondent says, "Yes." The reason THE SENTINEL gives in support of its "No," is—

Morals must have a sanction; therefore, to teach morals is not only to teach rules governing actions but to teach also the reasons for those rules.

Granted. But is not the function of teaching indissolubly joined to reason-giving and to pointing out the practical value of what is taught? Must the State refuse to teach natural science because some pupil might ask after the authority for material laws? And were the pupil to ask—Who made chlorine and sodium? and who made the law that their union must produce common salt? must the teacher put her finger to her lips and be silent? To teach anything, connects God with it as the source of its life and ministry. Therefore, to exclude morals from our public schools on the ground that God is connected with them as the author of their gracious value, would exclude everything else, and even ourselves, from the school room.

Neither God nor morals, the common property of all men, should be excluded from our schools. But dogmatic theology and all forms, or hints, of sectarianism should be excluded. There is no necessary value in dogmatic opinions, but there is a necessary value to morals and to character builded on them.

Besides, does not THE SENTINEL really join in what we mean by moral when it says, "The most we can do is to insist upon correct deportment," in our public schools? *Correct* deportment is nothing more nor less than conduct fashioned after the best ideal common to all. It is not the product, necessarily, of dogmatic theology, but of that which is above all sects or forms of religion—God and man.

And perhaps our opinion on this subject might be strengthened by a clear and reasonable definition of *State*. We should not look upon the State as "something outside of ourselves" to reign and rule over us, but as ourselves mutually united to secure mutual benefits. The powers that made the State, as commonly defined, can unmake it. And if the human family, especially in a republic, desire that the highest values known to themselves, be taught to their children in their common schools—the idea of God and the necessities for morals—have they no right to govern their own affairs? They confess one to another that opinions of God and theology are, while helpful, not of first importance. But God and morals are of first importance. Upon this ground they all unite.

If we dare not breathe the name of God in the school-room for fear of teaching religion or morals, if when asked by the hungry mind of pupils after authority for *all* truth and *all* good, our teachers are to say nothing, then, for one, I am willing to abandon all such systems of public non-instruction.

In conclusion, I must insist upon believing that a brain so usually clear and a heart so warm and true as think and beat in the sanctum of THE SENTINEL, will come to see the school question as touching morals therein, in a different light.
