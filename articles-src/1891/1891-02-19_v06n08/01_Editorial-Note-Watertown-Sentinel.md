It is evident that civil government cannot, if it would, enforce morality on a moral basis. It takes cognizance of overt actions only. It cannot sway the convictions; it cannot reform the conscience; it cannot renew the heart. If it attempts to coerce the conscience, it usurps authority which belongs alone to God, the supreme moral Governor.

In its attempts to do so, it may persecute, it may make a class of its citizens act the part of hypocrites, but it cannot reach the heart on matters of morality, and much less on those of religion.
