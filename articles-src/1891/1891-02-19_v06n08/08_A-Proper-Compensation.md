Two Harvard youths, making a polemic tour in the Scottish Highlands, were in the habit of stopping at a small inn, and asking for milk, the charge for which was invariably a penny a glass. Calling one Sunday at a romantic-looking cottage, to holiday in Senits, they were partly received by the cottager's wife; and though the milk was accepted, the proffered twopence was refused, with solemn admonition as to the impropriety of such doings on such a day. The travelers were turning away with a sorrowful word of thanks, when the woman cried with a meaning clear. "Na, na!" she cried, "I'll no' tak' less than tenpence for milk on the Sawbath!"—*Harper's Magazine*.
