THERE appears to be, at the present time, a bewildering current of thought running through our modern democracy, which strikes at the very foundation of liberty. The apparent impotence of the older means of action to restrain irreligion or simply religious indifference, seems to tend to unsettle all fixed principles of government or law. And the impression seems to prevail that the irregularities or deformities of the moral man must needs be corrected by some sort of legislation, and thus the threatened dangers which appear on the horizon of the social and religious world will be averted.

How important that, at such a crisis, the principles which constitute the basis of society be not ignored or done away with! How important that the dangers which threaten liberty should be met without compromising—for the sake of temporary and only apparent success—the principles, without which the greatest nations go to speedy ruin!

The following, which I translate from the French, of Alexander Rudolph Vinet, will, I think, be read with profit in this line of thought, and although only an illustration, will be found deeply suggestive:

It is with the soul enlisted in the life of religion or thought, as with a ship launched upon the waters, and seeking, through the ocean, the shores of a new world. This ocean is society, religious or civil. . . The ocean carries the ship, but the ocean can engulf it, and does sometimes. Society engulfs us more frequently still; but then she carries us, and we cannot land without being carried by her; for she is like the sea, which, not so fluid as the air and not so dense as the earth, yields to us just enough, and resists us just enough, to help on, without hindering, our journey toward its desired end. Our destination is not at the bottom, but at the other side of the sea. While sailing upon these deep waters, let us be careful not to disappear into their depths. Let us be contented to yield the keel of our ship to the element which carries us. It is possible to founder on the ocean of society as well as on the ocean of our globe, and it is useless to say upon which of the two oceans shipwrecks are the more frequent. The ship which every one of us is expected to steer and save is the individuality.

I admire alike the ship and the ocean, man and humanity. No humanity without a man, no man without a humanity. I love to gaze, in turn, upon these two forces, observing the mutual help they give to each other, and also their mutual opposition, which, in a sense, is also a help. . . The ocean is made for the ship, not the ship for the ocean; the essential thing, the ultimate object, is that the ship shall land, that the individual man, the real object of God in his creative work, shall accomplish his destination, by remaining himself in direct connection with God. Society is helping him by carrying him; but he is distinct from society, and cannot be blended with her; and woe unto her as well as unto him, should she happen to engulf him.

The keel which the ship—man—yields to the sea—society—represents the social restrictions brought to bear upon each citizen,—the price paid by him in his contract with society; in other words, his obedience to the legitimate laws of the State, laws which insure personal protection, property, and decency. The swallowing of the entire ship—of man's individuality—illustrates the encroachments of the State on the moral rights of the individual—the fatal obedience of the latter to legislation in matters of conscience and religion.

How much talk there is nowadays about such legislation! and what will become of thousands of beautiful ships on the sea of our modern civilization?
