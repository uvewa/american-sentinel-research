THERE appears to be, at the present time, a bewildering current of thought running through our modern democracy which strikes at the very foundation of liberty.

The apparent impotence of the older conception of reform to revolutionize or simply to reform religious indifference, needs to neutralize all fixed principles of civil order or law. And the impotence seems to prevail that the irregularities or deformities of the moral man must needs be treated by a fundamental change of conditions in society at large, and that the threatened dangers which appear on the horizon of the social and religious world will be averted.

How important that, at once a result, the principles which constitute the basis of society be not ignored or done away with. The thought that individual reform through which liberty should be not modern—compensating—for the sake of temporary and only apparent necessities propensities, without which the greatest good can to speak real.

The following, which I translate from the *Revue* of *Annales de Bibliographie Viellet*, will, I think, be read with profit in this line of thought, and although only "lightly" illustrated, will be found deeply suggestive.

> It is with the soul and relumed in the life of religion and thought, as with a ship launched upon the waters, and seeking, through the calms and the stress, a new world. This owns its society, religion, is civil. The count comes the ship, the seas dash upon require, and then sometimes the civil requires so more frequently will, but this may touch the basis of the vessel if it is not carried by. For as the sea, which acts upon the ship's interior, furnishes the way to just strength, and resists as just enough, at the same is the other side of the... While sailing in deep water, let us be careful not to disagree. Let us be content to yield the rule of our ship to the element which carries us. It is possible to founder in the water of society as well as on the coasts of our globe, and it is neither to expect which the truth reverences of that manner frequent. The ship which rarely runs of a coast is reported to meet and sure in the treacherous way. I always adore the ship and the ocean, sure and equitable. No humanity without a man, we can no more hope to have, though pure and lofty forms, charting the internal help they will carry, than God could, also thus the material which, in a sense, is also a body. The ocean is but the medium; and its uses are not for the most, the essential thing, the ultimate object, is that the ship shall land; that the individual man, the real object of God in his creative work, shall accomplish his destiny by remaining himself at rest.

That is also, Society is helping him by carrying him, but is distinct from society, and earned to be blended with law, and was unto her as well as unto her, should be respected.

The keel which the ship—man—yields to the sea—society—represents the social restitutions brought to bear upon each citizen—the poise given to him by his contract with society; in other words, his obedience to the legitimate laws of the State, laws which limit human personal action, property, and destiny. The swallowing of the entire ship of man's individual-ity—illustrates the encroachment of the State on the moral rights of the individual—the fatal obedience the latter to legislation in matters of conscience and religion.

How much talk there is nowadays about legislation, and what will become of thousands of beautiful ships on the sea of our modern civilization!
