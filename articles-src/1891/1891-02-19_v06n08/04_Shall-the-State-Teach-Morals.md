*To the Editor:* I find myself in much hearty agreement with THE SENTINEL on so many important questions, that I am almost at any conclusion to dissent to on the question of morals in our public schools.

What I would like to say in this brief article paper, I will put into the most condensed form consistent with clearness. I shall not reply to THE SENTINEL's detail suggestions, but let me state my own position clearly and write to this.

Shall the State teach morals? I say it should. "Yes," "Nay" correspondence [60] to the SENTINEL must have a sanction; this question must enter with a contest; it is necessary to touch the reasons on that point.

Granting this. But not on the ground of teaching utilitarianism joined to reasoning and to practical questions. "What?" Must THE SENTINEL refuse to teach morals on the other ground and would take the only ground remaining—civil and moral law? And were the people so to put in, who choose when and after morals and who made the law that their union must produce common self? must the mind produce common self? must the educator put her finger for the best and let all rest? To teach morality, combined, as best in the teaching of the order of life and relation duty. Therefore, to exclude teaching our public schools as to that which is moral is connected with the sense of the moral law, and with some reasonable idea of religion; this it ought to be observed. Coming then with the people in this country who are not church members, and care even ourselves, from the teaching of morals.

Besides, does not THE SENTINEL really tell us in "what he means by moral" when it says "What we must do and to is to insist upon correct deportment," is our public schools? Correct deportment is nothing more or less than conduct fashioned after the best ideal common to all. It is not the product, necessarily, of dogmatic theology, that it is what is allowed to all acts of religion—God and man.

And perhaps our opinion on this subject might be strengthened by a clear and reasonable definition of State. "We should not look upon the State as 'something outside of ourselves' to reign and rule over us, but as certainly mutually suited to secure beneficial results." The powers have shown the the fifty Sundays as fifty-two "sacred" rests. If the human family, especially in a republic, desire that the highest values be taught to their children in their common schools—the idea of God and the necessity for morals—have they no right to enforce this upon all others? They could never do more than establish opinion of God and theology are, while helpful, not of first importance. But God and morals never need first importance. Upon this ground they all agree.

If we dare not breathe the name of God in the presence of the young, nor practice religion or morals, if when asked by the hungry mind of pupils after authority for all truth and all good, our teachers are to say nothing, then, for one, I am willing to consider the whole consideration instructive.

In conclusion, I must insist upon believing that a brain so totally clear and a heart so warm and true as think and best in the searches of THE SENTINEL, will come to see the school-upon-religion-as-teaching morals therein, that is.

H. O. HOFFMAN.

[64] THAT which by object is to not the incidental teaching of morals in the public schools so far as moral principles can be inculcated by proper rules of deportment, language, and by the use in reading books of such stories as that of George Washington and such like, but the establishment by the State of a code of established morals to be taught in all schools as the sum of morality.

As we have before said, morals must and morals can be taught; a sanction, that is, moral precepts must be based upon some acknowledged authority. John Stuart Mill, a typical utilitarian, says: "I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions."

We, in contrast with many others, regard this as the chief and the ultimate appeal on all such questions. We simply deny the right of the State, which is practically to secular, to decide the question.

It is true that the State is only the citizen nationally named to secure certain "blessings," but it does show that the State might rightfully do whatever the individual citizens desire to have done. There are many things, in morals as in other matters, that the right of the few is as high as that of the many, or rather of the individual, minus one, were of our opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in attempting that one person, than, but if it had the power, would be justified in attempting it.

We fully agree with Mr. Mill, in this, and it seems to us, that to every American at least, the proposition ought to be self-evident. It follows that while we believe good morals and good religion to be of the highest value, we deny the right of the majority to force their ideas of morals and religion upon the minority.

THERE are but two standards of morals, namely, the divine, and the human or utilitarian. Every man who advocates the teaching of morals in the schools has in view the standard of morals which he conceives to be the true one. We at first understood our correspondent, whose letter we publish in another column, the teaching of the utilitarian standard of morals. Now, however, if we understand him correctly, he would have taught in public schools, not the morality that is the product of dogmatic theology, "but of that which is above all sorts or forms of religion—God and man." This would involve the teaching of somebody's ideas of God, and consequently the teaching of somebody's religion. We are really unable to perceive any difference between the position of our correspondent and that of the National Reformers, who demand the teaching of Christian morals in the public schools upon the basis of "unsectarian Christianity." The whole discussion simply illustrates the impossibility of a practical agreement, even among Christians, on the subject of what, if anything, should be taught in our schools on the subject of morals. We shall report elsewhere and in a more favorable place of the question more fully than space permits us to do in this paper.
