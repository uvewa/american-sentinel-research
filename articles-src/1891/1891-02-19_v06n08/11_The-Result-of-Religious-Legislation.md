LIKE causes produce like effects. As the result of the "Christianization" of the State by legal enactments in Constantine's time, bishoprics were bought and sold just the same as secular offices were and are now. The richest and most influential men secured the office of bishop, and used that office to increase their wealth and influence. Since religion was regulated by the civil law, the emperor was the natural head of the church; and since he also was the dispenser of patronage, men professed Christianity in order to secure office. The emperor continued to be head of the church until he transferred that dignity to the powerful bishop of Rome, whose assistance he needed in civil matters. Religion was then a matter of policy. And that is just what would happen in this country if religion were upheld by legal enactment.

We care not how pure the motives of some of the advocates of the religious amendment may be, when the proposed amendment is adopted, the results briefly indicated above will follow, just as surely as the night follows the day. And that is the state of things these men, in their blindness, imagine that Christ would sanction.
