"No other State of Our Day, writes of Pennsylvania, says:—

"'In no other State have I found so many 'pockets' that is not the least open to the Sabbath.' Then in no other State has he found as many punishments violating that has which provides that post-offices shall be opened at a pottery every day."

RAVANNA, this State, is moving in the direction of more direct enforcement of the Sunday law. On the 11th a Reading-room was formed at the annual of the Young Men's Christian Association with the pastors of the different churches. Its stated the leaders in the movement are and those who insist not just on Sunday, and who have the least of it, but those who are the most in compelling people to do whether they want to or not. There is a great deal of humming about the whole Sunday rest business.

A RELIGIOUS paper published in a Western State, being grieved that a certain juvenile religious publication in the East had omitted any reference to Christianity.

There are base agents, and the natural tendency under false pretenses, and ready to assist in the various practices that result from being imposed upon, to prevent the latter from being imposed upon, and the purpose that is the right thing for these times to instill into their young and unsuspecting hearts.

Sure enough! why not? And in order to secure it effectually, why not pass a law and such religious instruction shall be given, why not make a law regulating the whole matter, saying what shall give the instruction and what they shall teach? It is what, to be sure, but what they call religion. In short, why not have a State religion in fact, and refuse to tolerate either error or dissent.
