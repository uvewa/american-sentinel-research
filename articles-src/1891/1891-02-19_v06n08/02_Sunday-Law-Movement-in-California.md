An effort of more than ordinary magnitude will be made in the present Legislature to enact a compulsory Sunday law. The American Sabbath Union—an offshoot of the National Reform Association—is at the bottom of the movement, and will leave no means untried to accomplish its end, and that end is the amalgamation of Church and State—an idea altogether foreign to the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees to all the right to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences. To compel people, who do not believe that the first day of the week is the real, genuine, unmistakable Sabbath, to observe that day, is to deprive them of their constitutional right. Is this in accord with the American boast of freedom? Hardly, we think. Though we were brought up to reverence the first-day Sabbath, we do not feel that we have the right to force our belief upon others who hold just as honest convictions to the contrary. We of California need no Sunday law. There is no part of the world where religion and religious worship is more highly respected, or better protected than in California. This is as it should be; it is a creditable feature of our State. But when a religious institution, such as this American Sabbath Union, undertakes to dictate what all classes—the orderly as well as the disorderly—shall do or not do, on any day of the week, it is time to call a halt.
