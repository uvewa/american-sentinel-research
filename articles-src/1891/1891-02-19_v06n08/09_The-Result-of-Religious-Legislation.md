LIKE cause produces like effects, and the result of the "Christianization" of the State by legal enactments in Constantinian times, bishopricks were bought and sold just the same as secular offices are sold in our time. The friends and influential men secured the offices of bishop, and used their office to increase their wealth and influence. Since religion was regulated by the civil law, the emperor was the natural head of the church; and since he was also the chief patron of patronage, yet professed Christianity in order to secure office. The emperor continued to be the head of the church until he transferred that dignity to the powerful bishop of Rome, whose assistance he needed in civil matters. Religion was then a matter of policy. And that is just what would happen in this country if religion were upheld by legal enactments.

One can see how the motives of some of the advocates of the religious amendment may be, when the proposed amendment is adopted, the results briefly indicated above will follow, just as surely as the night follows the day. And that is the state of things these men, in their blindness, are attempting to bring about.—*Watertown (S. D.) Sentinel*.
