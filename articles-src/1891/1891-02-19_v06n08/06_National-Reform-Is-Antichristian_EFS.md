I AM well aware that the title of this article expresses a thought strongly foreign to the readers of THE SENTINEL. It seems to me, however, that in a larger sense than many realize, the whole scheme of national legislation is antichristian. It is directly opposed to the principles and object of the whole plan of redemption, which performs in Christ. In the open problems of disbelief in the plan of redemption, and in God's power to carry out that plan, and so has begun it, to the great commissions.

It is in attitude of fullness man, to patch up what he regards as defective in the infinite and eternal purpose of God. It is an utter failure to recognize the truth of that text which asserts that in moral and figurative matters, "Vengeance is mine I will repay, saith the Lord." Could anything be more blasphemously antichristian?

Did the National Reformers never ask themselves the question how it seems about that in a universe ruled by a God who is all-wise, all-loving, all-powerful for both evil, sin came to exist at all? There is only one answer to this question that interferes with the idea of such a God, who is both omniscient and omnipotent.

Sin is this. God made men—not to do evil, that they might be free to do right, capable of hating, that they might be capable of loving. He had made them absolutely, like every barrel now stands, made to run a certain way, and so a certain work—machines, and not men. They might have been innocent, but they could have given the dignity of a righteous or holy character. Innocence is like a blank book, beautifully bound, it may be, but without a word or mark. The book assumes character day by day, so as it is written in. God would have his world, his reasoning, opening equal with intelligent beings, possessed of righteous characters. There is no conceivable way that this sublime result could be reached, but by giving to each individual the freedom capable of choosing. But to make men that free is in its true role of sin. And a God who infinitely knew his made men thus free, and on such risk, that the sublime result might be attained.

That the angels who people Heaven, finally, greatly beautiful prevail, also have made thus free is now known, for we are informed that part of them sinned; and man was made free in close evil. When the inhabitants of this world sinned, it was God's purpose that they should be redeemed through Christ, and that this redemption should be a means of revealing God's love, the terrible nature of sin, and the beauty of holiness, to all intelligent beings in God's universe. Paul says the grace of God was as given us in Christ before the world was: 2 Tim. 1:9, 10. And that He hath chosen us in Him (Christ) before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, to the praise and glory of his grace.

Furthermore, in the third chapter of Ephesians, it is stated that it is by this sublime object lesson of sin, and in an attempted evil redemption with the revealed love and accompanying joy, felt before the universe, that the principalities and powers in the heavenly host of angels are to come to fully know the wisdom and love of God. Thus God is to arrive at the sublime result of a universe peopled with true intelligent beings, throughout the ages divine, doing right, and truly God's, while they still retain their freedom, because they have freely come to know and love the right, and know and hate the evil.

All this is to be accomplished by making men free, and leaving them free, and they be accompanied in the other way; taking away the freedom of the will of men, binding us with the shackles of set will and labor, and an evil environment, what we deserve on the things that we would. Will the world Paul cries out, "To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not." "For what wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Rom. 7:24. Christ answers, "The Lord hath anointed me... to proclaim liberty to the captives." Isa. 61:1. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me." John 12:32. The Spirit of God, through Christ, draws all men, implicating high and holy ambitions and desires that can be realized only through him. Thus he draws them till their freedom is restored [62] but still it is taken away on the other side, of God compels no man to do right. "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." The philosophy of the whole plan of redemption rests on the freedom of the will. Whoever the lightning out on a fair field and under the eye of the universe, the grand conflict between the opposing forces of right and wrong, has given us the pledge that though it may seem to us that the prince of falsehood and darkness threatens the land of Christ and hinders his work for a time, yet the Prince of Peace and truth shall finally, greatly, beautifully prevail. Gen. ...

As a further pledge, we have the experience of history, which shows that slavery and sorrow wherever and there every fetter cast on a fair field, truth has always conquered. Not every religious law ever passed by men from the days of Adam, down, is denied of its power of truth to conquer, and a refusal to trust it on a fair field against error.

Religious legislation, compulsory religious observation, is therefore a positive offence and declaration that it is the relationship of the law-making authority, God's substance, and the wicked schemes of enforcing Christ a failure. I repeat, could anything be at a flat antichristian?

Now the National Reformers themselves assert that they can impress on the whole plan of redemption in Christ. By taking away the freedom of the will which God gave in the beginning, and which Christ came to restore, and compelling men by man-made law. God alone was and is the self-sufficient moral arbiter. And were the proper so to put, who chooses when and after morals and who made the law that their union must produce common self? must the mind produce common self? must the educator put her finger for the best and let all rest? "To teach morality, combined, as best teaching in the order of life and relation duty." Therefore, to exclude teaching our public schools as to that which is moral is connected with the sense of the moral law, and with some reasonable idea of religion; this it ought to be observed. To will is present with me, and they suppose that if evil were there to be no temptation, and so leave only the good. But, says, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," they purpose to judge also. In this we find a natural parallel to the time of the law. What is the but will setting up their weak finite judgment against the wisdom of God?

This whole scheme allows his "eternal purpose" and as trying to take the government out of his hand. And what a prospect in themselves! Can they do it? This is the Papacy over again, the representation, who opposed, and it shall sit himself alone all that is called God. 2 Thess. 2:4. It is that which was tried to do at the first, and has been trying ever since. Then it is revealed the true nature of the work of the National Reform Association, and the banner under which they are fighting. Of the only way in which an intelligent God could bring his creatures to the status of righteous character, was be making them free, and setting before them good and evil, how much more now must the National Reformers think themselves, when they claim to be able to reach the same end by a shorter and safer method?

By thus supposing their proposed laws embodied the truth, the whole truth, and only the truth, their enforcement could still have but one tendency, and that would be toward learning men to outward cultivation, and away from conscious development of a righteous character. When, as is always the case, those laws are an embodiment of that which is false, that their enforcement is... E. F. STOKES.
