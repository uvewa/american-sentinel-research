THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION now has a State auxiliary in Massachusetts. It was organized in Boston on the 18th ult. The officers are as follows: President, Rev. R. G. Adams; Vice-Presidents, Hon. Rufus S. Frost, Hon. Edward H. Dunn, Mr. Daniel S. Ford, Mr. Robert Gilchrist, Hon. Newton Talbot; Secretary, Rev. George A. Crawford; Treasurer, Mr. Franklin Damon. These gentlemen are supposed to have enough of the "breath of the Puritan" to qualify them for their several offices.
