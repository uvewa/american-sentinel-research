# "Herald of Gospel Liberty."

THIS is the heading of the first religious newspaper published in the world. The paper was published by Elias Smith, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The first number was issued September 1, 1808, with a subscription list of less than two hundred.

A member of Congress said to me not long ago while speaking upon the state of the people in this country as it respects religious liberty he said "the people in this country are as good as, as political matters, but in things of religion neither the masses nor the statesmen as in 1808 truly understood what religious liberty is." This is true; many who appear to know what their rights are, but you can see that they contend for their rights, when they talk or act on religion, they are led by the despot; and are guided wholly by the opinion of designing men, who would take them at the stance of ignorance all their days, and entail the same on all their posterity. The design of this paper is to have [page 78] others who have since stood independently in the contest, against the demands for religious legislation. Very early in its history of this sentiment of our country, is sounded the Columbus, especially those of "New England" in which religion was introduced, the results of such legislation were seen to have to be limited to the lost interests of religion, the Church and the State; hence is Article VI. of the Constitution, and in Article I. of the Amendments, we have the elements as a safeguard against religious intolerance.

No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.—*Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.*

In defining the object of the Constitution, Washington, in a letter to the committee of a Baptist society in Virginia, wrote the following words, August 4, 1789, as follows:—

> If I had the least idea of any difficulty resulting from the Constitution adopted by the convention of which I had the honor of being President of or in any way tending to curtail the privileges of a religion to which I have never been favourable, and then were formed, an error to a voice of that instrument as now stands, I should have been among the first to be concerned by that action, as to be acknowledged that the liberty of consciences will be extinguished, if not I, you be rest that no man would be more willing than myself to revise and to alter that part of it so as to avoid all religious persecution.

You can, without recollection, remember that I have often expressed my opinion that every man that conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshipping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

In 1820, remonstrances for prohibiting the transportation of mails and the opening of post-offices on Sunday, were referred to the Congressional Committee on Post-offices and Postroads. The report of the Committee was unfavorable to the prayer of the petitioners. This report was ordered printed by order of the United States Senate. This position taken, in its reference to religious legislation, is set forth in the following unmistakable language:—

> The Committee look to the state of things for a discussion of power authorizing this body to inquire and determine what part of time, or whether any, has been made holy by the Almighty.

> If Congress should declare the first day of the week holy, it would not convince the few of the propriety of that decision.

> If a solemn act of legislation shall in one point define the law of God, or point out to citizens one religious duty, it may with equal propriety define every part of that revelation and enforce every religious obligation, even to the forms and ceremonies of worship, the establishment and support of the faith of the clergy.

> The framers of the Constitution recognized the eternal principle that man's relation to his God is above human legislation, and his right of conscience cannot, therefore, be a subject of human laws.

Has this clamoring for religious legislation ceased? No; the cry is now more widespread than in the past for the State to unite with the Church by pushing entirely "Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government and its administration, in the contest, against the demands for religious legislation. Very early in its history of this sentiment of our country, is sounded the..."

Whether, *white*, civil or religious, he can respect something more than the game of liberty. Here it has been clearly stated in the language above quoted, that true statesmen recognize the true rights of every one.

But, we will continue. In the fourth paragraph, an instance cited by Mr. Smith referring to the Parliament passing the bill against the wearing of ties and certain kinds of boots and shoes, which was the common practice at that time, that, they did not pass it simply from a civil standpoint and inflict a civil penalty only but viewed it from a religious point of view; from the fact that the wearing of them *defied not civil statute*, and of the people who discovered was *accommodation from the Church*.
