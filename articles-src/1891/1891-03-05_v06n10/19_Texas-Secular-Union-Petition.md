THE SAN ANTONIO (Texas) Secular Union is circulating the following petition for the repeal of the Sunday law of that State:—

> Realizing the pernicious evils that have blemished the history of the nations of the Old World, by the combining of Church and State, and fully appreciating the sublime wisdom of the founders of our Government in their unmistakable condemnation and inhibition of such an evil,

> Therefore, We, the undersigned citizens of Texas, would most respectfully represent that nothing is more obvious than that all Sunday laws contained in our statute books are infringements upon our liberties and natural rights, as defined by our fathers and clearly set forth by them in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States, and we would most respectfully petition your honorable body to repeal all laws requiring the observance of Sunday as a religious institution, or tending to that end.

This is a good deal better than the hot and cold deliverance of the American Secular Union upon the same subject. The fact is that all the Sunday laws now in existence rest upon the religious character of the day, and were it possible to separate from such laws all religious considerations without totally destroying the laws, nobody would care to retain them upon the statute books or to enforce them if so retained. Sunday is nothing, if not religious.
