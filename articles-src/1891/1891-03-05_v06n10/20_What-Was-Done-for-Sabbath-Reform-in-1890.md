IN Our Day, for January, Rev. Mr. Crafts, in telling "what was done for Sabbath reform in 1890," says:—

> The richest contribution of the South to the sheaf of the year is the petition of its great Baptist Convention, its Presbyterian Assembly, its Cumberland Assembly, and of the Episcopal Council of Virginia, asking Congress to forbid Sunday work in the military and mail service, in interstate commerce, and in the District of Columbia and the Territories, which, with the further indorsements of the Lutheran General Synod, the National Council of Congregational Churches, and many other bodies, made an army of two million one hundred thousand representative petitions presented in one day of this year to the present Congress. How strangely unmoved it is by this appeal, like the sound of many waters, for the emancipation of millions from Sunday slavery! Let the petitioning go on. The Breckinridge Bill for a rest day in the capital, asked for by its commissioners, and approved by the President, may be passed in the present Congress if earnestly urged.

And yet many people fondly imagine that the backbone of the national Sunday-law movement is broken, and that little or nothing remains to be done in opposition to it. In this very sense of security, and in the indifference which it begets, lurks the most serious danger of the situation.
