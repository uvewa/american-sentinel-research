The Christian Statesman, of February 5, 1891, has an article on the strength and responsibility of Christian nations, in which is an estimate of the numerical strength of the Protestant sects of the United States, from which is claimed "a decisive majority of the inhabitants of this country who are to be counted Protestant." And besides this numerical strength, Mr. William E. Dodge is quoted as declaring that "seven-eighths of the enormous wealth of this country is in the hands of Christian men." Adding to this "the factor of intelligence, remembering that colleges and seminaries are, with few exceptions, Christian," the following conclusion is drawn:—

> These considerations show that responsibility for the right settlement of public questions rests upon the Christian people of the United States. They have the power in their hands. They have no right to wield it for selfish or for any merely ecclesiastical ends, but in their capacity of citizens they are solemnly bound to settle the liquor question, the school question, the Sabbath question, and all related issues in accordance with the law of God.

To this conclusion I do not object, so far as relates to civil laws for the protection of society. But when the Christian people of the United States shall undertake "to settle the liquor question, the school question, the Sabbath question, and all related issues in accordance with the law of God," they will work in opposition to the plain declarations of our Constitution—the noblest and best ever devised by men,—violate the Golden Rule of Christianity, and assume the prerogatives of the Almighty.

The greatest evils which have ever afflicted humanity have been the result of human powers assuming to define and enforce the law of God. Whenever our secular Constitution shall give place to religious rule, like results will follow, as surely as that human nature remains the same as in past ages.

Of the one hundred and eighty-four sects of Protestants of the United States, who shall decide what the law of God demands?
