THE POWER OF ENGLAND has been invoked to force a Sunday law upon Hong-Kong. Some months since, the British Mercantile Marine Officers formed themselves into an Association, and carried on during the year an active campaign against Sunday labor. They obtained the Chamber of Commerce's promise to co-operate in a voluntary effort to lessen Sunday labor, but the officers were not content with this. They desire a law to be passed enforcing the same provisions as in custom ports, and as the local Government will not move, they have appealed for support from England.
