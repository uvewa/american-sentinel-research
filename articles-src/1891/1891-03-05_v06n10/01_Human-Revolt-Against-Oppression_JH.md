I FIND that human revolt against oppression of all kinds has uniformly resulted in the discomfiture of the oppressors, and in the spreading and strengthening of the cause of the oppressed; and that attempts to deny freedom of speech, and of any action not tending directly and wantonly to the danger of life and property and of innocent persons, have not only failed, but have forwarded the ends they sought to defeat. This lesson has been impressed upon mankind since the dawn of history.
