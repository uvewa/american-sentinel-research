This is the heading of the first religious newspaper published in the world. The paper was published by Elias Smith, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The first number was issued September 1, 1808, and in it the editor says:—

> A member of Congress said to me not long ago (while speaking upon the state of the people in this country as it respects religious liberty) to this amount: "The people in this country are in general free, as to political matters, but in things of religion multitudes of them are apparently ignorant of what liberty is." This is true; many who appear to know what belongs to them as citizens, and who will contend for their rights, when they talk or act upon things of the highest importance, appear to be guided wholly by the opinions of designing men, who would bind them in the chains of ignorance all their days, and entail the same on all their posterity. The design of this paper is to show the liberty which belongs to men, as it respects their duty to God, and each other.

What this editor said was not only applicable to many at that time, but also to many at the present time. Just notice how very many now appear to know what their rights are, but you can see that in all their talk and actions they are led by the leaders of the National Reform Association—by those who would compel them to hold to certain doctrines and observe a certain day under penalty of the law of the land.

Religious papers ought to progress. But we find many so-called religious papers of the present day far behind this first religious paper, in regard to what constitutes true religious liberty.

Mr. Smith, in the same paper, continues on the subject of liberty, as follows:—

> Liberty means a state of freedom, in opposition to slavery or restraint, and may be considered as either natural, civil, or religious.

> The absolute rights of man, considered as a free agent, endowed with discernment to know good from evil, and with power of choosing those measures which appear to him to be most desirable, are usually summed up in one general appellation, and denominated, the natural liberty of mankind. . . .

> Political or civil liberty, which is that of a member of society, is no other than natural liberty, so far restrained by laws (and no further) as is needful and expedient for the general good of the whole. Hence, the law which restrains a man from injuring his fellow-citizen, increases the civil liberty of mankind. Every causeless restraint of the will of a subject, whether done by one or more, is tyranny, and every law concerning things indifferent, is a law destructive of LIBERTY. How many such laws are there to be found in the history of nations? To mention a few may suffice.

> In the ninth and tenth centuries, the greatest princes in Europe wore wooden shoes, with long points to them. The clergy, who ruled, being highly offended, declaimed against the long pointed shoes with great vehemence. . . . At length the Parliament of England interposed by an act, A. D. 1463, prohibiting the use of shoes or boots with pikes exceeding two inches in length, and prohibited all shoemakers from making shoes or boots with longer pikes under severe penalties. This was not sufficient; it was necessary to denounce the dreadful sentence of excommunication against all who wore shoes or boots with points longer than two inches.

> Religious liberty signifies a freedom to believe in God, and to obey him according to the manifestation which he has made to man, in his works, in the Scriptures, and by the spirit of truth, the manifestation of which is given to every man to profit withal.

> Every kind of human law respecting religion, is inconsistent with real religious liberty, and the influence of the magistrate in matters of religion is the same as though they should make laws to bind us to our food, manner of preparing it, how and when it should be eaten, etc. The operations of the mind, are not, can not be, subject to the laws of men, no more than the light of the sun, the rain, wind, or seasons of the year can be under their control.

> Liberty, either civil or religious, has respect to something more than the name of liberty. Real liberty respects the rights of mankind in general, and this subject can not be well understood, unless the rights of men are understood.

You will notice in the fourth paragraph, an instance cited by Mr. Smith referring to the Parliament passing the act against the wearing of the long pointed boots and shoes, which was the common custom at that time, that they did not pass it simply from a civil standpoint and inflict a civil penalty; but they passed it from a religious point of view; from the fact that the wearing of them offended THE CLERGY, and one of the penalties denounced was excommunication from the church.
