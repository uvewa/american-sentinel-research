# Powers of Government Derivation.

The idea is prevalent in America—as it is almost universal in Europe—that the civil government is omnipotent; except as far as the powers have been limited by the people. And this same exception is not admitted by the great "utilitarian" school of statesmanship. Austin, the representative of the whole nation captive, Austin, the systematic of their jurisprudence, specifies thus: "Nor if it follow from this essential difference of a positive law, from the nature and source of the sovereign and independent political society, that the power of a monarch properly so called, or the power of a sovereign number in its collegiate and sovereign capacity, is *in capable of legal limitation.*"—*Lectures on Jurisprudence, London edition, page 279.*

And Hobbes, in his thorough going treatment, sovereignty declares that the right sovereign is omnipotent; except as far as to which—is only another form of stating what Austin says.

Austin, in his lecture, continues: "A monarch or sovereign number of a body legal duty, were subject to a higher or superior sovereignty that is to say, a monarch or sovereign number limited by a legal body were sovereign and not subject of them. Supreme power limited by positive law, is a flat contradiction in terms. If the contradiction or difficulty lies—is not the fact lies—in that only. It is a simple faced on its truth. Positive law set by a "supreme" "is *not* laws omnipotent." All this power exists whether under monarchies. Nevertheless, people take it or fight it. Not all this, and think the sovereignty to be determined is as to observe it exists, its authorities, but because the light gives us nature. "I "We quarrel," says Professor Ellis in his work on *Political Ethics*, an English author, about this question of sovereignty, but take for granted, for substance sovereignty, and without much regard to powers acknowledged by public law where was perhaps not the least distinguished of the writers of the despotism."

But this idea that the sovereignty in the sense of omnipotence or omni-competence exists anywhere, is simply a figment of the imagination.

> "We hold these truths to be *self-evident:* that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are *instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the governed."*

[page 77] are not only limited but are also derivative. Government has no powers whatever, but those delegated by the people. And the people can delegate no powers that they do not possess. Then if, since that government, so far from being absolutely supreme, only has so many powers of the people are pleased to grant it.

Then again, the powers and, of course, we have just noted, as used in the Declaration of Independence of the people, though not delineative, are limited. That powers are limited by the law of nature; no man having a right to infringe upon the rights of others. "All men are created equal," says the Declaration of Independence; are "liberty," and the pursuit of happiness "are among their inalienable rights;—rights that cannot be taken away by any power on earth. The famous Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted three weeks prior to the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, positively declares "that all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity, namely the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety."

These are the inherent and natural rights that cannot be delegated. Then the powers, for example "are" beyond the individual rights or sovereignty, whatever ever vested or however vested. "The sovereignty of every body be, vested in the extravagable by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members the reserved rights of individuals from instances, for example of becoming parties to the original mass of sovereign, whatever or however vested."—*W. Rawlins, Mahon, Volume 1st.*

This idea was decidedly popular with our early statesmen, and occupied a prominent place in our early State documents, it is being asserted and reasserted both in the North and South.

But by this delegation of power was not meant the surrender of rights. In fact, in the former is an assertion of the retention of sovereignty. For whatever a government delegates a minister or ambassador to act for it, by that very act it asserts the authority to set the matter; and the delegation of power is simply an authorization of a person to act for—with less or equal power, with—in no case with more power than that possessed by the delegating power. So in delegating powers to government, the people simply hire agents to do certain work for them, and pay them for such work in taxes. But they do not give up their right. The

former asserts this principle emphatically in a letter to Francis W. Gilmer, dated at Monticello, June 7, 1816.—

> The legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power; that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us.—*Works of Thomas Jefferson, Volume VII, page 5*.

The derivative nature of government, as viewed by our early statesmen is clearly shown in the memorable words of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which asserts the doctrine in these words "that all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people, that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them." Hence, according to the American political system, civil government is simply a public corporation, the officers of which are amenable to the people, just as truly as the officers of other corporations are amenable to the members. They are entrusted with the work of protecting the rights of the people, and whenever they interfere, in any way with a single right of a single person, they are guilty of exceeding their commission and authority, just as truly as is the bank cashier when he embezzles the funds of the banking corporation, and the members of the corporation are no more bound to submit to the injustice and usurpation to one of them than they are in the other. This is the point dwelt upon by Madison when he asserts that the "reserved rights of individuals (foundations, for example) "are" "beyond the legislative reach of sovereignty, whatever vested or however vested." "These, I say, are not only limited but so much beyond the individual rights or sovereignty, whatever or however vested." The delegation of the power would be illegal; it is not being the people to delegate—and therefore the power would be illegal.

But fortunately, in America, this principle asserted and reasserted is positively every Constitution in the land. The rights of the individual—the just ones that he has under the natural law—are recognized and provision is made for their protection in the courts. This is why Sunday laws are unconstitutional. They interfere with the rights of the individual: (1) By injuring his right of religious worship—religious liberty; (1) by interfering with personal liberty; (and) by interfering with liberty to acquiring property; besides flagrantly violating the general principles of our Government. Herein all have equal rights. Neither the Christian nor any other person, legally, has any more rights than any other person; but all are on an equality before the law. Colonel Johnson in his celebrated report to the House of Representatives on the Sunday question notices this very [page 77]

"The Constitution," he says, "regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a military individual than that of a whole community."

What matters the line for the whether or be false, the fact still remains that as before, the organization of government one man did not have the rightful power to make man another to obey the Sabbath, so upon the formation of government no such power could be delegated to it.
