# Human Enforcement of the Law of God.

The school question, the Sabbath question, and all related issues in accordance with the law of God.

To this conclusion I do not object, so far as it relates to civil laws for the protection of society. But when the Christian people of the United States shall undertake "to settle the liquor question, the school question, the Sabbath question, and all related issues in accordance with the law of God," they will work in opposition to the plan distinctly and emphatically in the declaration of the noblest and best ever devised for nation—to enlist the Golden Rule of Christianity, and assume the prerogatives of the Almighty.

The greatest evils which have ever affected humanity have been the result of human power assuming to define and enforce the law of God. Whenever our secular Constitutions shall give place to religious in this, the results will follow, as surely as that human nature remains the same as in past ages.

Can the one hundred and eighty-five million of Protestants of the United States, who shall decide what the law of God demands?

F. Y. CORTINAS.
