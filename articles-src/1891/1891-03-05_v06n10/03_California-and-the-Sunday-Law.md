# California and the Sunday Law.

The following bill has been introduced into the lower house of the Legislature and referred to the Committee on Public Morals:—

> *Proposed an act entitled "an act to provide for a day of rest."*
>
> The people of the State of California, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:—
>
> SECTION 1. Every person who on the first day of the week, commonly known as Sunday, shall keep open any store, shop, grocery, ball alley, billiard or pool room, or other trading or business house, or shall sell or expose for sale, any dry goods, clothing, boots, shoes, hats, or furnishing goods, or groceries, or hardware, or shall employ others to do so, or who shall on said day sell, barter, or give away, or cause to be sold, bartered, or given away, any spiritous, malt, or other intoxicating liquor, or any other article or thing, or shall keep open any drinking saloon, or dance house, tippling house, bar room, or other place of resort, theatrical or otherwise, in or upon any building, vehicle, or vessel where spiritous, malt, or other intoxicating liquors are sold, bartered, or given away, shall be punished for such offense by a fine of not less than twenty dollars, nor more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment; and each sale, barter or gift, shall constitute a separate offense.
>
> SECTION 2. This act shall not apply to druggists, nor to proprietors of hotels, boarding-houses, lodging-houses, or restaurants, nor to butchers, bakers, or persons engaged in the sale of fruit, fresh meats, fresh fish, fresh vegetables, newspapers, or magazines, nor to barbers, nor to persons engaged in necessary household work.
>
> SECTION 3. Those who are members of a religious society, who observe as a Sabbath, any other day in the week than the said first day of the week, shall not be subject to the penalties of this act, so that they observe one day in the seven as herein provided.
>
> SECTION 4. The provisions of the last preceding section shall apply only to those who in good faith, observe another day of the week than Sunday as the Sabbath, and who actually and honestly keep in continued operation, or attempt to keep in continued operation, the store, shop, or business mentioned, on each and every day of the week, except the day actually and in good faith observed as a Sabbath as aforesaid.
>
> SECTION 5. All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with and in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.

Discriminators met this in consultation at Sacramento, February 11, for the purpose of having some influence toward the rejection of the bill, Rev. Edward Thompson, of the American Sabbath Union, Mr. Crafts, a Congregational minister, Mr. Stevenson Porter, of the Westminster Presbyterian Church, Elders M. T. P. [page 75]

Mr. Colby and Mr. Judge Mayhew, all spoke in favor of the bill.

It was opposed by Samuel P. Putnam, of the Liberalist, W. S. Gilton and the writer, on behalf of the Religious Liberty Association. While W. A. Cuddy, and Rev. A. J. Bailey presented their individual objection. I give you the principal points made. It was claimed that because the President of the United States is allowed two days, Sundays excepted, to sign the papers, by Congress, and the Constitution in thus excepting Sundays, provides for Sunday rest, and the President in this way also established a precedent, it holds in the same as law.

Against it was shown that the Constitution makes no provision for Sunday. The President shall on those Sundays, any more than the other ten days, he can sign the papers, or *no election of failing*, his conduct on those is in no way defined; hence there is not a semblance of law in the claim.

It was claimed that the law was needed for the rest and health of the people. In answer to this it was shown that people can work a long time less every day if they get rest at night, hence, there would be more propriety in making a law to compel them to go to bed at a certain hour at night and get up till a first rate time in the morning; before enforce a daily rest than a weekly one as it is more needed.

One speaker held that a Sunday law is for religion; only a civil law. While another advocated Sunday as a Christian institution, and argued that we are a Christian people, and we ought to keep it; and that law is needed to compel us to do so.

Of course it was easy to show that these positions were contradictory, for a Christian institution is certainly religious. It was also shown to be absurd that Christian ideas must be forced, by civil law, to obey Christian institutions; or, by law, by any Christian institution upon anyone else.

It was also shown that Sunday law is not Christian, if they were to one but Christians would have any right to keep Sunday. Suppose a man and woman ask a minister to marry them will he refuse because they are not Christians? Certainly not, for marriage is a civil institution and belongs to those who are now, as well as to those who are, Christians; but if the same could be said for the sacrament or for baptism would be to hold that those are Christian institutions, and only Christians have any right to them. Men can be Christians and not keep Sunday, the expression of those who "conscientiously observe another day, is an admission of that. One of the advocates of the bill says that exemption was placed there from Christian courtesy; that usually churches be exempt from taxation because they are a public benefit. Suppose an exhibitor of works of art, or a publisher of clean, moral and religious books, should make the same claim; or, to go further still, suppose a theatrical manager should produce such plays only as could not be objected to by the most moralistic spirit, where is the line to be drawn in the matter of exempting property from taxation? Recently a private corporation built a bridge across the Kentucky, they demanded that it be exempt from taxation on the ground of its usefulness to the public. Their request was denied. What legitimate business is not a public benefit? Our railroads, telegraphs, etc., are all a public benefit, and the logic applied to churches, if applied to them, would also exempt them. So far from being a benefit to the churches themselves, but while, if adopted, would prove an open door for a union of Church and State, with all its evil consequences that the inevitable result.

Are there no statesmen today wise enough to foresee the evil of such legislation, and staunch enough to defend, as our fathers have done, the Constitution as it now stands?—Yes; it is to be published at our honor that the true statesmen still live, and in almost every State in the Union his influence is still felt sufficiently to protect these principles of right against the encroachments of those who, under religious zeal, lose sight of their observations.

That the Christian religion, through its influence upon the individual, is a benefit to the State, is an undeniable fact; and that all citizens should be protected in the exercise of their religious rights is also beyond question. But let religion not be enforced. "God stands free from the worship of those who worship him, 'in spirit and in truth' of whom it is said, 'He seeketh such to worship him.'" Believers in Christianity and religion, in the interests of good government, as with, James Madison,—"Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. And a connection is injurious to both." And with U. S. Grant we plead, "Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school supported entirely by private contribution. Keep the State and the Church forever separate."—*N. R.*

[page 76] when a civil law is used to enforce any religion we have the most complete union of Church and State. Sunday laws are not civil; they are not just as civil, who is not keep Sunday, as those who, and sometimes they are more so.

The friends of the bill stated that the workingmen were demanding the law. But it was asked, "what labor organization, what laboring class, is asking for the passage of this law?" and they were forced to admit that they could not name any in the State. It was evidently a call from a few ministers and religionists—why the workingmen of the State are not calling for rest, on the contrary, they are loudly calling for work.

The same speaker who advocated the law only as a civil measure, contradicted himself by advocating it as a necessity to compel the "religiously inclined" to go to church, and compel their competitors in business to close their places of business so as not to have any advantage of trade. We hold if this principle be accepted as a true basis of legislation, the Jew, and Seventh-day Adventists, and Baptists are entitled to a law to compel the closing of places of business on Saturday when they want the people to go to church.

One speaker advocated the bill, declaring it was needed to *prevent* religious worship on Sunday. It was shown him that the present law of that State protects religious meetings on *all* days of the week. The extreme penalty for disturbing them is six months in the county jail and a fine of five hundred dollars.

Some of the speakers claimed a Sunday law was necessary to improve the morality and thereby the prosperity of the communities. In reply, the morality of New England, when it had the most stringent Sunday law, was shown to be of the kind that hung those accused of being witches, banished Baptists, beat Quakers, and bored their tongues with red hot irons; and we have no use of such morality. It is also admitted by the advocates of this bill that condition of the cities and small business of the State on Sunday, on account of its many being idle. Hence it is evident that Sunday idleness does not assist in making people civil, to say nothing of making them moral.

It was shown that the law is contrary to the Constitution of the United States, the Fourteenth Amendment declaring that "No State shall make or enforce any law abridging the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United States." All the right guaranteed citizens of the United States, by the United States, must be granted him by each State. The United States guarantees him full liberty in religious matters. Congress enacted the law for govern a citizens of the United States, and the Constitution says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and when any State makes a religious act it is interfering with the rights guaranteed by the United States to its citizens. The Constitution of California forbids legislating in favor of any creed, hence this bill is contrary to the Constitution of the State, for in favors classes making a law holding one day sacred above excepting others.

The following item, from the *Sacramento Bee*, of February 9, will show how good are most of the arguments for the bill, and also demonstrate our claim that Sunday keeping does not make men civil. "Those who do not keep it are more civil than those exist day—"

> During the Sunday-law hearing last night, Judge Carpenter opened the constitutionality of a law that allows privileges to some that it denies to others. The remark stirred up the Rev. Thompson of San Francisco, the American Sabbath man, so intensely that he was aroused at the dense ignorance of a man who was "neither a judge"—who dares to touch such a question.

Now here the answer is anything but ignorant. And in his last man's to refer with, as Thompson was aroused to such a degree as to be so *uncivilized* as to *insult a man* at the close of the consultation. But Thompson is a very fair sample. We have to deal with this kind of people, therefore it is essential, in the fairest, most fraternal way, and begins to talk, at the same time letting them alone to attend to their own business, and let the solder rest on a moment's rest, and stand in equal protection under the law of all.
