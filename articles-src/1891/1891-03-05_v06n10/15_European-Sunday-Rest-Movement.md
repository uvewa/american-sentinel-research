THE labor bill now before the German Reichstag provides for the rigid enforcement of Sunday rest. "The bill forbids," says the Christian Advocate, "Sunday labor in mines, salt-pits, quarries, collieries, founderies, workshops, and factories of all kinds. In Austria a recently enacted ordinance forbids Sunday toil, including that on newspapers, so that printers in Vienna are free on Sunday. Denmark and Holland have taken a step in this direction, and even in Russia petitions demanding that factories and shops be closed on Sunday, bid fair to meet with a successful issue. The question has been taken up in the Federal Parliament of Switzerland, and effective measures securing rest to working people, to some extent, on Sunday, have been adopted. The Review of Reviews has an article on this topic, showing the progress this movement has made within recent years."
