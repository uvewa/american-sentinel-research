PERSONALLY, I am an intense believer in absolute religious liberty. No individual has the right to interfere with the freest exercise of this knowledge on the part of his fellow-men. I have ever stood for "the right of conscience responsible only to God, and beyond control or regulation by any human form." So far as their fellow-men or the State is concerned, Robert Ingersoll has the utmost right to teach his infidelity, and the Unitarians to build their churches and preach their views; and any man who attempts by physical force or legal enactment to prevent them has struck a blow at the liberty of which, as Americans, we are so justly proud. On the other hand, I claim and glory in the right to combat their errors by all the power of my pen and voice. My right I propose to exercise, and would be the last to deny to others what I claim for myself.
