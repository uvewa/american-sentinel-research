The idea is prevalent in America—as it is almost universal in Europe—that the civil government is omnipotent, except in so far as its powers have been limited by the people. And even this exception is not admitted by the great "utilitarian" school of England, whose doctrines have led a whole nation captive. Austin, the systematizer of their jurisprudence, specifically says: "Now it follows from the essential difference of a positive law, and from the nature of the sovereignty and independent political society, that the power of a monarch properly so-called, or the power of a sovereign number in its collegiate and sovereign capacity, is incapable of legal limitation."—Lectures on Jurisprudence, London edition, page 270. And Hobbes, in his treatise on government, sweepingly declares that "no law can be unjust,"—which is only another form of stating what Austin says.

Austin, in his lecture, continues: "A monarch or sovereign number bound by a legal duty, were subject to a higher or superior sovereign: that is to say, a monarch or sovereign number bound by a legal duty were sovereign and not sovereign. Supreme power limited by positive law, is a flat contradiction in terms." But the contradiction or difficulty is—not in the facts—but in the meaning that is attached to the words. "Sovereign" and "supreme" do not mean omnipotent. Absolute power exists nowhere under heaven. Nevertheless, people take it for granted that it does, and think the only question to be determined is as to where it exists, in the monarch, in the Legislature, or in the people? "We quarrel," says Professor Bliss in his work on Sovereignty, "as did our English ancestors, about the location of sovereignty, but take for granted its existence somewhere, and without much regard to powers acknowledged by public law. Hobbes was perhaps the most distinguished of the writers of the despotic school." But this idea that sovereignty, in the sense of omnipotence or absolutism, exists anywhere, is simply a figment of the brain.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights; that among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the governed." Then the powers of government are not only limited but are also derivative. Government has no powers, whatever, but those delegated by the people. And the people can delegate no powers that they do not possess. Then do we see that government, so far from being absolutely supreme, only has so many powers as the people are pleased to grant it.

Then again, the powers (and, of course, we here mean just powers, as used in the Declaration of Independence) of the people, though not derivative, are limited. Their powers are limited by the law of nature—no man having a right to infringe upon the rights of others. "All men are created equal," says the Declaration of Independence; and "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" are among their *inalienable* rights—rights that cannot be taken away by any power on earth. The famous Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted three weeks prior to the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, positively asserted "that all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety." Hence the power to interfere with these rights cannot be delegated. Then the powers of government are reduced to this: Only such powers as the people have a right to delegate, and do actually delegate. Madison, in writing on Sovereignty, makes this very distinction. "The sovereignty of society," says he, "as vested in and exercisable by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members; the reserved rights of individuals (conscience, for example) in becoming parties to the original compact being beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed."—*Writings of James Madison, Volume IV.*, page 422.

This idea was decidedly popular with our early statesmen, and occupied a prominent place in our early State documents, it being asserted and reasserted both in the North and South.

But by this delegation of power was not meant the surrender of rights. In fact, the former is an assertion of the retention of sovereignty. For whenever a government delegates a minister or ambassador to act for it, by that very act it asserts its authority to act in the matter; and the delegation of power is simply an authorization of a person to act for it—with less or equal power,—but in no case with more power than that possessed by the delegating power. So in delegating powers to government, the people simply hire agents to do certain work for them, and pay them for such work in taxes. But they do not give up their rights. Jefferson asserts this principle emphatically in a letter to Francis W. Gilmer, dated at Monticello, June 7, 1816:—

> Our legislators are not sufficiently apprised of the rightful limits of their power, that their true office is to declare and enforce only our natural rights and duties, and to take none of them from us.—*Works of Thomas Jefferson, Volume VII.*, page 3.

The derivative nature of government, as viewed by our early statesmen is clearly expressed in the second section of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which asserts the doctrine in these words "that all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people, that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them." Hence, according to the American political system, civil government is simply a public corporation, the officers of which are amenable to the people, just as truly as the officers of other corporations are amenable to the members. They are entrusted with the work of protecting the rights of the people; and whenever they interfere in any way with a single right of a single person, they are violating their trust and abusing their authority, just as truly as is the bank cashier when he embezzles the funds of the banking corporation; and the members of the corporation are no more bound to submit to the injustice and usurpation in one case than they are in the other. This is the point made by Madison when he asserts that the "reserved rights of individuals (conscience, for example)" are "beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed." There is no possible way for any government to obtain jurisdiction or authority over one's rights. Such jurisdiction would be illegal (illegal according to natural law or justice) even though expressly delegated in the written Constitution itself. For, as Madison says, these rights are "beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed." The delegation of the power would be illegal—it not being the people's to delegate—and therefore the power itself would be illegal.

But fortunately, in America, this principle is asserted and reasserted in probably every Constitution in the land. The rights of the individual—the just claims that he has under the natural law—are recognized and provision is made for their protection in the courts. This is why Sunday laws are unconstitutional. They interfere with the rights of the individual; (1) by interfering with the freedom of worship—religious liberty; (2) by interfering with personal liberty; and (3) by interfering with the right to acquire property; besides flagrantly violating the general principles of our Government. Here all have equal rights. Neither the Christian nor any other person, legally, has any more rights than any other person; but all are on an equality before the law. Colonel Johnson in his celebrated report to the House of Representatives on the Sunday question notices this very point.

"The Constitution," he says, "regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual than that of a whole community."

But whether this be true or whether it be false, the fact still remains that as before the organization of government one man did not have the rightful power to compel another to observe his Sabbath, so upon the formation of government no such power could be delegated.
