THE REV. MINOT J. SAVAGE, is a Protestant clergyman and a well-known writer, of Boston. He said a few days ago: "We talk as though the Catholics had no rights. We say this is a Protestant country. It isn't. Were I a Catholic I would fight to the bitter end before I would submit to have a religion taught in the public schools which I believed would endanger the eternal welfare of my child's soul. The causes which led our forefathers into rebellion were less than this. The cure seems to be simple. It lies in justness and fairness to all."
