As an observer of civil-religious agitation, and not as a secretary, I expect much from the Baptists in the way of a return to that absolute discrimination made by our Lord between the things of God and those of Caesar. The grand but incomplete work done by Baptists in the past in the interest of equal rights to all in matters of conscience, is going on to-day, and promises to go on until all religious questions will be taken from the domain of civil matters. Many Baptists now believe that such a stage has been reached among them.

The James Street Baptist Church, of Toronto, has recently requested that their property be appraised with a view to taxation on an equality with all other property. When, some years ago, a Canadian Baptist college was destroyed by fire, the Government offered to rebuild it, but the offer was respectfully declined. Similar in spirit was the action of the American Baptists when they refused to share in the provisions of the bill passed by a recent Congress, which appropriated public money for the support of denominational schools among the Indians.

The more I become acquainted with the principles of Bible religion, the more I am impressed that much which now receives the sanction of Christian people is unjust and therefore unchristian. Baptists are beginning to see that religious instruction at public expense, and the exemption of church property from taxation are contrary to their professed principles on the question of union of State and Church. They are beginning to see the fallacy and superficiality of the argument that churches should be exempt from taxation because they are a public benefit. Suppose an exhibitor of works of art, or a publisher of clean, moral and religious books, should make the same claim; or, to go further still, suppose a theatrical manager should produce such plays only as could not be objected to by the most precise moralist, where is the line to be drawn in the matter of exempting property from taxation? Recently a private corporation built a bridge over a stream in Kentucky, they demanded that it be exempt from taxation on the ground of its usefulness to the public. Their request was denied. What legitimate business is not a public benefit? Our railroads, telegraphs, etc., are all a public benefit, and the logic applied to churches, if applied to them, would exempt them all. So far from being a benefit to the churches themselves, this exemption works the other way. An immense amount of church property lies idle except for a few hours each week. If this property stood on the same basis with other property in this matter, its owners would strive to make more use of it. More effort would be put forth, more results as a consequence, and as the results increased the finances would, also, and there would be enough to pay all honorable bills. The utility argument in favor of exemption from taxation is as superficial as the resurrection argument in favor of the change of the day of the Sabbath.

The enlightened and candid man will say, "church property is exempted from taxation because it is a relic of the union of Church and State." So, too, is religious instruction in the public schools and the practice of opening school sessions with religious exercises and the reading of the Bible, a relic of the union of Church and State. These practices are unfair and therefore unchristian. Parents because they love their children, ministers because they are paid for so doing, and from the higher motives of consecration, should teach religion. Everybody is taxed to support secular teaching in the public schools and therefore nothing but such instruction should be given there. So long as anybody sanctions religious instruction in such schools, so long as there be an approval of the practice of exempting church property from taxation, and of the thanksgiving proclamations from the President and the Governors of our respective States, many of whom care little or nothing for God, so long there can be no just claim that there is a separation of Church and State, for all these things are relics of such a union.

I look, then, to Baptists with much hope. Not only for a spread of healthy sentiment on these points, but also that they will soon see that all legislation affecting the Sabbath is equally inconsistent with their principles, and when they shall have once seen this, we may justly expect them to go one step further, when they will see that in observing Sunday they have overthrown the Sabbath of Jehovah, and have placed themselves in so palpably inconsistent a position with their fundamental doctrine, a "thus saith the Lord" for everything, that many will feel like reproaching themselves for not having seen it before.
