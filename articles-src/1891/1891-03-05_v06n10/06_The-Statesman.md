# The Statesman.

The true statesman is a man of principle. He may be a man of great ability, and possess great wisdom, but he will not employ either of these to secure the adoption of measures that he knows will destroy any citizen of his rights. As the object of good government is to secure to men their rights, not simply the rights of the strong, but of the weak against the strong, not the rights of the few against the many, but to all, so the purpose of the true statesman, who is the representative of the Government, must be that —the protection of all in the enjoyment of their rights.

The eloquent speeches of Patrick Henry in the interests of American liberty, form but the natural outburst of long-fostered feelings of outraged justice. The Declaration of Independence drawn up and signed by the fathers of our Republic, was but a simple statement of the principles that animated them during the energetic struggles of the Revolutionary War. The Constitution of the United States, and the various State Constitutions, are but, in law, of equal rights for all citizens, and the annunciation that all should have the equal protection of those laws. The work of Benjamin Franklin, as minister plenipotentiary to France, as valuable to the United States Government, was successful because to, its labor, imported, the rights of all men as equal, and sought for equity only in the intercourse of nations affecting the affairs of State; and during the severe conflict for the preservation of the Union after the emancipation proclamation, it is easy to trace the struggle for the strifes, a struggle for the continued establishment, in our national policy, of the principles proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence.

All honor is due to the noble statesmen who, during the contests of the past, were strong to support, to observe, to dissent, and courageous enough to defend, these principles of right of all hazards. Such men enjoy true statesmanship, and the esteem in which they are held by their countrymen is well merited.

The same principle is clearly seen underlying the work of the noble men who formed, and established our national [page 78] liberty which belongs to men, as it respects their true belief, and religion.

What this editor said was not only applicable to many at this time, but also to many at the present time. Just notice how very many now appear to know what their rights are, but you can see this at hall talk and action they are led by the leader of the National Reform Association—to those who would compel them by law to hold to certain doctrines, and observe a certain day under penalty of the law of the land.

Religious papers continue to progress. But we find many avowedly secular religious papers of the present day far behind this first religious paper, in regard to what constitutes a real statesman.

Mr. Smith, in the same paper, continues: "Every country needs a wise statesmen, to follow a course in legislation, as follows:—

> a good statesman, endowed with discernment to know good from evil, virtue from vice, possessing that wisdom which enabled him to distinguish between what should be encouraged and suppressed; a wise man, for wisdom warmed up in our general apprehension all the other qualities. We may add to these those of piety; fear of God, considered as the beginning not of *society*, is not other than material liberty; a statesman who should display the qualities of integrity, humility, abstinence from luxury, and expedient for the general good of the whole community, a statesman in every sense of the word is what a country needs."

Every nation continues to present the will of all, for the equal protection of all.

The first duties were for our Reformation and statesmen in the interests of religious liberty. We present those who have dealt their part in that, the clergy, and what now is, we compare the clergy of to-day, England, and of Reformed England to be set in, with those avowedly irreligious (the Deists) of revolutionary days, in this and in the hands the the lovers of right and human liberty. This was not sufficient; it was necessary to dissent from State religion in this country; and this the real statesmen have done. They go a chapter less than we religious.—

—You talk about your *senses*, and I have very little of yours. You think I am a great politician. I am nothing. My people think I am a statesman. Very little I know of statesman.

Thompson had enough, and saw as he took it; be that is, —I understand there was.—They have and need to, get to fact, of the kind. It is thought that the bill will not become law.
