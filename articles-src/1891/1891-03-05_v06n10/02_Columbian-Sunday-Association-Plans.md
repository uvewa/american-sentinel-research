ONE of the objects of the Columbian Sunday Association is "to arrange for and carry on great mass-meetings on the Sundays during the season of the World's Exposition, to be addressed by distinguished speakers on themes appropriate to the day; chorus singing to be a feature of these meetings." The Association will also endeavor to secure "occasional holidays for all working people—men, women and children—that they may from time to time attend the World's Exposition, and particularly to this end—to make more nearly universal the weekly Saturday half-holiday."
