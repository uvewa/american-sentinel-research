An aged minister in this State writes as follows: "My sympathies are with you in the work in which you are engaged. I am glad to realize that when dangers threaten, God is sure to raise up some to give the warning. Now, while many are zealously laboring to subvert the free institutions of our Government, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has been brought into service to give the warning of the danger that threatens."
