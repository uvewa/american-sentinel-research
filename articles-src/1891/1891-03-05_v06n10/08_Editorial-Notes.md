GOVERNOR Patterson presided at a mass meeting, held in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on the 5th ult., to protest against the Sunday opening of the World's Fair.

---

Of the proposed new and more liberal Sunday law for Pennsylvania, "the Pearl of Days" says: "It lets in the submissions of the question of necessity to the verdict of a jury. There will be special pleading in the professions, and seasonably which would make the substance of a Sabbath law nothing.

It must be a bad cause that is afraid of trial by jury.

As good minister in this State writes us as follows: "My sympathies are entirely in the work to which you are engaged. I need it, study to realize what when others threaten, God is sure to rule you up to some to give this warning. Note, while many are resolutely labored to enforced the free institutions of our Government, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has been their best into service to give the warning of the danger that threatens."

THE American Sabbath Union has now an auxiliary in Massachusetts. It was organized in Boston on the 18th ult. The officers are: President, Hon. R. R. G. Alwood, Vice-Presidents, Hon. S. Smith & Prof. Hook, Edward H. Gilbert, Mr. Daniel S. Ford, Mr. Robert Gilbert, Hon. Newton Talbot, Secretary, Rev. I. Horsier; Cured Secretary, Rev. Franklin Duenn. These gentlemen are supposed to have enough of the "breath of the Puritan" to qualify them for their several offices.

The labor bill now before the German Reichstag provides for the right enforcement of Sunday rest. "The bill forbids, says the *Observer*, ... "all manual labor in mines, salt-works, quarries, coal factories, foundries, workshops, and factories of all kinds. In Austria a recently enacted ordinance forbids Sunday toil, including that on newspapers, so that prints are in Vienna are free on Sunday. Denmark and Holland have taken a step in this direction, and even in Russia petitions demanding that factories and shops be closed on Sunday, did fail to meet with successful issue. The question has been taken up in the Federal Parliament of Switzerland, and effective measures securing rest to working people, to some extent, on Sunday, have been adopted. The *Revue de Reviews* has an article on this topic, showing the progress this movement has made within recent years."

REV. DR. WILLIAM J. R. TAYLOR, Corresponding Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has received his office from New York, to Washington, D. C. The "Pearl of Days" says that he "is a able representative of the national society for the preservation of the Christian Sabbath, the day of rest and worship, he has already received a cordial welcome from its representative residents of Washington."

THE REV. Miner J. Savage, is a Protestant minister and was formerly in Boston. He said a few days ago: "We talk as though the Catholics had no rights. We say this is a Protestant country, the Puritans came here. 'Were I a Catholic I would fight to the bitter end and I would sooner or later have a religious taught in the public schools which I believed to be essential to the eternal welfare of my child's soul. The causes which led our forefathers into rebellion were less than this. The cure seems to be simple. It lies in justification."

The power of England has been invoked to force a Sunday law upon Hong-Kong. Some months since, the British Mercantile Marine Officers formed themselves into an Association, and carried on during the year a vigorous campaign to close the public houses on Sundays, and against labor. They obtained the Chamber of Commerce's promise to co-operate in a voluntary effort to lessen Sunday labor, but the officers were not content with this. They desire a law to be passed enforcing the same provisions as in custom ports, and as the local Government will not act, they have appealed for support from England.

THE SAN ANTONIO (Texas) Seventh-day Adventist is circulating the following petition for the repeal of the Sunday law of that State:—

> Realizing the pernicious evils that have blemished the history of the nations of the Old World, by the combining of Church and State; and fully appreciating the sublime wisdom of the founders of our Government in their unassailable condemnation and inhibition of such an evil.

> Therefore, We, the undersigned citizens of Texas, would most respectfully represent that nothing in our statute books of that State is calculated to more conspicuous than the all Sunday laws contained in our statute books are infringements upon our constitutional rights of free religious worship; as these and clearly set forth by them in the Declaration of Independence and reaffirmed by the Constitution; and we would most respectfully petition your honorable body to repeal all laws requiring the observance of Sunday as a religious institution, as tending to that end.

This is a good deal better than the last taken up in the Federal Parliament of the American Sabbath Union upon the same subject. The fact is that all the Sunday laws now in existence rest upon the religious character of this day, and were it possible to separate from that and all religious considerations without totally destroying the laws, nobody would care to retain them upon the statute books or to enforce them if no religion. Sunday is nothing, if not religious.

IN its *day*, for January, Rev. Mr. Crafts, in telling "what was done for Sabbath reform in 1890," says:—

The richest contribution of the books to the stand was in the petition of the great Baptist Convention, its Presbyterian Assembly, its Cumberland from, and of the Reformed Council of Women, asking Congress to forbid Sunday work in the mails and naval service, in interstate commerce, and in the District of Columbia and the Territories. It was signed by delegates in numerous manner and from General Synod, the National Council of Congregational Churches, and other similar bodies, an array of two million for finished thousand religion's statesmen petitioners, presented to one of the early days of the session of Congress. What a power it is and what is in its appeal, like the sound of many waters: Let the petitioning go on. The Books indicate pages for it and a large envelope and form for its convenience, and supervised and by the Press Committee, may be had free at the office to almost any amount open."

And many people fondly imagine that the backbone of the national Sunday-law movement is broken, and that little or nothing remains to be done in its reported to it. In this very same of security, lies in the indifferences which the bills have struck the most severe danger of this movement.

FEBRUARY 6, the following resolution was offered in the United States Senate and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:—

> Resolved, That the Senate of the United States has heard with deep regret and just indignation, the newspapers in regard to the alleged persecutions of the Jews in Russia, and is of opinion that, consistent with the relations of State prisoners in Russia, and comity of the nations, the President of the United States shall, in the interests of humanity and in the name of the Government, employ its kind offices through its representative at the court of the Emperor of Russia to take measures to inspire the humane treatment of the Hebrew subjects of the Czar, on the part of the native peoples of Russia, and to place them in a condition of political equality with that of other citizens.
