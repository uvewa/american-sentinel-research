Of the proposed new and more liberal Sunday law for Pennsylvania, the "Pearl of Days" says:—

> The snake in this bill is the submission of the question of necessity to the verdict of a jury. Any one can see that this would cause delay and expense and uncertainty, which would make the enforcement of the law almost impossible.

It must be a bad cause that is afraid of trial by jury.
