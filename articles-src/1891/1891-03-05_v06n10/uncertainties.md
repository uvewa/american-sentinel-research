## OCR Quality Notes

1. **Page 1, Line 30** - "C. P. HOLLMAN" appears in the masthead as associate editor. This should likely be "C. P. BOLLMAN" based on known editors for 1891. However, the OCR clearly shows "HOLLMAN". Transcribed as it appears in the OCR.

2. **Page 2, Line 92** - "AN ACT" section contains "ball, beer, cook, or prize fight" - "cook" appears to be an OCR error for "cock" (cock fight), which makes more sense in context and appears correctly later in the document.

3. **Page 3, Line 113** - "Mr. Cubery" mentioned as speaker - name spelling uncertain from OCR.

4. **Page 6, Line 262** - "convice" appears to be OCR error for "convince" in quote.

5. **Page 6, Line 290** - "usual festation" appears to be OCR error for "manifestation" (confirmed by context in line 296 where full word appears).

6. **Page 7, Line 327** - "Adress" appears to be OCR error for "Address".

7. **Page 7, Line 352** - "built" appears to be OCR error for "pulled" in context of pencil pocket.

8. **Page 7, Line 391** - "Unmarks" appears to be OCR error for "Unmasks".

## General Notes

- All advertisements on pages 7-8 were skipped as instructed.
- Page headers and running titles were ignored as instructed.
- The masthead lists "C. P. HOLLMAN" but this is likely an OCR error for "C. P. BOLLMAN" who was the known associate editor in 1891.
