# "What Does the Bible Teach about the Sabbath?"

ONE of the objects of the Columbus Sunday Association is "to arrange for and carry out a proper programme for the Sundays during the season of the World's Exposition." It is to be achieved "by distinguished speakers on themes appropriate for the day; chaste singing in a [form] of those meetings." The Association also endeavors to secure "commendable holidays for all working people, business women and children—that they may from time to time attend the World's Exposition, and particularly to this end—to make more nearly universal the weekly Saturday half holiday."

PERSONALLY, as an American believer in absolute religious liberty. No individual has the right to interfere with the freest exercise of the knowledge of any part of his fellow-men. I have ever stood for "the right of conscience responsible only to God, and beyond control or regulation by any human authority."

In an article in review of his productions on the Sunday-law question, Mr. Crafts inquires, "What does the Bible teach about the Sabbath?" Well, if it is the *only* civil Sabbath that they want enforced by law, what is the difference what the Bible says about the Sabbath? If it is a matter for a body of religions, not a body of religious denominations, of all finding their beginning and their end in Jesus Christ and the salvation which he brought to men. Therefore, this inquiry is but another evidence which demonstrates that the Sunday-law advocates contradict themselves when they say that it is a civil Sabbath law that they want enacted, and that the religious element must not be considered. Nor is this all; not only do they contradict themselves, but they know that they contradict themselves. They know that to make for a civil Sabbath is a fraud.

There is another singular thing about this inquiry. In 1888, the American Sabbath Union was organized. It did its very best in that year and all through 1889, and the greater part of 1890, to have a national law enacted to compel everybody to keep Sunday as the Sabbath, when, lo, in the

*whether or not* Sunday is the Sabbath. One of the vice-presidents of that association, Rev. George S. Mott, D.D., wrote, and the association printed and circulates a tract, entitled, "Saturday or Sunday— Which?" That is, this tract is an inquiry as to whether Saturday or Sunday is the Sabbath? And now Mr. Crafts comes out with an inquiry, "What does the Bible teach about the Sabbath?"

From these facts it appears that this association has gone on its way fully two years, trying to get a national Sunday law enacted to compel everybody to keep Sunday as the Sabbath, and they then find it necessary to set on foot an inquiry as to whether Sunday is the Sabbath or not! It would seem that they should have made this inquiry of some little use before undertaking that other enterprise of going so far. Why do they want to compel men to keep a day as the Sabbath when they themselves are not sure that it is the Sabbath? If it is a matter that is yet open to inquiry that they themselves most needs inquire, does not that show a reasonable doubt upon this question? Does it not imply a doubt, so reasonable, in fact, as to demand of fair and reasonable men that they should pause in their career of compulsory observance of the day, until it shall have been settled, upon a good reasonable doubt that the day is all that is claimed in the proper? Again these facts show that the question is one of inquiry, have not others as much right as the Sunday-law advocates have to push their inquiry, to have their doubts on the inquiry as to which day is the Sabbath, or, "What does the Bible teach about the Sabbath?" should not first their satisfaction that Sunday is not the Sabbath, then have not such persons the right to act according to the conviction reached by inquiry?

Suppose all the people should diligently follow the inquiry thus raised by the American Sabbath Union, and that all of them should become convinced that another day than Sunday is the Sabbath; then suppose this majority should form an association to secure laws both [page 74] State and national, compelling all who now observe Sunday, to observe this other day, would be friendly law workers agree to the propriety of such proceedings? Everybody knows they would not. Therefore, even though the American Sabbath Union should pursue this inquiry and come to the conclusion already decided from Mr. Crafts, go to show that that THE SENTINEL has always and firmly tended—that the Sabbath is religious only. The comparison which became it is so—religious only, and its observance a religious only, therefore, no civil government on earth can ever of right, have anything whatever to do with it. This is further confirmed in the same article now under notice. Mr. Crafts adopts as his, a quotation in which there is this statement:—

> That which expresses religious authority and religious duty. We, in fact, know that Sunday only as it is named by a religious day.

This week is terminated and marked only by the Sabbath. That day, accordingly, must have its right more beyond other consideration, is a "religious day." It is the church mark, therefore, of religious authority and religious loyalty. And when the American Sabbath Union or anybody else endeavors to enforce the observance of that day by law, they thereby endeavor to enforce the observance of a religious day, to compel the recognition of a religious institution, and the acknowledgment of a religious loyalty. This is further confirmed, in the same article now under notice. When Mr. Crafts makes his own another quotation in which there is argued the impracticability if not the impossibility of enforcing a rest day as anything else than a religious institution. The quotation reads as follows:—

> "I have already stated my conviction that the question whether a weekly holiday could be maintained on a *purely secular basis* is a grave one. There would certainly be seen in England and in this country unmistakable evidence on established grounds of public experience, wholly apart from religious considerations, a legal holiday on a *broader* basis than the present Sunday. But it would, of course, be necessary *to ascertain how far public sentiment would be ready to press for those benefits* if it was entirely independent of the idea of *religious obligation*—a presumably indisposable mind be compelled to decide whether it was a holiday worth having. I have proposed it in absolutely neutral terms so that it would be rejected opposed by two classes—by those who would oppose any compulsory rest, and by those who would oppose a holiday *without its religious character.*"

The Bible names the Sabbath, first, as God's rest, then, as man's day.

The Bible does, first and partly false. It is true that the Bible presents the Sabbath, first, and last, of all times as God's day. Sabbath means rest; God's resting day means rest day. The rest which made the day the rest day, was God's rest. The rest day, therefore, can never by any possibility be anything else than God's rest day. It can never come to be a fact that God rested. He himself can not change that fact. Therefore, the Sabbath, the rest day, can never be other than what it is—God's rest day. The Bible all the way through calls it God's day. The fourth commandment calls it "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Over and over again he calls it "my Sabbath." In Isa. 58:13 he calls it, "my holy day;" and the "holy of the Lord." And in the last mention of it in the Bible he calls it the "Lord's day." The Sabbath therefore is the Lord's, and not man's. As it can never be to be God's day, it can never become man's day. It is true, that the Sabbath, the rest, was made for man. But it was made for him to use *as the Lord's*, never as his own. It was made for man to use in the worship of the Creator, and as Mr. Crafts himself says,—

> We are to rest *as God* did, not in *idleness*, but in resting from work among *vegetables* and animals to the *rest of the soul in man*.

All these statements, even to this one, from Mr. Crafts, go to show that that THE SENTINEL has always and firmly tended—that the Sabbath is religious only. The comparison which became it is so—religious only, and its observance a religious only, therefore, no civil government on earth can ever of right, have anything whatever to do with it. This is further confirmed in the same article now under notice. Mr. Crafts adopts as his, a quotation in which there is this statement:—

> That which expresses religious authority and religious duty. We, in fact, know that Sunday only as it is named by a religious day.

Sabbath named religiously, that is sanctioned directly by religion and sustained by the conditions of physical, mental and moral need and welfare.

This is exactly what THE SENTINEL has always argued, and so far, this is what Mr. Crafts finds the Bible teaches about the Sabbath. We shall say more on this same subject next week, but for the present we shall close with the observation that when he is confronted with his own evidence, these men will say that the Sabbath is civil, and that it is only a civil observance that they would enforce by law. Could anything possibly be more *incongruous or more repugnant to sincerity*; and any will whom we say plainly that it is not only inconsistent, it is dishonest, it is not civil, and that they know that their making for a "civil" Sabbath is a fraud.
