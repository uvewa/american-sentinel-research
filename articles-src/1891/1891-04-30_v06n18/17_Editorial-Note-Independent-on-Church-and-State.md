IN an editorial on the late Dr. Spear, one of the editors of the Independent, who has lately died, occurs this paragraph:—

Here also occurred his account of the Federal Judiciary; and of even more interest to the lay unish, his thorough discussion of the relation of religion to the State. This volume is the best exponent of the doctrine, which was earnestly his and ours, that Church and State should be absolutely separated, that church property should be taxed, and that the Bible should not be required to be read in this public schools.

Yet, notwithstanding this clear expression of policy from the Independent, the following tacit indorsement of the enacting and enforcing of religious laws by the State is to be found in the same issue, having reference to the violation of the Sunday laws in New Jersey:—

But encouraged by the recent expression of public sentiment throughout the State, there has been a rising of the people in Camden, and the result is a change for the better on Sunday, and the prospect of a vigorous enforcement of the law.

Can it be that the Independent is blind to the inconsistency between the statement that "Church and State should be absolutely separated," and an expression of satisfaction at the "prospect of a vigorous enforcement of the law" for the observance of a dogma of the Church by the civil power?

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL and the National Religious Liberty Association have not been, and are not, alone in the advocacy of sound principles as to the relation in which human government stands to religion, but how few are willing to carry these principles unswervingly to a consistent conclusion.
