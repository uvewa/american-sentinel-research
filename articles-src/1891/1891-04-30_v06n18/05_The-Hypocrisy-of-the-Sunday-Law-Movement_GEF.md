## The Hypocrisy of the Sunday-Law Movement.

The recent Boston Convention of the American Sabbath Union, seemed to do about the lion's share of its attention to the Sunday newspapers, calling them "damna in disguise," and "devil familiars given a law to suppress their publication. As we have repeatedly been noticed in THE SENTINEL, the Convention seems to be the result of a committee of D. D's. and LL. D's., to petition to the present Legislature for a hearing on the subject of no changing the State Sunday law as to make the publication of Sunday papers unlawful. This with petition was presented to the Legislature, and by that honorable body, was referred to the next Legislature. So it seems this matter has been deferred. The petition for their incredible desire for speech-making before the Legislature of Massachusetts immediately gratified. Meanwhile, how ever, they are kept busy, as elsewhere, but the old themselves place or plan and Sunday, and no suspicion is that their purpose on Sunday before the people that they do not in any way favored religious of law, first must be doing service, to get other attention.

It is an old and true saying that you never know a man or a woman till you see them at home, and become familiar with their home life. "If you want to know what a people are, go to them." All this is a true of societies and organizations of men as of individuals. The convenience hypocrisy, and stamps of

the-like running, of this whole Sunday-law movement is never fully realized till those people are visited in their own conventions, and the real nature and plans for desisting these Sunday laws, are compared with the false and hypocritical reasons given to the public. Before the public it is continually declared that the movement is in the interests of "liberty." That the poor and weary toiler is compelled to labor seven days in the week, and his rights of rest must be granted him by law.

It has been to forget that every Sunday law always was and always must be a direct infringement on human liberty, by compelling all to rest even against their will and need. They magnify the importance of Sunday rest until one is reminded of the old cry, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." It would seem more in the logic of that all our outform civilization, the public school system, the Declaration of Independence and all, had grown directly out of Sunday keeping. In fact, you would think the Lord had had only one commandment his matter as well as they do in, instead of the ten; and that the seven days, he would simply have made Sunday and Sunday laws, and they would have worked everything else that had is good. Having thus erected of their rite eloquence and ingenuity to magnify the civil benefit of Sunday, they unite in crying for "civil Sunday laws." All of this before the public.

Now visit them at their own conventions and they throw all their pretenses of civil law support from the public, but to talk among themselves why they want the law, how the law, and how best they may get their laws, and what how best they may get them. How quickly the laboring-man the man of the cause of liberty, the civil institution are forgot! The most Massachusetts Convention is a fair sample of this. Not a single reference is made to any of these civil things, nor to anything they give more for desiring and demanding Sunday laws, especially laws to prevent the publication of the Sunday papers. It is that the mealy toiler is thereby compelled to work in the rest day? No, for it is well known that the men do not choose to work in preference on Saturday. Is it that these papers threaten any of our civil institutions? No. There is one institution, and one only, that it is claimed they threaten, and that is the modern Church. Because the churches can not stand the competition of the Sunday paper, the churches must be "protected" by law, and the Sunday papers suppressed. Every single reason given for such laws is a religious and not a civil one.

Hear them. Mr. Lewis R. Dunn, New England Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, says:

The Sunday paper is a demon in disguise. Supposing that you know, the Bible way to expel the demons, is to expel, to exercise them in the name of the Lord, and not in the name of Darwin. Paul denounced in no

But why is the Sunday press "a demon in disguise"? "The very words would plainly

We think this proposition of the Rev. Gentleman, has gone very evidently too far. That is to say the church cannot exist without the Sunday press, the proposition is true; but is a true, it conveys and always was, for the real, true Church of Christ, shall it be able to exist approved by the civil law of. The Sunday-law logic justifies all the moral legislation and all the persecutions this side of the inquisition, and would repeal

organizations are, coward, but they have more at their command.

This is equivalent to saying that no minister who depends for this place and upon his popularity with the people, and that what minister does not, Methodist as well as others, it can dare to benefit the people by elevating them above their present way of thinking and acting, but must confine his efforts to simply trying to please them where they are. "Try not to aim to elevate but only to please." This is precisely one of the reasons why the state Convention declares that the Sunday paper should be discontinued by law. Should the Sunday sermon be discontinued for the same reason, and the minister silenced? It almost seems as though, if we would only stand back and give these Sunday-law ministers time enough and rope enough, they would hang themselves. It would not be surprising however if they new under the it they did. Religious laws often react upon those who made them.

Before this Convention closed, it passed three resolutions declaring the religious origin and nature of the Sabbath, and that true religion that was transferred by Christ and the apostles to Sunday, and pledging themselves to resist all attempts to divert said Sunday, as a day of rest and worship, to the sacredness of the divine Sabbath Union, where is by to by itself alone do not think that the Sabbath is a "civil institution," and it does not intend to preserve simply our "civil American Sabbath;" and it thinks very little about either the cause of liberty, or about the poor overworked laboring man, but only about the interests of the Church, and the power of the clergy, and yet the same people among the Government, are busy before the public with the old civil-Sunday-law plea. Not at all this peculiar to the Massachusetts American Sabbath Union; it is a true and fair sample for the Union's understand method of working everywhere.

As has often been shown, their method of obtaining petitions is unfair and decep. They not for tax "present petition from being compiled in labor on Sunday," and under cover of units such an appeal as this plan, they try to set a law to compel all to cease laboring on sabbath day, whether wish to or not. As in the case of the Breckinridge bill, before the people they desire to make it appear of that the law is not upon the District of Virginia, but against Christians; that when by themselves, they admit that the reason, they want the law is not for the District of Columbia at all, but that the United States may thereby establish a precedent for a national Sunday law. Every gentleman and lady of Christian knew truth and fair right and do not have to employ such methods of advancement. It is the real political doctrine that "the end justifies the

Connected with the movement, there are undoubtedly many honest people, whose eyes are blinded; but the best that can be said of the movement, as a whole, is that it is full of insincerity and hypocrisy.
