WE have received from the publishers, Sweet & Sturdy, Brattleboro, Massachusetts, a copy of "Right and Wrong," by Willian A. Sturdy. The book contains 404 pages, six by nine inches, is well printed, and is neatly bound in cloth, with gold letters. We are not informed as to the price, but that can be learned by writing to the publishers.

"Right and Wrong" relates to "literal ethics and a popular form of government," "showing," the title page says, "the defective character of 'Webster's Dictionary,' with its influence upon the disturbances between the ruling class and the common laborer." At first thought, it seems a little unkind on the part of the author of this book to attempt to demolish an old and recognized authority in the English language, just as it has been thoroughly revised at great expense to the publishers; however, "truth is mighty," and if, in the light of Mr. Sturdy's book, a discriminating public shall decide that a particular dictionary does not contain the maximum of truth, as dictionaries go, why, so much the worse for that dictionary. But inasmuch as we have a new Webster's, we shall not decide hastily to discard it. That is to say, compositors and office boys permitting, we shall still follow Webster as closely as possible in the mazes of, it must be confessed, a somewhat perplexing orthography and orthology.
