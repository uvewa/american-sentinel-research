THE Baptist Examiner says:—

The total abolition of Sunday travel is not to be hoped for. Especially in the neighborhood of our great cities, facilities of transit are needed on Sunday as on the other days of the week. It is, however, generally admitted that the volume of Sunday travel could be sensibly reduced without serious inconvenience to the public and injury to business.

Certainly "the volume of Sunday travel could be sensibly reduced," and in a very sensible way, namely, by the voluntary action of those who profess a religious regard for Sunday; if all such would cease to travel on that day, the volume of travel would, indeed, be sensibly reduced. This would be not only sensible, but honest, and according to the Golden Rule, in which respect it differs radically from the "civil" Sunday law method.
