CHICAGO has organized a Columbian Sunday Association, with an Executive Committee of eighteen members for the purpose of bringing sufficient influence to bear upon the management of the World's Fair to secure its closing on Sunday, and for the exploiting to the world of the "American Sunday." A number of committees and sub-committees have been appointed and their work systematically laid out.

The following are the published objects of the Association:—

1. To prevent by every practicable means the calamity to our country and the injustice to the fifty thousand or more employes of the Columbian Fair and related industries, by opening the Exposition on Sunday.

2. To distribute literature showing the advantage that has come to America from the observance of the American Sunday, this literature to be printed in all languages, and to be especially distributed during the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.

3. To arrange for and carry on great mass meetings on the Sundays during the season of the World's Exposition, to be addressed by distinguished speakers on themes appropriate to the day, chorus singing to be a feature of this meeting.

4. To assist in securing occasional holidays for all working people—men, women, and children—that they may, from time to time, attend the World's Exposition, and particularly to this end, to make more nearly universal the weekly Saturday half-holiday.

The Columbian Sunday Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Chicago Ministerial Committee have joined in the publication of an address to the country at large, setting forth the dangers to the Nation, which, in their opinion, will result from the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, and calling for an organized demonstration from all classes, directed to the National Commission and the Chicago Directory.
