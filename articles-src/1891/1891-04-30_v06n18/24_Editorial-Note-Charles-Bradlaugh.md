It is said that it was the intolerance and bigotry of his rector that drove Charles Bradlaugh into atheism. Young Bradlaugh, who was particularly bright "found some difficulties in the Thirty-nine Articles, which did not seem to him in accord with the New Testament. His rector was a man totally deficient in tact, and on learning of the boy's state of mind, treated his incipient skepticism as a proof of depravity, and scolded him furiously. Young Bradlaugh, with the hasty logic of youth, concluded that Christians could not answer by argument objections made to their faith, and soon became a complete disbeliever in Christianity or any other form of religion." A more Christian course would probably have saved to the cause of Christianity a man of rare talents. This is simply another illustration of the fact that those who attempt to do Christian work by non-Christian methods only mar the work of God and destroy souls.
