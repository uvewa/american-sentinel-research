"A SHAMELESS Surrender," and "Eternal Vigilance Needed," are the headlines of editorial articles, in the Mail and Express and the Christian Advocate, on the Freedom of Worship bill which has passed the Assembly of this State, by a vote of eighty-seven to eighteen.

In the words of the Mail and Express, "The bill applies to all incorporated and unincorporated reformatory societies securing State and municipal moneys. It forcibly opens these institutions to the sectarian services of all sects and denominations." The question is further characterized in the same editorial as an "ugly sectarian controversy," and the prophecy made that "if this measure becomes a law, resistance to sectarian and ecclesiastical aggressions upon our civil and religious liberties will be forced into politics, and somebody will get hurt." In the closing paragraphs, the sword of the political headsman is freely waved and the Republican members of the Legislature called upon to note the keenness of its edge. "Free American sentiment is an element to be considered by men seeking the suffrages of the people, as novel as this statement may appear to those who can hear more easily whispers from the Tiber than thunders from the Hudson. The Republican Senate must defeat this measure. Any Republican senator whose political future is not all behind him had better not say 'yes' on the roll-call, if this iniquitous foreign-born and unnaturalized bill ever gets out of committee and is put upon its passage."

The Advocate declares that "the passage of this bill will raise a religious issue," and warns us that "the Roman Catholics are working with tact and vigor" to secure the passage of this measure. The Mail and Express also tells us "these bills were skillfully drawn, under the direction and with the approval of Archbishop Corrigan, and they are consequently in the interest solely of the Roman Catholic hierarchy." And upon this the writer is evidently beset with a vision of the dragon of the twelfth chapter of Revelation, for he cries out in terror, "and the horrible visage of the oft-defeated monster, which has for years been clutching at the throat of unfortunate childhood, and striking at the vitals of Christian benevolence, in our unsectarian institutions, emerges from the dark chamber of the Assembly Committee on Revision, under the leadership of Mr. Blumenthal."

The Observer also devotes almost two columns to this same subject, beginning with the question, "Do the Protestant people of this State realize that the old jesuitically framed and named 'Freedom of Worship' bill has passed the Assembly by a vote of eighty-seven to eighteen?" Extended statistics are quoted to show that by far the greater proportion of prisoners, prostitutes, and rumsellers are Roman Catholics, thus showing "the practical folly of yielding to the demand of that religious institution which furnishes the least evidence of being entitled to special denominational recognition."

The fact in regard to this bill is that the unprejudiced mind will fail to find in it a shadow of favoritism or partiality toward any creed or denomination. The reason why the Roman Catholics father the measure evidently is because they find themselves only tolerated in public institutions, and not on an equal footing with the denominations which constitute the "national Christianity" of the United States.

The Christian Advocate says, "priests can be admitted. There has never been any trouble on the subject of religion at the House of Refuge, on Randall's Island, except with the Jesuits. Priests can go there now. . . . The Roman Catholic priests are allowed to visit the children, converse with them, teach them, confess them, visit them in sickness, and bury them when dead." Notice the language, "can be admitted," "can go there," "are allowed to visit." The situation is evidently one of toleration not of equality.

The whole question resolves itself into a contest between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Protestantism has now the superior place and influence in public institutions, and to yield equal place to Roman Catholicism would be, in the minds of those who hold that this is a Protestant Christian Nation, "A Shameless Surrender."

In a sentence intended to describe the Roman Catholic position, the Observer unwittingly characterizes the Protestant bigotry which this discussion has unexpectedly uncovered. The expression is this: "It is absolutely nothing but the old arrogance that despises anything religious that does not include its own ecclesiasticism."

What right has the Legislature of the State of New York to say that any form of worship shall not be accorded a perfect equality with every other form of worship, either in penal institutions or in any other place within its jurisdiction? And if it be true that any creed or form of worship arrogantly assumes to itself to be the national Christianity and only tolerates any other creed or form without acknowledging its equality, why-may not the Legislature say authoritatively that no such distinction or discrimination shall be made in public institutions?

This discussion is but another loud-voiced witness to the supreme error of permitting ecclesiasticism to have any influence whatever in the control of civil institutions.
