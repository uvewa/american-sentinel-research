Liberty and freedom should be understood, by all alike. To the American people, it means liberty of action, freedom of thought restricted only by a conscientious determination to do right, to be liberal and honorable.—*American Standard.*

---

The Ohio Senate has passed the Schultz bill which provides that the question of closing the midway of Cincinnati on Sunday, shall be submitted to popular vote. If such measures as this humanity will be deceived into giving adherence to Sunday law under the delusion that they are voting for temperance and civil order.

---

Popular education, the education given at public expense, by and in accordance with the provisions of law, is a part of the Government, and should in the essential particulars of which we write, be entirely in harmony with it. Neither prayers, conferences, nor sentiments of majorities have any proper place in the public school room.—*Independent Patriot, Lamoni, Iowa.*

In an article in W. C. Crafts' Sunday-law paper, the *Pearl of Days*, we find these sentences:—

Said Sabbath laws, though timidly enforced at first, could be doubled in vigor in less than a single instance. I think laws even weakened. The courts have held in Maryland that playing baseball, as a money-making show, violates the statute. . . . It would hardly be denied that the Sunday opening of a barber-shop is not a work of necessity or mercy. Presidential Speaking at the National Base Ball League, has forbidden Sunday games for 1891. . . . . . . Our next battle will be then closed in Los Angeles, and the contagion of its courage has secured the same result all over Southern California. As a result of sermons, literature, and organization, the Sunday opening of the post-office has been discontinued in some places. Sunday newspapers, have, in at least one instance, been suppressed by law, and in another by public opinion.

Mr. Crafts recommends a wholesale petitioning for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, suggesting that eight copies of each petition be prepared in duplicate, to be sent to both houses of the next Congress, to the Columbian commission, to both the commissioners and both the alternates of the State where the action, taken, and to the World's Fair directory.

[page 142]

The Star-Messenger, of this city, has been closed for violation of the Sunday law, and the information is published that the license; responsibly, for no other reason is on Sunday.

---

Slight agitation of the question of the Sunday opening of museums in this city, has called forth from the *New York Presbytery*, and the New York East Conference, both of which have recently been in session, sets of resolutions protesting against any such action on the part of the authorities.

---

Rev. W. F. Crafts has published his appointments for the next three months as follows: May I, Cresco, Iowa; May 3-5, Dubuque; May 6, May 8, Waverly, Lawes; May 10, Marshalltown, Iowa; June 17-19, Fremont, Chambersburg, Nebr., July 17, Winona, Chattanooga, Wis.; August 1, Western Pennsylvania.

The trial of the Right Reverend Dime Museum proprietor, indicted for opening his museum on Sunday, has been twice postponed upon the court declining upon itself to speak thus disastrously upon the case. The real reason for postponement ought to be made public. Do the authorities propose to be kind of it? The matter is in the hands of the District of New York the hands of Assistant

*Resolved,* That we deplore the fact that our city, is either respect and to observe the Sabbath better than many, east or west, still falls below Pittsburg or New York, or Chicago, in allowing the snail hawking of newspapers upon the Sabbath to the detriment of home life and Sabbath worship and we still call upon our public officers to suppress this affront to Christian sentiment and fines that this.

*Resolved,* That we assure our public officers whose every duty it is to prevent and punish the opening of saloons and other infraction of our Ioannina Sabbath law, that we will heartily support them in enforcing it, and we earnestly request our Mayor to publish the Sabbath law of this State, and let no violator may plead ignorance of its provisions etc.

The permanence which is given to the idea of "a law" is worthy of note, as well as the peculiar and significant juxtaposition of the expression "Christian sentiment and State law." Steadily, by gradual conveyance, the prejudiced mind is being conveyed that to affront religious "sentiment" is an infraction of the civil law which "public officers must be called upon to punish.

Mr. Crafts' late injunction to the faithful National Reformers is noteworthy. Referring to the April week of prayer, he says:—

The world's week of prayer for the Sabbath should be a week of practice as well as prayer, of embodying the law we have as well as pressing for better ones. They pity best who are honest between papers or working with God in the enforcement.

A more true expression of the idea contained in this paragraph would be "I pray and prosecute."

In the Bible codes from Berlin, of April 18, is to found this following apply:—

> The Kaiser is much annoyed by the disrespect shown to his wishes above by a number of cavalry officers attending the Harrah Society's races on last Sunday. The Emperor's brother-in-law, Duke Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein, who was among the delinquents, received the full measure of the imperial resentment, he had and reminding me the language in which it was conveyed that the Emperor had into the event to protest her holders, the other day, to the Empress' circle of chosen friends. The Duke and his partners at polo might feel that they have brought to their attention a social ban and in other respects treated as prisoners.

Certainly the National Reform politicians are making rapid progress when crowned heads enforce Sunday observance upon members of their own family by military discipline.

In an editorial on the late Dr. Spaer, one of the editors of the *Independent*, who has lately died, records this impress paragraph:

Firm also-oratored his account of the Federal Judiciary; and of even more interest to the layman, his thorough discussion of the relation of religion to the State. This volume is the best account of the doctrine, was unanimously adopted, and is not, that Church and State should be absolutely separated; that church property should be read in the public schools.

Yet, notwithstanding this clear expression of policy from the *Independent*, the following tact independent of the standing and enforcing of religious law by the State is to be found in the same issue, having reference to the violation of the Sunday law in New Jersey.—

But encouraged by the recent expression of its sentiments throughout the State, there has been a rising of the people in Camden, and the result is a change for the better in morals, and the prospect is encouraging.

Can it be that the *Independent* is blind to the inconsistency between the statement that "Church and State should be absolutely separated," and an expression of satisfaction at the "prospect of a vigorous enforcement of the law" for the observance of a digest of the Church by the civil power?

The American Sentinel and the National Religious Liberty Association have not been, and are not, alone in the advocacy of sound principles; but so is the clothing in which human government stands to religion, but how far we are willing to carry these principles universally to a consistent, logical conclusion.

Chicago has organized its Columbian Sunday Association, with an Executive Committee of eighteen members for the purpose of bringing of sufficient influence to bear upon the management of the World's Fair the exploiting to the world of the "American Sunday." A number of contributors and subscribers offered to be appointed and their work systematically laid out to the convention.

All of the following are the published objects of the Association:—

1. To prevent for every practicable and just effort the opening to the public on Sunday of the Columbian Exposition of 1892 to the exclusion of those employed or more employees of the Columbian Exposition and of related industries, by the operation the public on Sunday.

2. To enable those having the advantage that has come to America from the observance of the Christian Sunday, this themselves to be printed in all languages, and to be especially forcible during the World's Columbian Exposition of all American respect to differs from others.

3. To arrange for said carry out from said Sunday religious Exposition, a series of Sabbath services, to be addressed by distinguished speakers on the interests of the Christian Sabbath.

4. To assist in securing eventual legislation for the purpose of the day. It is as open does see from of this that no civil uses is mentioned concerning this day, that the Sunday law advocates do not mean that they shall not in benefit an benefit not only to

All these are the Doctor's reasons and the first of the law is to suppress the publication of the Sunday paper, and all these are religious and not civil reasons. But they to be reminded, however, that this is not the real reason why the American Sabbath Union, of Massachusetts, petitions for stricter Sunday laws. The reasons given to the public are only the sham reasons, and in their vast contrast with these real reasons the church work of the Union with this brand of counterfeit hypocrisy.

In this same Convention, on the same day, Joseph Cook said:

> The Methodist pastors, who are appointed by the bishops, and do not owe their positions to their admiration in the Sunday papers. I fear that such action would assault any Congregational minister in the coming summer.

---

The Columbian Sunday Sabbath Union, and the Chicago Ministerial Committee have joined the idea. Its professions of advocates to the country at large, settling forth the dangers to the Nation, which, in their opinion, will result from the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, and called for an organized denomination, from all of whom disgruntled to the national Commission and Columbian government or authorities.

---

That Methodist ministers of Cincinnati, have memorialized the Mayor in regard to the suppression of baseball in that city on the coming summer.

[page 144]

The *Independent* has obtained the views of prominent Roman Catholic and Protestant archbishops and bishops upon the question of opening the World's Fair upon Sunday. Of course a large majority of the Protestant prelates are opposed to Sunday opening; while, of twenty-two Roman ecclesiastics furnished would admit the public to the Fair on Sunday, only in the afternoon. Out of twenty-five Episcopalians, twelve were for Sunday opening. Of the Methodist bishops only one, a colored man, favors Sunday opening.

A writer in the *Daily Herald*, of St. Joseph, Missouri, says, "The progress made in the antisatanic and refinement of the nations since the heyday of the Puritan Sunday, would hardly place in the hands of Mr. Crafts and his associates such dangerous tools as gibbets and stakes to enforce their decrees, but the bait-trap of Sunday legislation still on our statute books gives them the convenience and facilities of mallets, jails, and policemen's clubs." Yet Mr. Crafts and his disciples will use those means theire is little doubt —provided the people at large choose to permit it.

---

An observer of the seventh day, in Texas, writes to the organs of the denomination: *The Dryer and Herald*, that he has never been served with the privilege to observe on Sunday. Mr. Crafts actually said as much as this in regard to the persecutions in Tennessee, where Sabbatarians have died of fevers contracted in prison. If, and moreover a man should be hanged for Sunday work even the President of the Sabbath Union, who has thus far remained silent, might be provoked to say that a county jail and typhoid fever would have been a more respectable means of

We are glad to note the following in an account in the *Sabbath Recorder* of a Ministerial conference:—

> The paper on "Sabbath keeping Women and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union," by A. H. Lewis, we here a large but neat; that when all the women were not consistently belong to the Union, there was not consistently belonging to an organization whose expressed purpose is the Union, which was not consistently belonging to the Recorder. Other means were produced which were of interest and matters of all we based these.

We are glad to see, too, that because we are opposed to the original object of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, but because the Union has largely lost sight of that object, and has espoused so-called National Reform. That which affiliation with National Reform can be called only in name.

It is said that it was the indiscretion and selfishness of the more noted Protestant Bradlaughs into atheism. Young Bradlaugh, who was particularly bright "found material difficulties in the Thirty-nine Articles, which did not seem to him in accord with the New Testament. His rector was a man totally deficient in fact, and on learning the boy's state of mind, instead of meeting his difficulties with, used his insipient skepticism as a proof of incorrigibility, and had him expelled from the Sunday-school. Young Bradlaugh, with the hasty logic of youth, concluded that Christians could not answer by argument's objections made against to their faith, and soon became a complete disbeliever in Christianity or any other form of religion." A close Catholic course would probably have saved to the cause of Christianity a man of rare talents. The case well illustrates the important fact that those who attempt to do Christian work by so-called Christian methods only mar the work of God and destroy souls.

We have received from the publishers, Sweet & Sturdy, Brattleboro, Massachusetts, a copy of "Right and Wrong," by William A. Sturdy. The book contains six pages, six by nine inches, is well printed, and is neatly bound in cloth, with gold letters. We are not informed as to its price, but that can be learned by writing to the publishers.

"Right and Wrong" relates to "liberal ideas and a popular form of government," "showing," the title page says, "the definite character of *Webster's History*,

with," its influence upon the distinctness between the ruling class and the common laborer." At first thought, it seems a little unkind on the part of the author of this book to attempt to demolish an old and recognized authority in the English language, just as it has been thoroughly revised at great expense to the publishers; however, "truth is mighty," and if, in the light of Mr. Sturdy's book, a discriminating public shall decide that a particular dictionary does not contain the masterwork of truth, and therefore, one, why, so much the worse for that dictionary. But inasmuch as we have a new Webster, we shall not decide hastily to discard it. That is to say, composition and grammar is to say, composition, and we shall follow Webster as closely as possible in the names it, if not in composition, as a standard for parsing orthography and orthopy.

*The Baptist Examiner* says:—

> The practical abolition of Sunday travel is one of the most needed reforms to-day. In most of our great cities, facilities of transit are needed on Sunday, perhaps, but the volume of Sunday travel could be sensibly reduced without serious inconvenience to the public and in large to the travelers themselves.

Certainly the "volume of Sunday travel could be sensibly reduced," and in a very sensible way, namely, by the voluntary action of those who profess a religious regard for Sunday; if all such would cease to travel on that day, the volume of travel would, indeed, be sensibly reduced. This would be not only sensible, but honest, and, according to the Golden Rule, in "actual respect to differ from others."

It is very strange, indeed, that in this day of progress and general enlightenment, any persons, or sets of persons, should be so narrow-minded as to set forth and teach doctrines and principles that characterized the Dark Ages. To compel people to do a thing on the first day of the week, and in which they do not believe, is lost one form of tyranny. Is this in sympathy with the American basis of free Government? We think not. Although we are firm Seventh-day believers and keep the first day of the week, we feel it wrong for us to force our views upon those who might not agree with us, on a religious point of view, or holding to contrary convictions.
