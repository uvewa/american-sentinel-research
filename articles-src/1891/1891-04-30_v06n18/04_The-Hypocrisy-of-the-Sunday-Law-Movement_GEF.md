THE recent Boston Convention of the American Sabbath Union, seemed to devote the lion's share of its attention to the Sunday newspapers, calling them "demons in disguise," and loudly demanding a law to suppress their publication. As has already been noticed in THE SENTINEL, the Convention resulted in the appointment of a committee of D. D's. and LL. D's., to petition the present Legislature for a hearing on the subject of so changing the State Sunday laws as to make the publication of Sunday papers unlawful. This petition was presented to the Legislature, and by that honorable body, was referred to the next Legislature. So it seems that these clerical gentlemen will not have their inordinate desire for speech-making before the Legislature of Massachusetts immediately gratified. Meanwhile, however, they are busy here, as elsewhere, with the old threadbare plea for a civil Sunday, and are emphatic in their declarations before the public that they do not in any way favor religious laws, but only ask the enforcement of the "civic day."

It is an old and true saying that you never know a man or a woman till you see them at home, and become familiar with their home life. "If you want to really know a fox, trace him to his den." All this is as true of societies and organizations of men as of individuals. The consummate hypocrisy, and attempt at fox-like cunning, of the whole Sunday-law movement is never fully realized till these people are visited in their own conventions, and the real reasons there given for desiring these Sunday laws, are compared with the false and hypocritical reasons given to the public. Before the public it is continually declared that the movement is in the interests of "liberty." That the poor and weary toiler is compelled to labor seven days in the week, and his right to rest must be granted him by law.

They seem to forget that every Sunday law always was and always must be a direct infringement on human liberty, by compelling all to rest even against their will and need. They magnify the importance of Sunday rest till one is reminded of the old cry, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" It would seem from their logic (?) that all our glorious civilization, the public school system, the Declaration of Independence, and all, had grown directly out of Sunday keeping. In fact, one would think if the Lord had only understood the matter as well as they do, instead of making the world in six days, he would simply have made Sunday and Sunday laws, and they would have worked everything else that is good. Having thus exerted all their eloquence and ingenuity to magnify the civil benefit of Sunday, they unite in crying for "civil Sunday laws." All this before the public.

Now visit them at their own conventions where their object is not to gain Sunday-law support from the public, but to talk over among themselves why they want these laws, and how best they may get them. How quickly the laboring man, and the cause of liberty, and the civil Sunday are all forgotten! The recent Massachusetts Convention is a fair sample of this. Not a single reference is made to any of these things. Let us see what reasons they give here for desiring and demanding Sunday laws, especially laws to prevent the publication of the Sunday papers. Is it that the weary toiler is thereby compelled to work on the rest day? No, for it is well known that the work on the Sunday papers is mostly done on Saturday. Is it that these papers threaten any of our civil institutions? No. There is one institution, and one only, that it is claimed they threaten, and that is the modern Church. Because the churches can not stand the competition of the Sunday paper, the churches must be "protected" by law, and the Sunday papers suppressed. Every single reason given for such laws is a religious and not a civil reason.

Hear them. Mr. Lewis R. Dunn, New England Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, says:—

The Sunday press is a demon in disguise.

Supposing that were so, the Bible way to expel the demons, is to exorcise them in the name of the Lord, and not in the name of Caesar. Paul recommends us to prepare for the conflict with Satan by putting on the whole armor of God, not of the State, and by taking the sword of the Spirit, not of the civil power. That is the way Christian conquered Apollyon, but it seems the Church has wandered far from the good old way.

But why is the Sunday press "a demon in disguise"? The very next words plainly tell:—

The young are absenting themselves from church on the Sabbath, and if the best interests of the community are to be conserved, these must be turned.

When THE SENTINEL has declared that the real object of such laws was to induce people to attend church, and that if they failed, the logical tendency of all such legislation was to culminate in compulsory church attendance, many have said it was an exaggeration, and the American Sabbath Union has always been the first to sneeringly deny it. But here it is in plain words from their own lips, "These must be turned." The young stay at home to read the paper, so the papers must be stopped by law. They go off on excursions, so the Sunday trains must be stopped by law. If that fails there must be some other law devised to head them off and drive them into the church, for in some way, "these must be turned."

Rev. Dr. Chadbourne, in this same Convention, said:—

The Sunday paper is the foe of the Church and the Sunday school.

We think this proposition needs to be proven, but they evidently believe it is true. Supposing it is true; so is all sin, everywhere and always, the foe of the true Church of Christ. Shall it all be suppressed by the civil law? This Sunday-law logic justifies all the religious legislation and all the persecution the world has ever seen, and would repeat them.

Again, Rev. Dr. Chadbourne says:—

The Sunday paper is a secular intrusion upon sacred time. It is an open and defiant violation of the purpose of the day. It is an open door for every secular enterprise, for it has no especial rights. It does not aspire to benefit and elevate but only to please.

All these are the Doctor's reasons for asking for laws to suppress the publication of the Sunday paper, and all these are religious and not civil reasons. Let it be remembered, however, that they are the real reasons why the American Sabbath Union, of Massachusetts, petitions for stricter Sunday laws. The reasons given the public are only the sham reasons, and in their vast contrast with these they stamp the whole work of the Union with the brand of consummate hypocrisy.

In the same Convention, on the same day, Joseph Cook said:—

The Methodist pastors, who are appointed by the bishops, and do not owe their positions to their congregations, might arraign church members for advertising in the Sunday papers, but I fear such action would unseat any Congregational minister in the State. . . . I am not disposed to say Congregationalists are cowards, but they have more at risk.

This is equivalent to saying that no minister who depends for his place and salary upon his popularity with the people, (and what minister does not, Methodist as well as others?) can dare aim to benefit the people by elevating them above their present way of thinking and acting, but must confine his efforts to simply trying to please them where they are. "They do not aim to elevate but only to please." This is precisely one of the reasons why the same Convention declared that the Sunday paper should be discontinued by law. Should the Sunday sermon also be discontinued for the same reason, and the minister silenced? It actually seems as though, if we would only stand back and give these Sunday-law ministers time enough and rope enough, they would hang themselves. It would not be anything new under the sun if they did. Religious laws often react upon those who clamor for them.

Before this Convention closed, it passed three resolutions declaring the religious origin and nature of the Sabbath, and that that religious nature was transferred by Christ and the apostles to Sunday, and pledging themselves to resist all attempts to divest said Sunday, as a day of rest and worship, of the sacredness of the divine law. So it seems that the American Sabbath Union, when it is by itself alone, does not think that the Sabbath is a "civil institution," and it does not intend to preserve simply our "civil American Sabbath," and it thinks very little about either the cause of liberty, or about the poor over-worked laboring man, but only about the interests of the Church, and the power of the clergy. And yet these same people since the Convention, are busy before the public with the old civil-Sunday-law plea. Nor is all this peculiar to the Massachusetts American Sabbath Union; it is a true and fair setting forth of the Union's underhand method of working wherever it operates.

As has often been shown, their method of obtaining petitions is unfair and deceptive. They ask for laws to "prevent people from being compelled to labor on Sunday," and under cover of such a specious plea, they try to get a law to compel all to cease laboring on Sunday whether they wish to or not. As in the case of the Breckinridge bill, before the people they try to make it appear that if the law is not passed the District of Columbia will relapse into barbarism; but when by themselves, they admit that the reason they want the law is not for the District of Columbia at all, but that the United States may thereby establish a precedent for a national Sunday law. Every gentleman and every Christian knows that truth and right do not have to employ such methods of advancement. It is the old jesuitical doctrine that "the end justifies the means."

Connected with this movement, there are undoubtedly many honest people, whose eyes are blinded; but the best that can be said of the movement, as a whole, is that it is full of insincerity and hypocrisy.
