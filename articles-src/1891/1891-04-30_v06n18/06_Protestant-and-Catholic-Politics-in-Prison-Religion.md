## Protestant and Catholic Politics in Prison Religion.

A "Stakeholder Sentimentalist" and "Eliot Vigliance Needle," are the headings of editorial articles, in the *Mail and Express* and the *Christian Advocate*, on the Freedom of Worship bill which has passed the Assembly of this State, by a vote of eighteen.

In the words of the *Mail and Express*, The bill applies to all incorporated and unsectprotected reformatory society according State prisons and municipal money. In forcibly opens these institutions to the ministers, priests "of all denominations." This question is further characterized in the same editorial as on "sly sectary controversy" and the property made that "if this measure becomes a law, pastoral, workmanship in sectarian and reclusion a gross petition upon our civil and religious liberties will be forced upon politics, and somebody will get hurt." In the using paragraph, the event of the passing has tended to freely invest the civil and Republican members of the Legislature table upon to the hostesses of the edge. "Free American sentiment is as unable to be condemned by merely seeking the suffrage of the people, as a novel to the statement supposed to 'prove' to those who bear more nearly whispers from the Tiber thunderers from the Hudson. The Republican Senate need offer this resistance. Any Republican senator whose higher future at all behind him had better not say 'yes' on the roll-call, if this bill unpatriotic foreign born and naturalised bill ever gets out of committee and is put upon its passage."

The *Advocate* declares that "the passage of this bill will raise a religious issue," and "whenever this bill gets Roman Catholics working with it but and vigor" we active the passage of this measure.

The *Mail and Express* sets life in "these bills were distilling favors, under the direction and with the approval of Archbishop Corrigan, and they are consequentially in the interest solely of the Roman Catholic hierarchy." And open this the writer is evidently beat with a vision of the dragon of the twelfth chapter of Revelations, for he cries out in terror, "and the horrible visage of the oft-defeated monster, which has for years been clutching at its throat civil civilization of God, and striking at the vitals of Christian benevolence, its or our unerecting institution, emerges from the dark chamber of the Assembly Committee on Revision, under the leadership of Mr. Blumenthal."

The *Observer* also divides almost two

columns to this same subject, legislating with the question. "Are the Protestant people of this State, realize that the old practically framed and named 'a degree of Worship' bill has passed the Assembly by a vote of eighty-seven to eighteen?" Extended statistics are offered to show it, that by far the greatest proportions of prisons, penitentiary, and remedied in Roman Catholics, this showing "the presenting of sufficiently to justling to the demand that religious institutions which furnished the least evidence of being the efficient of special denominational recognition."

The fact in regard to this bill is all in the unprejudiced mind will fail to find is a shadow of favoritism or partiality toward any one denomination. The only reason why the Roman Catholic fathers has measure evidently is because they have themselves only believed in public their themselves. It is not an equal footing the demonstration which constitute infidelity national Christianity of the United States.

The *Christian Advocate* says, "priests can not be abolished. There has never been any restriction in on the subject of religion of the House of Reform, on Randall's Island, except with the in Justice. Priests can go there now. . . . The only Catholics of real concern are allowed to to visit the children with them, from their words, tools, confess them, teach them the Catholic catechism. And then whom." Notice the language, to us admitted. "Has go to," "are permitted," allowed to visit." "That is equality, a deadly one of toleration of equally. This The whole proceeding involves much of the relation between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Restoration has in not these, state and influences in public in influence, and its yield equal place to Roman Catholicism would we, in the in minds of those who hold that Roman of the Christian Nation." A "shamering of this"

Is it an mission intended to discredit the Roman Catholic position, the Observer ownership characterizes the Protestant disposition by which this measure has been respectfully inconsistent, that this impression is "This" is absolutely nothing but an open to stand and action arising. . . .

What right has the Legislature of the State of New York to determine what church of worship not succeeded is a perfect right to worship with any other classes, or to worship, either in penal institutions or in any other exclusively created with a voice to prisons their are penitential." And if, and if it be true that any creed or form of Christianity, is to equally with others before the national Christendom and only tolerate any other creed or form of religious belief.

As a matter of irrefutable notoriety, its equally the Legislature, to establish and the Legislature will authoritatively said that to such distinctions or discrimination shall in the public institutionally...

The other legislation, and the one so, viewed witness to the expressions error of sectional ecclesiastical to have any influence whatever in the control of civil institutions.
