THE trial of the Eighth Avenue Dime Museum proprietor, indicted for opening his museum on Sunday, has been twice postponed. The "Pearl of Days" takes upon itself to speak thus dictatorially upon the case: "The reason for postponement ought to be made public. Do the authorities propose to let him off? The matter is in the hands of Assistant District Attorney McIntyre."
