PUBLIC education, the education given at public expense, by and in accordance with the provisions of law, is a part of the Government, and should in the essential particular of which we write, be entirely in harmony with it. Neither the forms, ordinances, nor sentiments of any religion have any proper place in the public school room.—Independent Patriot, Lamoni, Iowa.
