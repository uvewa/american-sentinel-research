## On Moral Legislation.

Three-editor of Freethought doesn't like our criticism of his statement that "if religion is a good and beneficial thing, the more places it can be found the better," and that "only people who know that Christianity is a fraud can have sufficient excuse for objecting to the enforcement of religion exercises in public institutions. I submitted that, on its face, this was a plea for a State religion that any Freethinker ought to treat, and ought not to be found anywhere, but the Three-editor replies as follows:—

If religion is a good thing it ought to be encouraged.

I do not understand how any argument against what I did not say can possibly apply to what I actually did say; and the Three-editor of the Sentinel abstraction—not to mine—which is why I treated it, not having in a having-a-subsistence. And I, I did not say that any opinion, belief, should, or practice ought to be enforced. I have not, therefore, believed that it would have a force that, or that the enforcement of State religion, while maintaining that he is guilty of untruth.

The words that he says he put in his were simply the *gist* of what he did actually say, and it was plainly stated as such. Our statement was that in substance he said, "if religion be a good thing it ought to be enforced." And we would like to see anybody show that this is not the substance of what he said. But the ex-editor denies our conclusion, viz., that had he the power he would enforce infidelity, to the extent of putting it wherever the State has power to put it, and we are willing to believe that it would not, and

that he says so plainly. But he will be more careful in his words, and will make more consistent; and above all things he ought, if possible, to make up his mind what he believes, and tell, when he writes to be sure that his words properly express it always; that when they are ready for to do the work of Freethought, of March 1, if they do to its foundations and April of it.

But the ex-editor does not relish the issue of the question, and remands it, and we need to dismiss it further, but adds:

> "I would be glad to hear what he is the editor of THE SENTINEL to say as to the charge that, in favoring moral legislation he is just as great a religious bigot as, and he should be he told the truth about moral legislation.

We this reply that the ex-editor would have said, we great a religious legislation as would be bad the moral which the guided, properly represented his moral legislation for we most certainly discountry the responsibility such as the attributes to us of favoring.

Further we would say, we the ex-editor could certainly understand, that this, and one should not, and never have, favored moral legislation. We have certainly opposed all legislation that is not justifiable in purely civil grounds. We have been specially guarded in this particular, and like no one can point to anything that we have ever written that is to the least not in favor of harmony with this statement. We have constantly maintained that the State has no right to deal with moral questions, and that it can prohibit, only for civil reasons, those things which are crimes, that is, those which, acts as trespass upon the rights of others. Not only so, but we have been criticized from time to time by the religious press for holding these views, and one of this gentlemen, who is evidently guilty of writing with only limited knowledge of his subject, accuses us of doing just the opposite.

The ex-editor says that the claim is made that morals and religion are different, yet, he, but let us say we have not made such a claim. In fact our contention has been, that while morals and religion differ in respect, morals and religion are so closely related that it is impossible to distinguish clearly between them, and that for this reason the State should in round questions of moral just as it is attempted to in its religious questions also, and for the same reason, should relegate them both alike to the domain of the conscience.

But the questions: "If the State may legislate on temperance, education, and morals, why not is belief?" We say it up. If the State may properly legislate on morals do do not see how any could draw the line and say that it should not legislate upon belief. However,

[page 139]

the State does not and cannot properly between moral legislation and legislating upon temperance and education, that is, if by temperance legislation is meant

regulation or prohibition of the liquor traffic, and if by education is meant making provision for the secular instruction of those who are to become members of the body politic.

The State has the right to exist; it has the right to perpetuate its existence; this it can do in a republic only by providing a good degree of intelligence among the people. To this end it seems so to us that it would be proper for the State to provide facilities for the education of its future citizens, though we are not of the extreme who believes that the children are the wards of the State, and that the right of the State is equal to that of the parents.

The principle of the regulation of the liquor traffic is universally admitted; that which the State may properly restrict it may not properly prohibit; and the justice of the restriction of the liquor traffic is maintained by everybody. The man who pays a license to sell liquor thereby admits the right of the State to impose that license, and he likewise admits the right of the State to prohibit the traffic by those who pay no license. He not only admits the right but after paying his own license he demands that the State exercise the right. Why might then has he to find fault should the State the next year refuse to give him license, and prohibit him from engaging in liquor traffic?

But there is another and even better reason to be urged in defence of temperance legislation, viz., the duty of the State to protect the lives and property of the individuals who compose the State, and to do this at the smallest expense consistent with the public safety. The records of our courts and courts also show that threefourths of the crime of the country is caused by the use of the liquor, and a very large per cent of the taxation is due to the same cause; and whatever may be said of the right of the individual to use intoxicating liquors, there can be no question of the right of all the people to prohibit a traffic that makes rich the few at the expense of the many; that puts into the treasury of the State a few paltry dollars while it draws out indirectly a hundred-fold as much.

Again, Mr. Macdonald omits to us of having defended the legal suppression of polygamy. It is true that we have done so, but never upon moral grounds; we have defended it solely upon civil grounds. We have defended it upon the right of the people to take away the right of many more to have wives. Taking, the world over, and indeed in the United States, the number of males and females are practically equal. To permit polygamy is to permit a monopoly in women. Again, to permit polygamy is either to discriminate unjustly between the sexes. But it is a strictly polygamy show. But this would cause utter confusion in families, and would make necessary a practical application of the permission

doctrine that children are wards of the State, because the State would be burdened with the care of unnerous children of unknown paternity. These reasons may not seem sufficient to the ex-editor, who is somewhat tinctured with the doctrines of *Herr* Marx, but they are the reasons we give, and they are certainly not moral reasons, they are purely civil reasons; and if they and others of like nature are not sufficient we want no action. If the State is not justified in interfering with polygamy; but so as they seem conclude to say; and with this we dismiss the matter, trusting that our critic will absolve us from the charge of basing God's untruth, and he will in the future better understand our position in regard to moral legislation.
