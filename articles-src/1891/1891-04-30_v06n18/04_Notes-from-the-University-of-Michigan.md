## Notes from the University of Michigan.

A most interesting lecture was delivered in the University, April 5, by Mr. A. F. Ballenger, of Chicago, on the history of State-churchism during the Christian era. The lecture consisted of a dozen of acts.

The first act was the stoning of Stephen, in Jerusalem, A. D. 35. The second act was the persecution of the early Christians, by the pagans, under Nero and his successors. The third act was the persecution of Christians (non-Catholic) by the Catholic Christians. The fourth act was the persecution of Christians (Catholic) by Protestant Christians in England under Elizabeth. The fifth act was the persecution of Protestants by Protestants (the case of Servetus being used as a striking illustration). The sixth act was the persecution of American Christians (Baptists, Quakers, etc.), by American Christians (Puritans). The seventh act was a vivid portrayal of the persecution of Sabbatarians in Tennessee, by American Christians now.

While, as the speaker portrayed his subject, he paused from act to act, and depicted some affecting scene of the tragic drama of religious intolerance from mediaeval Europe to the wilds of the New World, from intolerant New England of a century and a half ago, to the America of to-day; as he opened the doors of some of our American prisons and visited Christians imprisoned there for their faith, as he knelt on the prison floors and prayed with them, and then turned to the desolate homes where loving wife and child await day by day the return of the husband and father—it was almost with a chill of horror that the listeners realized the final act was being played in free Protestant America, in the closing years of the nineteenth century.

The speaker declared that the times were some excuse for the persecutions of former days. But what excuse was there for America, after a century of prosperity, unparalleled in the history of the world, to again ratify the institutions, in

American laws interfere with a person's religious belief? At a logical deduction the speaker asserted that "Neither Protestant Americans, nor the Christians of the nineteenth century, indeed, is able to cope with the bigotry and intolerance of the human heart. Every persecution have now are made possible by a union of Church and State. I using church Italy, martyred Catholic, and martyred Protestant, martyred Practicals and martyred Quakers," and from the death of Stephen to our own time—dead hearts-torn forms, martyred Presbyterians, and their sacred ashes, and by them at the door, not of Christianity as taught and practised by its Author, for I challenge the world to show that by word or act the great Author of the Christian religion ever sanctioned the propagation of doctrine of his teachings by means of the civil arm, no, I lay them at the door of civil and ecclesiastical powers that charged them, and upon the religion of the meek and lowly Nazarene, but unto that engine of tyranny at God's writing the pages of ecclesiastical history in blood and disgraced the name of Christianity.

A more vivid lecture, or a more convincing presentation, would have been more difficult. At the close of the lecture, Mr. McAlister, of the law department, one of the front best singers in the University, had a very appropriate song to a touching; and a very appropriate song something to Eddie's letter. The music was a very well chosen piece, "The Baby's Prayer." The words are as follows—

Just before the battle the bard was sung. Mr. Ballenger declared that the bards had cannel the writing of it, which, in brief, are as follows: In 1886 Mrs. M. W. Parker, a Sabbatarian, living at Dayton, in the County of Rhea, was prosecuted for laboring on her own premises on Sunday, by some whose religious views were disproved. She was convicted before a Justice of the Peace of the State; but getting no relief there, and refusing to pay the fine and cost imposed, amounting to all at $9.63, which she believed to be unjust, she was taken from her wife and child, and put in jail,

serve a period of two hundred and eighty days. From the brief orders that persuaded the place, he contracted material fever, from the effects of which he is finally died. At the last business meeting of the Religious Liberty Society the following resolutions was unanimously adopted:—

Whereas, Mr. A. E. Ballenger, of Chicago, has lectured at the our University a most interesting lecture on "Religious Freedom," setting forth in a forcible and forceful manner the American position in the time of the relations of Church and State, the disgraceful treatment handed out of some so-called "church" movement, deportation alike to both the Church and the State, therefore—

Whereas, the University of Michigan, that the first real object of such laws was to induce people to attend church, and that where this failed, the logical tendency of all stock this provision was the result to compulsory church attendances, many have said it was an exaggeration, and the American Sabbath Union has always been the first to resentfully deny it. But here it is in plain English from their own lips, "I have read directly from their stay home at home to attend to, the papers read by the papers must be stopped by law. They go off on excursion, instead of attending upon the teaching of law. If that fails fines must be sent to make law devised to bond them off and drive them into the church, in the same way, "daze must be forced."

Rev. Bradshaw, in this same Convention, said:—

> I take the position of the Church of the church cannot exist without the Sunday press.
