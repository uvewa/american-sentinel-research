AN observer of the seventh day, in Texas, writes to the organ of the denomination, the Review and Herald, that he has recently been served with the following notice:—

We the undersigned, citizens of this community, inform you that if you keep Saturday for the Sabbath, you must keep Sunday also, thus conforming to the customs and habits of the people. If you refuse, we will whip you within an inch of your life for the first offense: and on the second we will hang you until you are dead, dead, dead.

Judging from this, National Reform has secured a pretty good foothold in the Lone Star State. These zealous Christians (?) ought, however, to know that in this way they will speedily bring their cause into bad repute. They should take the more respectable, but not more Christian, method of invoking the power of the State to coerce those who do not agree with them in religious matters. If they should actually carry the matter so far as to hang somebody, even some of the leading spirits of the American Sabbath Union might be roused to say that "it would seem to be a harmless kindness to permit observers of the seventh day to do private work on Sunday." Mr. Crafts actually said as much as this in regard to the persecutions in Tennessee, where Sabbatarians have died of fevers contracted in prison; and if somewhere a man should be hanged for Sunday work even the President of the Sabbath Union, who has thus far remained silent, might be provoked to say that a county jail and typhoid fever would have been a more respectable means of execution.
