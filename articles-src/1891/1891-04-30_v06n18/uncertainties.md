## OCR Quality Notes

The OCR transcription was generally of good quality from the Mistral OCR source file. The following issues were noted:

### Page 1
- Line 7: OCR read "THE AMERICAN SUN-TIMES" but context clearly indicates this should be "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL" (masthead title)
- **Correction made:** Changed to "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - confirmed by publication name

### Page 3
- Line 160: "poison bafened air" - unclear if this is archaic spelling or OCR error for "poison baffened air" or "poison-laden air"
- **Transcribed as:** "poison bafened air"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - kept as OCR read, may need verification against original

### Page 5
- Line 241: "Congregationalists" correctly read despite column break

### Page 6
- Line 293: "curve" appears where "curse" would make sense ("liquor traffic as a curve to society")
- **Transcribed as:** "curve"
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely OCR error, but preserved as read

- Line 303: "invettable" appears where "inestimable" or "inalienable" would make sense
- **Transcribed as:** "invettable"
- **Confidence:** LOW - likely OCR error, preserved as read

### Page 7
- Multiple advertisement OCR issues with formatting, prices, and product descriptions
- These were not transcribed as articles per instructions (skip advertisements)

### Page 8
- Line 450: "unish" appears to be fragment or OCR error in quote from Independent
- **Transcribed as:** "unish"
- **Confidence:** LOW - preserved as OCR read, unclear original
