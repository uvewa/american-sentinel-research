In an article in the United Presbyterian, Rev. W. F. Crafts says:—

Our Sabbath laws, though bitterly attacked in many legislatures since April of last year, have not, in a single instance, I think, been even weakened. The courts have decided in Maryland, that Sunday baseball, as a money-making show, violates the law against Sunday "labor;" in Pennsylvania, that Sunday opening of a barber-shop is not a work of necessity or mercy. President Spaulding, of the National Base Ball League, has forbidden Sunday games for 1891, as before. Sunday saloons have been closed in Los Angeles, and the contagion of its courage has secured the same result all over Southern California. As a result of lectures, literature, and organization, the Sunday opening of the post-office has been discontinued in some places, Sunday newspapers, have, in at least one instance, been suppressed by law, and in another by public sentiment.

Mr. Crafts recommends a wholesale petitioning for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, suggesting that eight copies of each petition be prepared in duplicate, to be sent to both houses of the next Congress, to the Columbian commission, to both the commissioners and both the alternates of the State where the action is taken, and to the World's Fair directory.
