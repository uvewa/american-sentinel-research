THE Independent has obtained the views of ninety-seven Roman Catholic and Protestant archbishops and bishops upon the question of opening the World's Fair upon Sunday. Of course a large majority of the Protestant prelates are opposed to Sunday opening; while out of twenty-two Roman ecclesiastics fourteen would admit the public to the Fair on Sunday, only in the afternoon. Out of twenty-five Episcopal bishops only two favor Sunday afternoon opening. Of the Methodist bishops only one, a colored man, favors Sunday opening.
