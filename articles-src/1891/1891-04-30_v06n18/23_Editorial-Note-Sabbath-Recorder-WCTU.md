WE are glad to note the following in an account in the Sabbath Recorder of a Ministerial conference:—

In the paper, "Sabbath keeping Women and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union," by H. D. Clarke, we have a long-felt want; that which will make it evident that our Seventh-day Baptist women can not consistently belong to the Union. It is hoped that the paper, in full, will soon be published in the Recorder. Other essays were presented which were of interest and instructive to all who heard them.

We are glad to see this, not because we are opposed to the original object of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, but because the Union has largely lost sight of that object, and has espoused so-called National Reform. That which affiliates with National Reform can be Christian only in name.
