[page 137]

Much has been said on the proposed National Sunday legislation, and religious amendment to the Constitution, as being subversive of the principles of our Government. None too much has been said on this, and none too much can be said. But the Sunday-law workers, and the liquor-workers generally, are not the only ones whose aims and workings are anti-American and subversive of the rights of States Government. All those who look to the Government as being the great governmental parent of the people, which must feed, and clothe, and nurse, and coddle the people, are engaged in the same business. The Sunday-law workers proceed upon the theory that the people are so incompetently babyish that they are incapable of deciding for themselves when they are tired or when they should rest, and that therefore the Government must take the place of a parent and decide for them, and compel them to conform to the decision whether they are tired or not, or whether they want to rest or not. The great governmental parent says you are tired, and that is enough, if you are not tired you ought to be, and, therefore, must invariably rest on Sunday.

More than this, the Sunday-law workers proceed upon the theory, that the people are incapable of deciding for themselves whether they ought to be religious, and for what extent, and after what manner; and therefore the great governmental parent must decide this for them, and compel them to be religious, to whatever extent she chooses, and after the manner of heathen.

The Farmers' Alliance movement, which is just now causing more trepidation than any other one thing, proceeds upon the theory that the farmers are conducting their business in such a way as to make sufficient money out of it, and therefore the Government, as a good indulgent parent, must furnish them money in such quantities as they need.

The two other agitations of the same thing, but the nationalist movement sums up all of them, by proceeding upon the theory that the people are incapable of doing anything at all for themselves, and therefore the Government, as the universal parent, must do absolutely everything for them, even to showing them the very times that they shall eat.

Of course all who are engaged in these different movements, do not put their respective causes in this way, that would be rather too raw, but this is precisely what those things amount to from beginning to end. The outcome of the whole matter is the two extremes—the simple idolatry or rather the legalization of the people, and the personality or rather the divinity of the Government. Either of these things lie in the other, and both alike are antagonistic to the principles which are the basis of American institutions.

The first of all American principles, and the grandest of all government principles, is the manliness and in that the entire capability of the people. And the second is like unto it, namely, the absolute responsibility of the Government to the people.

Both of these things are plainly asserted by the Declaration of Independence. That

[page 138]

men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem to most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

This presupposes that men are from the first, and as such are fully capable of taking care of themselves; that that instead of needing to be taken care of by the Government, the Government is to be taken care of by them. It presupposes that the people are capable of deciding for themselves as to what is best for their legislatures and how they shall pursue it, without the Government of being set up as their guardian to tell them when or how they shall eat, or be religious, or anything else that may relate to their personal affairs.

This statement clearly shows also, that the Government is but a piece of political machinery, which is created by the people to secure their rights and to assure their safety in the exercise of their rights. This is the doctrine of the national Constitution, for says the preamble:—

> We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

And Article IX, of Amendments says:

> The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

And Article X, of Amendments says:

> The powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

Thus, is clearly announced in both the Declaration and the Constitution, the doctrine, that the people are supreme, as the sovereign of a pure democracy; that the government is but a piece of political machinery set up by the people, by which they would make themselves secure in the enjoyment of the inalienable rights with which their Creator endowed them; and that whenever this piece of machinery fails to accomplish the purpose for which the people made it, it is their "right" to smash it and make another one. Nothing could more plainly show the utter subordination and impersonality of the Government, than do these statements of the Declaration and the Constitution.

True, these are the American principles, and, as long as they are in shall continue, in genuine civil liberty, and the conservation of the rights of the people. Thus and for this reason was this Republic established, "a Government of the people, by the people, and for the people."

Any doctrine, therefore, that tends to set the Government above the people, to make it the parent of the people, or to give it a personality, is directly contrary to American principles as announced in the Declaration and in the Constitution; it subversive of Republican government, and is a step toward monarchism. In short it is to renounce the principles of freedom and to advocate that of despotism.

This is precisely what is done in the movement referred to at the beginning of this article, and we a still more dangerous place which we shall notice in our next. Let the reader preserve this copy of THE SENTINEL, until he receives the copy of the next number.
