IN the cable news from Berlin, of April 19, is to be found the following spicy paragraph:—

The Kaiser is much annoyed by the disregard of his wishes shown by a number of cavalry officers in attending the Hurdle Society's races on last Sunday. The Emperor's brother-in-law, Duke Gunther, of Schleswig-Holstein, who was among the delinquents, received the full measure of the imperial resentment. So loud and menacing was the language in which it was conveyed that the Empress ran into the room to protect her brother, whom the Emperor was denouncing as a blasphemous jockey. The Duke and his partners in guilt spent this Sunday in the barracks, deprived of tobacco and liquors, and in other respects treated as prisoners.

Certainly the National Reform principles are making rapid progress when crowned heads enforce Sunday observance in members of their own family by military discipline.
