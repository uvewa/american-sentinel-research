A MOST interesting lecture was delivered in the University, April 4, by Mr. A. F. Ballenger, of Chicago, on the history of State-churchism during the Christian era.

The lecture consisted of a drama of seven acts. The first act was the stoning of Stephen, in Jerusalem, in A. D. 34. The second act was the persecution of the early Christians, by the pagans, under Nero and his successors. The third act was the persecution of Christians (non-Catholic) by Catholic Christians. The fourth act was the persecution of Christians (Catholic) by Protestant Christians (in England under Elizabeth). The fifth act was the persecution of Protestants by Protestants (the case of Servetus being used as a striking illustration). The sixth act was the persecution of American Christians (Baptists, Quakers, etc.), by American Christians (Puritans). The seventh act was a vivid portrayal of the persecution of Sabbatarians in Tennessee, by American Christians of to-day.

While, as the speaker portrayed his subject, he passed from act to act, and depicted scene after scene of the tragic drama; as he carried his listeners from mediaeval Europe to the wilds of the New World; from intolerant New England of a century and a half ago, to the America of to-day; as he opened the doors of some of our American prisons and visited Christians imprisoned there for their faith; as he knelt on the prison floors and prayed with them, and then turned to the desolate home where loving wife and child await day by day the return of the husband and father;—it was almost with a chill of horror that the listeners realized the final act was being played in free Protestant America, in the closing years of the enlightened nineteenth century.

The speaker stated that the times were some excuse for the persecutions of former days. But what excuse was there for America, after a century of prosperity, unparalleled in the history of the world, to again enforce the unchristian, un-American laws interfering with a person's religious belief? As a logical deduction the speaker asserted that "Neither Protestantism, Americanism, nor the civilization of the nineteenth century, unaided, is able to cope with the bigotry and intolerance of the human heart. Every persecution presented here was made possible by a union of Church and State; I bring them all, martyred Catholic, and martyred Protestants, martyred Puritans and martyred Quakers,—all from the death of Stephen to our own time—their beast-torn forms, their rack-tortured bodies, and their sacred ashes, and lay them at the door, not of Christianity as taught and practiced by its Author, for I challenge the world to prove that by word or act the great Author of the Christian religion ever sanctioned the propagation or defense of his teachings by means of the civil arm; no, I lay them at the door of civil and ecclesiastical union, and charge them, not upon the religion of the meek and lowly Nazarene, but upon that engine of tyranny which has written the pages of ecclesiastical history in blood and disgraced the name Christian."

A more vivid lecture, or a more convincing presentation, would have been indeed difficult. At the close of the lecture, Mr. Thompson, of the law department, one of the finest bass singers in the University, rendered "The Prisoner," which was quite touching, and a very appropriate song to follow the lecture. The music was Lady Carew's famous piece, "The Bridge," and the words were as follows:—

"I stood in a Southern prison, and held a comrade's hand;
Not when the war cloud sullen, hung o'er that sunny land.
The Nation's strife was over, and Peace with gentle hand.
Round blue and grey was weaving Love's shining, golden band.
My friend was not war's prisoner; nor of his own misdeeds;
But victim of passions more cruel, of cold, relentless creeds.

"I asked the kindly jailor to loose the iron door;
And there in that loathsome prison we knelt upon the floor.
Not often, no, not often, is heard the voice of prayer
In a dark and loathsome prison with its poison bafened air.
Yet often, ah, too often, has the scene I witnessed there
Made Freedom's cheek blush crimson and tarnished her name so fair

"Ah, what, I asked the jailor, as he barred again the door,
What deed of shame committed, the prison records bore?
What crime against his fellows now barred him a prisoner lone.
And left a wife and children in a widowed, orphan's home?
'O shame,' he muttered sternly 'the crime is of the State,
Your friend is another victim of a bigot's cruel hate."

"For obedience to his Maker, he lay in that prison cell,
Till the shadow of death came o'er him the sun could ne'er dispel.
My comrade and brother is sleeping, he lies buried where he fell;
Awaiting the roll-call of heaven: 'a mansion for a cell.'"

Just before the ballad was sung, Mr. Ballenger stated the facts which caused the writing of it which, in brief, are as follows: In 1886, Mr. W. H. Parker, a Sabbatarian, living at Springville, Tennessee, was prosecuted for laboring on his own premises on Sunday, by some whose religious views were disturbed. His case was taken to the Supreme Court of the State; but getting no relief there, and refusing to pay the fine and costs imposed, amounting in all to $69.81, which he believed to be unjust, he was taken from his wife and child, and put in jail to serve a period of two hundred and eighty days. From the foul odors that permeated the place, he contracted malarial fever, from the effects of which he finally died.

At the last business meeting of the Religious Liberty Society the following resolution was unanimously adopted:—

WHEREAS, Mr. A. F. Ballenger, of Chicago, has delivered in the University a most interesting lecture on "Religious Freedom," setting forth in a clear and forcible manner the American political ideas of the relation of Church and State, and the dangerous centralizing tendencies of some so-called "reform" movements, injurious alike to both the Church and the State, therefore,

Resolved, That we, the Religious Liberty Society of the University of Michigan, extend to him our appreciation of his interest in the cause of liberty, and heartily thank him for the lecture delivered in this place.

The oratorical classes have "tackled" the Sunday-law question now, and recently two debates were held in which it was discussed. The first one, "Resolved, That the World's Fair shall be closed on Sunday," was lost in the Junior law class by a vote of one to eleven. The second question, "Resolved, That the University library shall be open Sundays," was won in the Senior law class by a vote of fourteen to twelve. Public opinion is even much more strongly in favor of it.
