MR. CRAFTS'S late injunction to the faithful National Reformers is noteworthy. Referring to the April week of prayer, he says:—

The world's week of prayer for the Sabbath should be a week of practice as well as prayer, of enforcing the laws we have as well as petitioning for better ones. They pray best who are busiest between prayers in working with God in the answers.

A more terse expression of the idea contained in this paragraph would be "pray and prosecute."
