A WRITER in the Daily Herald, of St. Joseph, Missouri, says, "The progress made in the education and refinement of the people since the heyday of the Puritan Sunday, would hardly place in the hands of Mr. Crafts and his associates such dangerous tools as gibbets and stakes to enforce their notions, but the barbarous Sunday legislation still on our statute books gives them the conveniences and facilities of mulcts, jails, and policemen's clubs." That Mr. Crafts and his disciples will use these means there is little doubt—provided the people at large choose to let them.
