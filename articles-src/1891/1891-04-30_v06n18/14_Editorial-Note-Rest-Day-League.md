AT the formation of a "Rest Day League" in St. Joseph, Missouri, not long since, a series of resolutions were adopted of which the following extract is a sample:—

Resolved, That we deplore the fact that our city, in other respects said to observe the Sabbath better than many, east or west, still falls below Pittsburg, or New York, or Chicago, in allowing the noisy hawking of newspapers upon the Sabbath to the disturbance of home life and Sabbath worship, and we will call upon our public officers to suppress this affront to Christian sentiment and State law.

Resolved, That we assure our public officers, whose sworn duty it is to prevent and punish the opening of saloons and other infractions of our humane Sabbath law, that we will heartily support them in enforcing it, and we earnestly request our Mayor to publish the Sabbath law of this State, that no violator may plead ignorance of its provisions, etc.

The prominence which is given to the idea of "law" is worthy of note, as well as the peculiar and significant juxtaposition of the expression "Christian sentiment and State law." Steadily, by gradual insistence, the general impression is being conveyed that to affront religious "sentiment" is an infraction of the civil law which public officers must be called upon to punish.
