The ex-editor of Freethought doesn't like our criticism of his statement that "if religion is a good and beneficent thing, the more places it can be found the better," and "that only people who know that Christianity is a fraud can have sufficient excuse for objecting to its enforcement so long as they advocate the enforcement of anything;" and not only does he not like it but says we are "guilty of untruth." It is sad that he has so poor a memory as to enter such a denial, for his words were certainly quoted just as they appeared in Freethought the last week he presided over its destinies. But hear him in his own behalf; he says:—

Something more than a month ago, in discussing religious exercises in public institutions, I submitted the following:—

"If religion is a good and beneficent thing, the more places it can be found the better."

The drift of my remarks was that religion is a fraud, and ought not to be found anywhere, but the editor of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL makes me say:—

"If religion is a good thing it ought to be enforced."

I do not understand how any argument against what I did not say can possibly apply to what I actually did say. The editor is replying to his own statement—not to mine—which is why I remark that he is having a discussion with himself. I did not say that any opinion, belief, disbelief, or practice ought to be enforced. I have not, therefore, admitted, as the editor says I have, that did I believe in religion I would be in favor of enforcing it; and I respectfully call his attention to the fact that he is guilty of untruth.

The words that he says we put in his mouth were simply the gist of what he did actually say, and it was plainly stated so. Our statement was that in substance he said, "If religion be a good thing it ought to be enforced." And we would like to see anybody show that this is not the substance of what he said. But the ex-editor denies our conclusion, viz., that had he the power he would enforce infidelity, to the extent of putting it wherever the State has power to put it, and we are willing to believe that he would not, now that he says so plainly. But he should be more careful in his words, and withal more consistent; and above all things he ought, if possible, to make up his mind what he believes, and then when he writes be sure that his words properly express his belief; which they certainly did not do in Freethought of March 7, if they do in the same paper of April 11.

But the ex-editor does not relish this phase of the question, and remarks that we need not discuss it further; but adds: "I would be glad to hear what he [the editor of THE SENTINEL] has to say as to the charge that, in favoring moral legislation he is just as great a religious bigot as I should be had he told the truth about me."

To this we reply that the ex-editor should have said, as great a religious bigot as he would be had his words which we quoted, properly represented his sentiments; for we must certainly disavow any responsibility such as he attributes to us in this matter.

Further we would say, and the ex-editor should certainly understand this, that we do not, and never have, favored moral legislation. We have earnestly opposed all legislation that is not justifiable on purely civil grounds. We have been specially guarded in this particular, and no one can point to anything that we have ever written that is in the least out of harmony with this statement. We have constantly maintained that the State has no right to deal with moral questions, and that it can prohibit, only for civil reasons, those things which are uncivil; that is, such acts as trench upon the rights of others. Not only so, but we have been criticised from time to time by the religious press for taking this position, and now this gentleman, who is evidently guilty of writing with only limited knowledge of his subject, accuses us of doing just the opposite.

The ex-editor says that the claim is made that morals and religion are different; yes, so it is; but we have not made such a claim. In fact our contention has been that while not identical in every respect, morals and religion are so closely related that it is impossible to distinguish clearly between them, and that for this reason the State should let moral questions alone just as it is supposed to let religious questions alone, and for the same reason, viz., that such questions belong to the domain of the conscience.

But the gentleman asks, "If the State may legislate on temperance, education, and morals, why not on belief?" We give it up. If the State may properly legislate on morals we do not see how anybody could draw the line and say that it should not legislate upon belief. However, we think there is a difference between moral legislation and legislating upon temperance and education, that is, if by temperance legislation is meant the regulation or prohibition of the liquor traffic, and if by education is meant making provision for the secular instruction of those who are to become members of the body politic.

If the State has the right to exist it has the right to perpetuate its existence; and this it can do in a republic only by maintaining a good degree of intelligence among the people. To this end it seems to us that it would be proper for the State to provide facilities for the education of the children, though we are not of the number who believe that the children are the wards of the State, and that the right of the State is equal to that of the parents.

The principle of the regulation of the liquor traffic is universally admitted. That which the State may properly restrict it may properly prohibit; and the justice of the restriction of the liquor traffic is admitted by everybody. The man who pays a license to sell liquor thereby admits the right of the State to impose that license, and he likewise admits the right of the State to prohibit the traffic by those who pay no license. He not only admits this right but after paying his own license he demands that the State exercise the right. What right then has he to find fault should the State the next year refuse to give him license, and prohibit him from engaging in liquor traffic?

But there is another and even better reason to be urged in defense of temperance legislation, viz., the duty of the State to protect the lives and property of the individuals who compose the State, and to do this at the smallest expense consistent with the public safety. The records of our courts and prisons show that three-fourths of the crime of the country is caused by the liquor traffic, that a very large per cent. of the taxation is due to the same cause; and whatever may be said of the right of the individual to use intoxicating liquors, there can be no question of the right of all the people to prohibit a traffic that makes rich the few at the expense of the many; that puts into the treasury of the State a few paltry dollars, while it draws out indirectly a hundred-fold as much.

Again, Mr. Macdonald assails us for having defended the legal suppression of polygamy. It is true that we have done so, but never upon moral grounds; we have defended it solely upon civil grounds. We have defended it because to permit polygamy is to take away the right of some men to have wives. Taking the world over, and indeed in the United States, the number of males and females are practically equal. To permit polygamy is to permit a monopoly in women. Again, to permit polygamy is either to discriminate unjustly between the sexes, or else it is to permit polyandry also. But this would cause utter confusion in families, and would make necessary a practical application of the pernicious doctrine that children are wards of the State, because the State would be burdened with the care of numerous children of unknown paternity. These reasons may not seem sufficient to the ex-editor, who is somewhat tinctured with the doctrines of Herr Most, but they are the reasons we give, and they are certainly not moral reasons, they are purely civil reasons, and if they and others of like nature are not sufficient we must admit that the State is not justified in interfering with polygamy; but to us they seem conclusive; and with this we dismiss the matter, trusting that our critic will absolve us from the charge of having told an untruth, and he will in the future better understand our position in regard to moral legislation.
