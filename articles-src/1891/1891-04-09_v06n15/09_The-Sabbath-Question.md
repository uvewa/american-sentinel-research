### For the Bulletin:

The discussion of the Sabbath question now so vigorously carried on throughout the country was specially sprung in 1888, when the American Sabbath Union was organized. Auxiliary societies have been established in nearly all the States, and the friends of the Union are pushing its purpose with great zeal. Wisely or unwisely opened, the battle is on. The issues are in the hands of God and the patriotic citizens of the United States.

There is, perhaps, no graver or greater question—certainly none which so directly concerns the liberties of our people—because involved in the outcome is the interference or non-interference of the State with religious institutions. The American Sabbath Union is working to secure the legal recognition and protection of a specific and religious day, called Sunday, regardless of the moral rights and consciences of vast numbers of God-fearing and loyal citizens of our country. The Union is not willing that the Jew shall have a Sunday or Sabbath, nor that the large number of Seventh-day Adventists and Baptists shall be regarded with respect. As many crimes have been committed in the name of liberty so have many curses come upon the people in the name of religion. Great majorities on any subject are apt to become unpatriotic and tyrannic. The duty of the people is to watch principles, not majorities, and learn that vigilance and personal action and independence are often absolutely necessary to the perpetuation of pure religion and pure civil government.

We have come to that sort of crisis in the history of our religious institutions. We are now compelled to say whether or not we want the State to legislate on religious subjects, and fix by law our religious institutions. The American Sabbath Union declares its wish that the State shall declare itself in favor of one specific day as the Sabbath of America, and thereby force thousands of its own citizens either to disregard its behests or the behests of their own moral and religious conscience. We must face the issue. The labors of a life-time ought to protect one from the charge of foreignism on this subject. It is for the good of our free institutions and for the good of religion that we give our voice against the purpose of the American Sabbath Union. Nor are we able for a moment to believe that the objects sought by the Union are other than sincerely desired and religiously entertained. We think, however, the movement a blunder. The zeal of the Lord's house has eaten them up. They seem blind to everything on this subject other than majority notions of religion. They seem to forget that to oppress one sincere conscience in religion is ungodly. They also seem to forget that the national Constitution forbids Congress, and therefore the State, legislating in the interests of religion or fixing any moral status by statute.

We feel sure that the purpose of the Union, so far as legislation is concerned, will fail. The grounds of opposition to the legislative phase of the Union's work will be stated in a few brief papers which, by courtesy of the editor will be published in the Sunday Bulletin. The opposition in no way touches the great fact that we do sorely need, in these reckless times, some higher regard for the office of a sacred rest day. Our people ought to love and practice the privileges of a worshipful rest day. But to attempt to secure this good by law—to force the conscience of any of our fellow-citizens—is both unpatriotic and unreligious. I am heartily in favor of the movement looking toward the better observance of the Christian Sunday by Christians themselves. And just as heartily do I desire to see among the general mass of non-professional or non-religious citizens a more respectful behavior toward the worshipful rest day that custom has established in our country. But there is a lawful and an impartial way to reach this desired end. That way does not come through legislation.

In the paper to appear next Sunday, the question, "What is the Sabbath?" will be discussed, and in the light of the answer given we hope to find the true grounds of reform.
