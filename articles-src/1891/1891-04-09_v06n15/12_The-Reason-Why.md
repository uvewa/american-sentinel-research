There are several reasons why, in our judgment, the clergy should not take an active part in political organization; even of all the most distinguished. They are not the skilled organizers of practical organizations. Their function is to be good at their work, not to confuse with affairs, and while occasionally the same man is equally good at both, more frequently is the one who drops the first function to undertake the second, drops a higher for a lower cause, and he who undertakes to fulfill both fulfills neither. The American people are jealous of the interference of the clergy in political administration. The attempt to carry in the State by the Church has been very thoroughly tried in the Old World, and the success of the experiment has not been such as to encourage a repetition of it in the New World. Cardinals have not purified statecraft in France, nor have bishops who entered the House of Lords in England. Ministers are but men, and when they drop the vantage ground which their profession gives them for quiet and useful reflection and enter the environment of other men, they become much like them. If the minister goes into politics, in a certain sense he opens himself for interference with his politics; but it very easily happens than the question often stakes him in the far between service of the Church and the State, the two not infrequently seeming to present conflicting claims upon him.—*Christian Union.*
