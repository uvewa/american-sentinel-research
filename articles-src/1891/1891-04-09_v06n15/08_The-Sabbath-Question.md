The discussion of the Sabbath question as we vigorously carried on throughout the country are especially opening in 1888, when the American Sabbath Union was organized. Agitation societies have been established in nearly all the States, and the friends of the Sunday rest have pursued its purpose with great zeal. Mostly or wisely opened, the battle is on. The issue is now in the hands of God and the patriotic citizens of the United States.

There is, perhaps, no graver or greater question—certainly none which so directly concerns the liberties of our people or the cause involved in the outcome is the interference or non-interference of the State with religious institutions. The American Sabbath Union is working to secure the legal recognition and protection of a specific and religious day, called Sunday, regardless of the moral rights and conscience of a vast number of God-fearing and loyal citizens of our country. The Union is not willing that the Jew shall have a Sabbath or Sabbath, nor that the large number of Seventh-day Adventists and Baptists shall be regarded with respect. As many citizens have been [page 118] mitted in the name of liberty to many crimes could men upon the people in the name of religion. Great magistrates and any subject are up to detected significance and Tyrants. The duty of the people and the watch principles, not magistrates, and learn vigilance and perpetual action and independence are often absolutely necessary to the perpetuation of pure religion and pure civil government.

The history or too brief of a crisis in the history of our religious institutions. We are now compelled to say whether or not we want the State to legislate on religious subjects, and fix by law our religious subjects. By every indication, the Union declares in its will that the State shall worship itself in favor of a specific day as the Sabbath of America, and thereby thousands of its own citizens are to be disregard its liberties or else the behest of their own moral and religious conscience. We must face the issue. The failure of a life-time ought to protect one from the designs of a freethinker on this subject. It is for the good of our free institutions and for the interest of the fullness of the give and religious conscience to resist those set against the purpose of the American Sabbath Union. Not are we able for a moment to believe that the objects entertained by the Union are less than otherwise devoutly determined, and religiously honest in the aim, believed, however, the movement a blunder.

Thomas C. Easton, for instance, is one of them. They seem blind to everything in this subject so that man's duties belong to a day of religion. They seem to forget that to oppose one sincere conscience in religion is mighty. They also seem to forget that the national Constitution forbids Congress, and therefore the State, legislating in the interests of religion or fixing any religion upon the people.

We feel sure that the purpose of the Union, so far as legislation is concerned, is wrong. To suggest fully the outcome and the legislative plans of the Union's work will be stated in a few brief papers which, by courtesy of the editor will be published in the Sunday issue of the *Bulletin.* We in no way touches the great fact that we have ourselves, in these twelve reasons, not merely one subject before the office of a sacred rest day. Our people ought to lose no time and practice the privileges of a rounded rest day. But to attempt to secure this good by law is to force upon the liberties of any of our fellow-citizens—is both unChristian and unAmerican. It is unmanly, in favor of the thinker looking toward the better observance of the Christian law cherished by Christian minorities. And just as heartily do I desire to see among equal masses of non-professionalized or non-religious citizens a more respectful behavior toward the wrongful rest day, that such custom has established in our country. But there is a lawful and an impartial way to reach the desired end. That way does not come through legislation.

In the paper is suggested a society, that

question, "What is the Sabbath?" will be to punish any one of them for exercising his sincere freedom. What one might think, can not affect us, so long as their actions are confined within the common rules or requirements of rights and morality.—*Lux Barrington, in Bloomington (Ill.) Bulletin.*
