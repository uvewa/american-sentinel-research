It is very strange indeed, that in this day of progress and general enlightenment, any person, or sect of persons, should be so narrow-minded as to set forth and teach doctrines and principles that characterized the Dark Ages. To compel people to do a thing on the first day of the week, and in which they do not believe, is but one form of tyranny. Is this synonymous with the American boast of free Government? We think not. Although we were brought up to revere and keep the first day of the week, we feel it would be wrong to force our views upon those who might differ with us in a religious point of view, or holding to contrary convictions.

George Washington declared that the United States were not founded on the Christian religion. The American Republic has never claimed the right or privilege to inquire into the religious views of its citizens any more than it has to punish any one of them for exercising his elective franchise. What our neighbors may think, can not affect us, so long as their actions are confined within the common rules or regulations of rights and morality.

An attempt to legislate on the Sunday law would be the first step toward the union of Church and State, a union that has done more to sacrifice and destroy the lives of innocent men and women, than the political blunders of all the world combined. For our part we shall oppose such measures as undemocratic, and shall aim with a direct purpose to defeat the thrust at American liberty with all our power.
