REFERRING to a large foreign element in this country and the relation to Sunday of those who compose it, Alex. S. Bacon, Esq., of Brooklyn, at the second anniversary of the American Sabbath Union, said:

It is useless to argue with them from the word of God, for they do not recognize it as a rule of life.

The Sabbath Recorder, the organ of the Seventh-day Baptists, thus states what it conceives to be one reason why it is useless:

It is useless to argue with them from the word of God; but the reason which he assigns for such vain attempts hardly meets the case. It may be true that they do not place that importance upon the Bible as the rule of life which Protestant Christians in this country give it, but they also know that there is not one word of authority in the Bible for the observance of Sunday, as Mr. Bacon, or any one else, can easily ascertain. These foreigners, with their "bright intellects," and "susceptibility to argument," can not fail to see that these zealous advocates of Sunday fly in the face of the Scriptures to get rid of the Seventh-day Sabbath—the only weekly Sabbath known in the Bible. For this reason it is useless to argue with them from the word of God.

Is this not the reason also why they appeal to the State rather than to the divine law? If they had a divine statute for Sunday would they be so ready to demand civil enactments?
