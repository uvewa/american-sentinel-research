Rev. Thomas C. Easton is apparently not above begging the question when he wants to make a point. "We are essentially a Christian people," he said yet again, and then he proceeded to show that therefore the Columbian Exposition should be closed on Sunday. We do not say even, were this confessedly a Christian, not a Moslem, Exposition should be closed on Sunday, for we fail to understand how such a display would dishonor the Sabbath. We are certain that all kinds of places that dishonor more work days as well as Sundays are allowed to keep open all the year round. But if this is not a confessedly Christian people, and if Dr. Easton will find no such statement enshrined in our Constitution, the fact is that the congregations of Chicago want it to gather the offerings of visitors into their churches every Sunday, and receive from their collection plates the money that would otherwise be spent at the Exposition. So, of course, the clergy all over the country take from a fraternal helping hand. Let us not blame them either. But they should debate this question fairly.—*Sea Side Times.*
