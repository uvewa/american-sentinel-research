Strange as may appear, in this age of enlightenment, and this land of free thinkers, there are some who have not yet seen to have broken through the shell of error and superstition of the past, and learned that it is not the business of the Church to dictate to the policy of the State, nor of the State to say by whom, or by what means, men are to be saved in a kingdom not of this world.—*Western Herald.*
