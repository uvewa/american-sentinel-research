A FEW days since, there came to our table a marked copy of the Evening Sentinel, published at Keene, New Hampshire, containing the following notice of a new pamphlet:—

"THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH AND WHITHER IT IS DRIFTING."

There is in press, soon to be issued, a pamphlet of most unique character, with the above title, and which is calculated not only to interest a large class of people but to stimulate thought on the subjects of which it treats beyond anything of the kind that has recently come to our notice. The character of the work is indicated in its title. Although its contents can be digested in an hour, it is voluminous in thought far beyond many works of greater pretensions. Some of the propositions discussed are both momentous and startling; but they are supported in the main by quotations from recognized authorities that must largely relieve the writer of any charge of indulging in fanciful speculations. The timely reference which the author makes to the legislation sought in the direction of restrictive laws touching Sunday observance, etc., is well calculated to arouse such interest as will lead to a profound consideration of the whole subject. This work was written by one of our best-known citizens—a gentleman who has the courage of his convictions, and who, from the thought he has given these and kindred subjects, is well qualified to discuss them, not only in an interesting, but a logical manner, as will be apparent to the reader.

The same mail that brought to us the paper containing the foregoing notice, brought also a copy of the pamphlet which the title page tells us is "by a layman;" but as the Evening Sentinel assures us that the author is "a gentleman who has the courage of his convictions," we will suppose that his only motive in withholding his name from the public was that attention might be attracted to the subject rather than to the author.

"The present status of the Church," as depicted by the writer of this pamphlet, is simply deplorable. The author's opening statement is:—

The fact is but too apparent that the influence of the Church is on the wane, however repugnant the admission may be to its adherents and supporters. The leading men and papers in the religious world acknowledge the low condition of the churches and the many evil practices of which they are guilty.

In support of this indictment against the churches, the following extracts are then quoted from the Southern Presbyterian and from the Christian Advocate, respectively:—

"The churches get up a miniature theatre, mostly farcial, and ask godly and ungodly men and women to take parts, so as to draw money out of godly and ungodly pockets. And what does the sinner think and say of this? Why, that the Church is no better than the world."

"Disguise it as you like, the Church, in a general sense, is spiritually in a rapid decline. While it grows in numbers and money, it is becoming extremely feeble and limited in its spirituality, both in the pulpit and the pews. It is assuming the shape and character of the church of Laodices. There are thousands of ministers, local and conference, and many thousands of the laity who are as dead and worthless as barren fig trees."

Following these are other testimonies of a like nature, and then comes this statement from the late Rev. Austin Phelps, Professor in Andover Theological Seminary:—

We live in an age in which individualism in matters of religion has run wild. The waning of authority in the Church has carried with it, on the downward grade, the restrictive duties and courtesies of Christian morals which were once subject to the common conscience of believers, in which now every one does that which is right in his own eyes.

To this the author adds:—

In spite of the efforts put forth on the part of those who feel admissions of waning strength would prove detrimental to church interests, the fact can not be ignored that its influence for good, for building up Christ's kingdom, evangelizing the world is on the wane; that the garments of the Church are donned by many more for serving their own purposes than for the grand object of practically adopting the teachings and examples of the Master. Look at the defalcations, thefts, and casualties every day coming to light, of those who have held high position in the Church, bringing ruin ofttimes to widows and orphans whose all has been confided to their keeping.

While there are many noble examples to offset these, yet the lamentable fact confronts us that the tendency is to a laxity of morals and discipline that is bringing disgrace and contempt upon the Church, neutralizing in a large degree its power for good. What wonder, in view of this, that so many should be led to question the fundamental principles of Christianity and stray to other folds, accepting the doctrines of liberal churches and freethinkers. Well may we pause and ask, "Whither are we drifting?" The religious tenets of the Church are based on the great fundamental principles of the Bible; and when in conformity to its teachings it labors for the salvation of mankind there can be no doubtful result.

Following this, our author refers to the various theories of the origin of the earth, once rejected by the Church as anti-Scriptural but now accepted and taught; also to the doctrine of a future probation, and then says:—

When the fact is considered that its influence is all-pervading, sapping and undermining the churches in a measure that threatens destruction, it is time the tocsin of alarm was sounded. Not only is Andover and other staunch theological institutions being shaken, but ministers, as also laymen, in high places everywhere are contaminated; oft publicly advocating adversely to the old creeds that but maintain the basic principles of divine authority. To remedy this it is evident that the most decisive measures are demanded, in lieu of the palliatives that have so long been unsuccessfully resorted to.

The Sunday rest bill now pending in Congress, as also the proposed amendment to the Constitution wherein God and Christ are recognized as the head of all authority will, upon final enactment, insure largely the benefits sought by their promoters, as also go far towards securing further and more pointed legislation in the interests of the Church, which must be had in order to fully protect itself from the freethought heresies and liberal sentiments that are so surely gaining on it. Among the advantages thus to be secured is the control and censorship of the mails to the exclusion of all matter antagonizing the authority and doctrines of the evangelical churches, when, indeed, will Satan be shorn of a power hardly to be measured in words.

This the author realizes is pretty strong meat for the average American mental stomach, and he adds:—

This may seem too dominating, the wielding of a power not consistent with our boasted land of freedom. There is a just limit to freedom as to all things else. The laws already refuse the use of the mails for certain demoralizing agencies, obscene literature, lotteries, etc.

The agency of the press, through the mails, in disseminating heretical and liberal doctrines to the injury of the Church, is a thousand-fold greater in its terrible and far-reaching consequences than is all the literature to which the mails are closed. This assertion may be a startling one, yet nevertheless true, unless the doctrine, as distinctly declared by the Bible and as held by the Church, that mankind can only be saved through the atoning blood of Christ, be false.

Who that accepts the Bible in its fullness, in contemplation of the millions that are being led through the soothing doctrines of liberal and easy-going church influences down to everlasting perdition, could for a moment hesitate to lend his influence in shutting out from the mails every paper, pamphlet, or book that gives countenance to the theory that there is any hope for the salvation of mankind except through the merits or atoning blood of Christ?

When the advantage coming of the Sunday rest bill and others allied to it is secured, together with that which is sure to follow, then it is that not only the control of the mails but all else pertaining to the authority of the Church, will be established on a basis so firm as to be able to withstand and overcome all opposing influences.

That this would be strictly in accordance with National Reform theories the author shows by a number of quotations which he gives as follows:—

In speaking of the advantages to be gained by the adoption of the proposed amendment, Rev. R. C. Wylie, a member of the National Reform Association, whose object is to promote and aid in these reforms says, "We would then have a vantage ground we have not now." Says R. A. Gault, a leading worker in the Association, "Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the Government simply set up the moral law and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it." Says Jonathan Edwards, D. D., of New York City, "We want State and religion and we are going to have it. . . . The Christian oath and Christian morality shall have in this land an undeniable legal basis. We use the word religion in its proper sense, as meaning a man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God." Again, in a convention of this Association, in 1887, it was held that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national and world-wide, has one vital, organic thought, one all-absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm, and that is that Christ shall be this world's king—Yen, vevilg, this world's king in its realm of cause and effect; king of its courts, its camps, its commerce; king of its colleges and cloisters; king of its customs and Constitutions. The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law through the gateway of politics.

In the Christian Statesman, of February 21, 1884, Rev. J. M. Foster, District Secretary of the National Reform Association, declared that among the duties the reigning Mediator requires of nations, is an "acknowledgment and performance of the nation's duty to guard and protect the Church by suppressing all public violation of the moral law. . . . By exempting church property from taxation," and "by providing her funds out of the public treasury, for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field." Says another avowed champion of this cause, "I want to see the day come when the Church shall be the arbiter of all legislation, State, national, and municipal; when the great churches of this country can come together harmoniously and issue their edict, and the legislative powers will respect it, and enact it into law."

Thus are we encouraged by these and a host of other noble workers, who are determined that the ends sought shall be gained at whatever sacrifice it may cost. It is evident that a more powerful leverage than that of words must be brought to bear on those who persist in their opposition to the rights of the Church and its wholesome restraint.

The only possible defense of such methods is thus stated:—

To make our protests effective they must be backed by a power beyond that of words alone.

But the cry is made that in the rigid application of this principle the right of conscience would be denied. Even so, regardless of the conscientious scruples of these Seventh-day Sabbath keepers, the Jews, and others who assert their right to disregard the Sabbath recognized by the Church.

So long as this right is recognized and tolerated, so long will the Church be hampered in its efforts to overcome the heretical doctrines that have ever been a hindrance to its advancement. Says a prominent writer, referring to the legislation asked for, "When this is bad, as it soon should be, then we will rule the interests of godliness and sweep away those impious laws of liberty of conscience which are an insult to God and man." Rev. David Gregg, D. D., pastor of Park Street Church, Boston, a vice president of the National Reform Association, affirms that the civil power "has the right to command the consciences of men."

To show that all that he has indicated may be realized, our author says:—

It is to be especially noted as one of the most hopeful signs of gaining the desired object, to secure legislation that shall forever settle the matter in the interests of the Church, that nearly all the States have enacted laws recognizing the sanctity of the Sabbath, as held by the Church.

Following this he very logically argues that

if government, State or national, has the right in any degree to abridge or interfere with the right of conscience, of punishing by fine and imprisonment the Seventh-day Baptists and others of like faith who claim to conscientiously regard and keep the seventh day as the Sabbath, and as conscientiously labor and attend to secular interest on the first day, it certainly can do so to any extent it can be made to appear the welfare of the Church demands.

In justification of this course our author presents the following argument which every logically consistent National Reformer must practically make his own:—

The sacredness of Sunday in the higher sense could not be consistently maintained if the essential belief were lacking in the fundamental doctrines of the Church—the fall and redemption through the atonement. Hence, it is evident that laws against the desecration of the Sabbath were inspired by the belief that the fundamental doctrines of the evangelical order should be accepted as against the views of liberalists, who deny the sacredness of the Sabbath. It is also evident that the freedom so long accorded to those who ignore the basic principles of Christianity, but strengthens their purposes to gain the supremacy, to displace the doctrine of the atonement by that of progression, of the ultimate salvation of the whole human family. To counteract such pernicious teaching the Church should be invested with full power to suppress, at least so far as open advocacy is concerned, all such heresies. It is evident that the infliction of the vere measures that the stubbornness of these heretics might make it necessary to adopt, would call forth bitter denunciations. This is to be expected. But finding the "powers that be" fully arrayed against them, they will be obliged to accept the inevitable, to submit to the ruling laws as they exist. Better if it were necessary that some, at least, of the leaders of heretical doctrines be given to the fagot and the rack than be allowed to lead deluded armies down to everlasting perdition. But fearful as such a condition would be, it far better come than that the teachings of the Church be supplanted by doctrines and agencies that so inevitably lead to certain ruin.

He then takes up the objection that nothing of this kind would be tolerated in this age of freedom, and says:—

Of course not, under our present loose system of allowing the most blasphemous doctrines to be advocated ad libitum, protected by laws in so doing. So long as this condition exists there can be but little hope of the supremacy of the Church. But when the legislation sought for is bad, the Church will defend itself in the measure demanded by the assaults of its opposers. It is evident there is to be a life and death struggle; either the Church or its adversaries are to prevail. Can there be any doubt that God will approve any measure, however severe, to sustain his authority against the powers combined against it? . . . With this blessed assurance to encourage, all who would see the Church sustained and prosper should labor to this end with unrelenting vigor.

More might be quoted to the same import, but this must suffice. The pamphlet is valuable as portraying the real spirit of National Reform. The author makes but one serious mistake, and that is in arguing that National Reform is in harmony with the spirit of Christianity, and that the God of the Bible would be pleased with such methods. But can we wonder that this "layman" should thus mistake the spirit of Satan for the spirit of the Master, when so many ministers of the gospel fall into the same grievous error?

Christianity is of itself a most benign thing, National Reformers and Free-thinkers to the contrary, notwithstanding. Christ himself ever rebuked the spirit that would call down fire from heaven to devour his enemies, and it is only when his followers have departed from him that they have invoked the sword of the civil power to coerce men in spiritual things. The conclusion, therefore, of our author is not justified, namely that

when the Church, aided by State and governmental laws, shall come back to the old orthodox standard, uninfluenced by freethought and progressive ideas, not allowing conscience to be exercised adversely to its interests, then may we feel assured that God's blessing will follow in a measure that shall leave no doubt that the low spiritual condition, the lack of vital power and influence that has so largely characterized the Church status, its inefficiency, was largely due to the undue leniency toward all opposing elements.

On the contrary, the Church would gain nothing by the securing of the civil power. The blessing of God follows trust in him, and not force. The National Reform theory which, by the way, is closely akin to the infidel theory, that Christianity is dependent for its very existence upon human effort and support, is as dishonoring to God as it is destructive of true religion.

"When those first fair Eden glories met the eager, raptured eyes
Of our then unsiming parents in that pristine paradise,
Our good Father gave them all things, save the fruit of one fair tree,—
Set the good and ill before them, made their power of choosing free.
God doth never compel our spirits—we may choose the good or ill.
Tis the willing heart be loveth, but he never chained the will.

"Through the portal man threw open when he broke God's high decree,
Poured the clouds of error, followed by dark mists of misery,—
Error blinded human vision, so that mortals did not see,
Through the long Dark Ages after, that God made the spirit free.
So they sought to make it servile by the prison and the rack,
Till the beams of truth broke o'er them, and the clouds were drifted back."
