Enforced labor on Sunday is a tyranny, and enforced idleness in the same. To the civil, or any other, Sabbath is not and never was necessary for the preservation of free institutions. California, where the four Sabbath law is unknown, and free institutions are as free as anywhere, proves the claim for the necessity of a Sunday law to be false. Sunday laws are merely auxiliary to the preservation of religious customs, and they are necessary for no other purpose for no other reason than that professing Christians are not sincere enough to keep Sunday without being forced to it by the strong arm of the law.
