A city has clearly the right to see that no disorderly conduct is indulged in on this day's expenses; limits on Sunday or any other day. That is a matter of equity. It has no right to oblige any or refuse any citizen of hundreds, or of any other kind that is not of itself immoral, and is another.—*Ohio Gazette.*
