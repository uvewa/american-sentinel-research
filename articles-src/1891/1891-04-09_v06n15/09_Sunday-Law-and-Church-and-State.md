An attempt to legislate on the Sunday law would be the first step toward the union of Church and State, a union that has done more to sacrifice and destroy the lives of innocent men and women, than the political blunders of all the world combined. For our part we shall oppose such measures as undemocratic, and shall with a direct purpose to defeat the thing at American liberty with all power.—*Val. (Col.) Democrat.*
