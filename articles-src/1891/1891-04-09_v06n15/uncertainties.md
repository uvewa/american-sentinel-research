# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, April 9, 1891 (v06n15)

## General Note

This issue presented significant transcription challenges due to the small print size in the scanned images and areas where text was difficult to resolve. Multiple articles span several pages with dense, three-column layouts that were challenging to read at the available scan resolution. Many readings below should be verified against a higher-resolution scan or physical copy.

---

## Page 113 (01_Christians-Morals-and-the-Public-Schools.md)

No significant uncertainties.

---

## Page 113 (02_Enforced-Religion-in-Sunday-Laws.md)

- **Transcribed as:** "the four Sabbath law is unknown"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "four" may be "fair" or another word
- **Reason:** Small type difficult to resolve

---

## Page 113 (03_Referring-to-a-Large-Foreign-Element.md)

- **Transcribed as:** "Referring to a large foreign element"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Could be "Referring" or "Responding"
- **Reason:** First letter partially obscured

- **Transcribed as:** "the day which the weekly Sabbath known in the Bible"
- **Confidence:** LOW — sentence structure seems off; may be "the day which is not the weekly Sabbath known in the Bible" or similar
- **Reason:** Small print, word possibly missed

---

## Pages 113-115 (04_The-American-Sabbath_ATJ.md)

- **Page 114, left column:** "stripped, compelled, and to submit to be robbed"
- **Confidence:** LOW — phrase structure seems unusual; may be "stripped, compelled to submit to be robbed"
- **Reason:** Small print, possible word missed

- **Page 114, left column:** "compels to rob men of their inalienable right, in the exercise of their inalienable right, to become criminals of record and give them criminal records"
- **Confidence:** LOW — this passage seems garbled; original likely reads differently
- **Reason:** Dense text, difficult to parse at scan resolution

- **Page 114, left column:** "Christians but only Christians any right to approach"
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely "but only Christians have any right to approach"
- **Reason:** Word possibly missed

- **Page 114, bottom:** "even on this subject of Sunday observance care that the custom was adopted by the early Church without a divine command"
- **Confidence:** LOW — passage seems garbled; original wording uncertain
- **Reason:** Difficult to read at column break

- **Page 115, left column:** "That is to say, from the seventh to some other day, the only one from which it possibly could have been transferred"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — phrase structure reasonable but some words uncertain

- **Page 115, end of article:** "In our candid opinion of the Sunday, we are reformed, from beginning to end."
- **Confidence:** LOW — this closing line is very difficult to read; may be "In our candid opinion of the Sunday-law reform movement, from beginning to end" or similar
- **Reason:** Very small print at column bottom

- **Page 115:** Multiple passages throughout this long article have uncertain readings where the small print made individual words difficult to resolve. The overall argument is clear but specific phrasings may contain errors.

---

## Page 115 (05_Give-Us-Rest.md)

- **Poetry section:** All verse lines are VERY uncertain
- **Confidence:** LOW — the quoted poetry is in very small type and largely unreadable
- **Second pass completed:** Yes, but resolution insufficient
- **Reason:** Small type, possibly decorative or unusual font for verse

- **Signature:** "E. F. P."
- **Confidence:** LOW — could be "R. F. P." or other initials
- **Reason:** Small, difficult to resolve

---

## Pages 115-116 (06_Shall-Our-Schools-Be-Sectarian.md)

- **Attribution at end:** Transcribed as "—*The Christians of Weld.*"
- **Confidence:** LOW — this attribution seems unusual; may be "*The Christendom of Weld*" or "*The Christian of Weld*" or something else entirely
- **Reason:** Very small print, partially obscured

- **Multiple passages** in this article have uncertain readings throughout

---

## Pages 115-117 (07_A-Remarkable-Publication.md)

- **General note:** This article quotes extensively from a pamphlet published in the *Evening Standard* of Keene, New Hampshire. The quoted material is in very small print and many passages are uncertain.

- **Title of reviewed publication:** "THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH AND STATE" — this subheading is reasonably certain

- **Attribution at end:** "—*Moral and Religious Enactments.*"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — this appears to be the title of the pamphlet being reviewed
- **Reason:** Reasonably clear but unusual

- **Extensive quoted material on pages 116-117:** Most of the quoted text from the pamphlet is LOW confidence due to very small print. The overall argument about National Reform, church-state relations, and religious legislation is clear, but specific phrasings are very uncertain.

- **Poetry/verse on page 117:** Same verse appears both in this article and in "Give us Rest" — uncertain reading in both cases

---

## Pages 117-118 (08_The-Sabbath-Question.md)

- **Attribution:** "—*Lux Barrington, in Bloomington (Ill.) Bulletin.*"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — name could be "Lux Barrington" or "Lux Barington"
- **Reason:** Small print

- **Multiple passages** have uncertain readings, particularly on page 118 where the text wraps from page 117

---

## Page 118 (09_Sunday-Law-and-Church-and-State.md)

- **Attribution:** "—*Val. (Col.) Democrat.*"
- **Confidence:** LOW — could be "*Val. (Col.) Democrat*" or "*Vail (Col.) Democrat*" or something else
- **Reason:** Abbreviated newspaper name, difficult to resolve

---

## Page 118 (10_Religious-Persecution.md)

- **Text:** "was arrested fined in March, working and tried"
- **Confidence:** LOW — sentence structure seems garbled; original likely reads differently
- **Reason:** Difficult to parse at scan resolution

- **Attribution at end:** "—*Sayrest, in Leader.*"
- **Confidence:** LOW — newspaper name very uncertain; could be "*Dayarest, in Leader*" or "*Sayrest, in Leader*" or something else
- **Reason:** Very small print, attribution partially obscured

---

## Page 118 (13_The-Reason-Why.md)

- **Multiple passages** have minor uncertainties but overall reading is reasonably confident
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH

---

## Page 118 (15_A-Sunday-Question.md)

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH — most of this article is fairly legible

---

## Page 118 (16_A-City-Has-Clearly-the-Right.md)

- **Full text:** LOW confidence — this very short reprint is difficult to read and the transcription may be inaccurate in several words

---

## Page 120 (18_Editorial-Notes.md)

- **Christian Nation note:** Much of this long editorial response is LOW confidence
- **Reason:** Dense text, small print, wraps across pages

- **Baptists/Protestants note:** MEDIUM confidence — the argument is clear but specific words may be wrong

- **Russian Jews / Adventists note:** LOW confidence — very difficult to read; the connection between Adventists and Russian Jews is unclear

- **Gospel in All Lands note:** MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

- **Rabbi Marcus note:** MEDIUM confidence

- **Manitoba note:** MEDIUM-HIGH confidence

## Articles on page 118 left column (below Religious Persecution)

- **"It is very strange indeed..." editorial:** This piece about Sunday enforcement and George Washington was not given its own file. Its text may be part of a longer article or a standalone editorial. The text at the bottom of page 118 left column appears to end mid-sentence ("any more than it has"), suggesting it may continue elsewhere (possibly page 120). The connection is uncertain.
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Cannot determine where this text continues or ends
