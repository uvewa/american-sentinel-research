ENFORCED labor on Sunday is a tyranny, and enforced idleness is the same. The civil, or any other, Sabbath is not nor ever was necessary for the preservation of our free institutions. California, where the civil Sabbath does not exist, and where institutions are as free as anywhere, proves the claim for the necessity of a Sunday law to be false. Sunday laws are necessary only to the preservation of religious institutions, and they are necessary to that purpose for no other reason than that professing Christians are not sincere enough to keep Sunday without being forced to do so.
