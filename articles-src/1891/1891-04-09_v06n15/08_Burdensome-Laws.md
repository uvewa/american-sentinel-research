It is apparent that, taken as a Nation, our statute books, are burdened with many uncalled-for laws. And the spirit of the age is in this line, taxing its ingenuity to discover new paths in which to legislate, each enactment forging another link in the restricting chain of personal liberty. It is the spirit of "paternalism." Were all these laws strictly enforced nearly every man in the country would be behind prison bars. Attention needs to be given to the enforcement of existing law and the repealing of one thousand and one unnecessary enactments.
