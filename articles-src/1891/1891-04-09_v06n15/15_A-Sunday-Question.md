Rev. Thomas C. Easton is apparently not above begging the question when he wants to make a point. "We are confessedly a Christian people," he said yesterday, and then he proceeded to argue that therefore the Columbian Exposition should be closed on Sunday. We do not see why, even were this confessedly a Christian Nation, the Exposition should be closed on Sunday, for we fail to understand how such a display would dishonor the day. We are certain that all over the land places that dishonor week days as well as Sundays are allowed to keep open all the year round. But this is not a confessedly Christian people, and Dr. Easton will find no such statement or confession in our Constitution. The fact is that the clergymen of Chicago want to gather the crowds of visitors into their churches every Sunday, and receive on their collection plates the money that would otherwise be spent at the Exposition. So, of course, the clergy all over the country lend them a fraternal helping hand. We do not blame them either. But they should debate the question fairly.
