A city has clearly the right to see that no disorderly conduct is indulged in within the corporate limits on Sunday or any other day. Whether it has the right to stop an orderly game of baseball, or of any other kind that is not in itself immoral, is another question.—Gilpin County Observer.

The law can compel no man or congregation of men to observe Sunday as a religious day. The right to worship is left with the individual, as well as the object which he desires to worship. A town has a perfect right to maintain peace and quietude within its corporate limits. If baseball playing on Sunday is indulged to the annoyance of the citizens it can be abated as a nuisance, after the nuisance is proven. Such testimony, however, must necessarily be direct, positive, and from persons living in the immediate vicinity of the place where the game is played. The same evidence would suspend baseball playing in the same location on any other day of the week. In other words, a nuisance on Sunday is as much a nuisance on Monday.—Colorado Graphic.
