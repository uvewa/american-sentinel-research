Referring to a large foreign element in this country and the relation to Sunday observance, to it, Alex. S. Bacon, Esq., of Brooklyn, at the second national meeting of the American Sabbath Union, said:—

It is useless to argue with them from the word of God; but the reason which he assigns for such vain attempts hardly serves the case. It may be true that they do not place that importance upon the Bible as the rule of life which Protestant Christians in this country give it; but they also know that there is not one word of authority in the Bible for the observance of Sunday, as Mr. Bacon, or any one else, can easily ascertain. Those foreigners, with their "slight intellect, and susceptibility to argument," can as fast as we see that these zealous advocates of Sunday fly in the face of the Scriptures in demanding that people keep the day which the weekly Sabbath known in the Bible. For this is easily discerned from even a casual reading of the word of God.

Is this not the reason also why they appeal to the State rather than to the divine law? If they had a divine statute for Sunday would they be so ready to demand civil enactments?
