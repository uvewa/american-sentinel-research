Shall we have our schools secular or shall? Shall we teach history trenching on religious ground or not? The question has or has been mooted with reference to the Roman Catholics who have complained of the sectarianism of some of the textbooks used in the public schools. But the question is one that does not concern only the Roman Catholics as against the Protestants, as our Presbyterian friends in Tennessee are finding out. For they have sent a petition to the Legislature protesting against the introduction into the schools of the State of a history written by Mrs. Hunt. These Presbyterians take use in the public schools of the State. These Presbyterians assert that in his chapter on "Churches," Mrs. Hall has badly misrepresented the Presbyterian Church, and the reason for the origin of the Cumberland Presbyterian. And it is further charged that his histories exhibit too strong Methodist proclivities.

We merely say: Why should we ask or teach the scholars about the churches any way? Why, indeed, except that as sacred, the origin, and development of the churches is history, and if we want history regardless of its religious or sectarian tread, why should we stop at the churches, why not teach that department of history too? The reason why it should not be taught, is that every one looks at history with different eyes, and whether out Mr. Fulham is open to the fault charged against him, it goes without saying, that he could not see Presbyterianism as Presbyterians see it, and be the good Methodist that he probably is, and *vice versa*. In all such matters, it therefore seems best to refrain from offending the conscience of any.

The departments of physics, writing, language and literature, grammar, algebra, geometry, geology, [page 116] chemistry, hold no necessary relation to religion or to sectarian belief. But when we come to church history, will Presbyterians take the Reformers as the Roman Catholics, or will they even regard Luther as the Lutherans do? Is there a statement anywhere in the work of Zwingli or of the entering that field are we not traveling upon forbidden ground, which alike in the interests of peace and regard for the consciences of others it would be as well to avoid? So at least it seems to us.—"*The Christians of Weld.*"
