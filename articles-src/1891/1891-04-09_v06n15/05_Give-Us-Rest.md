From the sayings of National Reformers one would be led to think that labor is one of the greatest curses that affect human beings, and that rest is the thing most to be desired, thrown through trouble, the patterns for the life of life. How they feel for the poor laborer! Much more than he feels for himself in this direction. What the laborer wants is work, and a fair compensation for it. Every person has the right to rest. He can rest one day in seven, if he pleases. It is his concern altogether, without a law of the State to compel him; and the State has no right to interfere in this matter.

> "Our Father gives them all things, and, some the fruits of our fair tree.
> Set the good of all before them, made them free;
> God doth never compel our spirits—we may choose death if we will.
> The blooming heart to loveth, but is never chained to the sill."

> "Through the petal man there when the wind is at the height—
> God help them;
> Under every human vision, so that mortals did not seem.
> Through the long Dark Ages after, that God made the pathway straight,
> So they ought to make it secure to the poorest and the least,
> We were drifted back."

E. F. P.
