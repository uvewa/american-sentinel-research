R. M. King, of Ohio county, Tennessee, was arrested in March, working and tried, was arrested fined in his own field on Sunday. The Judge and the prosecuting attorney, as well as the witnesses, have declared that if Mr. King and his brethren continue to labor on Sunday, they will have to leave the State. Mr. King was arrested the third time last June, he says, "I went out in the morning and hoed as rows of potatoes, working just about one hour, then went to hear the Methodist minister preach, was arrested Monday, and tried first at Hardin and costs." In the same neighborhood on the same day, there was a man cutting grain with a binder, two men thrashing a farmer's hands to shock it, but there was no prosecution for their Sunday work, both. Mr. King can see from the jailhouse windows men working on Sunday, and there is nothing said about it; of all the prosecutions for Sunday breaking in this County, of which there have been a considerable number in the past eighteen months, not one arrest has been made outside the number of those who are not unbelieving commanded Christians.

If it is true that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, it is not equally true, if we would preserve our own liberties, we must respect the rights of all others. Christians as Christians would leave Sunday laws above, and take the Bible for their creed, the conflict with those who seek shorter, sharper, more conclusive, and leave others.—*Sayrest, in Leader.*
