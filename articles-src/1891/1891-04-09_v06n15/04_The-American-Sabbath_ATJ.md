Much inquiry has been made lately, as to what is "the American Sabbath." It seems to have been found out at last what it is. It seems to be the official organ of the American Sabbath Union, for there has just come to our table, page 1, Volume 1, of a twenty-four-page publication, entitled, the *American Sabbath*, which is declared to be "the official organ of the American Sabbath Union." We are rather of the opinion that this is as definite an idea of what the "American Sabbath" is as can ever be obtained. Yet, in several places through the paper, we find reference made to "the American Sabbath, or Lord's day."

Now, the Lord's day certainly belongs to the Lord. The expression being in the possessive case, the day must be possessed by the Lord. He is the possessor of the Lord's day. Therefore if the Lord's day is the American Sabbath, it follows inevitably that the Lord must be an American.

The National Reformers have been a long while trying to make him an American citizen. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, several years ago, joined the National Reformers in this project, and the two organizations have since pressed steadily together to that end. [page 114] They propose to have the Lord made the chief executive in this Nation; but as the Constitution declares that "no person, except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen, of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to this office," it inevitably follows that they must suppose the Lord to be a citizen of the United States. Such, however, is a very presumptuous position, for these organizations have fallen; yet, to it they seem to be wedded.

Now, we suppose that the members of these organizations who may read this, will cry out that we are very irreverent in thus writing; but this is a mistake, sirs. With sincere reverence toward the Lord, we simply set forth the blasphemous inferences of the professions and the demands of the American Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

According to the American Sabbath, and the Constitution of the American Sabbath Union, "the object of the American Sabbath Union, is to *preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.*"

The means by which it is proposed to accomplish this object, is by looking after "national and local legislation, for the protection of public peace and order, and of the rights of all classes of people to worship on their rest day." Every piece of legislation that has been yet sent forth or used in behalf of this cause of theirs, has been to compel the observance of the day as such, under penalties all the way from $1.00 to $1,000. Now according to the declared objects of the Union, all this is in behalf of the Christian Sabbath; therefore this Union does distinctively propose to preserve and defend the institution of Christian institutions, by law, that is, by force.

More than this, these laws are intended to set alike upon all—Christians, and non-Christians, Jews, infidels, and atheists alike, this, is in short, an attempt to compel all who are not Christians to recognize and observe a Christian ordinance. It is to compel those who are not Christians to act as though they were, it is to compel every man who is not a Christian either to become a hypocrite or a violator of the law. And every man who has the real manliness of a freeman will violate the law rather than to act the hypocrite by pretending to be what he is not.

Every man who is not a Christian, and every man who violates such a law, only exercises his inalienable and God-given right.

Let us make this plain. It is the inalienable right of every man in this world, to worship whom he pleases or whom he pleases. It is every man's right to be a Christian, or not, as he chooses. He is responsible to God alone for the exercise of this right. Every man in this world has the inalienable right to dissent from any church doctrine, and to refuse to conform to any church discipline. Every man has the right utterly to disregard every church ordinance, rite, and institution. Church ordinances, church rites, and church institutions, are of obligation only upon those who voluntarily assume the place of church members.

Now, when the State attempts to enforce the observance of church ordinances, rites, or institutions, it simply proposes to rob men of their inalienable right to think and to choose for themselves in matters of religion, and of church order. Men, are stripped, compelled, and to submit to be robbed of their inalienable right of freedom of thought in religious things, or to disregard the authority of the State. The State by thus stepping out of its place and becoming the supporter of the Church, compels to rob men of their inalienable right, in the exercise of their inalienable right, to become criminals of record and give them criminal records.

Now, Sunday is acknowledged to be a church institution only. As we have lately shown in THE SENTINEL, the American Sabbath Union itself says so. But the Union is so afraid to say this all the while, even on this subject of Sunday observance care that the custom was adopted by the early Church without a divine command. Church is admitted in this very statement of the object of the American Sabbath Union: that is, that it is to *preserve the Christian Sabbath.*

Now Christian institutions and Christian observances belong only to confessed Christians; and not only may neither Church nor State any right to require any others to observe them; but no others have any obligation to observe them. Baptism is a Christian ordinance; none but believers in Christ have any right to embrace it or conform to it. The Lord's supper is a Christian ordinance; and Christians but only Christians any right to approach the Lord's, or partake of the Lord's supper. Not only every preacher, but every Christian in the American Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, will acknowledge that this is [page 115] ever so, and would refuse to allow any one, who is not a professed believer in Christ, to partake of this ordinance. If any such non-professor, while still holding his unbelief, should presume to celebrate this ordinance, there is not a Christian in any one of these organizations, who would not count such a thing as gross sacrilege.

Now, these same people insist that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath, and the Lord's day; and at the same time demand that the civil power shall compel men to observe it who are not Christians, and have no respect whatever for the Lord. Then to their arguments, they stultify themselves by compelling men to observe in one instance, what they count those same men only as blasphemers for observing in other similar instances.

To be consistent, nay, to deal even as common fairness, the people and the organizations who demand Sunday laws, should concede that the observance of the Christian Sabbath, or the Lord's day belongs only to Christians; to those who respect the Lord; or else demand laws that shall compel all alike to observe baptism and celebrate the Lord's supper. Upon what principles of right or of common fairness can men be refused Christian baptism, and compelled, to observe the Christian Sabbath? Upon what principle of right or common fairness can men be shut away from the observance of the Lord's supper, and be compelled to observe the Lord's day? Oh, the depths of the hypocrisy and the meanness of the whole Sunday-law system are unfathomable!

The utter baselessness of the claims of the American Sabbath Union is clearly expressed in the statement of its declared basis. Here it is:—

> The basis of the American Sabbath Union is the divine authority and universal and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath, as manifested in the order and condition of nature, declared in the revealed will of God, formulated in the fourth commandment of the moral law, confirmed and interpreted and applied by the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, transferred to the Christian Church, as a perpetual legacy of rest and worship, accepted, protected and applied by civil and religious authority; and the beneficent influence of its observance.

Neither the divine authority nor the obligation, either universal or perpetual, of the Sabbath, is manifested at all in the order and condition of nature. There is nothing whatever in nature that marks the Sabbath. The week is not a natural division of time. The month is natural, and the year, are all natural, but in nature there is nothing to mark the week. This they themselves well know. Herrick Johnson, D. D., is one of the vice-presidents of the American Sabbath Union. He spoke for the Union before the Senate committee in 1888, and in his speech he said:—

> This appointment of one day in seven is arbitrary. There is nothing in nature to suggest it. There is the day of twenty-four hours, there is the month, there is the year, all these are natural divisions; but there is nothing in nature to indicate the weekly division, the measure of the day in seven. It is arbitrary, and we need that it be written if it be of divine origin.

Thus again the American Sabbath Union itself completely contradicts itself.

The second element in this basis is as knowingly self-contradictory as the one just above. "The Sabbath as declared in the revealed will of God, formulated in the fourth commandment of the moral law interpreted and applied by the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ," is the seventh not the first day of Sunday. In the revealed will of God, in the fourth commandment, and in the teaching of Christ from the beginning to the end of revelation—the only Sabbath ever declared by any of these is the Sabbath, is the seventh day, and not the first day of this week.

This is admitted in the publications of the American Sabbath Union, and even in the basis itself, for the very next element in the basis of the Union, is, that the Sabbath of the revealed will of God, of the fourth commandment, and of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, "was transferred to the Christian Sabbath or by the Christian Church." What the first day of the week, the Christian Sabbath, or Lord's day, is the first day of the week, and the Sabbath was the seventh day; to be transferred at all, necessarily had to be transferred from something else. That is to say, from the seventh to some other day, the only one from which it possibly could have been transferred, according to the fourth commandment and all the rest of the Scriptures, is the seventh day.

Moreover this, the first day of the week is not the Lord's day according to the Scriptures. This is as plain and logical as the fact of the seventh day being the Sabbath. "The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2:28. "The same Lord said" "the seventh day is the Sabbath." Here are two plain texts of Scripture; and it takes only to put them together as they stand:—

*Major.* The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.

*Minor.* The seventh day is the Sabbath. The only conclusion that can ever be drawn from these two texts is that—

*Therefore,* The Son of man is Lord of the seventh day.

That conclusion is just as true as these two statements of Scripture are true; these two statements of Scripture are as plain and positive on that subject as any statement of Scripture can be. Men may ring from the ancient or religious, to have all:—

*Major.* Whatever day is of which the Son of man is Lord, that is the Lord's day.

*Minor.* The Son of man is Lord of the seventh day.

Therefore, the Lord's day is the seventh day.

This logic is impregnable; and the conclusion is just as true as the Scripture is upon which it is based—as colossal as its hypocrisy and meanness are unfathomable.

In our candid opinion of the Sunday, we are reformed, from beginning to end.
