FROM the sayings of National Reformers one would be led to think that labor is one of the greatest curses that afflicts humanity, and that rest is the thing most to be desired, the one thing needful, the panacea for the ills of life! How they feel for the poor laborer! Much more than he feels for himself in this direction. What the laborer wants is work, and a fair compensation for it. Every person has the right to rest. He can rest one day in seven, if he choose and his conscience so dictate, without a law of the State to compel him; and the State has no right to interfere in this matter.
