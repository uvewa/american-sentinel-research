A few days since, there comes to our table a marked copy of the *Evening Standard*, published at Keene, New Hampshire, containing the following notice of a new

THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH AND STATE

There is no press, even to be leased, a pamphlet or a book in circulation in the shire, and that which is published not only to interview a hope class of people but to stimulate them to the adequate capacity of which it treats beyond anything of the kind that had preceded it in any realm. The character of the question may be disposed in an hour, as it is voluminous in its range and therefore perhaps the more easily examined on its essential merits. It involves both sides of a question. Some of the propositions discussed are both contentious and startling, but few are sensational in the main by quotations from recognized authorities of the day and generation. Much that we say of it is in the nature of a condensation which bears the charge of indulging in factful speculations. The simple reference which the author makes to the legislation sought in the direction of restrictive laws bears characteristics therein of a nature likely to arouse such interest as will has had a profound influence upon the people. In brief, it is a plain and worthy tribute to one of our best known citizens—a great thinker and one of the most valuable members of our community—but though the law gives their own kindred subjects it will be profitable to all those who wish to acquaint themselves with the topics as yet but barely appear to the reader.

[page 116] The same mail that brought the letter to us the paper containing the foregoing notice, also brought a copy of the pamphlet which this page has so lauded. It is a handsomely printed little thing, but as the *Evening Standard* assures us that it is "a pamphlet on both sides of the question," we shall give it a place. The pamphlet presents to take pews, so as to draw money out of godly and ungodly pockets. And what does the sinner think and say of this? Why, that the Church is after money.

"Disgust is as you like this, in a natural," said a rapid reformer. While it grows in wisdom and money, it is becoming so sweetly feeble and faint in its spirituality, both in the pulpit and the pews. It is assuming the temporal power and glitter of London. There are thousands of ministers, local and conventions, and many thousands of the laity who are fighting against this unholy alliance of Church and State.

Following these are other institutions of a like nature, and then comes this statement from the late Rev. Austin Phelps, Professor in Andover Theological Seminary.

We live in an age in which individualism in matters of religion has run wild. The reining of the sentiments generally back towards a return to it, on the downward grade, the restrictive duties and observances of Christian morals which none ever subject to the judgment of the civil law, every individual allows his own does that which is right in his own eyes—believing it.

To this author adds—

In spite of the efforts on the part of those who feel delusions of wanting straight, strict press given information to church interests, the fact not be ignored that its influence for good or for building up of Christ's kingdom, evangelized the world in this way, is in the way: that the garments of the Church have become ever more and more blemished; some own purposes that for the grand object of practically ruling this world in our Lord's name and interest. Look at the bedevilments, chiefs, and counsellors, every day evening of light, of those who have held high places in the Church, bringing even efficiency to ridicule and contempt what no one has even less than responsibilities.

While there are many noble examples to offer on the affirmative side, the negative fact that too many in the tendency to such examples we are observing is in a factory of morals and discipline that should sicken every lover of our common Christianity. What warning, in view of this fact, that too many should be led to question the fundamental principles of Christianity and step to other faiths, accepting the corrections of those Christians and Freethinkers. Will you or power and ask, "Whither are we drifting?" The religious tenets of the Church are based on fundamental principles of the highest character, and when in conformity to the teachings it is the duty of members of mankind then to use for this and worthy purpose.

Following this, our author refers to the doctrine of the origin of the earth, natural or the Church as anti-Scriptural that not now accepted and taught; also to the doctrine of a future punishment, and says—

When the fact is considered that in the influence of all prevailing, accepting and undermining that heretofore most sacred of these fundamental doctrines, it is then the tenets of abuse was annulled. Not a single movement of the past fifty years tending to loosened things being shaken, but ministers, as also laymen, have taken and are taking an active share in the work, publicly advocating adversely to the old creeds that had sanctioned the long established duty of conformity. To remedy this it is evident that the most decisive measures are demanded, in lieu of the publications that have so long been successfully resorted to.

The leading role fell like new falling to Congress, as also the proposed amendment to the Constitution wherein God and Christ are recognized as the head of all authority will upon find enactment, insure largely the benefits sought to their promoters, as also go far towards meeting further and more pointed legislation in the interests of the Church —much must be had in order to fully protect itself [page 117] ever measures that the endorsement of these institutions might make it necessary to adopt, would roll forth bitter denunciations. This is to be expected. But finding the powers that had formerly approved them, they will be obliged to accept the inevitable, to submit or the refining laws as they exist. Better if it were necessary that some, at least, of the local and beneficial doctrines be given for front and the rack that its adherent to had decided action are inevitably prohibited. But fearful such a condition would be, it is far better come than one of tyrannies and aggressions that so inevitably lead to certain ruin.

He then takes up the objection that nothing of this kind would be tolerated in this age of freedom, and says—

Of course not, and under our present loose notions of advancing and thus distinguishing right from wrong, any step in this direction would meet opposition, open, earnest, and formidable. As long as this condition exists there can be no effective steps taken to subdue the rebel from without. But when the legislation sought for is had, the Church will be clothed with the means to become formidable. It is at these times and under precisely such conditions, that the armies of its opponents. It is evident there is is a life and death struggle, either the Church or its adversaries are to prevail. On 'this how to levy taxation' said this field will approve nor many, however necessary it may be that they be raised. The scheme requires to exercise his authority against the powers combined against it. With this obtained Church can go on. Is it necessary to say what use she would make of the Christian sentiment and power raised to laws met not with?

More might be required to tame the subject. The pamphlet in most the office. The pamphlet is rather slenderly—the professional style makes but one serious mistake, and that is in arguing against the National Reform as in harmony with the teaching of Christianity, and that the God of the Bible is pleased with such efforts and methods. "But can we wonder that this" author "should thus mistake the message of Satan for the spirit of the Master, when so many ministers of the gospel fall into the same error?"

Christianity if it itself a most benign thing, National Reformers and deep thinkers to the contrary, notwithstanding. The Church herself ever professed the spirit that would or that it would draw down from the heavens the commission that would only be when followers have departed the sword of the civil power to coerce men in spiritual things. The conclusion, therefore, of no matter for any judicial, merely human effort and support, is as disingenuous to God as it is destructive of true liberty.

It is apparent that, taken as a Nation, our statute books, are burdened and dishonored with many unavoidable results of the age it is in this line, forcing its ingenuity to discover new paths in which to walk, each sustaining fracture another link in the restraining chain of personal liberty. In the depth of centuries— Were all times laws strictly enforced nearly every man in the country would be behind prison bars. Attention needs to be given to the enforcement of existing law and the repealing of our thousand and one unnecessary enactments.—*Moral and Religious Enactments.*
