RACINE, Wisconsin, is having some excitement over closing the saloons on Sunday. The former Mayor had the saloons closed on that day, but when the present Mayor was elected he allowed the saloons to be again opened. The church people petitioned the Mayor to no effect, and afterwards formed a citizen's association, employed some detectives from Chicago, and began to arrest the saloon-keepers. As a result the saloons are closed, only as some who have the password are admitted on the sly.

It should ever be kept before the public, that if these church people would put forth the same zeal to have the saloons closed every day in the week, it would be as easy to do that as to shut them up simply on Sunday. And when they only make their great efforts to secure Sunday closing, it is manifest that their zeal is for Sunday, and not against the saloon. Correct principles are always broad enough to take in more than Sunday, or any other one day in the week, when suppressing the saloon.
