The *Missionary Review* for January, Rev. John Rutherford, M. A., of Scotland, has an excellent article on "Extractions from Modern Missionary History," of the unmanageable interpretation of God in answer to prayer, and in biblical and avowed servants and their work."

Beginning with the remarkable deliverance of Layden, when besieged by the Spaniards in 1574, he presents quite numerous instances of the remarkable interposition of God in answer to prayer. And, evidently, with the thought we should keep in mind the Christian is in hostile lands, is among the greatest difficulties with a faith the missionary to brace himself amid the perils of heathendom.

This is the expression of a faith that believes that God's power is all sufficient for his work. The sentiment of the foregoing paragraph is, when difficulties confront the work of the Christian, instead of turning to human agencies for help, let him go to find the strong arm of Omnipotent Power, thus establishing of abiding faith; thus, believing that God is able to carry forward his work against any form of opposition, and regards it above everything. The true Christian believes that his God created the world, aye, the worlds, that he upholds all things "by the word of his power," and that his grace is all sufficient, and great for him to perform. Then how foolish is it to turn from the strength of the omnipotent God to seek help from the finite man of man, or to cower before any finite state or government.

It is said of the ancient people of Israel, "Yet, through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of aliens." The God of the prophets and apostle Israel is the God of the Israel of to-day. From this principle, certainly no Christian can dissent.

Those thoughts are recommended to the consideration of our National Reform friends who are so bold in their demands for human laws to assist them in carrying on his work in the earth. Christianity never was and never can be supported by enactments; it often shines at the brightest when the advancing columns are marching in the face of opposing legislation.
