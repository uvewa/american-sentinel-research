THAT Sunday laws are not enforced against the very class which we are told they are especially designed to reach, has just been illustrated in Walla Walla, Wash. The *Walla-Journal*, of that city, in its issue of August 1, gives the following account of a typical case:—

Probably what was the saddest thing that was set on a case in this county was the jury trial set for the violation of the Sunday law in Justice Taylor's court, Friday. The verdict was "Not guilty." Prosecuting Attorney Blanchard was shown the witness of the Sunday closing law, and the failure surely does not lay upon the shoulders nor upon any of the public officers. The responsibility rests entirely with the jury. The man who was put on the stand was Shankel Robbins, who testified that he was in the saloon, saw beer poured over the bar at least at. Twenty or thirty men were in the saloon all day. His evidence was corroborated by that of other witnesses. About the same agreements were made to the officer on the previous day but were completely refused by the prosecution. The jury, after discussing only the minutes, returned a verdict of not guilty.

If the defendant had been a poor Sabbatarian on trial for digging potatoes or plowing, greatly to the annoyance and scandal of his Sunday-keeping neighbors, a different verdict might have been secured. Certain it is that as a rule finders law are made effective only in the most petty cases. They should be wiped off everywhere.
