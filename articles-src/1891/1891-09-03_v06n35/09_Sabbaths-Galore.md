We have the "Continental Sunday," the "Puritan Sabbath," the "American Sabbath," and now, if Judge Hammond is correctly reported, we have "civil Sabbath galore." Of his decision in the King case, the *Missionary Review* says:—

By Judge Hammond's decision the defendant is permitted to observe Saturday as a civil right to observe his sentence. The decision is based, not on the consideration of the Sabbath as a religious institution, but as a civil one, under the process of Tennessee law, and that it is *not a day of Sunday spent in the form by his law that it is a duty to the State to keep Sunday as a day of rest.*

It appears then that King is condemned for recalling the Tennessee solitude. This institution, however, can be rediscovered only by those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath—or the Turk—remainder—of *Sign of the Times.*
