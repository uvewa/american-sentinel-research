THE nearest formula, as to human conduct, to the teachings of Jesus is found in the Declaration of Independence; and the Constitution of the United States is the embodiment, as near as may be, of those principles in the management of organized society.

THESE liberal principles are the outgrowth of the doctrines taught by Christ, and put into our national political system by the joint efforts of liberal Christian ministers, and philosophical statesmen, and the good done to religion and humanity will be an everlasting monument to those noble men whose efforts were not put forth in vain.

"It is strange that professed followers of Christ should forget the lines defined and ordered by the Founder of our religion, and appeal to the State to aid them with its fines and prisons in the spread of religious truths, when the facts are ever before us to prove that in this country, where Church and State have thus far been divorced, Christianity is on a better and more promising footing than it is in any other country on the globe."

WE do not charge the National Reformers with the intention to follow the example of the Papacy, nor with any purpose to oppose themselves to the truth of God by usurping his prerogatives; far from it; but we do charge that their zeal for God and for his law is not according to knowledge. Their purpose is to honor God by requiring all to acknowledge him as the rightful ruler of this Nation, and of all nations; but the effect of their proposed amendment would be to put the Government in the place of God, to substitute for the divine law human interpretation of that law, and so to destroy allegiance to God.
