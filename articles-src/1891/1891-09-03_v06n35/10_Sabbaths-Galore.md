We have the "Continental Sunday," the "Puritan Sabbath," the "American Sabbath," and now, if Judge Hammond is correctly reported, we will have State sabbaths galore. Of his decision in the King case, the report says:—

By Judge Hammond's decision the defendant is remanded back to the custody of the sheriff to serve his sentence. The decision is based, not so much on the constitutionality of the Sabbath clause, as upon the fact that King was convicted under due process of Tennessee law, and that it is not in the province of the Federal Court to review the case. Judge Hammond rules, however, that if man has set Sunday apart in due form by his law for rest, it must be obeyed as man's law, if not as God's law.

It appears then that King is condemned for violating the Tennessee sabbath. This institution, however, can be violated only by those who observe the seventh-day Sabbath; all others are exempt. Great is Sunday of the Tennesseeans!
