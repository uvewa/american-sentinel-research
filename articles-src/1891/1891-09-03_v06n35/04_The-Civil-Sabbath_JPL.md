Sabbath observance is nothing more nor less, than a religious business. Under the United States Constitution as it now is, any number of persons may observe any day of the week as a Sabbath, or keep no day at all, as they choose. No one may interfere with another, on account of his religious, or non-religious views. Hence, upon this question, all are upon an equality. And yet there are those who are dissatisfied with this impartiality. They claim the need of a "civil Sabbath" law.

Well, if such a thing could be, it is now already provided for by the Constitution, on equal terms with the religious Sabbath. Any number of persons may observe it (if such a thing could be) to their heart's content, and none could lawfully molest them. What more does anybody need?

There is something singular about this so called "civil Sabbath" movement. The prime movers therein, are religious Sunday-keepers. What do they want with another kind of Sabbath? It seems as though one kind of a Sabbath ought to be enough for anybody. And in reality it is. No one needs, neither desires, more than one Sabbath for his own use. Proof: Suppose those who observe the seventh day "according to the commandment," should get a law to compel the observance of Saturday, would it suit Sunday-keepers? No, indeed! Well, on the other hand: Suppose those who keep no Sabbath, should get a law to forbid all Sabbath observance, would it suit Sunday-keepers? No, indeed! Then can they tell why they are working so hard to do to others, that which they would not, that others should do to them? Some, if not all of them claim to love Jesus, and to believe the word which says of Jesus: "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."

Did Jesus attempt to get a law to force any one to do as he thought was right? Nay, verily. Do they indeed, walk as he walked?
