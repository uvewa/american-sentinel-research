The Scripture says that "the powers that be are ordained of God." How is it done? Is it direct and miraculous or providential? Jer. 27:5-8 says that the power of Nebuchadnezzar as king of Babylon was ordained of God. Did God send a prophet or a priest to anoint him king? or did he send a heavenly messenger, to Moses and Gideon? Not at all. Nebuchadnezzar was king because he was the son of his father, who was king. How did his father become king? Thus: In fact, i. e., Babylon was but a province of the empire of Assyria, and Media was likewise. Both revolted, and soon. The king of Assyria gave command, and issued a large force, went him to Babylon to quell the revolt, while he himself led other force into Media, and put down the insurrection there. Nabopolassar did his work so well in Babylon that the king of Assyria rewarded him with the command of that province, with the title, of king of Babylon. Thus we see Nabopolassar received his power from the king of Assyria. This was how Nebuchadnezzar got his power from his father, Asshurbanapal; Asshurbanapal received his from his father, Esarhaddon. Esarhaddon governing got his from his father, Sennacherib. Sennacherib, from his father, Sargon, and Sargon received his from the troops in the field, and national reforms from the people. Thus we see that the power of the kingdom of Babylon and of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of it, and his son, or of his son's was, simply providential, and sprung ultimately from the people.

Take, for instance, Queen Victoria, of Great Britain. How did she be- [page 274] come so? Simply by the fact that she was the first in the line of succession when William the Fourth died. Through some line she traces her royal lineage to William the Conqueror? But who was William the Conqueror? He was a Norman chief who led his forces into England in 1066, and established his power there. How did he become a chief of the Normans? The Normans made him their chief, so that in that line it is clear that the power of Queen Victoria springs from the people.

Take the other line. The house that now rules Britain, represented in Victoria, is the House of Hanover. Hanover is the province of Germany. How did the House of Hanover get into England? When Queen Anne died, the line of succession, one George of Hanover, who became king of England under the title of George the First. How did he receive his princely dignity? Through his lineage from Frederick Barbarossa, in 1152. Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud, who received the Duchy of Saxony from Frederick Barbarossa, in 1142. Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud, was a prince of the House of Guelph, of Swabia. And the House of Guelph was a prince of the Allemani, who invaded the Roman Empire and established their power in what is now a portion of Southern Germany—and what we know the German nation and empire. But who made this man prince? The savage tribes of Germany. So that in this line also the royal dignity of Queen Victoria springs from the people.

Besides this the governmental power of Queen Victoria was the wager extirpated, controlled, limited, the people. It has been related, and we have seen it in print, although the story may not be true, yet it will serve to illustrate the point, that on one occasion Gladstone, while Prime Minister and leader of the House of Commons, took a carriage, and started to enter a park. She did not exactly approve of it, and said she would not sign it. Gladstone calmly replied, "Your majesty must sign it." "Must sign it!" exclaimed the queen, "Must I sign it? Am I not the queen? I am the queen of England!" Gladstone calmly replied, "Yes, your majesty, but I am the people of England." And she had to sign it. The people of England did not commission the queen of England. The power of the people of England is above that of the queen of England. She is there to simply the representative of their power.

They are not personal sovereigns in themselves who are referred to in the words, "The powers that be are ordained of God." It is the governmental power, of which the sovereign is the representative, and that sovereign receives his power from the people. Outside of this a ruler who has ruled by right on earth, whose dignity was not derived from the people, either express, or permissive. In fact there is not really a sovereign, who is not ordained of God, nor any particular form of government. It is the genius of government itself. The absence of government is anarchy. Anarchy is without governmental condition. But the Scriptures say, "God is not the author of confusion." God is the God of order. He has ordained order, and he has put this into man himself that idea of government, of self-government, which is the first has of nations, which organize itself into forms of one kind or another, wherever men dwell on the face of the earth; and it is for men themselves to say what shall be the forms of government under which they shall live; or one nation, what shall be another has another. This genius of civil order springs from God; its exercise (which in legitimate spheres is ordained of God, and the Declaration of Independence simply asserted the eternal truth of God when it said, "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." Whether it be exercised in one form of government or another, it matters not. The governmental power and order thus ordained of God is from the people.

If the people choose to change their form of government, it is the same power still, and is to be respected still. The power was not ordained of God in its legislatures or census, it is by obligation of the former to their relation to their fellow-men; but no power, whether exercised through one form or another, is ordained of God to its functions pertaining to God, nor has it anything whatever to do with man's relation to God.

We have before shown that the Constitution of the United States is the only form of government that has ever been on earth that is in harmony with the principle announced by Christ, demanding of men only that which is Caesar's and of men to enter in any way into the fold of man's relationship to God. This Constitution sprung from the principles of the Declaration of Independence, and on this point simply asserts the truth of God.

"The American flag is a complete guarantee to the one-hundredth part, the value of the Constitution under which they live. They do not in any far degree the noble men who pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, that these principles might be our heritage. All that is or might have been, is all integrity to the principles of the Declaration of Independence. All allegiance to the Constitution is at once as, under which we live, which gives to Creator all His due, and leaves men to render to God all that they, instructed by the word of God, guided by their own conscience enlightened by the Spirit of God, may see must be requires of them. May the awful face of Horsemen blow in infinity pity upon the poor deluded wretches who think they are doing God service in their efforts to subvert the Constitution, and men's liberties under it, by means a sumptuous amendment. And may heaven's thrice blessed mercy be on about the poor people who have lost respect for Jesus Christ and their right to worship God, when these people shall have accomplished their purposes."
