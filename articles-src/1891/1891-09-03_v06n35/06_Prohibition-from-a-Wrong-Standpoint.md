THE SENTINEL is not and never has been opposed to the prohibition of the liquor traffic on proper civil grounds. It may be that under existing conditions prohibition is not practicable, that it does not affect the principle. If the measure is a menace to the peace and safety of society, if it makes criminals and paupers, if it increases the burdens of taxation, if it endangers life and destroys property, its abolition is demanded.

But this is not the standpoint from which prohibition is advocated by the majority of those who are in favor of it. Very unfortunately, it is made a religious question. It is proposed to prohibit the liquor traffic and as a menace to civil society, but as a sin against God. That it a most serious mistake. It is a mistake because to which the Prohibition party are very generally committed. This fact and illustrated by the following clipping, which among others, were adopted by the Prohibitionists of St. Lawrence County, in their recent convention at Ogdensburg, this State:—

> "Resolving, the question of how to deal with the rum trade is the position of the age, and the real solution to the work open to the friends of the Prohibition party under God.

> That it the interests of our Nation to make a faithful observance of the holy Sabbath and the enforcement of law looking for same, for the proper protection of the said day.

> In the name of God, and home, and native land..."

This is the assumption of a divine commission to abolish the liquor traffic ranks a greater danger. Necessarily, when some men come to act for God, they assume also to interpret the will of God; and in this the Prohibition party, as in the National Reform Association. Demanding prohibition for religious reasons, because it is sin, and because it his, this religious people they necessarily stand committed to the suppression of everything that in their view is morally wrong. In their logic, is everything that is in violation of the divine law; for it cannot be denied [page 277] that it if were the duty of the State to prohibit the liquor traffic because it is sin against God, it would be equally its duty to prohibit all sin.

It is this confusing of civil and religious things that leads the Prohibitionists to demand Sunday legislation. Assuming that it is their mission to prohibit sin, and believing it the duty of the State to sin, they demand that it be so prohibited. This is directly in the same line with the National Reformers, whose scheme of government is thus explained by Rev. S. E. Johnson, in the Christian Statesman. All civil government and all officers should take the Bible as the highest law set on the rule of action. Indeed, this help how is just as good a rule for individuals, as when the Church or in personal relations. Accordingly the whole moral law as summed up in the ten commandments, and the whole moral Mosiac penal code, would be the rule of action in Congress, the State Legislatures and in the courts of justice. Kidnapping, man-stealing, blasphemy and adultery, as well as murder would be punished by severe penalties. But the overcoming will of the people, but the unmanageable will of the people, but the unmanageable populace. As the world by right, can we doubt this as the millennium?

This we call "you would 'tend powerfully to the suppression of existing evil—all of absorbing wickedness. Public idolatry, profanity, blasphemy, Sabbath desecration, dissemination of immoral publications, oppression of the poor, and of the working once enslaved, dismantle every bar once to women, the licensed liquor traffic, transit for horses, the licensed liquor traffic, transportation, legalized prostitution, in, raucous divorce systems, polygamy, bloodshed, adultery—these and similar evils would be punished as the divine law directs."

So be consistent every where else who demanded prohibition because the liquor traffic is sin, must with arrowed National Reformer demand the enforcement of those whole of the moral law as summed up in the ten commandments; in short every logically consistent Prohibitionist is whether he knows it or not, committed already to the National Reform scheme. And this is the reason that no man who has a just appreciation of freedom of conscience, and who is willing that his neighbors should enjoy the same personal liberty ought to be guaranteed to himself citing by the Constitution of the United States, can affiliate with the Prohibition Party.
