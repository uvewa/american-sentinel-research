TUCSON, Arizona, has passed a Sunday ordinance and is enforcing it, so says the Mail-and Express.

PETITIONS to close all business on Sunday, are being circulated in Sibley, Iowa, and are said to be creating quite a stir.

THE present Mayor of Dayton, Tennessee, is enforcing the Sunday ordinances and closing all places of business there on that day.

"THE Sunday-closing law," remarks the 'Pearl of Days,' "is now rigidly enforced in Fernandina, Florida. Not only saloons, but cigar stores and soda water stands must be closed on Sunday, and nothing can be sold but ice, milk, and drugs."

AN Adventist preacher writes thus to a California paper, of a company of new Sabbath-keepers in southeastern Tennessee:

May God help this dear little company to stand firm under the present outburst of persecution which some are wont to urge upon them. Some are lying in ambush, like a coyote, to catch them working on Sunday, so as to report them to the Grand Jury.

REV. W. F. CRAFTS, the apostle of the "civil Sabbath" with the religion in it, recently visited Bradford, Pennsylvania. He severely censured the City Council for their action of some months ago on the Sunday ordinance, and declared the Sunday law of Pennsylvania one of the best in the United States. Under his direction a Best-day League was formed and committees were appointed to carry forward the work of forcing the people of Bradford to keep Sunday.

It was noted in these columns last week that the Superintendent of Public instruction in Texas had declined to give certificates to certain Sisters of Charity, on the ground that as they would devote their wages to the Catholic Church, to employ them as teachers would be a violation of the State Constitution, which provides that no part of the school fund shall ever "be appropriated to or used for the support of any sectarian school." The matter was referred to the Attorney General, who has decided that nothing in the Constitution or the laws of the State disqualified such persons from receiving certificates, if otherwise qualified.

THE Mid-Continental Review says: "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, a religio-political journal, has come regularly to our table for the last eighteen months, and is always a welcome visitor. While we can not indorse all its sentiments and views, yet its fearless expression of what it conceives to be right commends it to the thinking men of the day. Church and State, polygamy, and the Sunday law, are among the subjects that are discussed, and which must result in good in securing thought and investigation among the people. It is thinking, reflecting men that are needed in this day, and especially in America where the Government must be perpetuated by and through the intelligence and virtue of the people, or destroyed through their ignorance and debasement. Let the battle go on! The truth never came out from the ordeal of discussion with its lustre dimmed."
