An association of clerks in Denver is trying to secure the closing of all stores at six o'clock p. m., and all day Sundays. The Colorado capital people the clerks the following sensible lesson upon this question:—

The Retail Clerks' Union has everything to learn in its present struggle. Its members must impress upon them to attempt no arbitrary measures; to be law and peaceable in all things. Denver has seen the rise and fall of many such movements, and they have not left anything plainly to do in their path.

It is practically impossible, in a city like Denver, to impose an agreement to close in a given hour. It is contrary to business harmony; [page 279] it is against social equity.

It is one of those conditions with which the buyer and not the seller has to deal.

There would be no makers if no one be made.

There would be no clothing houses if people went naked.

There would be no barber shops if people are bald.

There would be no saloons if there were no buyers. No retailer would have their doors open at 6 o'clock, p. m., on Sunday, if there were no persistent customers coming in and wishing to purchase with the authoritative buyer.

"I wish to buy."

You have no wish to fight. You have liberty.

Why not construct a subdivision in Denver to elect his shop one minute from the stroke of the clock at the general call home at one to the last of their numerous army of customers. They do not buy no law under the national Constitution and Bill of Rights can be maintained that has in its interest the business of any person.

You may fuss, and fume, and clamor, as much as you please—this is the only solution of the problem, as we can perceive.

Sunday observance must be the voluntary act of the individual.

Some business houses find it convenient to close on Sundays. That is their right. Others may find it convenient and profitable to continue business on that day. That, also, is their right. When some of the clerks' unions are organized enough to deprive those stockholders of their right of their own personal property, and take a customer within an hour they will find a store anxious to fill their places in its employ.

Look to the buyer.

Or the King case now so prominently before the public.

Such are the legitimate fruits of the "civil Sabbath." Somebody must keep Sunday. It admits of no escape whatever.

Given such laws throughout the United States, will they be enforced? Against a Sabbath would be exposed to just that kind of treatment. And every such case when brought into a court, where there is evidence of sufficient malice against the defendant, will result in a conviction to pay fine. The person who is hurt in such a case is neither where should the law-breaker. In either work it is the buyer, the consumer who is really at fault. The motive which prompt the prosecution, the Sabbath breaking is merely an excuse for the prosecution. "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" said our Lord. And this was the law of God; and if any man shall choose to use it for his own benefit and to his own advantage, it is his right; and if any man shall choose to use him to the bitter end, and the law grants him that privilege to oppress, the wrong is in the institution. This is what "civil Sabbath" means. Justice, equality before the law, is a myth, as all history teaches, and as our own experience is teaching us. The Baptist desire to be put into such a position as makes him the prey of his neighbors, and if he be at the mercy of law in applying to places and buy on that which is a public holiday.

Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is having some excitement over the same line of the American Sentinel. A man had the saloons closed on that day, but when the ground Mayor was elected the allowed the saloons to again opened. The church people protested to the Mayor to act, and afterwards organized a citizen's association, employed some detectives from Chicago, and began to arrest persons. The Mayor says he will enforce the law only as some who has the power are admitted.

It should ever be kept before the public, that if the church people would quit and only fully easy to have the saloons closed every day in the week, it would be as easy to do that to do the same thing simply on Sunday. And when they only make their effort to secure Sunday closing, it is conclusive evidence that the effort is religious, against the saloon. Correct principles are always consistent. But he who asks the closing of one other day in the week, when suppressing the
