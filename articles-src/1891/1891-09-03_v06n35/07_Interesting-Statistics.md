August 8, the Census Bureau issued a bulletin giving statistics of the Roman Catholic Church and all other Catholic bodies historically related to it which are represented in the United States. The total number of communicants is 6,250,045, who are attached to 10,221 organizations (churches, chapels, and stations), making an average of 611 communicants to each congregation. The total value of church property, including edifices, the ground on which they stand, furniture, bells, etc., is $118,381,516. The average value of each edifice is therefore about $13,500. The Metropolitan See of New York, with its 472,806 communicants, has church property valued at nearly $9,000,000; that of Chicago comes second, with property worth $6,457,064, and that of Boston third, with a total of $6,379,078. Brooklyn comes fourth, with a valuation of $5,751,907, and Newark fifth, with $4,297,482. These five sees have more than one-fourth of the entire valuation of the church.

In the distribution of communicants, the archdiocese of New York comes first, with 472,806; Boston second, with 419,660; Chicago third, with 326,640; Philadelphia fourth, with 251,162; Brooklyn fifth, with 228,785; St. Paul sixth, with 203,484; and Baltimore seventh, with 192,597. There are twenty-two sees, which contain upward of 100,000 communicants each.

The church is represented in every State and Territory in the country, including Alaska, and the District of Columbia. It has organizations in every county, except one, in the six New England States; also in every county in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and other States and Territories.
