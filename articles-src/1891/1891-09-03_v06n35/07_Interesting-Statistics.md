ACCORDING as the Census Bureau issued a bulletin giving statistics of the Roman Catholic Church and all other Catholic bodies historically related to it which are represented in the United States. The total number of communicants is 6,250,045; they are attached to 10,331 organizations (churches, chapels, and stations), making an average of 611 communicants to each congregation. The total value of church property, including edifices, the ground on which they stand, furniture, bells, etc., is $118,381,216. The average value of each edifice is therefore about $13,500.

The Metropolitan See of New York, with 179,150 communicants, has church property valued at nearly $9,000,000; that of Chicago comes next, with property worth $4,875,694, and that of Boston third, with a total of $2,778,625. Brooklyn comes fourth, with a valuation of $3,516,007, and Newark fifth, with $2,795,793. These five cities have more than one fourth of the entire valuation of the denomination.

In the distribution of communicants, the archdiocese of New York comes first, with 476,000; Boston second, with 419,000; Philadelphia third, with 332,500; Brooklyn fourth, with 321,102; Brooklyn fifth, with 720,782; St. Paul sixth, with 173,004 and San Francisco seventh, with 193,877. There are twenty-two sees, which contain upward of 100,000 souls each.

The church is represented in every city of every State in the country. It is presently in every county, including Alaska, and the District of Columbia. It has organizations in every county, except one, in the six New England States and in every county in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio and thirteen other States.
