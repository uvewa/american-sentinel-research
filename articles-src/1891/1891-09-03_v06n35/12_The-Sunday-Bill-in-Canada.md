MR. CHARLTON'S bill which has been before the Dominion Parliament for some years in the form of. The committee to which it was referred cut it down to shut those out. The result is, retaining only those sections which prohibited the publication of Sunday newspapers, the running of certain railway trains and the opening of canals for traffic on Sunday. In this modified form it was brought before the House of Commons. On motion of Mr. Charlton, the promoter of that, the House went into a committee of the House on commons to consider it. A sharp debate followed, in which many of the members took part. The strong opposition on the bill from various directions, showed that the present Parliament has a majority which does not fall in with the movement, now so fast becoming Dominion that the Government, most of the members spoke in behalf of the Sunday bill, and to some of them it was not clear that such legislation should be left to the discretion of provincial Legislatures, while other opposition was based on the broad ground of religious liberty. These politicians could not be hedged about with "cast-iron laws," nor could they be whittled out of a Sunday.

Mr. John Thompson, a prominent member, spoke decidedly against the bill on the ground that if any legislation on that subject were enacted against the feelings of the Christian community, he recommended. Mr. Charlton in withdrawal of the bill. He moved that the committee rise, report progress, and ask leave to sit again. This in ordinary parliamentary procedure to defeat a bill which, in intent form of perforated asphyxiation known to Parliament.

This brought Mr. Charlton to his feet. He argued against the common ruling of the vote, but himself in fact contended that Parliament had a right to deal with the question of Sunday observance. To this the Home Secretary replied, and thus describes Mr. Charlton's last effort in behalf of his bill:

Mr. Charlton made so vigorous a fight against the proposal to drop his bill, that the chairman could hardly recognize in him the mild gentleman who promised some time ago to withdraw it if there was any opposition. There was a feeling that if there was nothing left in the bill worth so much a long struggle some of the members began to think that the one-horse parliament was asked to deal of a question far to so important a question. The bill did not make any friends who wanted a fair amount of some legislation through on this subject. Amid the cheering of the House he accepted the committee of. The defeat was the will of the good people of Canada, and threatened members with dire consequences for a close election.

The chairman pronounced the motion to rise carried, but Mr. Charlton demanded a vote. A rising vote was then taken, and the motion was carried with an overwhelming majority, and Mr. Charlton asks to resume *Jour fixed.* always—*M. d.*
