Hank, in New England, where the American persecution, and the celebrated King case was referred to, it is often urged that these things are made possible in the United States, only by the ignorance, and consequent bigotry of the poorer classes in the South. They still fondly fancy that in the old Commonwealth of Massachusetts, whatever their origin, would be enforced, if at all, only by kind hearted philanthropists, and for the benefit of the every one and hard pressed believers. Such forget the fact that, when once on the statute book, is open to enforcement the every citizen, the most ignorant and bigoted, as well as the most enlightened and philosophic. The courts can make no distinction. The judge and the jury may know that the motive of the complainant is one of petty spite, or narrow persecution, and that the complainant himself breaks the law he tries to enforce, and yet if the law has been broken, they must decide against the defendant. They can not even bring their judgment as to the justice or injustice of the law, into consideration at all, for this would be has the judiciary to extend the proper limits of the authority; and take upon itself the function of the Legislature. Already there have been no genuine cases of persecution here in Massachusetts, as any recorded in Tennessee or Arkansas.

Some six years ago, Mr. Albert Wears and a friend, both Seventh-day Adventist, having religiously observed the day previous, were quietly working in a barn at the rear of their house, in the city of Worcester. On that same day, several hundred men, who had not observed the day previous, were noisily working on a building, in a prominent place in the streets of the city; and some two thousand of the citizens were out on a gala day at a splendid pleasure resort near by; but none of these were disturbed, but an officer, directed to set on a spy, walked down that very street past the men who were noisily at work, and the residual and reached and listened outside the barn, till sufficient evidence was secured; then arrested them and, next morning, compelled them to pay a fine.

In enlightened Massachusetts, already almost notes of the people, and are told true to the memory of their sisters who drove out the Baptists, and whipped the Quakers, and hung the witches.

Another manifestation of this same spirit occurred only a few days since. The State of Springfield, received the following letter, a police officer acting as carrier:

H. H. State, Esq.—Dear Sir: I am informed that you, by yourself and others, on your premises are breaking the Sabbath law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, particularly called to the following extract from the revised laws, chapter 98, Sec. 1, which reads as follows:—

"Whoever on the Lord's day ... takes part in ..."

I desire to say if any of such a nature as prohibited in the preceding sections is present at the above-named locality, the same will be immediately stopped and the owner or person responsible, shall be punished by fine for not less than...

I presume that you consider yourself justified in working on Sunday, because of an observance of the same chapter, shall I put it—you'll find it exactly to be the case that if while a certain persons also observes the seventh day he observes the other as a Sabbath, and who is not in any business or work but the actual necessities of the day...

F. O. BOTSWAN, City Marshal.

Story in a Seventh-day Adventist.—He had played croquet six-to-one on Sunday. The people who complained of him were a good pair of Sunday keeping (!) neighbors of his, who, at the time they saw him playing, were themselves strolling out with a party of friends, having a merry pleasure ride on the sacred day. The consistent idea that distinguishing, the towns ruling out for pleasantries on Sunday, and playing croquet for pleasures on the day, and make one see an end a crafter, and the other perfect innocent, since both is gifted with Jentificial powers of casuistry.

It is surely however, from the contents of the City Marshal of Springfield—did that only the elastic conscience of the complainants, but even the law the State, makes such fine distinctions. The Sunday law of Massachusetts exempts from [page 275] all its penalties, the letting of horses, and consequently the use of teams for purposes of pleasure, on Sunday, and yet it condemns all games and sports on that day. Section thirteen, referred to in the letter of the Marshal, reads as follows:

"Whoever conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the penalties of this section for performing secular business, travel or labor on the Lord's day, if it disturbs no other person."

It is the evident intent of this section to cover the penalties of the chapter, and exempt the seventh-day observer, precisely as the minister, or other person, has a secular business and labor are specified, and sports are not, the Marshal of Springfield decides that the seventh-day observer may work on Sunday, but he cannot play.

All this is but another illustration of the way "according to the commendable working of the worthiness of exemptions. They are but class religion, and law, and if the Government confined itself to its legitimate sphere of protecting and maintaining the inherent right of its subjects, instead of despotically invading those rights, they would never be troubled by thought of it.

All such legislation as this, is a direct invasion of inherent rights, and a disgrace to our boasted civilization. We earnestly hope that the people will go far very far in this iniquitous religio-political movement. The blood of her Puritan ancestry still runs in her veins, with its taint of bigotry, as well as its sturdy virtue.

The speech of Congressman Morse of Massachusetts, in the Washington birthday law convention, two years ago, was noticeable for its prudential indifference to the rights of conscience, and its advocacy of straight religious legislation, without concealing it with the camouflage of a civil law "clam."

"In fact everywhere here in the East, in Sunday it is last talked about, and in all the numerous mass meetings and conventions of the American Sabbath Union, and its allies, the law enforcing Sunday observance has been most vigorously advocated."

If this is what they really want, as we believe it is, we are glad to have them say so even. For a wolf in sheep's clothing is more dangerous than it is a wolf; than whom many imagine it is only a "civil" lamb.
