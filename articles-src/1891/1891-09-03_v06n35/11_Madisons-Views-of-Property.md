The National Reform movement of the nineteenth century is the political movement of the fourth century over again. Then under stress of so-called Christian influence the State declared the principles of which the State. The Church established the demand and the demand is more now that the State shall do the same thing. One can hope that the result would be different? The dictated is now formulated in that "Christian morality shall be taken as the ultimate standard of right, and that our laws shall conform to that standard." This simply means to make the divine law, or rather that which the courts may not or the Church decide to be the divine, before, the fundamental law of the State. It would then be superior to the Constitution, and human courts would administer the divine law and decree punishment for its infraction. The Church and the State would both be governed by the same law. In substance, it may be said that in fact the Church it would be known as ecclesiastical; that is, of the Dark Ages, but it would be the same thing. Church simply what was done in the Dark Ages; and the evil of a union of Church and State are inseparable from such a system whether it be called a union of Church and State or only a union of religion and the State.

"According to this standard of merit, the praise of affording a just security to property should be sparingly bestowed on a government; which, however scrupulously guarding the possessions of individuals, does not protect them in the enjoyment and communication of their opinions, in which they have an equal, and, in the estimation of some, a more valuable interest.

"More sparingly should this praise be allowed to a government where a man's religious rights are violated by penalties, or fettered by tests, or taxed by a hierarchy.

"Conscience is the most sacred of all property; other property depending in part on positive law has at the bottom, the exercise of that [conscience] being a natural and inalienable right. To guard a man's house as his castle, to pay public and enforce private debts with the most exact faith, can give no title to invade a man's conscience, which is more sacred than his castle, or to withhold from it that debt of protection for which the public faith is pledged by the very nature and original conditions of the social pact.

"...If there be a government, then, which prides itself in maintaining the inviolability of property; which provides that none shall be directly even, and if the public can not, without demonstration to the public use, and devoting where the security which individuals have in their own, their religion, their passions, and their faculties—nay, more which violates the property in the opinion of individuals, in the labor that acquires their daily subsistence, and in the hallowed remnant of time which ought to relieve their fatigues and soothe their cares—the influence will have an equitable claim to have such a government is not a pattern for the United States."

*—Madison, in the National Gazette, 1792.*
