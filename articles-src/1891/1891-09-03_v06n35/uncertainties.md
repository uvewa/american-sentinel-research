- Some minor uncertainties resolved on careful review

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article: "The Massachusetts Sunday Law"
- **Location**: Page 3, line describing City Marshal's letter
- **Transcribed as**: "criffe"
- **Confidence**: LOW
- **Reason**: This appears to be an OCR error. The text reads "...and make one a sin and a criffe, and the other perfectly innocent..." The word should likely be "crime" given the context, but OCR produced "criffe". Preserved as transcribed to maintain accuracy to the OCR source.

### Article: "The Sunday Bill in Canada"
- **Location**: Page 6, Montreal source description
- **Transcribed as**: "Star-tous"
- **Confidence**: LOW
- **Reason**: The text reads "The Montreal Star-tous describes..." This is likely an OCR error for "Star" or possibly another publication name. Preserved as transcribed.

### Masthead
- **Location**: Page 1, header
- **Transcribed as**: "AMERICANTE EDITORS"
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Reason**: OCR produced "AMERICANTE EDITORS" where it should read "ASSOCIATE EDITORS". Corrected to "ASSOCIATE EDITORS" as this is clearly a systematic OCR error and the correct term is well-established.
