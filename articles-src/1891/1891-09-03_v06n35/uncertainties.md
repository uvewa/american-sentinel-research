# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, September 3, 1891 (v06n35)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is significantly below ideal. The images provided are at a resolution where much of the small 19th century typeface is difficult to read with confidence. Many passages required significant interpretation based on context, and numerous words throughout the issue could not be read with certainty. This issue would benefit greatly from higher-resolution scans or access to the original IDML files.

## Article 01 - "The Nearest Formula"

- **Page 273, Column 1, paragraph 2**: The quoted passage beginning "Every liberal principle..." appears to be a quotation from another source but the attribution is not given in the visible text. The exact wording of several phrases within the quotation is uncertain due to image quality.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW - The small text in this column was particularly difficult to read.

## Article 02 - "How Are the Powers That Be Ordained?"

- **Page 274, Col 1**: "the wager extirpated, controlled, limited, the people" - This phrase does not read naturally and likely contains misreadings.
- **Page 274, Col 1**: The Gladstone/Queen Victoria anecdote - some details of this story may be imprecise; the sequence about a "carriage" and "park" and "sign it" seems unusual for the known historical anecdote (which typically involves a bill, not entering a park).
- **Page 274, Col 1-2**: The long quoted passage at the end beginning "The American flag is a complete guarantee..." contains several phrases that do not read naturally and likely contain misreadings due to image quality.

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented exceptional transcription challenges due to the image resolution. A very large number of passages throughout the issue are uncertain. The transcriptions represent best efforts at reading the text but should be verified against higher-quality scans before publication. Key structural elements (article titles, author attributions, article boundaries) are more confident than the body text details.
