*New York, September 3, 1891.*

**Note.**—Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invariable rule to send out no papers without pay in advance except by special arrangement, therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.

SENATOR PEFFER, of Kansas, gave expression to an important truth, when he said: "Whatever domain Government involved in Americanism. The journalist must make it takes." Those who are asking various measures of religious legislation should make a note of this.

---

If the State has the right to require or to forbid one religious observance, it has the right to require or to forbid any or all others. This is why all Christians who prize religious liberty as they should, and who are willing that others should enjoy the same privileges that they themselves do, oppose all State interference in religious matters. They hold that all must be left absolutely free to worship or not to worship, just as they please.

The Bakers' Assembly 3,705 Knights of Labor, of Boston, have resolved to ask the next Legislature of Massachusetts to enact a law prohibiting the opening of bakers' shops on Sunday, and a committee was instructed to present the matter to the General Court and to end be combated, during the next few months, a vigorous campaign in favor of Sunday closing. The members of the Assembly, it is announced, will request all labor organizations to assist them in this matter.

The Christian Advocate has the following.

Speaking of the flag of our country in connection with the schools, the Youth's Companion says: "The flag, rightly regarded, represents many good things besides loyalty; it represents truth, religion, liberty, law, self-sacrifice, mutual help, and fair treatment for a competitor." Of that Companion or country who deny the flag the flag: the teaching that there are not the religious principle whatever in the banner of the Republic. They would have it represent everything but religion. Principles of honesty and patriotism may be derived from religion. They contend that in no way can anyone say our flag—not Christ and State—is not religion and the State also. This is a false and dangerous assertion. But for religion, as our fundamental rights, we have no Republic. The foundations of our Government were laid in the principles of Christianity. The teachings of Christ are interwoven with our laws, our national institutions and national life. The flag represents religion; protects it, and derives from it strength and glory."

The idea that "the flag" represents religion is utterly absurd. George Washington, one of the founders of this Republic, and its first President, said: "The Government of the United States is in no sense founded upon the Christian religion;" therefore the flag of this country can in no sense represent the Christian religion. And if it did represent the Christian religion what phase of it would it represent, Protestant or Catholic? The men who teach the flag that has no religious significance teach truly, while men who teach the contrary show thereby their desire to have their religion enforced by the power represented by the flag, namely, by the State.

PURE Christianity, that of the Bible, will never form a union with the world. A true Christian nationality is not realized in any nation in a spiritual basis according to the word of God; and "antioch, theocracy Christianity," as far as the reign of law can make it, is, as a repetition of the Dark Ages. A true Christian nation will be seen only when Christ destroys the national governments of earth and religion in glory ever a people redeemed by divine grace, not by civil law.

CARDINAL GIBBONS is credited with saying: "I do not wish to see the day when the Church will invoke or receive any Government aid to build our churches, or to pay the salary of our clergy, for the Government may then begin to dictate to us what doctrines we ought to preach, or rather what we ought not, and by favor rule us." Upon this the Christian at Work says: "The Catholic and the Church and said be private to the schools, and he will be coupled, as accord with the last true Protestant sentiment of the country. The Catholic on the right road; only he ought to beware of stopping at the first or last house."

A 1090 article in the New York *Tribune*, in reference to the International Congregational Council held in London, in July, closes with this paragraph:

"It is about the vision congress universal Church Council, with representatives from all the world, constitutes a weirdest looking; conference not to hope that the World's Fair of 1893, will be closed on Sundays."

No one who intelligently notes the signs of the times will deny but that this is significant as an evidence of the rapid and world-wide spread of the movement for the legal enforcement of Sunday observance.

---

Take in connection with this and all that it means the latest judicial expression from Judge Hammond of the United States Court in his decision upon the King case, that "to work on Sunday may be harmless in itself because, as the petitioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness, and yet, if man has set it apart in due form by his law for rest, it must be obeyed as man's law, if not as God's law."

These things are significant. They signify the general willingness to accept a legal religion and enforce its dogmas by law, and also that the necessary legal conditions are almost ready.

The *Truth Seeker* makes the following excellent point against Judge Hammond's decision:—

The Judge says that it is not necessary to maintain the law that Sunday is a religious institution, or that the laborer shall be of itself honored to make it criminal in this State to do honest work on that day. And he is however, as the petitioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness to work on Sunday, and yet, if man has set it apart in due form by his law for rest it must be obeyed as man's law, if not as God's law. By this it is, in this case, or any day of the week Sunday is distinguished, enforce their observation, and the United States courts of fact our enforce. We see the consequences of such a law; it is readily in monstrous proportion.

The *Truth Seeker* is right; the same power that can forbid work upon one day of the week can forbid it on another or all the rest, and if, as Judge Hammond asserts, there is no constitutional limitations upon the power, the minority is left absolutely at the mercy of the majority.

"EVERYTHING good," says the "Pearl of Days," "centers in a Christian Sabbath for, the public worship of God. Let the worship, come to any city or town in our country, and in fifty years from now the land will be a vast wilderness, overrun by a large barbarous enterprise in it. The moral tone of society would be such that soldiers on a large scale could not be done. There would not be confidence enough to enable men to form large business corporations. No family of culture and refinements would live there. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, would be given up to the owl and bats to inhabit."

More arrant nonsense was never written. The history of all past civilizations disproves the claim.
