In the *American Sentinel* for June, Rev. James Brach, D.D., says that the "Christian Sabbath is in peril most of all from the sentimentalism of the Church. There is hardly any subject in the interest of which it is so hard to arouse more or to scatter an audience, even among Christians, on this subject of the Sabbath." He then follows with an exhortation to the ministers to agitate this question: "If the Christian conscience is aroused."

In another article in the same paper, Professor J. L. McIlhenny, Secretary of the fourth district of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in giving a report of his work in Wheeling, West Virginia, says: "I was told that it was a common thing for the grocery and the church members of a certain denomination do the same thing as the sabbath; and the pastor of the congregation had frequently spoken of these things." He further adds, that "the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Wheeling, had out a flaming placard for an excursion test Sabbath from Pittsburg to Wheeling, at $1.00 for the round trip. Ministers from Pittsburg, and their congregation, pastors and their congregations of neighboring towns, were all invited to the grand rally on that day. If the law, the boldest and most outrageous act was the creation of the Sabbath by the Church that I have ever known."

Mr. Little, of Dorchester, Massachusetts, in a paper read before the Congregational Council of the World, at London, says: "No institution of society, not the Church, more difficult and important than any other, was to be right in its creative in the Sabbath. Some of the greatest Christians to the other observance of the day were the thoughtless habits of Christian people."

A minister in Duluth, Minnesota, in discussing the Sunday question, said: "Not Protestantism the rum-shops are closed, mails are being sent over the land, manufacturers in action, men are working immorally, and we poor Christians are patronizing their employers."

Charles A. Blanchard, President of Wheaton (Illinois) College, wrote recently in regard to the perils of the Christian Sabbath:—

"Not only upon race the smoking, on the pulpit and the large barely failed, the paraders of the day, have been more largely and manifestly. Protestant Christians break the Sabbath in their homes first of all, because when the Church employ in the stores the profits of Sabbath breaking. So that men of the world look at the methods of Church members and non-Church members make no difference whether man keep the Sabbath or not, all who wish to stay open on Sunday; in my own preference my preference be obedient to God, to visit churches."

In regard to the means to be used to change the present condition of Sunday work and amusements, he further says:

My opinion is that if the Church alone would begin to do rightly there would be a reformation of morals of public places in regard to the Lord's day, so worthy of that it is regarded. If Presidents, teachers in theological seminaries, and leading ministers would begin by calling on pastors of churches and Sunday newspapers; so work on that day; work all legitimate matters; to be released in Sabbath, economy; console that the real service of our order closes should be restricted to publications on behalf of observance of our fellow day, of the Church that in the future in time, this Sabbath day will not be ours if we do not reform in the Church first. Well for us if it will in very largely on the close of the day of rest.

It is too bad that "Christians" will persist in sinning; ask; why is it that they won't keep Sunday anyway? But if they might more pertinently ask, why it is that so many of them are unwilling for laws to compel everybody to keep Sunday when they do not keep it themselves? Do they realize an inability to keep the day, and so ask the Government to station an army of brass buttoned blue coats about them and compel them to their duty? And consider the example of some one commands does not exhort him for working, or for the obstinate among the flock, on amusement on Sunday, does this class of Christians ask a law to compel everybody to keep Sunday for fear their weak knees and undeveloped spines cannot sustain them against the Sunday breaking
