Sabbath observance is nothing more than a man, that is a religious business. Under the United States Constitution, as it now is, any number of persons may observe any day of the week as the Sabbath, or any day or all, as they choose. No one may interfere with another, or occasion of his religious, or non-religious views. Hence, upon this question, all are upon an equality. And yet there are those who are dissatisfied with this impartiality. They claim the need of a "civil Sabbath" law.

Well, I wish a thing could be, it is now already provided for by the Constitution; on equal terms with the religious Sabbath. Any number of persons may observe or (if such a thing could to) their heart's content, and could hardly hereafter molest them. What more does anybody need?

There is a something altogether else that is called "civil Sabbath" movement. The prime movers therein, are religious Sunday-keepers. What do they want with another kind of Sabbath? It seems that though one kind of a Sabbath ought to be enough for anybody. And in reality it is. No one needs, neither desires, more than one Sabbath for his own use. Proof: Suppose those who observe the illustrating day "according to the commandment" should get a law to compel the observance of Saturday, would it suit Sunday-keepers? No, indeed it. Well, on the other hand, as Sunday does not suit Sabbath-keepers, should a get a law to forbid all Sabbath observation, would it suit Sunday keepers? No, I guess. Then can they tell why they are working so hard to Christians others, that which their world, and should attend to them? Some, if not all of them claim to love Jesus, and to believe the word which says of Jesus: "He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk, even as he walked."

Did Jesus attempt to get a law to force any one to do as he thought was right? Not, verily. Do they indeed, walk as he walked?
