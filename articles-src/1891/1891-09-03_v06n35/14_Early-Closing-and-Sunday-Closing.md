An association of clerks in Denver is trying to secure the closing of all stores at six o'clock p. m., and all day Sundays. The Colorado Graphic reads the clerks the following sensible lesson upon the subject:

The Retail Clerks' Union has everything to lose and nothing to gain by coercive measures. In all kindness and sincerity of purpose, the Graphic urges them to attempt no arbitrary measures, no matter what their foolish president advises. We have seen the rise and fall of many such movements, and they have ever left stumbling places in the road.

It is practically impossible, in a city like Denver, to close all retail shops at six o'clock p. m. Such a business condition never existed.

It is contrary to business harmony.

It is against social equity.

It is one of those conditions with which the buyer and not the seller has to deal.

Now look at it:

There would be no bakers if no one ate bread.

There would be no clothing houses if people went naked.

There would be no butcher shops if people ate no meat.

There would be no sellers if there were no buyers.

No stores would open their doors after six o'clock p. m., or on Sunday, if there were no persistent buyers.

Now if you clerks have a quarrel to pick, pick it with the unfortunate buyer.

Logic is logic.

You have the world to fight. You have history to combat.

You can not compel a shopkeeper in Denver to shut his shop one minute from the stroke of the clock at the grand entree of a new year to the last minute of that year, unless he is willing to shut it; and no law under the national Constitution and Bill of Rights can be enforced to compel him to do so.

You may fuss, and fume, and chafe, as much as you please, but you can not overcome this fact.

In the United States of America no sumptuary law can exist.

In the United States of America no Sunday law can prevail.

Sunday observance must be the voluntary act of the individual.

Many business houses find it convenient to close at six o'clock p. m., and all day Sunday. Others find it convenient and profitable to continue business after six p. m., and for a few hours on Sunday. The clerks in other stores have no lawful authority to deprive these merchants of their right or of their desire. You may win their clerks from them; but within an hour they will find a score anxious to fill the vacancies.

Let well-enough alone.

Look to the buyer.
