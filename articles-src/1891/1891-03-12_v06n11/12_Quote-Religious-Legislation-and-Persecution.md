THAT part of religious history written with the blood of martyrs, shows that from time immemorial legislation for Christ's sake has been the work of the devil's ambassadors. Christ himself did not escape. A religion that needs the strong arm of the State to support it, should be abandoned in the interest of good government. Morality cannot be legislated into any man or community.—Chicago Chronicle-Record.
