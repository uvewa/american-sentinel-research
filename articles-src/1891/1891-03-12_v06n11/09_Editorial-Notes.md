It is proposed to hold, next October, in Pittsburgh, a National Reform Convention, at which papers upon various National Reform topics will be read by leading men in sympathy with the movement.

---

It is stated that the Sunday Rest League, of Chicago, has a branch organization in every ward of that city, and its members every ward of that city, and its members thirty-one thousand men and women. One principle of the League is to give municipal support to no man unless he pledged himself to close the saloons on Sunday.

The Oakland (Cal.) *Times* says that Judge Green, of that city, recently refused naturalization papers to one Rev. Avard; Magnet for You, because "he failed to extract the question propounded to him. The Court advised him to read the Constitution of the United States, and postponed further examination until some future time."

---

It is stated that the now Mayor of Savannah, Georgia, is moving forward in a rigid enforcement of the State Sunday law, not only closing all saloons on Sunday, but these horrid hat-hooks of vice, the barber shops as well. Now if blackleg will only consent that eating could only be stopped in Savannah on Sunday, the millennium might begin at once.

The SENTINEL has mentioned the report which the Independent was able to make upon the question of Sunday closing as viewed by individual members in the Congress of the United States. It will be remembered that a considerable majority of those who expressed an opinion were in favor of Sunday closing. Now if the question of a Sunday law for the Nation, or even the question of Sunday closing for the World's Fair, should come before Congress for action, can any one doubt that those members who have expressed their opinion in favor of it, would not cast their vote in congress in the same direction? And in that case, in view of the figures given, can any one doubt that a Sunday bill would pass that body if it were presented?

THE SENTINEL has been sneered at by some people in the United States, for say-[page 88 continued] ing that there is danger that a Sunday bill would pass Congress, if such a bill were to come before that body for a vote. We have cared nothing for any of these sneers, because we have known all the time, precisely what we were talking about; and the figures of the *Independent* simply demonstrate that THE SENTINEL is a sensible sheet, and not an alarmist.

This is not saying that we believe that those members of Congress do themselves keep Sunday, or have any real regard for it; but because it throughout the hand, as well as in Congress, there is in this matter of many men, who really care nothing at all for Sunday, a horde of superstition which causes them to fear that those who are about something about Sunday and its observance, which they ought not to oppose, and which causes them to think that it would be better for them, to keep on what they think is the safe side. They will therefore yield to the superstition instead of looking into the matter for what it is, and acting upon conviction. There will yet be entered by Congress some kind of a law that will commit this Nation to the doctrine of the merchants of Sunday.

*The Baptist and Reflector*, of this city, publishes an "appeal to the people of New York," from which we take the following extract:—

As to see to repeat what is familiarly known as the Pool Bill. The bill has been before us in the Legislature, and has been referred to the Judiciary Committee. The Pool bill was in 1887, and is now constantly "for the purpose of improving the breed of horses. The real purpose was and is to revise and legalize betting on race or "pool selling" for five months in the year, suspending during that period certain sections of the penal code. By a strict fair investigation, as out of the face keep running of horse and grimes of a price during a horse among the port, as unfurnished and much manner was made.

There is the same "strange inconsistency" in Sunday laws, which make criminal one day of the week those things which are not only harmless upon all other days, but necessary and commonsense. Pool bills of the Fox Ilk, and Sunday laws should be labeled out altogether.

A certain question of committee was raised at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Sabbath Union. It was this: The new Constitution as substituted by the committee directed the new Board of Managers to divide themselves by lot into three classes, whose terms should expire in one, two, and three years respectively. The Rev. Dr. Root, of the United Presbyterian Church, took the position that the lot was the ordinance of the Lord, and was never to be resorted to if the same thing could be accomplished in any other manner; and he proposed that the Union should designate the managers in the various classes, notwithstanding that the New York law required them to be divided by lot. The Doctor maintained that the State [page 88 right column] had no right to require the observance of a divine ordinance.

The difficulty was gotten over by striking out all allusion to the method of dividing into classes, and simply providing that there should be a board of twenty-seven managers, one-third of whom should go out of office and their successors be elected each year.

---

It seems very strange that men who were assembled for the express purpose of influencing legislation in the direction of compulsory Sunday observance, claiming that the keeping of that day is required by the law of God, should be so tender upon such a point as that raised by the Doctor.

Accepting the Prohibition nomination for the Kentucky Legislature, Mr. Ernest R. Aldrich says:

> If elected, I shall do all in my power to assist in spreading the prohibition sentiment and to bring about the triumph of our cause; to push prohibition in every community of the state.

This appears to have been the point which Mr. Aldrich so especially emphasized, and commenting upon this fact a western paper says:

> "A city." Sunday-law victories that is being extensively scattered in California. We have the case to us in margin, this legal, upon a day, until our Sunday law is restored and faithfully in force.

But what has this to do with the cause of Prohibition?
