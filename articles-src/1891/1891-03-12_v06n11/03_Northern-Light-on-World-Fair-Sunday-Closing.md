THE Northern Light, the official organ of the Knights of Labor of Washington and northern Idaho, Western Central Labor Union of Seattle, and Trades Council of Tacoma, has the following on the Sunday-closing question:

We are decidedly opposed to closing the World's Fair on Sundays. Sunday, above all other days, is the day when workingmen could visit the various places of interest and devote sufficient time to profit by the advantages which such an institution affords to its visitors. The National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union would never have adopted such resolutions had there been any one to show the injustice of it to the working people, who have to toil daily from early morning until late in the evening. The closing of the World's Fair on Sundays would virtually deprive them of deriving the least benefit from it, and we would rather see that Fair closed all the rest of the week, and open on Sunday, than to see it open every day excepting Sunday.

The laboring men are far from being a unit in favor of Sunday closing.
