As regard to the American Sabbath Union's proposed Sunday law for California, the Pacific Coast Secretary says: "It may operate with inconvenience to some, but consider that you must have the right to sell liquor, run theatres, and do all sorts of works of gain." Note, the Union and its supporters generally denounce those occupations as desperately wicked. But the proposed Sunday law virtually says they may all right six days in the week, even including the day which the commandment says is the "Sabbath of the Lord."

The Union makes the further plea that the Legislature is bound to enact laws that shall conserve the good order, peace, happiness, and happiness of the people. Then we are left to infer that it will "conserve the good order, peace, welfare, and the happiness of the people" to "sell liquor, run theatres, and do all sorts of works of gain" six days in the week, provided they are withheld on Sunday. And furthermore, it is proposed to advise that such occupations are all right even on Sunday if the work be done privately, and the doors thereof will be "regularly" opened some one other day in the week.

Again, it is stated that the proposed law is "to prevent the physical and moral debility which springs from uninterrupted labor." Here, again, we are left to consider that it is not the nefarious liquor traffic, etc., that the Union is in striking at; it is the moral debility of not taking sufficient rest, on the part of the poor fellows who are engaged in the wicked work. Says the Secretary: "Rest on one day in seven is as essential as rest during the other six days of the week." It is so very important that liquor dealers should not cease their power of disposing, that every body must be obliged to observe Sunday as a holiday in order to accomplish that end!

It is not here designed to convey the idea that the Union really wished to run as the quotation of the rumseller increased, or to argue on these grounds. Many of the best business men even six days in the week; but such are some of the extracts from the statements in their "Civil Sunday law." Campaigns are continually running, in their efforts to evade the religious aspect of their cause. But their true colors will crop out constantly, despite the effort to hide them under a covert that is too short at best, and thin.

This is well illustrated in the where the monthly document for October, where it is inserted apparently, the following editorial reproof of Rev. Joseph Strong: "A holiday sabbath is destructive of popular morals, because it is hostile to religion, which is the root of morals."

Now the "holiday sabbath" is just what the Sabbath Union has been holding up for the admiration and defense of the people of California, from its first advent in the State, beginning with Mr. Crafts's first visit. From first to last, the Union's rep-[page 86] resentatives have called all the legal holidays in the State calendar as parallels of their proposed Sunday-law. "Yet there is nothing that so much depression misdemeanor as the trivial amusements indulged in by certain classes who voluntarily make a holiday of Sunday."

All sorts of saints and sinners may out, and do go on extended Thanksgiving and all go on an extensive Thanksgiving; but if the same gushing outdoor sort on the next day, it is terrible to contemplate. Any religious reform, on the morning after a general legal holiday, are went to treat the "climatal with virginal intensity, and let all of them merely with merely nominal sentiments, but sad—pathetic—and shines, and make appropriately upon such tender considerations."

But the Sabbath Union's proposed law for a Sunday holiday contemplates no such a seasonable condition for contemplative moral considerations. The attractions and amusements of that particular holiday would be exactly the same as would invariable fail to receive the customary tendency instinct to other holidays, but the individual citizens this chosen to spend all or a part of the day in this undertaking, must be given to understand that on this holiday not such a crime was "to prevent the physical and mental debility," in the parallel, so that if honorably, and thus shall have no mortal place in the back ground.

And, according to the Union's own acknowledgment, Sunday is already a holiday in California, in the sense that almost any significant would have to believe it their religious people are resting on it, as was set forth in the monthly document before addressed:—

> The Legislature prohibits all such gains, and leave every citizen, as far as legislation can, free from interruption. For instance, note in connection with above claim, from a well-known citizen to the maker an Senator to hold as a State holiday.

The representatives of the Sabbath Union have said, with emphasis that, on the Fourth of July, Admission-day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's day, and Washington's birthday all are legalized by the Legislature's prescription of the Sunday too. As to the customs of things, this people demand that Sunday be made a holiday by law. "The foregoing prediction is proof from their own words that if a once done with "religious arguments and religious" reasons be all they want, they have already. The law in regard to Sunday observance, need to not compel the closing of places of business, or stop the running of street cars, or forbid the voluntary action of any private citizen. There is neither exempted one of those days that is not estopped on Sunday.

Thus already, almost or legal of a holiday as rightly protected as any of those so persistently held up as examples. But must we contrast as similar to their real
