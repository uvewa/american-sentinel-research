IN the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in matters of Church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitarian; another, everybody who believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little further, but stop at the belief in God and in the future state. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.

—John Stuart Mill.
