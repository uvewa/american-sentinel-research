Protestants are contending, many of them, for a special religious training in the schools, not of a sectarian character, but general, fundamental.

I am beginning to doubt if the matter of religion can be safely or consistently, or perhaps justly, placed in the common schools, which belong wholly to the people. I do not see how I can justify my opposition to the principles and conduct of the Catholics in this matter, if I insist upon a course which in another way I myself adopt. Ex-President Woolsey, a great Christian scholar, and among the wisest of men, said: "I question very much whether the formal reading of the Bible in school does so much good as to be justly regarded as essential." I believe in my whole heart that religious training is of first importance for the development of full rounded character, and for the saving of men's souls. But that is the mission of the Church, not of the State. "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's"

Multiply churches, multiply Sunday schools, intensify the religious example and training in the family; but keep these common schools of our country to their own work of mingling these children into a oneness of life, a unity of patriotic purpose and love, an intelligent and responsible understanding of the meaning, duties and dignities of American citizenship.

Fellow-citizens: What we need just now in this Republic is a revival of pure Americanism. There is an American life; there is an American character; there is an American history; there is an American destiny, and these are good enough and glorious enough for any man or woman who walks American soil. Allegiance to any other nation let every one here forswear. Alliance with foreign nobility let every American daughter contemn. Every other flag of any other fatherland, let them one and all be left behind, as born or adopted citizens of this peerless American Nation. We salute with a rapture of loyalty the one flag whose stripes were baptised in the blood of the struggle of a people for its independence, whose stars came forth from the awful darkness of a mighty civil war to shine with an increasing radiance upon a people's commonwealth.—Rev. George B. Spalding, D. D., Pastor First Presbyterian Church, Syracuse, New York.
