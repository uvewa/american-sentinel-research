In regard to the American Sabbath Union's proposed Sunday law for California, the Pacific Coast Secretary says: "It may operate with inconvenience to some, who contend that they must have the right to sell liquor, run theatres, and do all sorts of works of gain." Now, the Union and its supporters generally denounce these occupations as desperately wicked. But the proposed Sunday law virtually says they are all right six days in the week, even including the day which the commandment says is the "Sabbath of the Lord."

The Union makes the further plea that "the Legislature is bound to enact laws that shall conserve the good order, peace, welfare, and happiness of the people." Then we are left to infer that it will "conserve the good order, peace, welfare, and the happiness of the people" to "sell liquor, run theatres, and do all sorts of works of gain" six days in the week, provided they are prohibited on Sunday. And furthermore, it is proposed to allow that such occupations are all right even on Sunday if the works be done privately, and the doers thereof will be "regularly" religious some other day in the week.

Again, it is stated that the proposed law "is to prevent the physical and moral debility which springs from uninterrupted labor." Here, again, we are left to conclude that it is not the nefarious liquor traffic, etc., that the Union is striking at; it is the moral debility of not taking sufficient rest, on the part of the poor fellows who are engaged in the wicked work. Says the Secretary: "Rest on one day in seven better enables men to acquire on the other six days of the week." Is it so very important that liquor dealers should increase their power of acquiring, that everybody must be obliged to observe Sunday as a holiday in order to accomplish that end?

It is not here designed to convey the idea that the Union really wishes to see the acquisition of the rumseller increased, or that they want to see him conduct his business even six days in the week; but such are some of the entanglements into which "civil Sunday-law" champions are continually running, in their efforts to evade the religious aspect of their cause. But their true colors will crop out occasionally, despite the effort to hide them under a cover that is too short at both ends. This is well illustrated in the Union's monthly document for October, where is inserted approvingly, the following expression of Rev. Josiah Strong: "A holiday sabbath is destructive of popular morality, because it is hostile to religion, which is the root of morals."

Now the "holiday sabbath" is just what the Sabbath Union has been holding up for the admiration and delusion of the people of California, from its first advent in the State, beginning with Mr. Crafts's first visit. From first to last, the Union's representatives have cited all the legal holidays in the calendar as parallels of their proposed Sunday-law. Yet there is nothing that they so much deprecate and denounce as the usual amusements indulged in by certain classes who voluntarily make a holiday of Sunday.

All sorts of saints and sinners may eat, drink, and be merry to their heart's content on the Thanksgiving holiday, and it all goes as exuberant thanksgiving; but if the same gushing outburst occur on Sunday, it is terrible to contemplate. All police courts, on the morning after a general legal holiday, are wont to treat the "drunks" with unusual leniency, and let them off with merely nominal sentences; and the public—saints and sinners alike—smile approvingly upon such tender consideration.

But the Sabbath Union's proposed law for a Sunday holiday contemplates no such considerate solicitude for the overzealous observers of this particular holiday occasion. Not only will the ordinary inebriate fail to receive the customary leniency incident to other holidays, but the industrious citizen who chooses to spend all or a part of the day in honest labor, must be given to understand that on this holiday such labor is a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment. Where, then, is the parallel, so blandly paraded, between the proposed Sunday "civil holiday" and those which have no uncivil phase in the background.

But, according to the Union's own acknowledgment, Sunday is already a holiday in California, in the sense that these agitators would have us believe is their sole aim. Here is their acknowledgment, as set forth in the monthly document before alluded to:—

The Legislature prohibits judicial and official business on Sunday. It likewise enacts concerning commercial business. For instance, notes, when the last day of grave falls on Sunday, must be presented to the maker on Saturday in order to hold the indorser.

The representatives of the Sabbath Union have, over and over again, cited the Fourth of July, Admission-day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's day, and Washington's birth-day as illustrative of the Legislature's prerogative to enact a Sunday law. On the strength of these, this people demand that Sunday be made a "civil holiday." The foregoing quotation is proof from their own words that if a civil holiday, such as those now in existence, be all they want, they have it already. The laws in regard to other legal holidays do not compel the closing of places of business, or stop the running of railroad cars, or forbid the voluntary labor of any private citizen. There is nothing estopped on any of those days that is not estopped on Sunday.

Then, having already a legal or civil holiday as rigidly protected as any of those so persistently held up as examples, what must we conclude as to their real motive in demanding a Sunday law? One would naturally suppose the object of so much labor to be the securing of something not already possessed. Then it must be something not directly asked for. Some of them say, "Half a loaf is better than no bread." What they ask now they ask in the name of physical rest, in the name of a civil holiday, etc., hoping by this means to get some kind of a special Sunday law, a direct legal recognition of the day, and then demand more as sentiment can be worked up among the people.

Clearly, the ultimate aim, whatever the present pretense, is a legal religious Sabbath, rigidly enforced as such. And some of the leading ones in the movement do not hesitate to openly avow such intent.—W. N. G. in Signs of the Times.
