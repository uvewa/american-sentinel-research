In an address delivered by Col. Edwin F. Sherman, of Oakland, California, in Association Hall, Boone, Massachusetts, Oct. 30, 1889, he made some very stirring appeals to the American people to be alert to the encroachments of Rome upon our American institutions, and said every American should be awake to the danger threatening our country by Roman Catholic aggressors interference with our public schools. He charges them with "manipulating our conventions, and our political machinery, wherever they can." This is evidently true, and they have secured large portions of the public school money with which to subsidize the Italians and others for the Catholics is decidedly wrong, and Mr. Sherman says: "The time is come when the American people, by their representatives in Legislatures, should make their laws so firm and so free, something their Constitutions and whatever it may be necessary, that not a single one shall ever be appropriated for any sectarian purposes whatever." And we say, let it be so. And how to face on to that is what the reader does not understand, unless to that this Mr. Sherman is somewhat muddled.

He says:—"We require our presidents, our legislators, judges, and governors to be sworn upon the Bible; then in the name of God, why drive it out of the public schools?" From this statement we see that he is as much in favor of the Bible in the public schools, said of course he would have Protestant teachings sent. If we should just accept this at once and put it into every school, what then? For if the Roman Catholics—who Mr. Sherman says "manipulate our conventions and our political machinery wherever they can"—should become the majority as he fears they will, they would have Protestant text books out and Catholic books in as fast as possible. Therefore, we say, no sectarian text books at all, and no religion forced into any school, for, as Mr. Sherman well says, "not one cent should be appropriated for any sectarian purposes whatever."

The only reason why he is opposed to using the public money for sectarian purposes, in the one case, is because the Catholics are getting the public money, and consequently are teaching the strong sectarian principles; while in the other case, it is all right to use the public money for teaching sectarian principles if those principles are in harmony with Mr. Sherman's theology. That the thing is not in the use of the public money, but in the kind of sectarian principles taught with the money. It follows, then, according to his reasoning, that in a country like this, where the majority rule, that the Bible which contains the sectarian principles of the largest number of voters, should be the Bible read in the public schools, and the very evil which he is seeking to avoid, namely, the use of the public money by the Catholics for school purposes, would be used for that very purpose soon; for they say, "caperly prevent the in the college in the departments at Washington, are Roman Catholics. They control your nationally express opinions, they are upon the newspapers, and prevent honest reports.... They manipulate your conventions, and public schools where they can, they say for the destruction of your Government and they breed faster than grasshoppers."

Now it will not take a prophetic eye or so-so kind of sectarian principles which are long be taught in the public schools, according to Mr. Sherman's own words.

As American citizens, are we ready for such an issue as this? If not, then keep the Bible out of the public schools, and precipitate no other issue of religion. "Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the Church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions.

"Keep the State and the Church forever separate."

Mr. Sherman further says of the American people, "There is no danger of our falling from grace; we are true to the Scriptures." Again he seems to be somewhat muddled with the idea of a wholesale religion,—a national Christian at all.

In order for the American people to fall from grace, they must first have been established in grace. Will Mr. Sherman please state how, and at what time this took place because the Scriptures? We know of no such time.

A nation can only in its grace as far as separate individuals in the nation have received the grace of God, that is to say, such individuals as have confessed their sins and been forgiven; thereby being made recipients of God's grace through faith, Eph. 2:1, 8. God establishes men in grace in the way individually, not in masses by the lot, nor through baptism; it is by faith, and continues in it, but no further. When we consider that not one-third of the American people have so received the grace of God, it is evident that as a Nation we have not yet been established in grace.

As to the benefit derived by the Nation or to the individuals that make up the Nation, because "presidents, legislators, judges, and governors," are commanded to be "sworn upon the Bible" we say not by years. A larger part of these do not know what is in the Bible, and a great many of those who do know what is in it, we are sorry to say, do not believe it; for these reasons, who makes those take their oath upon the Bible? No, it ought never to be done. It is the relic of the old idea of the divine right of kings.
