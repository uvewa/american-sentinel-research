A little practical experience is worth a good deal of theory. From the Boston Herald I clip an article bearing the suggestive title of, "Tobacco a drug on Sunday." Were it not for lack of space, I am sure the readers of THE SENTINEL would be interested in it all. I shall, however, only refer to a few points, and make one or two brief extracts accompanying them with comments.

It seems that the "Puritan City," the so called "Hub" of the moral and intellectual universe, prohibits by law the sale of tobacco and cigars on Sunday; also the sale of newspapers on the street, after 10 A. M. The industriously inclined bootblack is also prohibited from shining the soiled shoes of even the pious church-goers. Of course it is argued, as usual, that these laws are in the interests of morality and religion, but where is the evidence for such a claim?

The following conversation is vouched for as having taken place between a newsboy, and a bootblack, the newsboy meanwhile secreting his few remaining papers under his coat:—

"We's goin' to be moral, anyhow," chirruped the newsboy as the policeman came up within hearing, "even if we does do widout' n…igh to eat. I wouldn't break do law, I wouldn't."

"Neider would I," chimed in the juvenile shoppolisher, who had hidden his establishment—the shoeblack's regulation kit. "I am like de minstrels in Stomes's, I doesn't black on Sundays."

The same article gives an account of the Sunday sale, by the druggists, of gin-cocktails disguised as "Woodbury's Antidote."

Many continued to sell their tobacco and cigars in spite of the law, though one clerk testified that on that Sunday morning, although the cigars were there in the case, yet he had refused some fifty would-be purchasers.

Many of the men as they slammed the door behind their retreating forms muttered a word that sounded so much like the "slam," that it was drowned, as it were, in the echo.

One clerk told the reporter that he would not wonder if they soon had a way of disguising cigars.

Then comes the following:—

As if prophetic, the echo of the words still rung in the reporter's brain when he dropped into a druggist's shop, after taking a short ride to the South end, and asked for some cigars. The young gentleman back of the counter handed over a peculiar package that looked as if it might contain cough drops or a corn cure.

"Twenty-five cents," said the young man significantly, "or we can give you something made from a different formula for fifteen cents."

The package consisted of a cardboard 4 x 6 inches, and so folded as to make an elongated case open at the ends. Around this carefully folded was a dark paper wrapper sealed at the ends with red wax. Upon one of the broad sides of the package was printed the following:—

WONDER RELIEF.

AN EFFICIENT ANODINE

To allay restlessness, calm mental and bodily nervousness, and to produce a general state of delightful languor and repose. A palliative for Nervous Cough and paroxysms of Chronic Asthma. An aid to digestion.

PRICE. 25 CENTS.

At the back was printed: "Indorsed by many eminent physicians." Along the sides appeared the following:—

DE CAUTION—This drug is a powerful sedative poison, locally irritant, and should be kept beyond the reach of children.

An infusion of 20 grains of this drug in a half-pint of water (used for an enema) will prove an efficient antidote for poisoning by atrychnia. National Dispensatory, 2d Ed. 1880.

The scribe broke the sealed ends and drew forth three good cigars. The clerk of the Court Square establishment had spoken like a prophet.

These things speak for themselves. How much has been gained to the cause of morality and religion by these Sunday laws? Many have sold in spite of the law, and thus, perhaps, taken their first step in conscious willful law breaking. Others have found means of selling under disguise, thus adding to their other sin, that of deception. And all who, on account of the law, have refused to sell, have simply done so for fear of the law and are therefore no better morally than those who have sold, only a little more cowardly. The very newsboys and bootblacks are made, by the law, liars and hypocrites and every would-be purchaser is morally as guilty as if he had succeeded in making his purchase, to say nothing of the additional guilt of swearing at the discomfiture of his failure.

Where is the gain to the cause of morality? Where? It is a question that those who believe in morality enforced by law ought to answer.
