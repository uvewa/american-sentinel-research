# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, March 12, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 11)

## CRITICAL NOTE

**This issue was transcribed from low-resolution scanned images where the text is extremely small and frequently illegible.** Many passages throughout this transcription contain significant uncertainties or garbled readings. A high-quality rescan or comparison with physical originals is **strongly recommended before publication.**

The following documents specific areas of concern, but the problem is pervasive throughout the issue. All articles should be verified against higher-quality source material.

## Global Issues

### Article Boundaries and Text Flow
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - The three-column layout combined with low image resolution makes it difficult to trace text flow between columns and across pages. The article boundaries identified are the best reading but some may be incorrect.
- **Specifically uncertain:** The flow of text through pages 84-86 left columns. It is unclear whether "Somewhat Muddled" ends on page 85 or page 86. The relationship between the Robinson attribution on page 85 and the "Keep the Schools to Their Own Work" heading on page 86 is uncertain.

### Author Attribution for "Somewhat Muddled"
- **Location:** End of the article, page 86 left column
- **Transcribed as:** Unsigned, from Newburyport, Mass.
- **Confidence:** LOW - There appear to be initials at the end but they are illegible. May read "B.D.D.M.V." or something else entirely. The Newburyport attribution may also be misread.
