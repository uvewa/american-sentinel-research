LAST week, in the examination of this question propounded by Mr. Crafts, we found that, according to his own words, the Bible teaches that the Sabbath is religious; that its observance is to be wholly religious; and that the occupation of persons on that day is to be the worship of God, and "work for the souls of men." It is therefore the genuine expression of the wish of the American Sabbath Union, when the Sunday bills introduced in Congress propose to forbid all secular work on that day; that is, all work that does not pertain to the souls of men and to the world to come.

There are yet some other points to be noticed in this inquiry which has been raised by the American Sabbath Union, and also by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. We propose, therefore, in this article, to notice what further Mr. Crafts, and Mr. Mott, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union find the Bible teaches about the Sabbath. In the writings of these persons the effort is not so much to find out what indeed the Bible says about the Sabbath, as it is to find out how to get the Bible to sustain Sunday as the Sabbath. Consequently, among the very first of the statements by Mr. Crafts, under this question, is the following which he puts in italics:

Observe that there is nothing in the record of the original Sabbath to identify it with our Saturday.

He knows that this statement is not true; and the other parts of the same article show that he knows it. For instance, in arguing against the Seventh-day Adventists for holding to the fourth commandment as it reads, he says:

We only are consistent who accept both groups of like evidence, and believe that the seventh day was observed before the Hebrew nation, and that the Lord's day inherited its birthright at the resurrection.

Now the day which has always been observed by the Hebrew nation is "our Saturday." And the seventh day, which was observed before the Hebrew nation, was the identical day which was observed by the Hebrew nation. Also the seventh day which was observed before the Hebrew nation, was the original Sabbath. Therefore, as the seventh day, which was observed before the Hebrew nation, was the original Sabbath; as that day is the identical one which was observed by the Hebrew nation; and as the day which has always been observed by the Hebrew nation is identical with our Saturday, it is demonstrated by Mr. Crafts's own words that the original Sabbath is identical with our Saturday. This also demonstrates that he knows that that statement which he put in italics is not true.

Nor is this the only evidence which he gives to that effect in the article under consideration. He constantly contrasts the seventh day with the first day of the week, and yet professes to deny that the term seventh day means the seventh day of the week; but in this again his argument contradicts itself, for he adopts as his own the argument of another, in which it is said that,

The Creator observes the week in the development of his cosmos, and crowns the seventh day with his personal benediction. We in fact know the week only as it is marked by a religious day.

It is alone the action of the Creator in working six days and resting the seventh, that makes that division of time which is known as the week. The first series of seven days that ever passed upon the earth was by the Creator made the first week, and the last day of that series—the one upon which the Creator rested which he blessed and which he sanctified—that is the day which he made the Sabbath. Consequently, that was the seventh day of the week. There was no other period or division of time in existence of which it could be the seventh day. The week was the only portion of time there had yet been. The record is that "God did rest the seventh day," and that seventh day could not possibly have been any other than the seventh day of the week. This is precisely what is argued in the foregoing extract. As we know the week only as it is marked by a religious day, as the Creator observed the week in the development of his cosmos, and then crowned the seventh day with his personal benediction, it is thereby proved, beyond a question, that the seventh day which the Creator thus crowned by his benediction, was the seventh day of the week. Consequently, again it appears that Mr. Crafts's argument disproves the theory which he propounds.

Again, he says that,

It can never be proved that the Saturday of our almanacs was the day originally appointed.

Now he constantly asserts that the Sunday of our almanacs is the day of the resurrection of Christ. And that was the first day of the week. Now as the resurrection day, the first day of the week, is the Sunday of our almanacs, it never can be denied that the day before the resurrection day was the Saturday of our almanacs. The Scripture record is that "when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun." Mark 16:1, 2. By this, therefore, it is plain enough that the Sabbath is the day before the first day of the week. And as the first day of the week is the Sunday of our almanacs, it is plain enough that the Sabbath being only the day before, is the Saturday of our almanacs.

Again, the Scripture speaking of the day and the fact of the crucifixion: says, "And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus." Luke 23:54-56; 24:1-3.

The day upon which these folks rested was the Sabbath according to the commandment. It was the day before the first day of the week. The day before the first day of the week, is the seventh day of the week. That being the Sabbath of the commandment, it is thereby demonstrated that the Sabbath according to the commandment, is the seventh day of the week. Therefore, as the resurrection day was the Sunday of our almanacs, the day before, upon which those folks rested could have been nothing else than the Saturday of our almanacs." Let it be borne in mind that this is demonstrated upon the arguments and admissions of Mr. Crafts himself.

Again, the Sabbath of the commandment is the original Sabbath. This being the day before the first day of the week, and therefore the Saturday of our almanacs, it follows inevitably that the original Sabbath was identical with "our Saturday."

This is admitted, too, in the following perfect jewel of inconsistency:—

The Sabbath is a movable feast. A Jewish by-law located in on Saturday; a Christian by-law puts it on the day following, which is just as surely the seventh day in the sense of the commandment as Saturday ever was.

This admits that Saturday "was" once the seventh day "in the sense of the commandment." He says that it became so by a "Jewish by-law," but this statement is not true. The Jews had nothing to do with locating it on Saturday. It was not their work at all. The Lord did this himself. In the 16th of Exodus is the record. The Lord there told them that "on the seventh day which is the Sabbath," there should be no manna for them to gather. Nevertheless the people went out on that day to gather. Then the Lord said, "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. So the people rested on the seventh day." Ex. 16: 28-30.

By this it is seen that the Lord himself appointed the observance of the seventh day against the will of the Jewish nation. Therefore it is as plain as anything can be that, instead of it being a Jewish by-law which located the Sabbath on Saturday, it was the Lord himself who located it there: and in so doing he simply gave to that people his own interpretation of his own law, enjoining the observance of the Sabbath. This interpretation he held before them by the absence of the manna every seventh day for forty years. This being the Lord's construction of his own commandment, proves that this is "the sense of the commandment." Now Mr. Crafts says that that day was Saturday; therefore, it follows from his own admission, and it is the logic of his own statements, that the seventh day of the fourth commandment is identical with the Saturday of our almanacs, and that that is the sense of the commandment.

And this is what Mr. Crafts finds the Bible to teach about the Sabbath. Then why does he want a Sunday law to enforce the observance of the Sabbath? As we have often said, so say we now again: It would be altogether wrong and wicked to call for a State or national law to enforce the observance of that day which is indeed the Sabbath; but it is doubly wrong to demand any law to enforce as a Sabbath, the observance of a day which is not the Sabbath at all.

All this which has been admitted in Mr. Crafts's argument, is also confessed in the argument of the Rev. George Mott, in the American Sabbath Union leaflet before referred to. He there says:—

Our opponents declare, "we are not satisfied with these inferences and suppositions; show us where the first day is spoken of as holy, or as being observed instead of the seventh; we must have a direct and positive command of God." We admit there is no such command.—Page 7.

Christians are keeping Sunday and they want laws, both State and national, to compel themselves and everybody else to keep it. What authority then have they or do they claim for the obligation of Sunday? No divine authority; because he plainly says there is no divine command for it. This is plainly saying that Christians have no divine command for the observance of Sunday. That is true. THE SENTINEL has always said so, and now they themselves say so. Yet they blame THE SENTINEL for saying that it is so. Nor is this Mr. Mott's view only. He writes under the official title of "Vice-President of the American Sabbath Union," and that organization sends this forth as one of its official documents on the Sunday-law question.

Nor yet is the American Sabbath Union alone in holding this view. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union likewise occupies the same position. Leaflet number three, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union's department of Sabbath observance, is a concert exercise on the fourth commandment for Sunday schools and "Bands of Hope." From this leaflet we copy the following:—

Question 5.—Why do we not still keep the seventh day for our Sabbath instead of the first or Sunday?

Answer.—We still keep one day of rest after six of work, thus imitating God's example at creation, and at the same time we honor and keep in memory the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who on the first day of the week rose from the dead, and thus completed our redemption.

Question 6.—If Jesus wished the day changed why did he not command it?

Answer.—A command to celebrate the resurrection could not wisely be made before the resurrection occurred. He probably gave his own disciples such directions afterwards when "speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God."

This also plainly confesses that there is no command for any change from the observance of the seventh day, to that of the first or Sunday. By what right then does this organization demand State and national laws compelling people to observe, as an obligation to God, that for which there is no command of God? Where there is no command of God, there is no obligation towards God. They themselves confess that there is no command of God for the observance of Sunday; yet they demand laws to compel men to observe that day as an obligation enjoined by the Lord. In so doing, therefore, they require as an obligation to God that which they themselves say God has not required.

In so doing they put themselves in the place of God, and require that their will shall be accepted as the will of God. They require that their views, without any command from the Lord, shall be enforced upon all men; and that all men shall be required to yield obedience then as to an obligation enjoined by the Lord. This is the very spirit of the Papacy. That is precisely what the Papacy has done over and over again. That is what made the Papacy that which the Scriptures declared it would show itself to be, the "mystery of iniquity" opposing and exalting itself above all that is called God or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple—the place of worship—of God showing himself that he is God. And the Papacy has justified itself in those things in the same way in which this organization justifies itself in doing the same thing. That is by tradition, and what Christ "probably" taught or might have intended to teach, or would have taught, if the matter had only been brought to his attention.

Now, in conclusion, let us not be misunderstood. We do not deny the right of any of these persons to keep Sunday. We maintain that they all have the right to keep Sunday if they choose, without molestation from anybody, even though there be no command of God for it. This is their right and they are responsible to God only for the exercise of it. What we object to is their assumption of authority, and their demand for laws, to compel anybody to keep it. Nor do we object to their doing this because there is no command of God for it. We would object just as much to their doing it, though there were ten thousand commands of God for it. No authority but that of God can ever of right enforce a command of God. Men are responsible to God alone for their conduct with respect to anything enjoined by him.

In review of the arguments of the Sunday-law workers, we were brought to the consideration of their own published questions as to what the Bible teaches about the Sabbath, and as to which day is the Sabbath. We have found by their own arguments and admissions that they know that the Bible teaches precisely what the commandment of God says—"the seventh day is the Sabbath."

We have likewise found by their own plain statements, that without any divine command, they have adopted the observance of Sunday, and now demand laws, both State and national, to enforce upon all, as of divine obligation, the observance of that for which they say there is no divine command.

We have stated to our readers simply, what these organizations say in their officially published arguments for Sunday laws. It was our duty to do so, and the conclusion of the whole matter, the sum of all that has been said, is: As it would be totally wrong and utterly unjustifiable to enforce, by State or national law, the observance of the day which God has commanded; it is infinitely more so, and the very "mystery of iniquity," to enforce, as duty towards God, the observance of any institution, or day, or rite, for which there is no command of God.
