THE SENTINEL has mentioned the report which the Independent was able to make upon the question of Sunday closing as viewed by individual members in the Congress of the United States. It will be remembered that a considerable majority of those who expressed an opinion are in favor of Sunday closing. Now if the question of a Sunday law for the Nation, or even the question of Sunday closing for the World's Fair, should come before Congress for action, can any one doubt that these members who have expressed their opinion in favor of it, would cast their vote as congressmen in the same direction? And in that case, in view of the figures given, can any one doubt that a Sunday bill would pass that body if it were presented?

THE SENTINEL has been sneered at by some people in the United States, for saying that there is danger that a Sunday bill would pass Congress, if such a bill were to come before that body for a vote. We have cared nothing for any of those sneers, because we have known all the time, precisely what we were talking about; and the figures of the Independent should demonstrate that THE SENTINEL is a sentinel indeed, and not an alarmist.

This is not saying that we believe that those members of Congress do themselves keep Sunday, or have any real regard for it; but because throughout the land, as well as in Congress, there is in the minds of many men, who really care nothing at all for Sunday, a touch of superstition which causes them to fear that there may be something about Sunday and its observance, which they ought not to oppose; and which causes them to think that it would be better for them to keep on what they think is the safe side. They will therefore yield to the superstition instead of looking into the matter for what it is, and acting upon conviction. There will yet be enacted by Congress some kind of law that will commit this Nation to the doctrine of the sacredness of Sunday.
