THE Oakland (Cal.) Times says that Judge Green, of that city, recently refused naturalization papers to one Rev. Axel Magnus Le Vean, because he "failed to answer the questions propounded to him. The Court advised him to read the Constitution of the United States, and postponed further examination until some future time."
