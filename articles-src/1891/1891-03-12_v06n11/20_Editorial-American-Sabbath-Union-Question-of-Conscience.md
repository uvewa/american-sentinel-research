A CURIOUS question of conscience was raised at the Philadelphia meeting of the American Sabbath Union. It was this: The new Constitution as submitted by the committee directed the new Board of Managers to divide themselves by lot into three classes, whose terms should expire in one, two, and three years respectively. The Rev. Dr. Barr, of the United Presbyterian Church, took the position that the lot was the ordinance of the Lord, and was never to be resorted to if the same thing could be accomplished in any other manner; and he proposed that the Union should designate the managers in the various classes, notwithstanding that the New York law required them to be divided by lot. The Doctor maintained that the State had no right to require the observance of a divine ordinance.

The difficulty was gotten over by striking out all allusion to the method of dividing into classes, and simply providing that there should be a board of twenty-one managers, one-third of whom should go out of office and their successors be elected each year.

It seems very strange that men who were assembled for the express purpose of influencing legislation in the direction of compulsory Sunday observance, claiming that the keeping of that day is required by the law of God, should be so tender upon such a point as that raised by Dr. Barr.
