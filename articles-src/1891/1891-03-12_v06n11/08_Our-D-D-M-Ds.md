It is generally supposed that the abbreviation D. D. attached to a man's name stands for Doctor of Divinity, while M. D. denotes Doctor of Medicine. We should naturally expect the former to be expert in theological diagnosis and ardent to avert spiritual decay and death, but to the latter are especially entrusted the care of the body and the application of laws for physical health. When, therefore, we see certain Doctors of Divinity the foremost advocates of laws ostensibly in the interests of health, while the large and intelligent medical profession is almost silent, the question arises whether this zeal is most due to the inefficiency of the medical fraternity, the real benefit of the race, or to some ulterior religious scheme under a secular and philanthropic garment. One of the latest prescriptions of this compound school is a homoeopathic dose of rest, applied externally once a week, extending from the middle of Saturday night to a corresponding point Sunday night. If the mean temperature of a patient becomes so high that he objects to the measure and begins to "rave," be he old or young, strong or feeble, he must have the additional treatment of a period of quiet in jail, unless he prefers to take this part of his rest in hard labor to pay the fine his doctors impose, to make him careful not to overwork.

Of course, to a novice in such heroic kindness it looks as if the religious character of the time selected might be uppermost in the mind of its advocates, especially as they frequently call it, in plain language, the "Lord's day," and the "Christian Sabbath," but they strongly assert that this is insulting to their knowledge and skill, for all they desire is a day for the recuperation of hard-worked men, like saloon-keepers and others.

When practicing before the public they likewise give it the learned and technical title of the "civil Sabbath," well knowing that no one can understand that language. This sugar coating disguises the real taste, however, and many swallow it as eagerly as they would the apples of Sodom, but like the poor woman mentioned in Scripture, under the doctor's care, they grow continually worse instead of better. In fact some who have tried it the longest and hardest and have most faith in it, for others, frequently become so weak that they wander away and buy a newspaper on the day of rest, greatly to the annoyance of their divine doctors.

Why do not the physicians in charge of the case vary the treatment a little and ask for a law to enforce other Christian practices demanded, for the health of the people? Paul tells Timothy to take a little wine for his stomach's sake and for his often infirmities; bread and wine are used by the doctors in Christian communion. Why not have a law to compel every person to accept bread and wine at regular intervals as a "civil communion," for his health. That wouldn't enforce religion at all! How easy it is to allay suspicion by just calling a thing something else! And then, you know, they are so anxious for the poor workingmen, no one can doubt that they mean well; and, besides this, such a course would impress the foreign sons of toil who come to our shores, that this is a Christian Nation.

Then, again, a weekly bath is considered conducive to health. Most of the doctors in the churches agree that water is necessary to Christian baptism, and even immersion is given to chronic cases. Why not unite these results and have a "civil baptism" as a police regulation, for the health of the toiling masses, under the supervision of the churches and doctors of divinity? What a grand healthy country this would be! Civil Sabbath, civil communion, civil baptism, not as religious measures at all, but for the good of the public health. No wonder the D. D.'s are working for such a measure! Indeed, it seems the more that the subject is investigated the larger the field appears, and a few such innovations carefully made would open the way to an immense practice. Those who could not be cured by these methods could be sacrificed in the interests of advancing science.

For the present all who wish to help secure even half a loaf are asked to clamor for the proposed civil Sabbath law to prevent the desecration of the Lord's day; and especially must they denounce those who pretend to see any attempt in this to unite Church and State or to legislate on matters of religion and conscience. Workingmen should be occasionally reminded that it is for their interest to take the medicine promptly, for in some States where such laws exist it has been found necessary to amputate men from society and their families because they did not rest for their health on Sunday.

This, we are assured, is not persecution for religion nor a deprivation of just liberty; it is only enforcing the law!

H. E. ROBINSON.
