A little editorial experience in the present position, is a good deal of benefit. From the *Boston Herald* I clip an article bearing the suggestive title of, "Tobacco a Drug on Sunday." Went in for lack of space, I am sure the readers of THE SENTINEL would be interested in it all. I shall, however, only refer to a few points, and make one or two brief extracts accompanying them with comments.

It seems that the "Puritan City," like almost "Hub" of the universe and its boasted universes, prohibits by law the sale of tobacco and cigars on Sunday by the of newspapers on the street, after 10 A. M. The indiscriminate incidental bootblack is prohibited from shining the soiled shoes of even the pious church-goers. Of course it is argued, as usual, that these laws are in the interests of morality and religion: where is the evidence of the such a claim?

The following conversation is vouched for as having taken place between a newsboy, and a bootblack, the newsboy missing with the newsboy his remaining papers with his cost:—

*"Wrapped in his moral, anyhow," chimed up the newsboy as the policeman come up within hearing. "Here, if you do not wish to walk up—I'll give you a treat; it does he; I wouldn't."*

*"Noah would I," shamed in the juvenile shoe-stretcher, who had hidden his establishment under the shade of a regular tree. "I can take the committee to take a nap."*

The same article gives no account of the Sunday sale, by the druggists, of cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco. It does not interest.

Many continued to sell their tobacco and cigars in spite of the law, though one clerk testified that on that Sunday morning, although the cigars were there in the case, yet he had refused some who tried to buy particular.

Many of the men as they scattered the door behind their returning from maintained a word that sounded to much like the "damn;" that it was unmistakable. Others, who were, in the echo.

One clerk told the reporter that he would not wonder if they soon had a way of making cigars.

Then come the following—

At 4 o'clock, the police of the wards still rang in the reporters; that is when the druggist of a drug store, after taking a short ride to the North end, asked for some cigars. The young man behind the counter pulled out an innocent looking package that looked as if it might contain cough drops or a corn cure.

"Twenty-five cents," said the young man significantly, and the young man unwrapped what was had a different formula of Dr. Brown's whatever celery compound or his catarrh cure. Inside was a choice cigar; and to make an elongated cigarette appeared. Around the particular cigar that was in a dark paper wrapper sealed on the ends with a seal, pasted on the brand of one of the packages was printed the following:

AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY.

*This cure is warranted to cure immediately and permanently a general manic of sluggish temperament and mope. Full directions contained inside. Good for what ails you.*

At the back was printed: Endorsed by many prominent physicians. Among the other endorsements were these:

"Doctortine—This drug is a purely antiseptic remedy for an occurrence..."

The writer broke the sealed ends and drew forth a cigar of excellent quality. The law had been evaded; and elsewhere, no doubt, the same substitution had spoken like a true one...

The Sunday-law has proved nothing but an excellent encouragement. Evidently much has been gained to the cause of morality by enforcement of the Sunday-law! Many have with in spite to the command, but it does not change, and at this time, perhaps, taken their first step, evidently violating still law breaking. Others have found means of selling under the circumstances of hiding to their own use, that of deception. And all this, we on account of the law, have refused to sell, will have nothing done for fear of the law and are therefore worse for better; while many who have bought or not to have sold, only a lip from seeking to buy, are worse too. The news-boys and bootblacks are also barred from their small earnings; and so, truly, by the law, lust and hypocrisy and every over-sold-be purchasable is morally encouraged by it as it had succeeded in making Sunday a moral day, by supplying all of the habits and instead, if anything, the conditions of failure of his failure.

Where is the gain in the cause of morality? Where is it a question for the law? Those who believe in morality, offered by them.

That part of last year's history, written also in the blood of martyrs, shows that from time immemorial legislation for Christianity has been the worst foe of Christ's ambassadors. Christ himself did not usage. A religion that needs the strong arm of the state to support it, should be abandoned in the interest of good government. Morality cannot be legislated into men or community.— *Chicago Advance.*

Union of Church and State! The word is tried for centuries—and produced a harvest of persecution and bloodshed. Let us swing backward to those edges of mercy, and try the experiment over again as certain ligion propose! The gathering is coming up for complications. Let us be prepared to answer it.—*Presbyterian Age.*
