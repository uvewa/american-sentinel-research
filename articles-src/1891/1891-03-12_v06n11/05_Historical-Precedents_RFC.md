Those who are seeking religious legislation—a union of Church and State—do not argue the question on its own merits, showing that such legislation is in harmony with equal liberty and the rights of conscience; but instead of this they hunt for historical precedents, as though the practice of our fathers sanctified anything however erroneous, and made wrong right. Accordingly they speak of "securing teachers in all American schools who are imbued with the American spirit, and are able to instruct the children in historic American principles;" and also that in the selection of text books "to see that they do justice to the facts of American history and to conceded American constitutional principles." They say that a school from which the Bible is excluded "is not in the historic sense, an American school, and does not conform to the actual character of American institutions."

If they go back to our colonial history, they will find the beauties of religious legislation exemplified in the persecution of those whose consciences led them to differ from the creed of the majority. And by a very few steps they might trace these "American principles" back to Rome. Our American Constitution was intended to prevent the repetition of religious persecutions. It was designed to protect all in their religious rights, and to give no special favor to any. If the Christian religion can enjoy the equal protection of civil laws, it asks no more. To ask more is contrary to the principles of Christianity—a violation of its Golden Rule.

To go back of the formation of our Constitution for "historic American principles" is to enter the shadow of the Dark Ages. The "conceded American constitutional principles" are not conceded by all, nor by any who justly expound that instrument. Let them come to the Constitution itself for proofs and arguments, and not plead what somebody has conceded. When they find what they want in the Constitution, they will no longer ask for a "religious amendment." Their argument amounts to this: "Our Government has been a Christian Government from the beginning; therefore the Constitution must be so amended as to make it a Christian Government."
