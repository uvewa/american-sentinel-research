Last week, in the examination of this question propounded by Mr. Crafts, we found that, according to his own words, the Bible teaches that the Sabbath is religious; that the observance is to be wholly religious; and that the occupation of persons on that day is to be the worship of God, and "work for the souls of men." It is therefore the genuine expression of the wish of the American Sabbath Union, when the Sunday bills introduced in Congress propose to forbid all secular work on that day; that is, all work that does not pertain to the souls of men and to the world to come.

There are yet some other points to be noticed in this inquiry which has been raised by the American Sabbath Union, and by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. We propose, therefore, in this article, to notice what further Mr. Crafts, and Mr. Mott, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union find the Bible teaches about the Sabbath. In the discussions of these persons the effort is not so much to find out what indeed the Bible says about the Sabbath, as it is to find out how to get the Bible to sanction Sunday as the Sabbath. Consequently, among the very first of the statements by Mr. Crafts, under this question, is the following which he puts in italics:—

*Observe that nothing is in the record of the original Sabbath to identify it with our Saturday.*

He knows that this statement is not true; and the other parts of the same article show that he knows it. For instance, he [page 82] says that the creation week consisted of seven days; and that God rested on the seventh day, consequently, that was the seventh day of the week. There was no other period of definite time in existence of which it could be the seventh day. The week was the only period of time then had past. The record is that "God did rest the seventh day;" and that seventh day could not possibly have been any other than the seventh day of the week. This is precisely what is argued in the foregoing extract. As we know the week only as it is marked by a "proleptic day, as the Creator observed the week in the development of his cosmos, and thus crowned the seventh day with his personal benediction, it is thereby proved, beyond a question, that that seventh day which the Creator thus crowned by the Sabbath, was the very same seventh of the weekly cycle, as our week is now and always has been." Consequently, again it appears that Mr. Crafts's argument disproves the theory which it espouses.

Again, he says that,

It can never be proved that the mastery of days known as the day originally appointed was the day we now observe.

Now let us consider this: The Sabbath of our almanacs is the day of the resurrection of Christ. And what is the first day of the week. Now as the resurrection day, the first day of the week, is the Sunday of our almanacs, it never can be denied that the day before the resurrection day was the Sabbath of our almanacs. The Scripture record is that "when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun." Mark 16:1, 2. By this, therefore, it is plain enough that the Sabbath is the day before the first day of the week; as the first day of the week is the Sunday of our almanacs, it is plain enough that the Sabbath being the day before, is the Saturday of our almanacs.

Again, the Scriptures speaking of the day, and the fact of the crucifixion say: "And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus." Luke 23:54-56; 24:1-3.

The day upon which these folks rested was the Sabbath according to the commandment. It was the day before the first day of the week. The day before the first day of the week, is the seventh day of the week. That being the Sabbath of the commandment, it is thereby demonstrated that the Sabbath according to the commandment, is the seventh day of the week. Therefore, as the resurrection day was the Sunday of our almanacs, the day before, upon which these folks rested could have been nothing else than the Saturday of our almanacs. Let it be borne in mind that this is demonstrating against the arguments and admissions of Mr. Crafts himself.

Again, the Sabbath of the commandment is the original Sabbath. This being the day before the first day of the week, and therefore the Saturday of our almanacs, it follows inevitably that the original Sabbath was identical with "our Saturday."

This is admitted, too, in the following perfect jewel of inconsistency:

*The Sabbath is a movable feast. A Jewish law located it on Saturday; a Christian by his custom or the day following; while in each case the seventh day in the sense of the commandment is kept.*

This admits that Saturday "was" once the Sabbath. But the Sabbath "must be maintained." He says that it became so by a "Jewish by law," but this statement is not true. The Jew had nothing to do with locating it on Saturday. It was the Lord's work at all. The Lord did this himself. In the 16th of Exodus is the record. The Lord there told them that "on the seventh day which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none;" and that they were not to go out of the field to gather. Nevertheless the people went out on that day to gather. Then the Lord said: "How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? See, for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day." So the people rested on the seventh day. Ex. 16:26-30. By this it is seen that the Lord himself appointed the observance of the seventh day against the will of the Jewish nation; Therefore it is as plain as anything can be that instead of it being a Jewish by-law day, it was the Lord himself who located it; and in so doing he simply gave to that people his own interpretation of his own law, regarding the observance of the Sabbath. This interpretation he laid before them by the absence of the manna every seventh day for forty years. This being the Lord's construction of his own commandment, proves that this is "the sense of the commandment." Now Mr. Crafts says that that day was Saturday; therefore, it follows from his own admission, and it is the logic of his own statement, that the seventh day of the fourth commandment is identified with the Saturday of our almanacs, and that that is the sense of the commandment.

And this is what Mr. Crafts finds the Bible to teach about the Sabbath. Then [page 83] why does he want a Sunday law to enforce the observance of the Sabbath? As we have often said, so say we now again: It would be altogether wrong and wicked to call for a State or national law to enforce the observance of that day which is indeed the Sabbath; but let it also be wrong to demand any law to enforce as a Sabbath, the observance of a day which is not the Sabbath at all.

All this which has been admitted in Mr. Crafts's argument, is also confessed in the argument of the Rev. George Mott, in the American Sabbath Union, under before mentioned. He there says:—

> Our representation arises ... we are assisted with these references and explanations; since in whatever way we may look at the matter of the Sabbath observance and the seventh, we must have a direct command from the Most High, or we have nothing.

Christians are keeping Sunday and must have laws, both State and national, to compel themselves and everybody else to keep it. What authority can they have or do they claim for the obligation of the observance of that day? None. They can only say, as Mr. Crafts does, that they have "by parity" says there is no divine command for it. This is plainly saying that Christians have no divine command for the observance of Sunday. That is true. The Christians have nobody else to say, and they do say it themselves. Yet they blame THE SENTINEL for saying that it is so. This is not Mr. Mott's view only. This writer quoted this statement just as it was made by the American Sabbath Union, "and that statement arises from this fact, set down as the ground, that statement which he put in italics is not true.

Not yet is the American Sabbath Union alone in holding this view. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union likewise discusses the same position. Lucinda B. Helm, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (Department of Sabbath observance), is a catechism observer on the fourth commandment for Sunday schools and "Bands of Hope." She says the following:

*Question 1.—Why do we not still keep the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, as some insist? We still keep one day of rest after six of work, and do not confine ourselves to the letter, as many churches and States still keep Saturday, as do all the members of the church. The secular power is responsible about the history as having been a change of the family of the latest prescriptions of the judges, and the people is a interpretable document said perhaps of a person's and must be entirely apart out a week, as a settling from this middle of debate and know, as in a correspondence point Sunday rest. If the mean temperatures of a person become as high had he is degrees to the mountains and require to be "going to church on Sunday was and is customary."*

*Question 1.—Jesus visited the day changed from Saturday to Sunday?*

*Answer.—A command to celebrate the resurrection was the reason. There is no direct directive what way. "going to church on Sunday was and is customary."*

In review of the arguments of the Sunday-law workers, we were brought to the conclusion of that time and from examination as to what the Bible teaches about the Sabbath, and as to which day is the Sabbath. We have found by their own arguments and admissions that they know that the Bible teaches precisely what the commandment of God says—"the seventh day is the Sabbath."

We have likewise found by their own plain admissions, that without any divine command, they have adopted the observance of Sunday, and now demand laws, both State and national, to enforce upon all, as of divine obligation, the observance of that for which they say there is no divine command.

We have stated to our readers simply, what these organizations are in their of daily published arguments for Sunday laws, it was their duty to do so, and the conclusion of the whole matter, the sum of all that has been said, is that it would be totally wrong and utterly unjustifiable to enforce, by State or national law, the observance of the day which God has commanded; it is infinitely more so, and the very "mystery of iniquity," to enforce, on duty towards God, the observance of any sabbath, or day, or rule, or thing which is no command of God.
