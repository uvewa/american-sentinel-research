Parents are continually urging, many of them, for a special religious training in the schools, not of a sectarian character.

I am beginning to doubt if the matter of religion can be taught in a satisfactory, or perhaps justly, placed in the common school education which belong to the home. I do not see how I can just now justify my opposition to the principles and conduct of the Catholics in this instance; if I insist upon a course which in another way I myself adopt. As President Woolsey, a great educator, a Christian, and among the wisest of men, said: "I question very much whether the formal reading of the Bible in a school to be so much used is to be justified as educational." "I believe it in my whole heart that religious training is of first importance for the development of full Christian character, and for the saving of men's souls. But that is the mission of the Church, not of the State. 'Render unto Cesar the things which are Cesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.'

"Multiple churches, multiply Sunday schools, intensify the religious example of Christians in the family; but keep these common schools of our country to their own work of making those children into a common life, of a unity of patriotic purpose and love, an intelligent and responsive sense of dignity and of American citizenship.

"Follow: What we must not just keep in this Republic is a revival of pure Americanism. There is an American life; there is an American character; there is an American destiny, and there are good enough and glorious enough for all men or women who walk American soil. Allegiance to any other nation let every one here leave forever. Alliance with foreign nobility let every American daughter condemn. Every other flag of any other fatherland, let them one and all be left behind, as born or adopted citizens of this peerless American Nation. We salute with a rapture of loyalty the one flag whose stripes were baptized in the blood of the struggle of a people for its independence, whose stars came from the awful darkness of a mighty civil war to shine with increasing brilliance to every people and every clime."—Rev. George B. Spaulding, D. D., *Pastor First Presbyterian Church, Syracuse, New York.*
