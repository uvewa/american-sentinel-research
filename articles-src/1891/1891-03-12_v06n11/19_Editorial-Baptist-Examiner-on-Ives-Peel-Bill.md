THE Baptist Examiner, of this city, publishes an "appeal to the people of New York," from which we take the following extract:—

An act to repeal what is familiarly known as the "Ives Peel bill" has been introduced in the Assembly, and has been referred to the Judiciary Committee. The Peel bill was passed in 1887, and was ostensibly "for the purpose of improving the breed of horses." Its real purpose was to permit and legalize betting on races or "pool-selling" for five months in the year, suspending during that period certain sections of the penal code. By a strange inconsistency, an act which the laws pronounce a felony and prison offense during seven months of the year, is authorized and made innocent during the remaining five.

There is the same "strange inconsistency" in Sunday laws, which make criminal upon one day of the week those things which are not only harmless upon all other days, but necessary and commendable. Pool bills of the Ives ilk, and Sunday laws should be blotted out together.
