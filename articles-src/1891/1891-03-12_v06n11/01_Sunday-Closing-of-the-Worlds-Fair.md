Rev. Morgan Dix, D. D., Rector of Trinity Church, says: "I have no confidence in the judgment or the sincerity of those who tell us that the Church must purify politics, elevate the laboring classes, increase incomes, obtain the enactment of laws regulating total food and drink, and for all I know, take up and settle the questions of the currency, the tariff, etc."

In the minds of almost all religious persons, even the most conservative, the duty of toleration is admitted with but reserves. One person will bear with everything in matters of Church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate everything, short of a Papal or a Unitarian; another, everybody who has not invaded religion directly, who has paid their charity a little further, but stops at the belief in God and in future punishment. Whenever the sentiment of the majority is still generous and tolerant, it is found to have saluted little of the claim to be occupied.—*John Stuart Mill.*

The *Northern Light*, the official organ of the Knights of Labor of Washington and northern Idaho, Wisoma Central Labor Union of Seattle, and Trades Council of Tacoma, has the following on the Sunday-closing question:—

We are decidedly opposed to closing the World's Fair on Sunday. Sunday, above all other days, is the day when workingmen could visit the various places of interest and devote sufficient time to profit by the advantages that such institutions afford to the visitor. The National Farmers' Alliance and [page 82] meditations had there been any one to show the injustice of it to the working people, who have to toil daily from early morning until late in the evening. The closing of the World's Fair on Sundays would virtually deprive them of deriving the best benefits from it, and we would rather see that Fair closed all the rest of the week, and open on Sunday, than to it open every day except Sunday.

The laboring men are far from being a unit in favor of Sunday closing.
