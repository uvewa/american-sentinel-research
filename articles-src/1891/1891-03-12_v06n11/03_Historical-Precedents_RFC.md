Those who are seeking religious legislation—a union of Church and State—do not argue the position on its own merits, showing that such legislation is in harmony with good morals and the rights of conscience; but instead of this they look for historical precedents, as though the practice of our fathers sanctioned anything however erroneous, and made every wrong right. Accordingly they speak of "requiring text books in all American schools who are imbued with the American spirit, and who are able to instruct the children in historic American principles;" and also in the selection of text books "to see that they do justice to the facts of American history and to commend American constitutional principles." They say that a school from which the Bible is excluded "is not in the fullest sense, an American school, and does not conform to the actual character of American institutions."

If they go back to their actual history, they will find the baseness of religious legislation exemplified in the persecution of those conscientious dissenters to be distinct from the creed of the times. And by a very few steps they might trace those "American principles" back to Rome. Does American Christianity, as intended to prevent the repetition of religious persecution. It was designed to protect all in their religious rights, and to give no special favor to any. If the Christian religion can enjoy the equal protection of civil laws, it asks no more. To ask more is contrary to the principle of Christianity—a violation of the Golden Rule.

To go back to the formation of our Constitution for "historic American principles" is to enter the shadow of the Dark Ages. The "conceded American constitutional principles" are not exceeded by all, nor by any who justly appreciated that instrument. Let this matter go to the Constitution itself for proofs and arguments, and we shall find what actually has been ceded. When they find what they want in the Constitution, they will no longer call for a "religious amendment." Their argument amounts to this: "Our Government has been a Christian Government from the beginning, therefore the Christian religion must be amended to make it a Christian Government."
