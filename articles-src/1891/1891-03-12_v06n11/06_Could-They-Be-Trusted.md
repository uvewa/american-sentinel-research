The Christian, a religious paper, published in Little Rock, Arkansas, is perplexed over the condition of the political parties in that State, and appeals to the secular press for light upon the subject. The difficulty is that the papers, one and all, affirm that politics in the State are corrupt. "It is a common expression," says the Christian, "in the lips of every one, that the politics of this country are as corrupt as hell." But this the Christian ironically argues, must be a mistake so far as Arkansas is concerned, "because the leaders are all members of the church in good standing and full fellowship!" "Now you don't suppose," continues our contemporary, "this would be true if we were given to lying, slander, ballot-box stuffing, ballot stealing, intimidation, misrepresentation and bribery? Certainly not. A man who is a member of the church, in good standing and full fellowship, is a saint, or a hypocrite. The politicians of this State are all members of the church, therefore, they are all saints, and the politics of this State are as pure as the driven snow."

After naming a number of the State officers, and giving the churches of which they are members, the Christian continues:—

In the lower House of the last Legislature, out of nearly a hundred men, sent up here from all parts of the State, all but thirteen wrote themselves down as members of the church. So the secular press is mistaken about there being any corruption in politics. These men seem to be on opposite sides, but they are not. They are all "pilgrims and strangers on the earth seeking a city that bath foundations whose builder and maker is God." "They have crucified the flesh with all its affections and lusts," including desire for office. They have all renounced the hidden things of darkness and are walking in the light as children of the day. They have each pledged themselves to seek for the other's good and not his own, therefore, each candidate is trying his best to secure votes for his opponent; and is ready to deny himself that his brother may be elected.

Then in a graver tone, the Christian says:—

In all seriousness, the churches of Arkansas are responsible for the corruption in politics. : "Salt is good: but if the salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? It is fit neither for the land nor yet for the dunghill: but men cast it out. He that bath ears to bear let him bear." You [the churches] are losing your savor rapidly. You are hardly fit for the dunghill now. It is all your women can do to keep you alive by suppers, festivals, fairs and all kinds of schemes to get a little money out of unwilling contributors. People do not want to support your churches, and if left to your own merits for support you would die in one short year. . . . O Lord convert the preachers and leading members!

This is from a religious organ, and yet the National Reformers want the politics of the country turned over to the churches in order that the political pool may be purified!
