*The Christian*, a religious paper, published in Little Rock, Arkansas, claims that prayer over the resolution of the political parties in that State, and appeals to the secular press for light on the question. The difficulty is that this paper, one and all, affirm that politics in the State are corrupt. "It is a common expression," says the *Christian*, "in the lips of every one, that the politics of this country are as corrupt as hell." But this the *Christian* has roundly argued; that it is a mistake in so far as Arkansas is concerned, "because its leaders are all members of its churches in good standing and full fellowship." "If you don't accept," continues the contemporary, "this would be true if we look upon the record of the entire country—stuffing, ballot stealing, intimidation, misrepresentation and bribery? Certainly not. A man who is a member of a church, one in good standing and full fellowship, is a citizen, as a hypocrite." But politicians of this State are all members of the church, and as a hypocrite. But politicians of this State are as pure as the driven snow.

Then naming a number of the State senators, and giving the churches of which they were members, the contemporary asks:—

> In the lower House of the last Legislature, out of seventy-five members, most, were up from firms all parties—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—almost all were members of the church.

Then in a major sense, too, the *Christian* asks:—

> In all seriousness, the churches of Arkansas are responsible for the corruption in this State. Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its savor, it is good for nothing. These churches should be the land not for the draught; but not salt burn it.

It is from a religious organ, and yet finding something.
