IN accepting the Prohibition nomination for the Kentucky Legislature, last fall, Mr. Emmet C. Rudolph said:—

If elected, I shall do all in my power to assist in restoring the protection of law to the sanctity of the Sabbath in every community of the State.

This appears to have been the point which Mr. Rudolph especially emphasized, and commenting upon this fact a Western paper says:—

This strikes us as rather strange. We presumed that if a man were elected by the Prohibition party, he would do all in his power to secure prohibition; but this man assures his party that if they elect him, he will exert himself to the utmost to throw a law of protection around the Sabbath.

Well, that is not strange when in some States it is not difficult to find so-called Prohibitionists who say that "if the saloon would only close on Sunday it would be about all we could reasonably ask."
