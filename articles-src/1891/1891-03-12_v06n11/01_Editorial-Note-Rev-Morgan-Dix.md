REV. MORGAN DIX, D. D., Rector of Trinity Church, says: "I have no confidence in the judgment or wisdom of those who tell us that the Church must . . . purify politics, elevate the laboring classes, increase incomes, obtain the enactment of laws regulating meat and drink, and for all I know, take up and settle the questions of the currency, the tariff, etc."
