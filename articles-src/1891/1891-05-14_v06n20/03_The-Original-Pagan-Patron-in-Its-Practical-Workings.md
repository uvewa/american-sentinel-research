## The Original Pagan Patron in Its Practical Workings.

The principles of sovereignty and paternal patronism announced for the United States Government by the Supreme Court in the decision which was discussed last week, are of more consequence to the American people at this time than appears in the mere enunciation of the principles, though in that, as we have seen, there is announced, as far as the Court can go, a total revolution in the principles of government which were established by the makers of this American Union. This was to more clearly illustrated by following the lead suggested by the Court. It will be remembered that the Court held Rome as one of the authorities for the position which was taken in the decision, and by a brief examination of the Roman government, its system, its principle and its working, in connection with certain events and movements which are becoming quite popular in this country, the full meaning of that decision can be more clearly discerned.

In the Roman system the government was father of the people, and as such its power was supreme, absolute, paternal, and all-directing. "The idea of the State was the highest: the citizen, and within that was included all actual realization of the highest good, since the development of all other goods pertaining to humanity was much depended on this." "Nature's Man with all that he had was subordinated to the State, he must have no higher aim than to be a servant of the State, he must seek no higher good than that which the State could bestow. "The first fundamental right of the law was the paramount right of the State over the citizen. Whether as a family, or a propriety, or as [154] a member of a corporation or College, he had no natural rights of his own; his privileges were created by the law as well as defined by it. The State, in the plenitude of her power, delegated a portion of her own irresponsibility to the citizens, when satisfied the conditions she required, in order to become the parent of her children; but at the same time she demanded of him the sacrifice of his free agency to her own ends the idea of political agrandis." —*Merivale.*

It is very evident that in such a system there was no place for individuality. The individual was a part of the State. There was no such thing as the rights of the people. The right of the State only was to be considered and that was to be considered absolutely. "The more distinguished a Roman became, the less was he a free man. The complexity of the law, the direction of the rule drove him into a narrow circle of thought and action, and the more conspicuous he was, the harder and austerity of his life. The whole duty of man, with the lambiest and greatest of Romans, was to keep his house in order, and to be the obedient servant of the State." —*Mommsen.*

This every Roman citizen was a subject and every Roman subject was a slave. It would be difficult to conceive of a system under which whose principles were more radically opposed to those of the United States, than were these.

As the State was paternal the Emperor was father of the people, and as such he was to provide for the people's food, and then, as he gave them money, in short he dealt with them as a father with his children. Of course there before there was an expression of this society was the principle of the government. The only change from the time before the usurpers, to the time of the emperors was that in the imperial authority there was merged in one man that which before pertained to the government composed of the senate, consulate, and people.

In the days of Tiberius Gracchus, B. C. 133, the public lands were grasped by the [155] rich; great landed estates were owned by a few; and though there was a law which forbade any single holding of more than three hundred and thirty-three acres, the law was of ancient standing and had been grandly disregarded until practically it was forgotten, and the capitalists had entirely monopolized the public land which they cultivated by slave labor, and the citizens without capital being unable to compete with in contests of slave labor, were literally crowded off the land. Tiberius determined that the monopolies should be broken and that the public lands should be restored to the citizens. It was done, and within two years the commissioners appointed to distribute the land had carried forty thousand families upon public lands for which the monopolies had paid nothing to be assessed. But the commissioners became unpopular, because landholders who were compelled to resign their lands were exasperated, of course. On the other hand, those to whom the land was given not in all cases satisfied. It was not certain that some would not give in their places of land then offered, and that of the long run to sell themselves to those who could bid highest for their votes.

But the greatest trouble was, that in the greater part of these vast tracts of land that wanted, in fact it was money that they wanted first of all; and although the land was virtually given to him and he was improved at that, they could not get money out of it without work. It was of no personal work, too, because to hire slaves was against the very law, by virtue of which they had received the land, and with freemen was impossible, (because no freeman would work for a slave's wages —had it his estimate he to count himself no better than a slave) it needed the landed proprietor could still afford to pay the wages demanded by free labor, which he had to meet the competition of the nearby land owners who employed free slaves.

The only alternative was for the new landholders to work their land themselves, and do the best they could at it. But no money at first cost fuss as fret if they wished, and as what all done was only by hard work and economical living, many of them heartily wished themselves back and the rest at half times of the law were working for daily wages, though the wages might be small. The dissatisfied and restless grew bold enough to give the Senate its desired excuse to stifle and extinguish this generous effort for the commonwealers and return quietly to repeal the law.

Ten years afterward the same thing had to be done over again. This time it was accomplished under the leadership of Caius Gracchus brother of Tiberius; but it was not enough that he should restore the land law that had been secured by his brother. That law, even while it being worked as it had, was satisfactory to but few of its beneficiaries. The law he restored, it is true, but with the prospect of leaving Rome, and going perhaps to some distant part of Italy to engage in hard work, was not much of a temptation to men who had spent any length of time in Rome, involved in the political strife, and whose principal hope was to obtain money at the expense of subsistence with as little work as possible. It required something more than the restoration of the land law to satisfy them, and Caius Gracchus granted it.

With the "rattlesnake charming" of cheap per cent land loans in Rome, he secured the passage of a law decreeing that there should be established in Rome, public granaries to be filled and sustained at the cost of the State, and that from this the wheat should be sold to the poor citizens, at a merely nominal price. This law applied only to Rome, because in Rome the electors were held. "The effect was to gather into the city, a sordid needy, unemployed voters, living on the charity of the State, to crowd the circus and to clamor at the elections, available as doubt innumerable to strengthen the hands of the popular tribune, but casting in the long run to sell themselves to those who could bid highest for their votes."—*Creasy.*

People and their representatives stood over before this government became engaged as an emperor. In fact it became necessary to expect it; because, although it was not enough to distribute the land, it was not an easy to keep it distributed. Then to whom the land was given lived far above their means as the Government stores were open and the poor citizens were at the great part of the living expenses of those who received the land for nothing were not likely to cultivate habits of economy. Their truths were soon mortgaged and at last forfeited, falling back into the hands of the capitalists; and in the matter of things, at each successive step became monopolistic.

Thus at last the distribution of the land was at an end; always; the distribution of grain still remained a fixture, and as money had to be paid by the government in order to give to this either than land or grain, these that naturally grew up the circulation that the money should be given direct to the citizens, and in the eyes of demagogy, political necessity sanctified this practice, to give to each soldier anew one thousand and as to each citizen and twenty dollars till honest free rent for a year. In addition to this he provided a magnificent feast for the citizens who were supported by the public grants of grain. Twenty-five thousand besides were spread with richest viands from which the two hundred thousand State-pauper feasted, while from big basins the finest wine flowed freely.

Then came Augustus, the Emperor in whom was merged all that pertained to the sovereignty of the Roman Republic's patron. So long as Rome was in the full tide of conquest subduing republics and wealthy countries, levying upon them enormous tributes, robbing their treasuries, and rifling their temples, there was always money in the Treasury to furnish the funds, the grain, or even the money, which occasions might require. But when once the era of conquest ceased, or as did with Augustus, then also the demand for this subsidy actually increased. If requiring something more than it can simply be read in scriptural texts those God and the sought would for it also the leading cast not their own questions into a dilemma in comparison to which times paper in the China wall, which of most principles, however subtle in them they make to can forth unto appliances as to necessitate, for the ordinary expenses of government alone, the creation of those whom the army might deny.

been adopted as a distinct feature of the Government of the United States.

We have said, however, that there is involved in this matter, that which is of greater importance than simply is here expressed by the Supreme Court. These very principles are being advocated by certain classes in this country. Some there are who demand that all the land shall be possessed, or rather be held in trust, by the Government for the people's distributed for their good. Senator Stanford has already introduced a bill in Congress which proposes to oblige the Government after the manner of Augustus, to lend its land upon trustworthy security of the same at two per cent. for thirty years to all who can give security to double the amount borrowed. In the same line with the Farmers' Alliance demands that the Government shall build granaries throughout the land and advance money upon the farmers' crops as well as to loan money upon their land, and upon what collateral they might possess.

In these schemes there is involved the whole Roman system in its practical workings. If these things were done the Government would literally become possessed of a vast amount of land of grain, and with the Government in possession of such accumulation and having obtained possession of it by such means, the next thing, and according to these principles the same also enough too would be a demand that the Government should supply grain at a favorable if not a nominal price, to the poorer citizen. But back of all these outworkings, in which it is proposed the Government shall exhibit, there lies the fundamental principle. Where the Government obtains the money to lend to all who want to borrow, and to advance upon all crops of those who want it? This Government is not engaged in wars of conquest as Rome was, nor are in the capacity to become so.

It is proposed, indeed, by those who advocate the scheme, that the Government shall issue treasury notes to supply all the demands. But the more of such notes the Government issues, the less the say of them will be worth. A promise of the Government to pay is worth, no more than that of a private individual, if it has nothing still which to make the promise good. The Government may print on a piece of paper the promise to pay a dollar or even one thousand dollars, but the only thing that makes that piece of paper worth a dollar or a thousand dollars, is the certainty that the Government has that sort of real money will which to make the promise good. But if, without any such certainty, the Government issues a sufficient amount of such notes to supply the demands of all who want to borrow and to all who want to sell, as they demand it, it would be but a little while till none of it were be worth anything; and then who invented the scheme would discover this as soon as anybody else. They then would be ready to demand real money and not mere promises to pay.

But the Government would not have real money sufficient to supply the demand, and even the Government can not make gold and silver. What then? Oh, the monopolists, the millionaires, the money-lenders, and the rich people generally, will have care of real money. The Government, money and the Government is power in perfect, let this factor of the people can as regards division amongst the children. Will it is said that this would be confiscation? and that it can not be supposed all such means? It is a sufficient answer to say that the Government has already done it. The Emancipation, by the decision of the Supreme Court of law, Utah, did confiscate three millions of dollar worth of property belonging to the Mormons. The Supreme Court of the United States sustained the decision and confirmed the judgment.

And in the same way, the Court announced the doctrine, that it is not necessary for a corporation to violate its charter to justify the Legislature in dissolving the corporation; but that "Congress for good and sufficient reasons of its own, aside from any expression of such departure of that limitation and of any violation of it, has a perfect right to repeal its charter and abrogate its corporate existence." This plainly puts all corporate interests at the absolute disposal of Congress and the Court.

Everybody knows that these demands from time to last are already being loudly made by different classes in this country; so long as the American principle of government shall prevail and such schemes will amount to nothing, but let the European and the Roman principles of government supplant the American, then what is to hinder the carrying into [156] full effect every item of the different schemes proposed and advocated? This is why we say that the Supreme Court decision, under consideration, means vastly more, and a dire than this: the mere announcement of the principles which it has in it.

It is strange enough, indeed, that there should be any of those that are capable of thinking to say purpose on all who would be an matter should as to make the position and patronism of Rome or of Senator Stanford, the Farmers' Alliance and others to the same end. But the stooped of all the proposed things is that the Supreme Court of the United States should open the way to confiscation, and establish a principle of the Roman Government, the very principle upon which above was and all of these schemes could be made effective. And that the Supreme Court should also in this decision, as that very government by which those things done in view the practical application of the doctrine of parvus patria, make the distinct announcement that in its estimation, of this Government, is admissible.
