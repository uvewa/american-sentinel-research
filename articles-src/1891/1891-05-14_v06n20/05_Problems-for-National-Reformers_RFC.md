The self-styled National Reformers have several rather difficult problems on their hands for solution; but they are not disposed to give them up.

1. How to procure a "religious amendment" of a Constitution which has nothing of religion in it to amend, except this: that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The question is, how to get Congress to legislate in favor of certain religious tenets without annulling this prohibition.

2. How to enforce religious institutions by civil law without a union of Church and State.

3. How to make use of the Roman Catholics to procure religious legislation, and then exclude them from an equal share in the Government.

4. How to legislate non-sectarian religion into the schools of the Nation, which shall be Christian and not Jewish, Protestant and not Catholic.

5. How to build a civil Sabbath upon a purely religious foundation.

6. How to compel a part of the people to keep Sunday civilly, to make it easier for others to keep it religiously; and this without any religious discrimination.

7. How to enforce the observance of the first day of the week as the Christian Sabbath by a commandment which says nothing of that day, except as a day on which God worked, and also says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
