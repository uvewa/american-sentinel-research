## The World's Fair on Sunday.

THE *Independent* has obtained the views of nearly seven Roman Catholic and Protestant archbishops and bishops on the question of opening or closing the coming World's Fair at Chicago on Sunday.

The canvass shows that an overwhelming majority of the Protestant prelates are strongly opposed to the Sunday opening, and that of the twenty-two Roman ecclesiastics fourteen would only admit the public during the afternoon at best. Two only out of twenty-six bishops of the Episcopal Church declare themselves for Sunday afternoon opening. The Methodist bishops, white and colored, with a single exception, are against it, and he would, for [157] example, do it in the interests of the poor laborer, the soldier, and the laborer.

The remainder, representing the Moravians and the Evangelical Association, are all against Sunday opening.

The grounds for the Roman Catholic request are typified by Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul. They are that Sunday "is already the strongest factor in our favor, whether from the greed of capital or the aggressiveness of irreligion," for so "the day, even in a lesser degree, to the varnishing during solemn national occasions." "The interests of labor also, in his opinion, require that the day be kept for rest, and whatever leads to diminish its inviolability tends to the injury of the masses." "If the day is lost as a day of rest to the working classes and the laboring of Sunday," he adds, "is the glory of America."

Bishop Clark, of Rhode Island, hesitates the Episcopal opposition to Sunday opening when he says that the Exposition should not be opened on Sunday "without checking the religious sensibilities of the great majority of our people," and without yet all setting an example "which might be very disastrous and lead to the throwing open of all sorts of popular amusements on Sundays." That is substantially the position of the Methodist and other Protestant bishops who are against Sunday opening.

The other side is represented by Archbishop Ryan, of Philadelphia, who can see "no violation of the Sabbath in permitting the public to walk through the grounds and admire the products of human industry and the fine arts, which tend to improve and refine the mind." Therefore he would open the gate on Sunday after giving a reasonable time in the morning to religious duties. His speech is so obviously proper in itself that it indulges in an innocent and useful recreation in the afternoon." Bishop Grafton, of the Episcopal Church, regards it as "Pharisaical hypocrisy" to contend "same poor laborer may not pass into a picture gallery or listen to a band of music." He said: He would open the departments devoted to art after twelve o'clock on Sunday, believing that admitting the gates to itself "would only be in the interests of the soldiers and laborers." "The only colored Methodist bishop who is in favor of Sunday opening is Bishop Turner. He thinks that desecration of the day will be prevented rather than encouraged by the opening of the Fair because "thousands and or more visitors all the time in the city, if they are left on the streets like sheep, they will naturally gravitate to every outlet of vice and corruption." He would also open the gate in the afternoon as a reduction of the price of admission, but would stop the machinery and everything calling for special labor, allow no buying or selling except of substantial food, give sacred concerts, temperance and moral lectures, and have preaching by "ministers of the gospel, all without regard to town and color." The managers, he says, "could procure colored singers enough alone to have two or three concerts in operation at the same time," and hundreds of ministers among the visitors would be glad to take turns at the preaching.

If the question were put to a vote of the people of the Union, would not the great majority agree with the small minority of the bishops who are now for Sunday opening? We have no doubt that only those who mouth the loudest for Sunday by the law when this great majority can best enjoy such a display. As it is the comparatively small amount of labor involved in the opening cannot thus be estimated. The people of a nation of people would welcome the opportunity to perform, in as uniformly an obligation to Sunday cause and the aim for the accommodation of church-goers. It would be wrong to go to the Chicago Exposition on Sunday, it is it also wrong that Central Park here in New York should be most often resorted on that day by the working class who can find no time on other occasions, and is the thousands of them enjoying the beauty and the recreation of that pleasures ground and edifying and profiting by the magnificent musical at a World's Fair? As far as ourselves, we see not.

At this very time a petition to the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, asking that that building be opened on Sundays, is in circulation. The petitioners are citizens and they are the names of respectable persons quite in general. It is it is not for the people to visit that display of the treasures of art and industry on Sunday, it would be of far greater profit for them to observe and study the vastly more comprehensive display at the World's Fair.

What is it people to do on Sunday? Even when they go to church more than nine-tenths of the day still remains. They make all something, for mere idleness is the devil's opportunity. They must have means of recreation, or what could be better for that purpose than a grand display of the world's discoveries and art and industry, showing the progress of mankind in civilization and refinement?—*The Christian at Work.*
