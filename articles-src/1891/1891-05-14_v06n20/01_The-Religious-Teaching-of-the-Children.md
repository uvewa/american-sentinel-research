[153]

THE religious teaching of the children must be left in the hands of parents, friends, Christians. Were the State to undertake to teach religion, in this country, as the majority are Christians, she would teach Christianity. Then the State would have to require every teacher to be an active and earnest Christian. If this should be done, there would be many schools in charge of persons having to interest in religion, and no power could awaken interest in it. But who would go so far toward the union of Church and State, as to have the latter sit in judgment on the religious character of a large number of its servants? Surely the result of such inquisition and patronage would, in the end, be evil to all concerned. Let us have no State religion in our public schools; there is better and surer way.—*Rev. T. D. Peake.*
