# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, May 14, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 20)

## CRITICAL NOTE

This issue presented **extremely challenging scan quality** throughout. The original images are of low resolution with significant blurring, making precise character-level reading very difficult across nearly all articles. Many passages required best-guess interpretation based on context, vocabulary patterns typical of the American Sentinel, and sentence structure. The following are the most significant uncertainties, but the reader should be aware that **this entire issue requires careful verification against a higher-quality scan**.
