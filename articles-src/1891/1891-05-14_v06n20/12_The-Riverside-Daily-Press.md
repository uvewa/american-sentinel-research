THE *Riverside* (California) *Daily Press,* of April 15, publishes an article "by an advocacy of the exemption of church property from taxation. Church property is not taxed in California, but the arrangement must in not pleasing to many of the citizens. The writer of the article in question says that a tax upon church property is a tax upon religion, and declares that

> as a matter of true statesmanship and conscience, that both have to all in its power to all the

churches, even to build them such houses and exempt them from all kinds of taxation.

In conclusion the writer says:

> I take the ground that to tax a house of worship, the most sufficient factor and element in good government, is inconsistent and wrong; wrong in principle, and wrong in practice also. But, if challenged on the point of the vast sums invested in building Churches, I would willingly concede the beyond a fixed and reasonable sum so invested, in our houses for worship exclusively, the State may rightfully levy a tax. I make the same plea for a primary or district school house, but no other school which costs more. And will not this same principle, stirring all the States of the Union, be of abundant resources so as to be enabled to build more and more church houses. It is to be hoped that this distinction may soon be so that all real then this likewise favored and one blessed land may stand up among the American Nations with no burden on but for the church.

That is, he would favor a system that would put a premium upon fraud, what is would tend to make the Judges of what is worship to God?

It would be interesting to hear the gentleman explain how California already abolished what we have from been the papers? complained again and again by the Sunday or claims, from Mr. Crafts to Joseph Cook, was simply a civil Sunday law; how then do they propose to enact legislation which adapted the religious Sunday? Is Sunday a religious day dependent in any measure upon State legislature? So it seems. But what then becomes of the claim that Sunday laws are purely "civil?"
