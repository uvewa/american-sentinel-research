THE Christian Advocate, of May 7, remarks that

some persons become wonderfully interested in working people when they wish to crowd a measure through and can find no good argument in its favor. Let us look after the interests of working people by all means, but let us not invade the laws of God and nature under pretext of providing for any class.

That is just what we have always said.
