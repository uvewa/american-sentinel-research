THE Riverside (California) Daily Press, of April 23, publishes an article "by request of the Pastor's Association," in advocacy of the exemption of church property from taxation. Church property is now taxed in California, but the arrangement is not pleasing to many of the ministers. The writer of the article in question says that a tax upon church property is a tax upon religion, and declares that

as a matter of true statesmanship and economy, the State had better do all in its power to aid the churches, even to build them such houses and exempt them from all kinds of taxation.

In conclusion the writer says:—

I take the ground that to tax a house of worship, the most co-efficient factor and element in good government, is inconsistent and wrong; wrong in principle, and wrong in practice also. But, if challenged on the point of the vast sums invested in church buildings, I would willingly concede that beyond a fixed and reasonable sum so invested, in our houses for worship exclusively, the State may rightfully levy a tax. I make the same plea for a primary or district school-house, but no other school or college. California, I believe, has the distinction among all the States of the Union, of abolishing the civil and religious Sunday, and also of taxing church houses. It is to be hoped that this distinction may soon be lost; and that soon this heaven-favored and sun-blessed land may stand up among the sisterhood of States, with no blush on her fair brow.

That is, he would favor a system that would put a premium upon fraud, and constitute the State the judge of what is worship to God!

It would be interesting to hear the gentleman explain how California abolished the religious Sunday. California simply abolished what we have been assured again and again by the Sunday-law orators, from Mr. Crafts to Joseph Cook, was simply a civil Sunday law; how then can it be true that California abolished the religious Sunday? Is Sunday as a religious day dependent in any measure upon State legislatures? So it seems. But what then becomes of the claim that Sunday laws are civil only?
