## Sunday and the Workingman.

The following, in the following, relative to the proposal to open the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday:—

> We hear that a petition is in the hands of some persons who intend to present it asking that the Museum be open Sundays. The petition already has the signatures, we are told, of a number of young people connected with the Society of Christian Endeavor. We sincerely hope that the prayer of this petition will not be granted. The opening of the Museum on a Sunday afternoon showed by itself it might not be a bad thing, but the precedent is very bad thing indeed. If the Metropolitan Museum were opened on that afternoon there would soon be a demand to have it open all day Sundays, and then all sorts of places of entertainment, without which those who are so restless in behalf of the workingman's Sunday might very well do without, would claim the same privilege. Let us not admit the tendency of their claims. The whole question of Sunday observance is involved, and we fret and friter away what we have of it. The Hebrews knew the value of the weekly Sabbath as a day of rest. Let us be as wise as they, and instead of opening up lines of concession that makes it against the maintenance of the observance, let us build it up.

There is a failure to detect the distinction that the law and the exemption of church property from taxation, which are explicit, its emphasis to its pulpits inconsistent with our theory of the union of Church and State; but it surprises one that there should ever be any claims made that we have no social union.

Religious legislation, under the disguise of civil, auditory, and other protections, is as a insult to the ordinary intelligence, and "if grievances a pain" to think that the "Sabbath" reformers do not see through that light, and since they do not, what hope is there that they will learn in time that such legislation is alike subversive of the liberties of the people and in derogation of the rights of conscience.

This is interesting, first, because it shows that even two of the members of Sunday-keeping churches are not all with it. In favor the power of the State to force rigid Sunday observance upon all citizens; and second, because it reveals plainly the fact [156] that the fight against the Sunday opening of the Museum is made solely upon religious grounds.

The *Independent* truly says of the workingman: "that a great deal is asked for it on behalf of the for which he is not responsible." Yet it is this sort of rushing to and fro rather than the demand for Sunday laws made in the name of the workingman. It will be remembered that in the city of Washington, February 14, 1890, Mr. Crafts produced before the Committee on the District of Columbia, a Mr. Schoibles who said that he represented Local Assembly, No. 5,472, of the Knights of Labor, and that that organization had endorsed the Breckinridge Sunday bill. But unfortunately for this claim Mr. Millard F. Baker, master workman of the whole Federation Sunday law, Sunday mornings closing allowance to make the impression general that the workingmen are especially desirous of being excluded from museums the only day they have free.

One who was present and heard Mr. Hobbs speak, says:—

> This speech, coming as it did, was more or less of a surprise to all. It was its substance though it was "a stunner." It instantly resulted in altering the course of subsequent proceedings. It was listened to and is profoundly presented in behalf of the true workingmen who are actually in the position of being forced to labor on Sunday: and "of the Church getting after to forces these the Egyptian bondage of Sunday shows." Nothing would have happened that would have more clearly opened the eyes of members of Congress not of the American Sabbath Union, that this Sunday movement is in the interests of the workingmen, than did this unprecedented and wholly unsolicited testimony.

The idea that workingmen are, as a class, clamoring for Sunday laws is false. They should be allowed to go and they have upon closed against them upon the only day that they are as a rule specifically time to visit them, is absurd. Such a thing never would be made were it not that the friends of a State-enforced Sunday conscience feel that they must make a stand somewhere. What they want to secure is a general recognition of the principle, that the State is the proper guardian of the Sunday institution. In discussing this very matter, the *Catholic Review,* of March 7, says:

> When the Christian Sunday is a fact in the national life the observance of the day can not be left to another, provided its sanctity be kept, is of no moment.

This is the Catholic view of the matter, and it is rapidly coming to be the Protestant view; that is, the observance of Sunday in any particular way is not important if only the sacred character be recognized; but is just what the State has no right to do, and it's what Protestants and Catholics alike demand that the State and all acting now under state authority shall do.

This accounts for the everlasting ringing of the changes upon the so-called demand of the workingmen for Sunday laws, and for the Sunday-closing of the doors of any and all museums in their faces. The State as a political concern, is a secular State; that way its obedience to votes; the workingmen have voted, hence the analogy of the Sunday-law, Sunday mornings closing allowance to make the impression general that the workingmen are especially desirous of being excluded from museums the only day they have free.
