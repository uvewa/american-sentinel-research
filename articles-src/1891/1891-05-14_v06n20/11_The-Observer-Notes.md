THE *Observer* notes that:—

The Select Committee on Public Petitions has laid before the Canadian Senate the examination on the record of Catholic disabilities, but not one is known to the directorate in which any case of Catholic was actually the result of the faulting is quite possible. Mr. Sturgeon exposes the attempts of Catholics to overthrow the new political lines, and he refuses the one of the Talmud the character of a public document.

These two "movements" referred to the attempt to remove Catholic disabilities, and to free the Church from the control of the State, or separate Church and State. Every example of the advocacy of religious freedom which is not based on the pure principle of liberty as it is found in Christ will experience a "wounding of feeling" and finally prove its complete inadequacy, because at the last, coming to a defenses of the faith, an efficient aid to the enemies of religious freedom.

These movements are in this instance inspired by selfish or mixed motives, for they were introduced, advocated, and supported, solely on the gospel ground of — "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them," it would not be possible to "go too far," and no one, while yet a Christian, would feel any "revulsion" from such a course in the affairs of either Church or State.
