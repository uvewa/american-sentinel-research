UNDER the heading "The Pittsburg Law and Order Society," the Christian Statesman, of a late date, says:—

Pittsburg is one of the quietest cities in the United States on the Sabbath. For this it thanks its Law and Order Society, under the management of the efficient and zealous Captain Wishart. But the Society has gained the untiring hatred of the lawless classes, and the most unscrupulous assaults are constantly made upon it. It has just now been attacked in the Legislature—in what manner it may be inferred from the spirited reply which it has forwarded, by mail, to every member of that body:—

Inasmuch as the enemies of the Sunday law are circulating at Harrisburg false and malicious statements alleging gross abuses in the enforcement of said law in Allegheny County, with intent to render the Sunday law odious and to influence the Legislature to legalize certain kinds of business, we make the following statement:

First.—No person has ever been prosecuted for the sale, on Sunday, of any medicine of any kind whatsoever, or of any appliances designed for the relief of pain or sickness.

Second.—No person has ever been prosecuted for the delivery, on Sunday, of bread, or fresh milk, or ice, or of fresh meats kept in butchers refrigerators over Saturday night.

Third.—No person has ever been trapped or induced to violate the law by any agent or employee of the league.

Fourth.—The league has not made a specialty of prosecuting "widows and cripples." On the contrary, as the records will show, it began with the big offenders and prosecuted them vigorously and successfully. The league, however, has never been used physical or financial things, as a sufficient justification for the persistent violation of law.

Five.—Not one dollar of the fines collected for Sunday employment has ever been received either directly or indirectly by the league or by any agent or employe of the league, nor has the fines.

The above points cover the stereotyped charges which constitute the stock in trade of the law-breakers and their sympathizers. We challenge proof of any of these alleged abuses. The cases are all matters of record. We invite the fullest investigation, and will cheerfully meet our accusers face to face before a legislative committee, or any other tribunal. We call attention to a single fact which should show the utter flimsiness of all such charges: defendants have the right of appeal to the Judges.

We desire to emphasize the fact that the work of the league is done under the careful supervision of a committee. Our agent, Captain Wishart, is paid a fixed salary, and makes weekly reports to the committee.

The motto is, "We ask only obedience to law." To this reasonable demand good citizens will not object. Others must not. The league will continue to prosecute law-breakers without fear, favor, or affection, as it has done from the beginning.

There is no factor of this whole National Reform movement more subtly dangerous than the Law and Order League. A careful study of the above manifesto will develop many of the points wherein this organization is really inimical to the safety of the commonwealth which it so earnestly professes to protect.

In the first place, its main burden is the support and enforcement of religious laws, more especially of Sunday observance at present, as is shown in this letter to legislators. In the next place it assumes to itself, with the utmost arrogance, a complete incapacity to do wrong so long as it does not overstep, in its prosecutions, the limits of technical law. It flaunts in the face of any who are, or may be, its victims the fact that "defendants have the right of appeal." All that they ask is "obedience to law," to this good citizens will not object, "others must not."

These are principles no whit different from those upon which the inquisitorial prosecutions were carried on, and upon which the infliction of civil penalties, for the infraction of religion and ecclesiastical canons, were justified.

These phrases have a fine rhetorical ring but not all good citizens will accept it as an established ethical principle that they should acquiesce in the enforcement of unjust and unchristian laws simply because they have been enacted and are on the statute books.
