## Subtly Dangerous.

UNDER the heading "The Pittsburgh Law and Order Society," the *Christian Statesman,* of a late date, says:—

> Pittsburg is one of the optimist cities in the United States, or the Mother of the Pittsburgh Law and Order Society, under the management of the efficient and zealous Captain, William Boy. This Society has grasped the underlying hatred of the law, and the moral, and the real intelligibility the subject recently made open. It has just now been offered in the Legislature a bill which it hoped may be informed of the spiritual truly which is but the beginning of bad in a whole victory of that work.

Inasmuch as the remnant of the Sunday law are criticized among us the one of the most of being strenuous in the enforcement of and law in Allegheny County, the following criticism by the *Pittsburgh Dispatch* of the above-described institution shall be the following statement:

> There is no factor of this whole National Reform movement more subtly dangerous than the Law and Order Society.

It is gratifying to note that a careful and dispassionate study of the above manifesto will not give only of the points wherein lies the tendency of their principles.

In the first place, its main burden is the advancement of the Sunday laws, or more especially of Sunday observance at the expense of any amount of legislation the limits of the rights of the conscience. In fact, in the next place it assumes to the conscience. In the next place it assumes to be responsibility its impropriety to do wrong so long as it does not act overtly, in the prosecution, the limits of mechanics. It flaunts in the face of any who, or may be, its victims the law that no "discrimination the right of appeal." All that they ask is vilified, amore its law "to." In this good citizen will not object, "others will and at once make itself heard when the petition so that of large concerns of ready to do a purpose against from those upon which the overreaching Christian prosecution were startled in, and upon which the infliction of religion civil penalties, for the infraction of religion and ecclesiastical creed, were justified.

These pleas have a fine rhetorical ear, but not all good citizens will accept it as an established ethnic principle that they should acquiesce in the enforcement of unjust and unchristian laws simply because they have been enacted and are enforced.
