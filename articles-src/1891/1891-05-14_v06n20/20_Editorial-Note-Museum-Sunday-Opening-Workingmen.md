IN OPPOSING the Sunday opening of the Museum of Art in Central Park, the Christian at Work says:—

The Museum is already open two evenings of the week; and it is the testimony of the officers of the Museum that the attendance does not show that the laboring or artisan class avail themselves of the opportunity to any notable extent. There is no reason to suppose that Sunday opening would be justified by the attendance.

There is no force to this objection. The fact that workingmen do not rush to the Museum in the evening is no evidence that they would not go on Sunday. The only reasonable presumption is that the Sunday attendance would be large, and largely of those who can not well spare the time to go on other days.
