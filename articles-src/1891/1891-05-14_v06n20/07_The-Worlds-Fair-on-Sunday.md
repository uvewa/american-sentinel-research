The Independent has obtained the views of ninety-seven Roman Catholic and Protestant archbishops and bishops as to the question of opening or closing the coming World's Fair at Chicago on Sunday.

The canvass shows that an overwhelming majority of the Protestant prelates are strongly opposed to the Sunday opening, and that of the twenty-two Roman ecclesiastics fourteen would only admit the public during the afternoon at best. Two only out of twenty-five bishops of the Episcopal Church declare themselves for Sunday afternoon opening. The Methodist bishops, white and colored, with a single exception, and he colored, are for closing the Exhibition altogether on that day.

The remainder, representing the Moravians and the Evangelical Association, are all against Sunday opening.

The grounds for the Roman Catholic negative are expressed by Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul. They are that Sunday "is already too seriously attacked, whether from the greed of capital or the aggressiveness of irreligion," for us "to yield, even in a lesser degree, to its adversaries during solemn national occurrences." The interests of labor also, in his opinion, require that the day be kept for rest; and whatever tends to diminish its inviolability tends to the injury of the workingman. "Our accustomed observance of Sunday," he adds, "is the glory of America."

Bishop Clark, of Rhode Island, represents the Episcopal opposition to Sunday opening when he says that the Exposition can not be opened on Sunday "without shocking the religious sensibilities of the great majority of our people," and without setting an example which "might be very disastrous and lead to the throwing open of all sorts of popular amusements on Sunday." That is substantially the view of the Methodist and other Protestant bishops who are against Sunday opening.

The other side is represented by Archbishop Ryan, of Philadelphia, who can see "no violation of the Sabbath in permitting the public to walk through the grounds and admire the products of human industry and the fine arts, which tend to improve and refine the mind." Therefore he would open the gates on Sunday afternoons. So also Archbishop Janssens, of New Orleans, thinks that "if a Christian gives a reasonable time in the morning to religious devotions, he may be allowed to indulge in an innocent and useful recreation in the afternoon." Bishop Grafton, of the Episcopal Church, regards it as "Pharisaical hypocrisy" to censure "some poor laborer who goes into a picture gallery or listens to a band of music" on Sunday. He would open the departments devoted to art after twelve o'clock on Sunday, believing that shutting the gates entirely "would only be in the interests of the saloons and theaters." The single colored Methodist bishop who is in favor of Sunday opening is Bishop Turner. He thinks that desecration of the day would be prevented rather than encouraged by such a course. "With a hundred thousand or more visitors all the time in the city, if they are shut out from the Exposition, they will naturally gravitate to every centre of vice and corruption." He would open the gates in the afternoon at a reduction of the price of admission, but would stop the machinery and everything calling for special labor, allow no buying or selling except of substantial food, give sacred concerts, temperance and moral lectures, and have preaching by "ministers of the gospel, all without regard to race and color." The managers, he says, "could procure colored singers enough alone to have two or three concerts in operation at the same time," and hundreds of ministers among the visitors would be glad to take turns at the preaching.

If the question were put to the vote of the people of the Union, would not the great majority agree with the small minority of the bishops who argue for Sunday opening? We have no doubt that that would be the result, for Sunday is the day when this great majority can best enjoy such a display. As to the comparatively small amount of labor involved in the opening, there would be no trouble. Multitudes of people would welcome the opportunity to perform it, as multitudes are glad to run Sunday cars and trains for the accommodation of church-goers. If it would be wrong to go to the Chicago Exposition on Sunday, is it not also wrong that the Central Park here in New York should be most often crowded on that day? Where is the moral distinction between enjoying the beauty and the recreations of that pleasure ground and enjoying and profiting by the magnificent display of a World's Fair? As for ourselves, we can not see it.

At this very time a petition to the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, asking that that building be opened on Sunday, is receiving great numbers of signatures, and they are the names of religious people in great part. If it is profitable for the people to visit that display of the treasures of art and industry on Sunday, it would be of far greater profit for them to observe and study the vastly more comprehensive museum which a World's Fair is.

What can the people to do on Sunday? Even when they go to church more than nine-tenths of the day still remains. They must do something, for mere idleness is the devil's opportunity. They must have means of recreation, and what could be better for that purpose than a grand display of the world's achievements in art and industry, showing the progress of mankind in civilization and refinement?—The Sun.
