## Problems for National Reformers.

THE self-styled National Reformers have several rather difficult problems on their hands for solution, but they are not disposed to give them up.

1. How to preserve a "religious amendment" of a Constitution which has national religion or is it not sacred, except that this "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The question is, how to get Congress to legislate in favor of certain religious doctrines without annulling this prohibition.

2. How to enforce religious legislation by civil law without a union of Church and State.

3. How to make use of the Roman Catholics to prevent religious legislation, and then exclude them from an equal share in the Government.

4. How to legislate non-sectarian religion into the schools of the Nation, which shall be Christian and all Jewish, Pagan, and infidel and Catholic.

5. How to build a civil Sabbath upon a religious foundation.

6. How to so change the law as to keep Sunday strictly; to make it easier for citizens to keep it religiously; and this without any religious discrimination.

7. How to enforce the observance of the first day of the week as the Christian Sabbath by a commandment which says "the seventh day of that day, except as a day which God worked, and also may this "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." C. P. B.
