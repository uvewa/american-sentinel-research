The Independent has the following, relative to the proposal to open the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday:—

We learn that a petition is to be presented to the directors of the Metropolitan Museum, of this city, asking that the Museum be open Sunday afternoons. This petition, it appears, has been circulated by the efforts of a number of young people connected with one of our churches. It is most seriously to be hoped that the prayer of this petition will not be granted. If the question of opening art collections on Sunday afternoon stood by itself it might not be worth while seriously to oppose it; but it does not stand alone. If the Metropolitan Museum were opened at this demand there would be raised a clamor for the opening of theaters and concert halls, and all sorts of places of entertainment, without regard to their moral character or influence. These young people who are so zealous in behalf of the cause of the workingmen evidently do not understand the tendency of their efforts. We have, in all conscience, little enough of Sunday left; let us not fritter away what we have of it. The friends of the Sabbath must make a stand somewhere, and the best place to make that stand is against the opening of the Metropolitan Museum and all other institutions of like character. The very last wish that any friend of the workingman should have for him should be the introduction of the continental Sunday. That means not rest for him, but work. In this matter we are persuaded that a great deal is asked for in his name for which he is in no wise responsible, and which he does not and would not ask for himself. We do not know how thoroughly the mature Christian sentiment of the city will make itself heard when the petition we referred to comes before the directors of the Museum; but we are quite certain that the overwhelming Christian sentiment of this city is decidedly opposed to the opening of the Museum on Sunday.

This is interesting, first, because it shows that even the members of Sunday-keeping churches are not a unit in favor of using the power of the State to force rigid Sunday observance upon the public; and, second, because it reveals plainly the fact that the fight against the Sunday opening of the Museum is made solely upon religious grounds.

The Independent truly says of the workingman "that a great deal is asked for in his behalf for which he is not responsible." This is true; and of nothing is it more true than of the demand for Sunday laws made in the name of the workingmen. It will be remembered that in the city of Washington, February 18, 1890, Mr. Crafts produced before the Committee on the District of Columbia, a Mr. Schulteis who said that he represented Local Assembly, No. 2,672, of the Knights of Labor, and that that Assembly had indorsed the Breckinridge Sunday bill. But unfortunately for this claim Mr. Millard F. Hobbs, master workman of the whole federation of the Knights of Labor in the District of Columbia, was present, and presented the matter in quite another light. He said:—

No one has been authorized by the Knights of Labor to speak in favor of this bill. Mr. Schulteis is not authorized to speak for the Knights of Labor. It is true Mr. Schulteis is a member of a committee having charge of certain matters, but that committee has nothing to do with this question. The Knights of Labor are virtually opposed to this bill. Some are in favor of some parts of it; some are in favor of all of it; and some are entirely opposed to all of it. For this reason the Knights of Labor of the District, as an organization, have refused to have anything to do with it. We are all in favor of a day of rest, some of two days; but we are afraid of the religious side of this question. What benefits the Knights of Labor wish to obtain, we think can be better secured by our own efforts through our own organizations than by the efforts of others, through the Church.

One who was present and heard Mr. Hobbs speak, says:—

This speech, coming as it did, was more or less of a surprise to all; but to Mr. Crafts and his party it was "a stunner." It instantly crushed to atoms the whole pet theory which they had so nicely framed and so pathetically presented in behalf of "the poor workingmen who are so cruelly oppressed by being forced to labor on Sunday;" and of the Church's gallant effort to liberate them from "the Egyptian bondage of Sunday slavery." Nothing could have happened that would more clearly expose the perfect hollowness of the plea that is made by the American Sabbath Union, that this Sunday movement is in the interests of the workingmen, than did this unpremeditated and wholly unsolicited speech.

The idea that workingmen are, as a class, so devoted to Sunday that they want art museums closed against them upon the only day that they can as a rule spend time to visit them, is absurd. Such a claim never would be made were it not that the friends of a State-bolstered Sunday sacredness feel that they must make a stand somewhere. What they want to secure is general recognition of the principle, that the State is the proper guardian of the Sunday institution. In discussing this very matter, the Catholic Review, of May 9, says:—

Where the Christian Sunday is a fact in the national life the observance of it in one fashion or another, provided its sanctity be kept, is of no moment.

This is the Catholic view of the matter, and it is rapidly coming to be the Protestant view; that is, the observance of Sunday in any particular way is not important if only its sacred character be recognized; but that is just what the State has no right to do; yet it is the very thing that Protestants and Catholics alike demand that the State and all acting under State authority shall do.

This accounts for the everlasting ringing of the changes upon the so-called demand of the workingmen for Sunday laws, and for the Sunday slamming of the doors of the art museums in their faces. The State is a political concern; it turns this way or that way in obedience to votes; the workingmen have votes, hence the anxiety of the Sunday-law, Sunday-museum-closing advocates to make the impression general that the workingmen are exceedingly desirous of being excluded from museums upon the only day when they have time to visit them.
