## Army Chaplains

Under the subject of chaplains in the army, General Schofield says:—

> Under the conditions now existing a corps of chaplains, which being a part of the military force, composed of the adversaries to as many diverse denominations as there are chaplains, is impractical. In all other things the War Department provides that whatever is needed for the benefit of the soldiers should be attracted and governed; but in religion and in morals it must alone would not to the same the foreada that is lay the fundamental principles of our Government. There is, therefore, very great field for the performance of effectual religious service in the army, and great danger of doing more harm than good by any attempt to exercise military control or influence over religious matters. My suggestion is that the best policy would be to have the various garrisons in the army bear to select religious audiences of his choice as they, at their conferences in this country, and the army as the denominations shall desire to send the necessary money to pay for their services, and that the respective departments regulate the rank of their election. In this manner a lepers disposition in behalf of the of all, would have the effect of more tracts, look at least a part of the year, whose services.

From personal experience we know, not only that there is very little field for the exercise of duties of religious services in the army, but that there is a good deal less performance in this than the size of the field allows; but the General's proposition to have pay for of the citizens of those whom the army might deny.

"And not the Departments or could the mode of their election, would leave the entirely just about as it is now. We really cannot not today until before the matter yet any right this thing to do for a Congress and all challenges. Of it that were done the army and the navy would needless want to the equipment in the position they possibly can under any system of government the chaplains that are chosen do the men as good, and they prevent others from doing them any good. If this system was right—and to its right in law, then the soldiers and the marines of the United States are not citizens interested in their religious welfare, and would do this great thing right for those who intended to do it. In this way many times more good would come to the army and navy than are ever possibly come under any system of chaplains that could be arranged.
