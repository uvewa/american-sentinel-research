WE have received from the author, Rev. A. P. McDiarmid, pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist Church, Brooklyn, a copy of an excellent pamphlet entitled, "Should Church Property Be Taxed?" Mr. McDiarmid answers in the affirmative and supports that answer by irrefutable arguments. The pamphlet is the best thing on the subject that we have seen, and should be read by everybody. The publisher is E. Scott, 134 West 23d Street, New York. We do not know the price, but think that 10 cents sent to the publisher would secure a copy.
