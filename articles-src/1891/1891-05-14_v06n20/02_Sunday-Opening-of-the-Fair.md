REPORT there is from a Chicago *Fair* office, the demand is made that it close on the Fair grounds. As there are two days recognized as the day of religious rest,—each by a good Christian bodies, which is to have the preference? The seventh-day people have as many rights as the first-day, and the Government has just as much right to protect the conscientious scruples of the one as the other. As a matter of luxury and of fact the seventh-day folks have the best of the argument, though the great mass of indifferent people are not particular which day is kept, so that there is a day kept. It is all-considerations there is no harm taken by keeping each exhibit open on Sunday. On the continent of Europe, Sunday is election day. In Ireland, at present, Sunday is the day of campaign speeches, and priests think it no evil, after their clerical duties, to do a bit of work on the stump.—*San Francisco Alto.*
