THE Observer notes that

the Select Committee on Public Petitions has reported two hundred and twenty-six petitions forwarded to Parliament against the recent bill for the removal of Catholic disabilities, but not one in its favor. Liberalism in reference to church matters has made considerable progress, but a revulsion of feeling is quite possible. Mr. Spurgeon expresses the feeling that the Society for the Liberation of the Church from State Control, has gone too far along political lines, and he refuses the use of the Tabernacle for the Society's annual meeting.

The two movements have, of course, drawn their support from Nonconformists, but all Nonconformists are evidently not ready to wipe out all religious distinctions.

These "two movements" referred to are the attempt to remove Catholic disabilities, and to free the Church from the control of the State, or separate Church and State. Every example of the advocacy of religious freedom which is not based on the pure principle of liberty as it is found in Christ will experience a "revulsion of feeling," and finally prove its complete inadequacy, becoming at last, instead of a defender of the faith, an efficient aid to the enemies of religious freedom.

These movements are in this instance inspired by selfish or mixed motives, for if they were introduced, advocated, and supported, solely on the gospel ground of "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them," it would not be possible to "go too far," and no one, while yet a Christian, would feel any "revulsion" from such a course in the affairs of either Church or State.
