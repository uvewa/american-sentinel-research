PRESIDENT SHEPARD, of the American Sabbath Union, is profoundly concerned because of the refusal of the World's Fair Commission to decide definitely and at once to close the great Fair on the first day of the week. On a recent Sunday he told the congregation of the Asbury Methodist Church, that the reason why Chicago has of late been in the clutches of the grip was that the directors of the coming World's Fair in that city have not yet decided whether or not the Fair shall be closed on Sunday. Upon this the Recorder remarks that "it would perhaps be interesting to know what, in Colonel Shepard's opinion, is the cause of the grip in New York, and whether there is such a thing as a sin bacillus."

The readiness with which those who are engineering this Sunday business constitute themselves interpreters of God's dealing with men, is amazing, or would be, did we not remember that ofttimes "the wish is father of the thought." These men covet the power to punish those who believe and practice differently from themselves, but not possessing that power they imagine that the misfortunes common to all men are special judgments from God upon those whom they deem great sinners while they themselves are saints. In all such cases the words of Christ recorded in Luke 13:1-5 are to the point. The President of the American Sabbath Union may suppose that the grip in Chicago is an evidence of the special displeasure of God against that city, but the conclusion is altogether gratuitous and only shows that some people would love to have it so, and would, if they could, add to the supposed divine judgment, tangible evidences of their own displeasure.
