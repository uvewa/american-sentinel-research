A LAWYER in North Carolina, who has read THE SENTINEL three months, writes:

I have been reading with pleasure and decided approval the numbers of THE SENTINEL you have kindly sent me. About two years ago, I wrote for the local paper an article on the origin and sanctity of the Christian Sabbath, commonly called Sunday, and respecting its nature and obligation, to correct what I consider general ignorance and misconception on the subject; and it was highly approved by many persons of piety and learning, including churchmen; but it stirred up such a bitter feeling and controversy on the part of a Presbyterian clergyman and his followers, that after a few replies and rejoinders I quit the subject, with good grace, however. I have no time to write at length and refer to much of the ground covered by THE SENTINEL. I will only sum up briefly my politics on the whole subject. I believe that the Saviour intended that his gospel should be propagated by simple preaching without the aid of the State; that it does not require any outside help, and that the whole world can not suppress it. It can accomplish nothing except through its effect on the hearts and consciences of men, and it can do this only when presented to them gently and lovingly, and it must be accepted voluntarily, without force, constraint, or interference of law. Whilst the Christian's life is a warfare, the fight must be between the man and himself, and his evil passions and appetites, and not between him and some one else who wants to make him good by force, if need be, whether he will or no. This puts the devil in any one, and makes him hate religion, if such be religion. The Church and its ministry should not strive with men, except by earnest plea and entreaty; and when it goes out into the world and interferes by law, or personal opposition, with the business or pleasures of men, it abandons its field of duty, and surrenders all its power and its influence. You have a herculean task before you to set the country straight on this subject.
