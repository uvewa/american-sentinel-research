It is stated that those who cause arrest of persons for having their places of business open on Sunday, in Tacoma, have learned that they must themselves pay the costs. Under the direction of Mr. Crafts an ordinance had been drawn up making the city responsible for the costs in all such cases, but it failed to pass.
