THE National Temperance Congress has been called to meet August 18 and 19, 1891, in the Auditorium of the National Prohibition Park, Staten Island, New York. "We ask," says the call, "all local, State and national temperance societies (regardless of sex or politics), and all churches and Sunday schools, and other associations which hate the saloon, to send representatives to the National Temperance Congress."
