## A Lawyer in North Carolina, who has read THE SENTINEL, writes three months, says:

I have been reading with interest the American Sentinel which a brother in our Baptist Church, Brooklyn, a copy of an excellent pamphlet entitled "Church Property. Its Power To Taxed" etc. Mr. Dimond answers in the affirmative and suggests that answer be sent by the parties. This pamphlet is the best thing in the subject that they were saying, and should be read by everybody. The publisher, E. Stokes, 84 West 28th Street, New York. We do not know the price, but think that it cast to cents the pamphlet.
