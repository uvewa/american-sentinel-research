IN RUSSIA the Russian who deserts the national religion for a purer form is a traitor to the State, and will be punished promptly as such. In this country the American Sabbath Union is doing all in its power to place all who do not keep Sunday under a like ban, to disgrace them in the eyes of their fellows, and to punish them by law. The principle in either case is the same, and it is no better in America than in Russia.

A ST. PETERSBURG dispatch, of April 30, says:—

The priests and pastors of Moscow are overwhelmed with requests from Jews for baptism in order to avoid expulsion. The law prevents such conversions, except in the case of Lutherans and Catholics, and then permits conversions only in limited numbers.

The reasons for these requests for baptism is that the Russian Government is expelling the Jews; the dispatch continues:—

The expelled Jews are cruelly treated, being marched out of the city afoot chained in bands by the wrists. The Russians afterward pillage the deserted shops and houses.

And this is practical National Reform by a "Christian Government" that rules by "divine right"!
