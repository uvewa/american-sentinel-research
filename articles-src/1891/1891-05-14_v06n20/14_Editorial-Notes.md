IT is stated that those who are prosecuted for any purpose of having their places of business open on Sunday, in Tacoma, have learned that they must themselves pay the costs. Under the direction of Mr. Crafts an ordinance had been drawn up making the city responsible for the time and such cases, but failed to pass.

THE Prohibition and Prohibitory-ists are having a worse time already among the year suspension of the seven ministers who, some months took the positions that under the United States Constitution, as it is, we not the Christian Nation, the New York organ of the denomination, is full of the controversy, and it seems that no end is in sight.

THE *Christian at Work,* of May 7, says some persons become wonderfully interested in the possible welfare of the workingman through and one find not so good arguments in its favor. Let us look about the interests of working in the gift of nature and under all provisions of rest.

That is just what we have always said.

PRESIDENT SHEPARD, of the American Sabbath Union, is profoundly concerned because of the refusal of the World's Fair Commission to decide Sunday closure and to close the great Fair on the first-day of the week. A record from his told to the congregations of the Albery Methodist Church, that the reason why Chicago has of late been in the clutches of the grip and Prohibition to them, because the World's Fair in that city have not yet decided whether or not the Fair shall be closed on Sunday. Upon this the *Recorder* remarks: that "it would perhaps be interesting to know what, in Colonel Shepard's opinion, is the cause of the grip in New York, and whether there is such a thing as a sin bacillus."

The readiness with which those who are engineering this Sunday business constitute themselves interpreters of God, dealing out, meaning, it, and would be, did it not remember that oftimes "the wish is father of the thought." These men covet the power to punish those who believe and practice differently from them-[160]selves, not yet possessing that power they imagine that the misfortunes common to all men are special judgments from God upon those whom they deem great sinners while they themselves are saints. In all the care the words of Christ recorded in Luke 13:1-5 are to the point. The President of the American Sabbath Union may suppose that the grip in Chicago is an evidence of the special displeasure of God against that city, but the conclusion is altogether gratuitous, and only shows that some people would love to have it so, and would, if they could, add to the supposed divine judgment, tangible evidences of their own displeasure.

THE National Temperance Congress has been called to meet August 18 and 19, 1891, in the Auditorium of the National Prohibition Park, Staten Island, New York. "We ask," says the call, "all local, State and national temperance societies (regardless of any political), and all churches and Sunday schools, and other associations which hate the saloon, to send representatives to the National Temperance Congress."

IN Russia the Russian who deserts the national religion for a pure form is a traitor to the State, and will be punished promptly as such. In this country the American Sabbath Union is doing its in power to place all who do not keep Sunday under a like ban, to disregard them in the eyes of their fellows, and to punish them by law. The principles are similar in the nation, and it is in no better a interest than in Russia.

A St. Petersburgh dispatch, of April 28, says:—

> The priests and pastors of Moscow are over-exerted in order to prevent the threatened exposure of the people under to avoid expulsion. The law presents such an alternative being the exclusion of the Hebrews, Catholics; and these permits concessions only in case of extreme necessity.

The reasons for these requests required in turn is that the Russian Government finding expelling the Jews, the dispatch continues:—

> The expelled Jews are cruelly treated, being marched out of the city about chained in bands by the wrists. The Russians observed strictly the dividing steps and fences.

And in practical National Reform by a "Christian Government" that rules by "divine right."

IN opposing the Sunday opening of the Museum of Art, in Central Park, the *Christian at Work* says:—

> The Museum is only open two evenings of the week; and it is the testimony of the officers of the Museum itself, that working people would prefer the listening or artists than shall themselves of the opportunity to pay a week's values. There is no reason to suppose that Sunday opening would be patronized by the attendance.

There is no force to this objection. The fact that workingmen do not rush to the Museum in the evening is no evidence that they would not go on Sunday. The only reasonable presumption is that the Sunday attendance would be large, and largely of those who can not well pare the time to go on other days.

THE *Mail and Express* is also troubled over the agitation in favor of opening the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday. It says:—

> The whole movement for opening museums on Sunday is backed by the interests of the American Sabbath, and by the liquor dealers and others who are opposed to the religious observance of the day in this country. As far the anticipated benefits to the workingmen of opening the collection, experience shows that they would not follow. The Nation's art galleries stand in taken for easy by working men on Sunday, and the galleries in London were not perceptible in a promise of to getting into by the public.

The charge that this movement is backed by the liquor dealers is simply silly, and as false as it is foolish; nobody to send Elliot Shepard would ever suggest that all thing. We would beg to suggest to the *Mail and Express* that there is some difference in dissipation: in favor of the Paris and those of New York; many of whom are quite as capable of appreciating the beautiful arts as are the members of the "Four Hundred." We also rise to remark that the action of the workingmen in London, wheeled at they doubtless were by Sabbatarians, does not prove that the Metropolitan art binding American workingmen.

The *Mail and Express* should inform itself touching Sunday and common law, instead of advocacy of Sunday closing of museums.

We have received from the author, Rev. W. F. Crafts, a copy of an excellent pamphlet entitled, "Church Property. Its Power To Taxed" etc. Mr. Dimond answers in the affirmative and suggests that answer be sent by the parties. This pamphlet is the best thing in the subject that they were saying, and should be read by everybody. The publisher, E. Stokes, 84 West 28th Street, New York. We do not know the price, but think that it cast to cents the pamphlet.
