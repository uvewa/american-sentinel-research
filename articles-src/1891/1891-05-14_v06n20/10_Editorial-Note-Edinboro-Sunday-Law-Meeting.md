A RECENT Sunday-law meeting in Edinboro, Pennsylvania, passed, among others, the following resolution relative to this paper:—

That we warn the people of our community against the insidious attacks of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL and other secularist publications, and all those who aim to defeat or antagonize legislation designed to perpetuate to all our people the preservation of the Christian Sabbath.

The same meeting heartily indorsed the ironclad Sunday law of Pennsylvania, in these words:—

We utter our indignant protest against the proposal to modify, nullify, repeal, or in any way impair the efficiency of our Sunday law of 1794. Laws which for nearly one hundred years have stood as a bulwark in defense of our Christian Sabbath.

They should have added: A law which for nearly one hundred years has made it possible for any religious bigot who wished to do so to persecute those who differed from him in the matter of Sunday observance. Possibly the Rev. J. L. McCartney, under whose directions these resolutions were drawn and adopted, does not know that under that same law of 1794 Seventh-day Baptists have been repeatedly fined and imprisoned for doing common labor on Sunday, after having conscientiously observed the seventh day according to the fourth commandment. But Mr. McCartney is an officer of the American Sabbath Union, and the works of the Union he will do.
