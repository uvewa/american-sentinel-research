THE Mail and Express is also troubled over the agitation in favor of opening the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday. It asserts that

the whole movement for opening museums on Sunday is backed by the enemies of the American Sabbath, and by the liquor dealers and others who are constantly trying to introduce European license into this country. As for the anticipated benefits to the workingmen of opening the Museum, experience shows that they would not follow. The Paris art galleries are visited by very few workingmen on Sunday, and the galleries in London were closed in pursuance of a petition signed by the workingmen themselves.

The charge that this movement is backed by the liquor dealers is simply silly, and is as false as it is foolish; nobody but Editor Shepard would ever suggest such a thing. We would beg to suggest to the Mail and Express that there is some difference between the workingmen of Paris and those of New York, and the difference is altogether in favor of the workingmen of New York; many of whom are quite as capable of appreciating the beautiful as are the members of the "Four Hundred." We also rise to remark that the action of the workingmen in London, wheedled as they doubtless were by Sunday-law advocates, should not be considered as binding American workingmen. The Mail and Express should infuse a little honesty and common sense into its advocacy of Sunday closing of museums.
