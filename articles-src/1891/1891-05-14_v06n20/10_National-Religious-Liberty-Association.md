## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible as taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and in obeying what is of any civil government in legislating to have.

We believe, without exception, that the civil rights, which are equal for all people, should be granted to all.

We deny to believe it be our duty to not say out to every bill or which it may set all to purpose or law unjust and their civil religion.

A SECRET Sunday-law meeting in Ellicottville, Pennsylvania, passed, among other things, the following resolution relative to the papers:

That we warn the people of our community against the insidious attacks of the AMERICAN SENTINEL upon Sabbath-day institutions, and also of those who aim to defeat or extinguish legislation designed to perpetuate to all our people the power valued of the Christian liberty.

The same meeting heartily indorsed the invaded Sunday law of Pennsylvania, in these words:—

We utter our indignant protest against the pretended right to modify, repeal, or in any way impair the efficiency of our Sunday law of 1794, and ask a bolstered in defense of our American institutions.

They should have added: A law which for nearly one hundred years has made it possible for any religious bigot that wished to do so to persecute those who differed from him in the matter of Sunday observance. For a matter of fact, it has been under whose direction these the resolutions were drawn and adopted, does not know that under the same act of 1794 Seventh-Day Baptists have been repeatedly fined and imprisoned for doing common labor the observed the seventh day according to the fourth commandment. But Mr. McCarthy is only an officer of the American Sabbath, and the works of the Union do not stop at trifles.
