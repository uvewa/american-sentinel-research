## Judge Hammond and the Seventh-day Adventists.

ANOTHER very important, and what would seem a rather peculiar commentary upon Judge Hammond's decision in the famous King case, is the following facts:

The petitioner can not shelter himself just yet, behind the doctrine and tenets of religion, in denying the existence of a law, and the application to him. He is entitled to be heard in his own religious feeling or sentiment on the enforcement of the particular law, in mitigation of the first, should be set apart by the polite for the duty of public rest and religious observance. This is what he really believes and wishes, he and his sect, and we must say that such involuntary observance about what shall be his own day of public rest, and his own day of labor. His conviction is, that in this, as in his other religious principles, the real sentiment of heaven and earth demand, not that they set apart a day of public rest, not in a law founded on the usages and customs, and not that religious freedom has been denied to him. His day not being to claim the time that would altogether at law for all men if not for some but one day in "civil" society in casting, religion, and akin to maintaining the situation, for one more than the prohibition on the sacrificing of human life by himself and all men, in the distinguishing demand of civilization.

This is an important statement for more reason than one, all of which we can not just now notice. It presumes to define for Mr. King, and the people with whom he is religiously connected, just what they really believe and wish. The thing it does, in too, in such a way that it appears that the Judge considers himself capable of defining their beliefs and wishes, according to his own views, more plainly and more authoritatively than they themselves are able to.

We say that his statement is the statement of his own views, and not theirs, because we personally know that as a matter of fact, the views attributed to them by Judge Hammond, are not, in any sense, the views held by themselves, and which are matters of public record. In other words, we know and are abundantly able to prove, and shall prove, that the statements made by Judge Hammond, as quoted above, are not true in any sense whatever.

As to the belief and wish of Mr. King as an individual, in this matter, we are able to present it in his own words and in his own signature, as the following plainly shows:

---

43 Bond St., New York,
*Nov. 6, 1891.*

Mr. R. M. King,

*Dear Sir:—*Judge E. B. Hammond, in the decision in your case, made certain statements as to what you and your people *really* believe and wish. As the following is a part of the record referred to your case—portions of which we have published—we ask you to be kind enough to write to us, stating, from what *I know of yourself and your people personally*, whether or not you agree with these statements, endorsed separately, with your comments on it, which I would respectfully ask, as it relates to your personal and his beliefs.

ALONZO T. JONES,
C. P. BOLLMAN,
W. H. McKEE.

*The statement of Judge Hammond as referred to above, was then sent to Mr. King, to which he replied as follows:—*

---

Eco. A. Oates,
*Solicitor, Obion Co., Tenn.,*
*Nov. 11, 1891.*

---

[In] *His [King's] own religious feeling or sentimentality on enforcement of this particular law in mitigation of the first, should be set apart by the polite for the duty of public rest and religious observance.*

*Answer:* "This is not true, and never was true in any respect."

*"This is what he really believes and wishes, he and his sect, and we must say that such involuntary observance about what shall be his own day of public rest."*

Question: Is this true in any sense? That is, does he wish an involuntary observance about what his day of rest shall be?

*Answer:* "I never did believe or wish for such a thing."

Q. Do you really believe and wish that heaven and humanity demand that the seventh day be your own day of public rest and his own day of labor?

*Answer:* "To the best of my knowledge and belief the Judge has no right to declare a true statement of the religious matters of the Seventh-day Adventists."

*Answer:* "I know of no one of my sect believers who so wish."

*"His real complaint is that his adversaries in this state pass the acts of religious control against him and the laws formed on that usage and custom, and not that religious freedom has been denied to him."*

Q. Is it true that his real complaint is that the Sunday observers observe the usages and customs of the country?

*Answer:* "It is not."

Q. Is this your real and unqualified complaint that religious freedom has been denied you?

*Answer:* "That is true indeed."

*"His day not being to claim the time would altogether at law for all men if not for some but one day for the duty of rest."*

Q. As for the Seventh-day Adventists, as a denomination, or a "sect," or a "peculiar sect," there is something to be said also, there is a public record upon this subject, which is plain and unmistakable. Nor is it merely a record in the occupancy of one man or one term. It is a public record; public, too, in the sense that it is a part of the record of the Senate of the United States. December 13, 1888, the United States Senate Committee on Education and Labor held the argument on a National Sunday law, which had been introduced in the Senate by Senator Blair, chairman of this committee. At that hearing the Seventh-day Adventists were officially represented. In the arguments that were there made by them in the person of their official representative, this very point was brought out clearly and distinctly more than once, and we here present their position as stated in that argument, and since published by themselves, and which has thus been made plain to all who have a mind to read upon the subject. We quote:—

Senator Blair—Would it answer your objection in that regard, if instead of saying "the Lord's day," we should say "Sunday"?

Mr. Jones—No. Because the underlying principle is the same. The basis of it is the religious legislation in regard to it; its ecclesiastical legislation, and we want nothing to do with it, no matter under what name it comes.

Now do not misunderstand us on this point. We are Seventh-day Adventists; but if this bill were in favor of Saturday, the seventh day—the Sabbath of the Lord—if there were a bill in Congress to promote its observance, we would oppose it just as we oppose it as it is now, for the reason that civil government has nothing to do with what we owe to God, or whether we are obeying or not, or whether we keep any day or not. . . . therefore, we say if this bill were framed in behalf of the real Sabbath of the Lord, the seventh day, the day which we observe as the Sabbath, we should oppose it just as much. We would not compel to do no work upon that day, or would compel men to do anything that pertains to our observance of that day: because the State is not to lord over the conscience. . . .

I was arguing upon the principle of the thing—the principles established by Jesus Christ—that with that which is God's, the civil government must never have anything to do. It is a matter solely between man and God; and if any man does not render to God what is God's, he must answer to God, and not to any man, nor's any organization of men, for it, for no earthly organization or power has a right to assume the prerogative of God. . . .

. . . And any power that undertakes to provide the means for any man, for religious service of any kind, is to that extent a religious establishment, in favor of religion. Any civil government in this attempt, sets itself against the rights of man and the prerogatives of God. . . .

This Sunday bill proposes to have the Government to just hold this, and Seventh-day Adventists—

[Some reflections upon the author of the bill, this National Sunday bill which is under consideration, and without the enforcement of the law for a "civil Sunday." He viewed this considered law as worse than all other Sunday laws in that there were no restrictions, and not as a Sunday law that was not anti-christian, and there is therefore no law that can be civil in the enforcement of a religious rest day.]

Senator Blair—You oppose all the Sunday laws of the country then?

Mr. Jones—We do.

Senator Blair—You are against all Sunday laws?

Mr. Jones—Yes, sir.

Senator Blair—State and national, sir.

Mr. Jones—Yes, sir.

Senator Blair—In other words, you take the ground that nobody has any right for, that under the auspices of the question, society may not require an observance in any manner, of the Sabbath? this Sunday?

Mr. Jones—As to its disturbing others, I have answered that before; in asking about the Sunday statutes or my position exactly—

Senator Blair—I understand that the way you—

Mr. Jones—I do not see from what you are saying that our position is as precisely as stated, and that it is conformity at the present time. You say that it is one way and they say that it another.

Mr. Jones—But they say after a law is enforced for the observance of the day on its first-day benefits, and they know that Sunday is the first day, and they assert that any command in regard to it. The commandment says to keep the seventh day.

Senator Blair—Is it still the Sabbath?

Mr. Jones—Certainly; and we keep it; but we do not propose—our opposition to Sunday legislation—

*Senator Blair—*The civil government of the United States is their position.

Mr. Jones—That was a theocracy.

Senator Blair—You are entirely logical, because you may claim to have no Sunday legislation in the State or Nation either.

Mr. Jones—Of course I am logical, all the way through, on the platform upon which I stand, and upon which this whole system is founded, and the reason I do this is because the civil power is co-equal to the legislature of the Nation. As you observe, this bill has an exemption clause providing that not all who shall not be constrained to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week; the regulation day of rest. This first gives us more reason to oppose the bill than if that exemption clause were not in it; because then we will be able to see that our opposition arises from a deeper and higher cause than of mere selfishness.

Again—

Mr. Oates—Mr. Jones has been referring to the past action of the General-day Adventist churches and laws in Washington. I have called their attention to a point, and, by a ruling, that they recognized religion in regard to this subject.

*Senator Blair—* New York City, Editor of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.

Mr. Jones—Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee: This whole argument on this subject was made on behalf of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. The material that was discussed was the subject which was made as much of by the petitioner who was just as well the other side. My attention has been called to it by one member of this committee for the purpose of showing the Seventh-day Adventist opposition to this legislation.

Congress can make no law upon the subject of religion without interfering with the free exercise thereof. The enforcement of the observance of Sunday or any other day upon the religious ground of observing Saturday would most obviously oppose our principles. That is why I present our position as we wish it known. The fact is that such religious exercise of our right to keep that day as they are faithfully. Therefore we say to any kind in protection: We do not ask you to protect us by legislation. If you do, we ask you to publish in favor of advocating, or in the mind of any exemption clause. We ask you to accord to us our inherent rights as free men, to mind of our worship, and to set up our practice in our constitutional rights as American citizens, to be let alone.

Gentlemen: It is time for all the people to decide that this Sunday, this advocacy doctrine, this whole Nation is, and of right ought to be, a man and religion matter, with the government out of it.

If any further evidence be required here it is:

*The statement of Judge Hammond as referred to above, was then sent to Mr. King, to which he replied as follows:—*

Eco. A. Oates,
*Solicitor, Obion Co., Tenn.,*
*Nov. 11, 1891.*

*Answer:* "This is not true, and never was true in any respect."

*"This is what he really believes and wishes, he and his sect, and we must say that such involuntary observance about what shall be his own day of public rest."*

Question: Is this true in any sense? That is, does he wish an involuntary observance about what his day of rest shall be?

*Answer:* "I never did believe or wish for such a thing."

Q. Do you really believe and wish that heaven and humanity demand that the seventh day be your own day of public rest and his own day of labor?

*Answer:* "To the best of my knowledge and belief the Judge has no right to so define our belief."

*Answer:* "I know of no one of my sect believers who so wish."

*"His real complaint is that his adversaries in this state pass the acts of religious control against him and the laws formed on that usage and custom, and not that religious freedom has been denied to him."*

Q. Is it true that the Sunday observers observe the usages and customs of the country?

*Answer:* "It is not."

Q. Is this your real and unqualified complaint that religious freedom has been denied you?

*Answer:* "That is true indeed."

*"His day not being to claim the time that would altogether at all, on say if there is no law applicable all men if not some but one day of rest."*

Q. As for the Seventh-day Adventists, as a denomination, or a "sect," or a "peculiar sect," there is something to be said also. There is a record upon this subject, which is plain and unmistakable. Nor is it merely a private record in the occupancy of one man. It is a public record; public, too, in the sense that it is a part of the record of the Senate of the United States.

We quote:—

*He is the enjoining the asserting influence of the fourth commandment, the literal observance of which by himself and all, it is the distinguishing demand of his own peculiar sect.*

Q. Is this his position for the official representative of the Seventh-day Adventist body?

*Answer:* "So far as my knowledge goes, it is not. No, never."

*Is the disturbing or any other observer of the fourth commandment, the literal observance of which by himself and all he in its distinguishing demand of his own peculiar sect, to also violate by any form of human law?*

Q. To the best of your knowledge and belief does any other observation on this record thereon?

*Answer:* "So far as my knowledge goes, it is not."

Again—

Mr. Jones—Here is our desire in the legislative matter. This is a part of our memorial to Congress, sent at a time in this same season of the year, and we ask no relief for ourselves that we are not willing should extend to every other person in the country. Our proposition asks to reject; and an exemption clause in the bill in favor of those who keep any other day amounts to nothing.

Senator Blair—Your proposition is to strike out the Sabbath from the Constitution and condition of affairs of the United States, is it not?

Mr. Jones—Yes, sir; of its constitutional—

Senator Blair—Certainly, so far as the science and observance of the Sabbath are concerned.

Mr. Jones—Yes, sir, by civil law.

Again—

Mr. Jones—As to the whole principle of the thing—
We have objected to this whole Sunday law and religious legislation, and Sunday laws in particular; the question is—

Senator Blair—Is it in the civil law of the United States?

Mr. Jones—It is, in the civil law of the United States, as religious legislation. And the American Seventh-day Adventists have always protested against all religious legislation, and we believe that States' human provision protests which shall be in the form of law. . . .

Senator Blair—Then this is a constitutional question?

Mr. Jones—Certainly. Giving it that is a matter for religious—

Senator Blair—There is a proposition that it must have an exemption clause, and upon this ground?

Senator Blair—You can not be both in the field—

Mr. Jones—Here is our desire in the legislative matter. This is a part of our memorial to Congress. And upon the same platform from which the Nation speaks, upon which all the rights of all the people stand, we ask to others only what we ask for ourselves.

Senator Blair—You say that the proposed amendment does not go far enough for the Seventh-day Adventists?

Mr. Jones—Not a bit.

Was not this the only record in the case. February, 1890, the House Committee received the hearing of this bill. A Sunday bill introduced by Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, for the District of Columbia. At this hearing also the Seventh-day Adventists were again before the committee to show the record of the District of Columbia was heard before the committee. From the verbatim report of the speeches made by them that hearing we quote:—

Mr. Jones—Mr. Chairman: I have little time to present all my matter. I will present the very nearest, some arguments to present against the bill. I will begin with a reading from which this whole history of the last weeks that we may present. Credit for his criticism when the position of himself and other Adventists at the hearing has shown the facts of the law as having influence in the particular State or in the particular district.

That from here on to the end of these proceedings: that at that time when any measure is to require those who keep the Sabbath from any distinction of the Sabbath, the king lives in giving conduct to its wishes, and old laws, any good citizen—

. . . for years of service, appears in the Presbyterian confrontation to lords and establishment and religion to be quite in this passage of Scripture, then tells them what he says is in the in the matter before us and relates to things of that nature: that in a what state must be done. The States is that a while a part must be on civil law, and this puts an end to all controversy; his wish was carried on to the letter. . . .

"A fearful religious persecution has everywhere made fair inlaying, and can there be only visit to the authorities from God's purpose, that the authorities to know how tragical and cruel the logic of toleration and State religions when worked out in the hands of despotic power.

"Whatever may have been the aggravating causes, nothing only the love of the foot. If you view this principle and each instrument to take the first step, those who got the power will use it so that they take the last step in the history."

Again—

Senator Blair—Your proposition is to strike out the Sabbath from the Constitution and condition of affairs of the United States?

Mr. Jones—Yes, sir; by civil law.

Again—

Mr. Jones—As to the whole principle of the thing, the question is, we ask no relief for ourselves that we are not willing should extend to every other person in the country. . . .

Mr. Jones—I object to the whole principle of the thing. It matters not in the least, whether it is a State or whether it is a National bill. If it is a question that is in the State—

Senator Blair—Is it in the civil law of the United States?

Mr. Jones—It is, in the civil law of the United States, as religious legislation. And the American human provision protests which shall be in the form of law. . . .

Senator Blair—Giving it that is a matter for religious legislation?

Mr. Jones—Certainly. Giving it that is a matter for religious. . . .

Mr. Jones—I object to the whole principle of the thing. We have objected to this whole Sunday law and religious legislation, and Sunday laws in particular. We ask to others only what we ask for ourselves.

Senator Blair—You say that the proposed amendment does not go far enough for the Seventh-day Adventists?

Mr. Jones—Not a bit.

---

This evidence which cannot be controverted, it is demonstrated that the statements of Judge Hammond as to the belief and wish of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and wish of the Seventh-day Adventists are false in every particular. Indeed, all the points made in the argument before the United States Senate Committee, December 13, 1888, had never been controverted till this nineteenth day of November, 1891, and were now publicly made for the first time, in direct and irrefutable contradiction of the statements of the Judge, it will not be possible to reach them now, as flatly contradictory to those statements of the Judge.

But as these points have been matter of public national record, and matter of knowledge to thousands upon thousands of the people, for nearly three years past for Judge Hammond set forth his decision, this first leaves him—a judge—of a court of the United States; of the unexceptionable predicament of having upon a simple question of fact, officially published to the world a set of statements which are not only untrue in themselves, but which public and official records also to be untrue, and which thousands upon thousands of the people know to be untrue.
