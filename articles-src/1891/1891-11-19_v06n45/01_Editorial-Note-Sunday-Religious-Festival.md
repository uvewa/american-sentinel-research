THE AMERICAN SENTINEL maintains the inalienable right of every man to profess any religion or none just as he chooses; and it denies the right of any association of religious people to compel those who are not religious to act as though they were, or to conform to any religious observance, or to recognize any religious institution. It likewise denies the right of the State to pronounce any religious or ecclesiastical institution a civil thing and by that means compel conformity to it.

SUNDAY is, and always was, a religious festival. It was originally sacred to the worship of the sun god, and is now very generally regarded as commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and is by many held to be the Sabbath. If it were not regarded as sacred there would be no demand for laws enforcing its observance. It is therefore a matter that the State has no right to touch. It is true that the friends of Sunday legislation have learned wisdom by past experience, and endeavor as much as possible to keep in the background the fact that their motive is religious, but they can never get away from the facts. They demand a "civil Sabbath;" but what they mean is a religious Sabbath enforced by civil law.
