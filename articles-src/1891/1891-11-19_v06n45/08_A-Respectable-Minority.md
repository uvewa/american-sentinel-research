The Duluth Herald publishes a letter from G. H. McClelland, in which some wholesome principles are stated so clearly that he who runs may read. Speaking of the action of the Baptist Convention at St. Cloud, Minnesota, he says:—

> They not only protested against the use of State moneys for the advancement of Roman Catholicism, but also against the use of public money in the interests of "any denomination whatsoever."
>
> Second, we would have it understood that this is distinctly a Baptist principle; and therefore, true to this, you will search in vain for a line of history to show that they have ever received a cent from the State for their schools, though in repeated instances it has been offered. We are opposed to any alliance whatsoever between the Church and State. We believe in taxation of all church property by the State. The First Baptist Church of Toronto has but recently appealed to the State authorities to take their property from the exemption list. Again, the Baptists make no demand for Bible reading and prayer in the schools. The denomination at large repudiates such a charge. Anything you can do, Mr. Editor, to keep Church and State apart in all lines, will be appreciated by your "immersion friends" to the number of 3,000,000, in the United States.

As R. Heber Newton says, "every thinking Presbyterian is a heretic" so every thoughtful professing Christian holds what the National Reform Association would consider heretical views as regards Church and State, and the interference of either in the affairs of the other. This contingent, which is by no means small, from all denominations, together with these three millions of Baptists, the Seventh-day Baptists, the Seventh-day Adventists, the Jews, ought to constitute a sufficiently respectable minority among religious people to command the attention, and the respectful consideration of the "National Reformers."
