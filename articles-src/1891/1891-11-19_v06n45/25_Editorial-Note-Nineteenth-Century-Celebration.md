THE number of centennials, expositions, and commemorative exhibitions of one kind and another, in these days, is suggestive of a desire to wind up the world's affairs in a display of human glorification. The last proposition of this kind comes from the Chicago Evening Journal and recommends "the celebration of the nineteenth century of Christianity in 1896, as that would be the real anniversary of the birth of Christ." The Journal's comment on the participation of the Israelitish people in such an event marks the spirit of the whole thought,—"There is no view of Jesus that a Jew could take that is not flattering to his national pride"; and the relation which his race has to the Christian religion should "make every Jew hold his head a little higher to the end of time." This is like the voice of Nebuchadnezzar saying again in arrogance; "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?"
