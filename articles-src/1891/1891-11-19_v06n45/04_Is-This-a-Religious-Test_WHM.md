ARTICLE VI of the Constitution of the United States declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." A case has just arisen at Washington, which, if carried to the conclusion hinted at in the official report upon the question, would seem to require a definite interpretation of that clause in the Constitution.

The report, as published in the Sun, of the 8th inst., explains the nature of the case, and reads thus:

> Mr. Secretary: The accompanying communication, referred to you by Sixth Auditor Coulter and handed me for my consideration, presents a case where a clerk in his division has become somewhat entangled in the Department regulations and the laws of Moses. Believing that the thousands of clerks employed about him, and the world generally, are headed in the wrong direction in observing a day as Sabbath that they should not, he is moved by "conscientious convictions" and a regard for his "eternal welfare" to appeal to the Auditor for some assistance to enable him to follow conscience, which says he should not work on Saturday, and to abide by the regulations, which say he should. A solution of the question seems so obvious, and rests so wholly in Mr. Austin's hands by his simply resigning, that it must be the Auditor will not permit him to do so. If this be so, I think the Auditor is clearly wrong.
>
> The blue book shows that this clerk has had his "conscientious convictions of duty" outraged for years, by being compelled to work six or seven hours daily for six days of the week, Saturday included, all for $1,600 a year, and but one month annually for vacation. This should continue no longer. It is not only violative of the Constitution of the United States, but of those fundamental principles which underlie our free institutions (vide Amendments to Constitution, Article II., and Mrs. Heman's "Landing of the Pilgrims.") It may occur to the Secretary that it is possible that while this clerk is strong on the fourth commandment he may be weak on the tenth; that, while his conscientious convictions lead him to rebel against working on Saturday, his covetousness incitates him to appropriate the $1,600. This is barely possible, but I do not want to believe it.
>
> Now, I can understand that so good a man as Auditor Coulter should desire to retain a man of so active a conscience in a service where there is supposed to be no little of it. Still, it would not do to make an exception in this case or undertake to revolutionize the service in his division by starting work on Sunday morning and ending on Friday evening. Neither would it do to permit two Sabbath days in every week. While I am satisfied such an arrangement would run counter to no conscientious convictions and would be generally agreeable, it would not be proper in view of the present condition of the Treasury.
>
> In throwing out these few hasty suggestions on this religio-departmental question, I have not considered it as fully as it deserves. I would further suggest, however, that the whole matter be referred back to the Auditor, with direction that he associate with him the Chief of the Warrant Division, and the Director of the Mint, who together shall consider the matter and report. These gentlemen are distinguished for their piety as well as executive ability, and are fully competent to successfully wrestle with any or all the commandments of the Decalogue.

> L. Crounse, Assistant Secretary.

The epithets, dignified, judicial, scarcely seem to apply to this report; neither do the words, considerate, respectful, harmonize any better with the general tone of the document.

The gravity of the question, here so flippantly raised, certainly would have called from one who had any appreciation of its importance, at least, a respectful treatment, even if the thirty years of army and departmental service, and the unvarying record for worth and ability of the gentleman in the case, could not have commanded the kindly consideration of his superior officer. But although these claims be ignored, there is still farther a personal dignity of official position to maintain, and farther yet an individual noblesse oblige which should pertain to every officer of the United States Government in no less degree than to a private gentleman.

Should the suggestion of this report be followed by those to whom it is referred, in their final decision, a religious test will have been established as a qualification for admission to the departmental service, and from the time of the official delivery of such a decision every Israelite, Seventh-day Adventist, or Seventh-day Baptist, would be excluded from serving under the Government. If this conclusion should be reached where is the limit to which the "religious test" in Government affairs may not be applied?
