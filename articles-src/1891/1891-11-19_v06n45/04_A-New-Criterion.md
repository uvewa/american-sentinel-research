## A New Criterion.

THE Synod of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, in Brainerd, has passed a resolution recommending Congress to refuse the grant of $5,000,000 for its aid to the World's Fair at Chicago, until the managers of that enterprise give a pledge that they will not permit the Fair to be opened on Sundays.

This information that the inference of such a pledge is given the money is to be forthcoming whether or no, and the purpose for the pledge to be made is to follow as a condition. Besides the aspect which this assumes, of pretending the strict observancy of the Sabbath, which the Synod expects, it indicates that the clerical minds of the Synod do not recognize any other considerations with regard to that loan than the Sabbatharian question.

But it happens that there are several other important considerations. The chief of them is the fact that Chicago was the only available site for the Fair and the only positive pledge of its representative that it would ask for no aid from Congress established the matter. Whether that pledge can be insisted upon or not may be an open question for Congress. But it might occur to the minds of our friends of the Synod to inquire, if Chicago has no cost. Some remembrance. Every large section and city has its voices the first pledge, what the exact value of the second would be.

Finally, do our friends of the Synod really seem to take the attitude that if people will adopt their views of Sabbath observance they shall have all the money they want from the national Treasury?—*Pittsburgh Dispatch.*
