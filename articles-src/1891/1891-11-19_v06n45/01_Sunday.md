SUNDAY is, and always was, a religious festival. It was originally sacred to the worship of the sun god, and is now very generally regarded as commemorating the resurrection of Christ, and is by many held to be the Sabbath. If it were not regarded as sacred there would be no demand for laws enforcing its observance. It is therefore a matter that the State has no right to regulate. It is the duty of friends of Sunday to recognize this fact. In these days of nominally legalized sacred wisdom by past experience, and endeavor as much as possible to keep in the background the fact that their motive is religious, but they can never get away from the facts. They demand a "civil Sabbath" but why that may mean a religious Sabbath enforced by civil law.

It has only been through the union of the Church and ecclesiastical powers that active religious persecution has ever been possible. Had there been no such unholy alliance, "Fox's Book of Martyrs" could never have been written. It was always the ecclesiastical power which condemned, and the secular which executed the decree. This has been true in other countries and in past ages. It is to be no different in this country and at this time. The American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association, with all their allied societies, conjointly with the Church influence, constitute the ecclesiastical force which, by means of the Law and Order League, joins itself with the secular power to enforce the forgotten religious laws on our statute books, which have survived the Reformation, and are now fermenting in the body politic, and the whole will be permeated with the Satanic leaven.
