# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, November 19, 1891, Vol. 6, No. 45

## CRITICAL NOTE

This issue presents exceptional difficulty for OCR transcription. The text throughout all 8 pages is extremely small and dense, particularly in the multi-column format. Many passages, especially in the lengthy "Judge Hammond and the Seventh-day Adventists" article (pages 1-3), contain text that is at the limits of legibility. The Q&A format of that article, with extensive quotations from Senate hearings and correspondence, makes the reading especially challenging.

**This entire issue should be considered LOW to MEDIUM confidence and requires thorough verification against the original PDF or higher-resolution scans.**

## Article 02: "Judge Hammond and the Seventh-day Adventists" (Pages 1-3)

### GENERAL NOTE
This article is the most challenging in the issue. It contains:
