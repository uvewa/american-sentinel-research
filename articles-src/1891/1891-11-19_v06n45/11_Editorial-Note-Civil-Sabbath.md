THERE is no such thing as a "civil Sabbath," and nobody wants such a thing. A "civil Sabbath" could be nothing else than a weekly holiday, when public business would be suspended and the people be left free to do as they please so long as they are civil, just as they are upon any holiday. But that would be the "continental Sunday" with a vengeance; and that the Sunday-law advocates do not want.
