A PITTSBURG dispatch to the Sun, of this city, concerning the late annual convention of the Pennsylvania Woman's Christian Temperance Union which was held at Bradford, gives the following as from Mrs. W. B. Rhoades, State and County Superintendent of Young Womens' Work:—

> We have given up the idea of ever gaining anything by politics, and are now confining ourselves to individual work. We expect nothing, or very little from legislation. It has been shown that the law cannot make a sober man out of a drunkard, or turn a bad parent into a good one. We must go from house to house to sow the seeds of temperance if we wish to harvest a higher standard of morality, and a better understanding of the duty of a Christian.

This is sound sense. We wish all the women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Unions, both old and young, would learn as much and would practice accordingly. Then they could do some good.
