As pestilence and death cross the world in the darkness, and no man knows from whence they come, so this moral pestilence and spiritual death of religious legislation is making the circuit of the earth, fostered by the spirit of all evil. In confirmation of this, Elder A. J. Read, who is with the missionary schooner *Pilcairn*, writes the following letter from the Friendly Islands, to the *Signs of the Times*, Oakland, California.—

"The natives who inhabit the Tongan or Friendly group are by far the most intelligent and promising race which we have met on any of the South Sea islands.

"We spoke of their thrift and industry as manifested on Vavau and Haabi, which places we had visited at our last writing. The same thing was also noticeable at Tonga-tabu, the principal island and seat of the government.

"The government is well ordered, generally speaking, and is in the hands of the natives, King George Tubou, whose picture graces the postage stamp, being the ruling sovereign. The legislative government is modeled after the English form, having a Parliament composed of a House of Lords and a House of Commons. It is said that when any measure is pending which the king fears is going contrary to his wishes, his old head, gray with ninety-five years of service, appears in the Parliament, and, with a voice which strikes consternation to lords and commons alike, he begins to quote to them passages of Scripture, then tells them what his opinion is in the matter before them, and states that that is what must be done, and this puts an end to all controversy; his wishes are carried out to the letter.

"A fearful religious persecution has been sweeping these fair islands, and one has only to visit the scene and talk with the survivors to know how tragical and cruel the logic of toleration and State religion is when worked out in the hands of simple natives.

"Whatever may have been the aggravating cause, surely no excuse can be offered for the cruel persecutions which King George has allowed to be carried on in his realm. It is said to have started in this way: The Wesleyan body has operated in these islands since the days of heathenism. They had great influence with the natives, the king himself being a strong adherent to the faith, and placing great faith in the missionaries, whose advice was always highly esteemed in all matters, religious or political. One of these ministers, a Mr. Baker, became estranged in some way from the Wesleyan body and his fellow-laborers, and, holding a strong political influence, he accepted a position as premier under the Tongan Government.

"As the differences became greater, the king was persuaded that a continuance of the Wesleyan Church in his islands would mean annexation to the British Government.

"Accordingly, he was persuaded to start a church of his own, which he did, making a few changes in the form of service, and calling it the "Free Church of Tonga," or as it is generally called, the "King's Church."

"The meeting-houses of this new church were built in close proximity to the Wesleyan buildings, and a law passed that the Wesleyans should not hold service during the hours that service was going on in the "King's" or "Free Church." The appointments were then made so as to take up all the established hours of worship in the new church service, and thus compel the Wesleyans to meet whenever the Free Church dismissed, and dismiss whenever the Free Church chose to meet.

"The chiefs were instructed to do all in their power to get the people to join the new church on the ground of loyalty to their king. It is stated by people living in the Friendly or Tongan islands that any chiefs who refused to change were deposed; thus, out of mere policy, many went over, but of course there were some who would not change, because they felt conscientiously bound to the church which brought the gospel to them. These, it is stated, were mustered out in their different villages, and asked whether they would be loyal to their king and join his church; if they assented they were considered changed; if they said they would be loyal to the king, but would not change their connection with the Wesleyans, then "persuasive measures" were used. They were placed under guard, and their houses watched, every movement was hindered, and even life itself was made burdensome by the omnipresence of the king's officials. Of course these officials made free use of any eatables they could find on Wesleyan premises. Pigs, fowls, yams, taro, breadfruit, etc., vanished with astonishing rapidity; their plantations also suffered from these depredations, until the poor Wesleyans were pauperized. Any resistance was severely punished.

"They were prevented from holding services, a law being made that unless there were a certain number of persons present, no religious meetings could be held aside from the established or Free Church.

"As a result of these and other unjust measures, some of the Wesleyans suffered all sorts of indignities; some had their teeth knocked down their throats, others were pricked with bayonets, some were banished to a desolate volcanic island, where they were pretty sure to die of starvation unless the eruptions from the active crater should chance to burst forth in time to prevent starvation, by a more merciful but not less horrible death. A few were killed outright. Redress was impossible, as the courts were all controlled by the kings people, who could manage to evade the statutes.

"The European settlers here are quite indignant, though quite helpless to prevent the persecution.

"Many claim that Mr. Baker, the premier, was responsible for it all, working by intrigue to get revenge on the Wesleyans and make money out of those who were opposed to him. However this may be, Mr. Baker is now deported, and these religious laws are still enacted, religious distinctions are still retained in the statute books and in all the towns, save one, the restrictions on Wesleyan services are still maintained. There are laws governing the use that shall be made of God's Sabbath, and also even controlling the use that shall be made of God's name; thus most sacred things are made matters of human legislation, paving the way for still greater persecutions in this fair kingdom should these laws be retained."
