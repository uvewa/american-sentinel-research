HENRY GEORGE has an ally from an unexpected quarter. The "Church Society for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor" has recently been organized, in this city, and immediately decided by resolution that as "God is the Father of all men and has created the earth for his children," therefore "the land of these United States belongs to all the members of this American Nation, and land monopoly is contrary to the will of God." There seems to be an unnoticed inconsistency between the premise "all men" and the conclusion "American Nation." If the Father of all has created the earth for his children it does not follow that the United States belongs to the American Nation, alone, but each of his children owns a proportionate undivided share, and every individual holds a title-deed to the earth, as tenant in common with all the children of God.

This "Church Society" would do well to review its logic and its law before it brings suit to evict all but "members of this American Nation" from the soil of the United States.
