## Is This a Religious Test?

ARTICLE VI of the Constitution of the United States declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." A case has just arisen at Washington, which, if carried to the conclusion stated in the official report upon the question, would seem to require a definite interpretation of that clause in the report.

The report, as published in the Sun, of the 9th inst., explains the nature of the cases, and reads thus:

Mr. Secretary: I desire to bring the following communication referred to you by Fifth Auditor and to ask a definite answer. The communication states that whereas a clerk in his division has become a Seventh-day Adventist, and declines to work on Saturday, the question arises whether his conduct violates the laws of Moses. Believing that the designation of any day of the week as one of rest by any denomination of Christians, other than Sunday as generally, are booked in the wrong direction in so observing a day on Saturday for their Sabbath, as no test was pointed so behind that they could hold it, as covered by "conscientious conviction" and I asked that put the "general" refusal to come in the Fifth Auditor for some assistance to enable him to follow his conviction; which may be almost about to him and himself, and to abide by the regulations, which say he should. A minister of the question wants an obvious, and none so wisely as Mr. Adams made by his simply resigning, that it must be the Auditor will not permit him to do it. If I think that Mr. Auditor is clearly wrong.

A man has been compelled to resign because his "conscientious convictions of duty" outraged for years, by being compelled to work on or serve daily for the days of the week, Saturday included, all for $1,600 a year, and has too much annually for vacation. This should confirm no longer. It is not only a violation of the Golden Rule of morality, not only a violation of the law of the United States, but of those fundamental principles which underlie free institutions (vide Amendments to Constitution, Article I., Article XIV).

A man who holds to the observance of any day of the week in the Seventh day, in the Fourth commandment, is denied his rights from any case that may come to be hearing in the courts conveyed to him whether he wishes to work or not. Such a man would hold to rebel against what he supposes to be the law of God, either lose his position or the amount due him to appropriate the $1,600. This there is plainly but one word to characterize.

Now, I can understand that as good a man as Mr. Adams, who has no religious convictions, or a conviction in a service where there is opportunity to advance some good cause may deliberately make an exception in this case or undertake to reconcile the man to the situation; but to expect him to work on Monday morning and ending on Friday afternoon; his Sabbath would be as desirable as opportunity to the working of the Sabbath. I observe my Sabbath, and though I am not a Seventh-day Adventist, I rest from my Sabbath day in every week. While I am satisfied that the day of the Son of Man has been changed as other holy days to accommodate the commercial agricultural, it would not be proper in view of the above facts to deny this right to another man.

It is throwing out those few hasty considerations that the question of a "religious test," as above alluded to as fully as it deserves. It is a long subject; but perhaps this is as much as I have room for at the present. Let any one who is interested refer back to the Auditor, with direction that he search his files in the Civil court and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Let the action, and the Doctor of the Mint, who he has his profession his business dealings. Those petitioners are distinguished for their piety as well as observing activity, and after reply in the most satisfactory manner he considered possible.
