The Sunday movement, which for the last few years has been a matter of increasing interest in England and in various places upon the continent, has reached Italy, where it has assumed phases peculiar to the condition of religion in that country. Of widely different character than in other countries, the movement is agitating all classes in Italy, especially the operatives. Not long ago there was a large and orderly meeting in Naples to promote the objects of an association in favor of Sunday reform, and those who attended were principally operatives, one of their number being in the chair. The aim of the movement is to secure another day's relaxation from labor. The curious feature of the movement is that it is urged as a necessity on purely physical grounds; almost nothing is said in favor of securing a day for devotion. The latter view of the question could not have well been taken by the Italians, to whom the churches are always open, and who, as a rule, never neglect to perform certain offices of religion. While living in an atmosphere of devotion, as far as traditional practices are concerned, there is no reason for regarding the Sunday movement as it is looked upon in other countries. At dawn of each day the "Angelus Domini" sounds, calling to prayer. At mid-day, so it is, when most people uncover and repeat a devotion; while every evening the "Ave Maria" is announced by every church bell, and longer prayers are said. The great desire of the association is to obtain another day's exemption from labor. Relaxation is obtained in Italy in many holidays. Every Sunday is a holiday where every one amuses himself as he may think best, but crowds attend mass and the benediction. In view of these facts the ground of the Sunday movement in Italy is considered unsubstantial, and it is felt that if the Italian should put it on any other ground he will have the sympathy of a larger number of supporters. An effort has been made to diminish the number of saints' days in Italy, but without much success. The government has already made the experiment, but the people will have their holiday. If Sunday should be made a day of rest, the problem would be simplified, for saints' days would decrease in number.
