The Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Michigan, publishes the following series of questions, addressed to Rev. W. F. Crafts, and taken from a leaflet which has been largely distributed in Michigan, of late:—

1. Is there not less Sunday work done on a Sunday morning newspaper than on a Monday morning newspaper?

2. Are not the large Saturday editions issued largely for Sunday reading?

3. Will any newspaper hurt anybody on Sunday, who does not read it?

4. Cannot all refuse to read it who choose to do so?

5. Has a minister or any one else a right to take any forceful means to compel those to stop reading newspapers on Sunday, who choose to do so?

6. Is there anything uncivil about reading a newspaper on Sunday? How can it interfere with a "civil Sabbath"?

7. In your "Sabbath for Man" pages 442, 443, you say: "Neither Sunday newspapers, nor Sunday trains, nor any other Sunday business, except trades of vice could live if all Christians withheld their patronage." Are not Christians then responsible for their continued existence? and is not the proper remedy a regeneration of the Church, and not a resorting to the forceful requirements of law?

8. Is not the only way to make this a truly Christian Nation, to make the people Christians?

9. Can men be made Christians by law?

10. Is not the best way for each individual to preserve the Sabbath, for him to keep it?

11. Do those who keep the seventh day keep the fourth commandment of the Decalogue? and if so why do you wage war against them, unless it is that both their keeping of it and the commandment itself condemn your theory and practice in this respect?

12. When did Christ, as carpenter, lay down his saw after six days of toil? Was it every Saturday night or every Friday night? What day did he keep as Sabbath,—Sunday or Saturday?

13. In your "Sabbath for Man," page 258, you say: "It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work." Is not every other man just as free to observe the first day? Cannot every person who desires to keep Sunday, close his shop and refuse to work? Where, then, is the need of Sunday laws? What more can consistently be asked than absolute freedom?

Representatives of the American Sabbath Union and National Reform Association are holding meetings in Michigan, and putting forth earnest efforts for the enforcement of the religious laws of that State. W. F. Crafts is among the number, and copies of these "Questions" have been presented to him on different occasions, but as yet have elicited no reply.
