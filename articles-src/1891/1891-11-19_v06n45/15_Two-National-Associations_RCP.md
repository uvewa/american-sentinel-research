THE reader will remember that last week, in an article under this head, was presented the testimony of history upon the practical application of the principles of two national associations, namely, the National Reform Association, and the National Religious Liberty Association. The purpose of this article is to answer the question, "What does the Bible teach upon the subject of religious legislation?"

Since the Bible is the revelation of the will of God to man, and is the Christian's final appeal in the settlement of every question with which he has to do, we come to it with the full assurance of faith that in it we will find the needed instruction to lead us to correct conclusions on this subject.

Let us first inquire, What is the nature of the work of becoming a Christian, and living the Christian life? Jesus says it is a birth from above, and a life of loving service. John 3:3, margin, 14:16. While John and Paul speak of it as falling in love with Christ, and living in love with him as a man does with his wife. 1 John 4:19. Rom. 7:4. Eph. 5:31, 32.

Then how can the State make men Christians by law? Can the law make a man fall in love with a woman in whom he sees nothing to love and admire? We all agree that it would be absurd to attempt such a thing. Is it any loss absurd to attempt to compel men, by law, to fall in love with Christ, and be born from above, when they see in him nothing that calls out their love and admiration?

The whole plan of the gospel of Christ is opposed to religious legislation. The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the nature of the mission of Christ, says it was to preach "liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." Isa. 61:1. And Christ himself says the plan of saving men is not driving them to be religious by law, but drawing them by love. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." "No man can come unto me except the Father which sent me draw him." "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." "My sheep hear my voice, and they follow me." Christ well knew that when men saw him to be "the chiefest among ten thousand," and the one "altogether lovely," they would so fall in love with him that it would be more than their meat and their drink to do the will of his Father. And if they did not so fall in love with him, all the laws of all the governments on earth could not make a single soul render acceptable service to God. In view of this, Christ plainly declares that the extent of the just claims of civil governments upon citizens are that they render to the State only those things which belong to it, and that they then be free to render to God the service that belongs to him.

"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." While in this passage Christ does plainly say we are under moral obligation to render certain things to Caesar, or the civil government, he expressly states that the things we are to render to God are wholly outside of Caesar's claim; hence Caesar has no right to compel any religious service.

What commission did Christ give to his disciples when he sent them out to carry his gospel to a perishing world? "Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them," etc. But who were they to baptize?—Believers only. "He that belizenth and is baptized, shall be saved."

Was not the Church commissioned to demand that all the "Christian laws, institutions, and usages" be placed upon "an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land," in order to give them power and influence in their work?—No; Christ said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth," and "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." His presence and power was to be to them all needed help. So he told them to tarry at Jerusalem until they were "ondued with power from on high." Thus equipped, without delaying to demand the State to place their "Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis," they were prepared to enter upon their work with the assurance that "My word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." Does not Paul afterward say that he could do everything through the power of the State? Far from it. His words are, "I can do all things through Christ, which strengthened me." And Paul's view was exactly that expressed by Christ in the gospel commission.

There is, then, not only no necessity for religious legislation in the plan of the gospel, but there is no place for it, and it is directly opposed to the gospel. The Saviour wants his disciples to render him willing service. His own words of invitation are, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that beareth say, Come."

Note the contrast between this invitation and that of the National Reformers. They would compel all to come, regardless of their will in the matter. They go just that much farther than Christ authorizes them to go.

But suppose some are not willing to heed the invitation, and come of their own accord, after you have said to them "Come"? Christ says, further, "Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely." He would not force the will, but still entreat. "He that thirsteth let him come." So it is plain that he desired only those for his followers who voluntarily chose to accept his teachings.

The Religious Liberty Association says that this is in every way just and right. But the National Reform Association says that we want to "place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis." That is, we want the State to compel all to accept our views of religion. But would the National Reformers think it was right for the State to compel all to accept the Jewish faith? I think if the State should do such a thing I would hear them crying, "Tyranny! Despotism! The State has no right to legislate in any such way!" And they would be right in this claim. But now what about their demand that all Christian usages, as they view them, should be enforced, by law, upon others. Are they the only ones whom God has intrusted with the right to choose in matters of religion? Or have all the same right of choice in matters of religious belief? And is it the right of each, as far as civil government is concerned, to be religious or not, as they choose, as long as they act civilly? Is that the right of each member of the National Reform Association?—Certainly. Is it my right?—Yes. Then have we a right to deprive others of the free exercise of rights which we claim for ourselves? Let Christ answer: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets."

We can not fulfill the requirements of the gospel without granting to all others the same right of choice to be religious or not, or to choose their religious belief the same as we claim for ourselves. Hence, as I believe, we all agree that no civil government has a right to legislate us individually into, or out of, any religious belief; and acknowledge that, we admit in principle the whole question of the right of civil governments to legislate on religious subjects. So long as we follow the teachings of Christ, and do to others as we would have them do to us, we will all cease to advocate religious legislation.

In the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, he made a golden image and set it up in the plain of Dura, and commanded all the rulers in the kingdom to come and worship it; and he decreed that if any should not worship, according to the edict which he had issued as king in behalf of the State, they should be cast into the fiery furnace. There were three faithful men there who refused to be legislated out of their rights of religious worship. They were speedily cast into the furnace of fire. This was but the next step which must always follow the enactment of religious laws. There must be a penalty, and to make the laws operative the penalty must be enforced. But no sooner had these men reached the flames than four were plainly seen, and the form of the fourth was "like the son of God."

Upon the invitation of the king they came out of the furnace, unharmed and without even the smell of fire upon their garments.

God had stepped in and openly expressed his disapproval, by rebuking those who would compel religious observances. His disapprobation of religious legislation was again manifested when Daniel was cast into the den of lions because he was unwilling to renounce his faith, to be in harmony with the unjust laws of the State which demanded control of his worship.

Stephen, dying a martyr to his principles that every man had a right to teach and worship according to the dictates of his conscience, was greatly encouraged by the Lord's giving him a view of scenes in Heaven. He saw "Jesus standing on the right hand of God." "And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel." Paul was there at the time, and those who stoned Stephen laid their clothes at his feet. He at that time believed in religious legislation, and he afterwards says, "I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee." "And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him."

That he was honest in what he was doing, and thought it was the best way to advance religion, I do not doubt, for he declares, "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day." The trouble with Paul was, that he had been deceived into false ideas of religion, and, through this deception, led to believe it was right to legislate people into being religious, and to persecute those who opposed his faith; but when he became acquainted with Christ, and accepted the Christian religion, we see a radical change in his principles on this subject.

He makes a full and open confession in this respect, and obtained forgiveness. 1 Tim. 1:13. No one ever hears him advocating religious legislation after he became a Christian. Though he himself was whipped, imprisoned, and finally beheaded on account of his faith, he faithfully instructs the brethren, "being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed," we legislate? No, "we entreat." It was an easy thing to persecute Christians in those days, because they were few in number and their influence small. Paul continues, "We are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day." 1 Cor. 5:12, 13. Thus it has ever been, and ever will be, when the truly pious are persecuted for their faith. Even Christ was so regarded; and being falsely accused was arrested, tried, condemned, and executed as a criminal, for daring to teach a religion not recognized by the State. The Saviour here plainly takes his stand on the principles since adopted by the Religious Liberty Association, that every man who acts civilly should be protected by the State in his right to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

When the disciples were about to enter upon their work, they were instructed that, "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you." "Yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God service." When they went out they found it so. Peter and John were commanded not to teach in the name of Jesus; but they calmly said, "We can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard."

Was not God displeased with them for refusing to obey the "powers that be," which "are ordained of God" in this thing?—No. Why? Because when the civil government legislates on religion it has gone beyond its legitimate province, and ceases to meet the purpose of God in ordaining it. So when the apostles were preaching Jesus, in disobedience to the command of the State, God sent an angel with this plain message, "Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." This settles the whole question of religious legislation. If the authority to decide between true and false religions had been committed to the civil government, then the disciples should have submitted to the council, and ceased to preach Jesus. Since the civil government can not legislate on religious questions without acting as judge of what are true and what are false doctrines, and since God here taught the disciples to disregard such decisions rendered by the State, the conclusion is unquestionable that the teaching of the gospel of Christ is against all religious legislation.

In the light of the foregoing facts, the conclusion is:

1. That the application of the principles of the National Reform Association have always resulted in religious intolerance and persecution, and seriously against the prosperity of both the Church and the State.

2. That the application of the principles of the Religious Liberty Association has resulted in the greatest prosperity of both the Church and the State.

3. That the principles of the National Reform Association are in direct conflict with the teaching of the gospel on the subject of religious legislation.

4. That the position taken by the Religious Liberty Association against religious legislation is in harmony with the gospel of Christ.

5. That religious persecution is always the sure result of compelling religious observances, and that all the religious persecutions of the past are chargeable to false views of God and religion, and not to true Christianity. "And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me."

In the present conflict, may both reader and writer be found on the gospel side of this question.
