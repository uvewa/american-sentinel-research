## Two National Associations.

THE reader will remember that last week, in an article under this head, we presented the teachings of the Bible concerning the authority of civil government, as gathered from the pronouncements of two national associations, namely; the National Reform Association and the National Religious Liberty Association. The purpose of this article is to present it further. "What does the Bible teach upon the subject of religious legislation?"

Since the Bible is the revelation of the will of God to man, and the Christian's final appeal in all matters relating to human government, and what to do, we come to it with the full assurance of faith, and the confident expectation of being left without excuse to correct conclusions on this subject.

As to first inquiry, What is the nature of the work of becoming a Christian, and living the Christian life? Jesus set it forth in a brief sentence, and a life of loving service. John 3:16, and 1 John 4:14. What do said Paul speak of in calling upon men in behalf of Christ to come to God? He says a man deals with his wife. 1 Cor. 13. Rom. 7, 4; Eph. 5:25, and the conclusion.

Then how can the State make men Christians by law? Can the law make one fall in love with a person to whom he was nothing to love and act upon? We all agree it would be absurd to attempt such a thing. It may has absurd to attempt to compel men by law, to be faithful to Christ, and to learn from above, when they see nothing but their own lives that are being made and to make that such men with their own free will adhere to.

The whole plan of the gospel of Christ is opposed to religious legislation. The prophet Isaiah, speaking of the nature of the mission of Christ, says it is to preach, "liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." Isa. 61. And Christ himself says the plan of salvation is not driving them to be his chosen people to be willing to believe. "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." "Come unto me." "If any man will come after me." "Come unto me." "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden." "If any man hear my voice, and they that hear, my voice." "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not." "My sheep hear my voice, and they that hear me follow." "All that the Father giveth me." "The children among ten thousand," and "altogether lovely" love and devotion and who. . . .

If they did not so fall in love with him, all of the power on earth could not compel them to make a single and sincere acceptable to God in the service of this, Christ gladly declares his own power of the just claims of civil governments upon the citizens of the land render to the then unto them upon the same principle of responsibility in the relation to God to the civil service his belongs and that—

. . . "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's." While in this passage Christ does not require or indeed imply that the citizen should render all things to Caesar or the civil government, he so emphatically declares the limit of the civil government to the things that, in their nature, are purely civil. We are wholly of Caesar's claim; hence Christ has the right to tell us exactly what they are.

The commandment of Christ gives to his disciples when he sent them out to carry his gospel to a perishing world:—"Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." Matt. 28:19, 20. He sent them to teach—"Deliver my law." He has His statutes to be taught—"Deliverance only." He has His statutes

But the Church Christ commissioned to demand and compel? By no means! The field for the gospel "is planted upon," "an unbelieving earth to grow and mature by the works of his own hands." "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." If they will believe, the promise is theirs; if not, "he that believeth not shall be damned." Christ never gave power and influence in their work:—No, . . . "All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth," and "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." That was enough. If power was to be to them all needed help. He was to be with them always, and they were to be "endued with power from on high." Thus equipped, "Christians' laws limitations, and institutions and sustaining legally, their" duty were the subject matter of—and in all the promises of their being made.

"My word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please." These are the things wherein I sent it." Does not Paul say of this word of God that it is "living and powerful," and "sharper than any two-edged sword?" and that it is the "exceeding great" the power of the State? Far from it. His words are: "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." And Paul's view was exactly the same as Christ's on the subject of civil government and Christianity:—

There is, then, not only no necessity for religious legislation in the plan of the gospel, but there is no call for it, and is directly opposed to the gospel. The Reformers who make its discipline state their own positions in the words of the legislation: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is that which is profitable for everything that beareth my," Come.

Nor is there any justification of the principles of the National Reformers. They would come squarely against the property of both of the Church and of the National Reformers. They go just that much farther than Christ ever. They go just that much farther than Christ
