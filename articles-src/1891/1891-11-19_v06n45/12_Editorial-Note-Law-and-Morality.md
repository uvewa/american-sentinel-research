A SPEAKER at the Ecumenical Conference in Washington said, "The law which authorized Louisiana lotteries made men immoral by law." By parity of reasoning, The law which enforces Sunday observance makes men Christian by law. Are men made either moral or immoral, Christian, or un-christian, by law? The cases are parallel. The absurdity of the one is the absurdity of the other.
