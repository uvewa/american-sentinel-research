## "Remand the Prisoner."

AN almost tingly interest accrues to the positive words of R. M. King, published in the review of the decision in his case rendered by the authority in view of his unexpected death, notice of which has been received at the last moment before going to press.

The five publishers the following in its obituary column:—

R. M. King—The persecuted Seventh-day Adventist whose case attained fame through being arrested and convicted for Sunday labor by the courts of Tennessee, on Tuesday. It is a year and a half since his first case attracted national, if not international notice through the medium of the legal courses ever since, and is now pending for trial in the United States Supreme Court. We shall have more to say of this in due time.

Thereupon the defense was submitted. The defense showed that R. M. King had been employed Rev. E. Dickerson and carried in his behalf. The defense showed that King was a Seventh-day Adventist, that his church was organized, ruled that States had a right to make their own regulations the observance of Sunday, and to enact Sunday laws. Thereupon a new case was thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Tennessee. The final trial of the case we are certain will push the case to a conclusion not heretofore reached in the country.
