The Christian Union, October 31, says: "The experiment of opening the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday has now been tried over four months, and the success has been so great that all opposition has been done away with, and the trustees who at first objected have yielded frankly and fully, deciding to make the Sunday opening a permanent thing if the necessary money can be raised. In the first eighteen Sundays over one hundred thousand people came. Some damage was done, but not much. To the majority of the great crowds who went in it was a new experience, and a few did not know how to behave themselves, or to appreciate the opportunity. But they will learn this, together with much other valuable knowledge, and the public and press will probably never have to regret their efforts to force open those tightly closed doors."
