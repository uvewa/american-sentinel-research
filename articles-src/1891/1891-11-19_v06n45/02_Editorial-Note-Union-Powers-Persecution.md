It has only been through the union of the secular and ecclesiastical powers that active religious persecution has ever been possible. Had there been no such unholy alliance, "Fox's Book of Martyrs" could never have been written. It was always the ecclesiastical power which condemned, and the secular which executed the decree. This has been true in other countries and in past ages. It is to be no different in this country and at this time. The American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association, with all their allied societies, conjointly with the Church influence, constitute the ecclesiastical force which, by means of the Law and Order League, joins itself with the secular power to enforce the forgotten religious laws on our statute books, which have survived the Reformation, and are now fermenting in the body politic, and the whole will be permeated with the Satanic leaven.
