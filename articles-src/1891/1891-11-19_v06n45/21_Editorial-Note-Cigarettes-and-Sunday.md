A SOUTHERN paper gives publicity to a case of indolent conscience, with a very apt critical remark, as follows:—

> Though my sale of cigarettes, I guess, is more than all the other dealers of the city put together, yet I am opposed to the sale, and wish some means could be taken to wipe out the sale completely. They are a curse to the people.—W. H. Silverman, of Atlanta.
>
> Well, why don't you quit the business, Mr. Silverman? Are you a good citizen to carry on "a curse to the people" by selling cigarettes to them?

So also, it may be said to those who want a law to compel themselves to stop "desecrating" the Sunday, and so to save the Nation from this "curse."
