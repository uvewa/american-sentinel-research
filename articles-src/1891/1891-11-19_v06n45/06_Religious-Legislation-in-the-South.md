## Religious Legislation in the South.

AS a professed anti-christ cross the world in the darkness, and no man knows from whence they come, so this most pestiferous and spiritual death of religious legislation is making the circuit of the earth. We are fostered by the spirit of all, in every formation of life, Elder A. J. Read, who is with the missionary adventurers. Plainly this was the following letter from the Friendly Islands, the following from the *Signs of the Times,* of November 5:

The natives who inhabit the Tonga group evidently grow by far the most intelligent and promising race from which we have in all out of the South Sea Islands. A rude epoch of their thrift industry is manifested on several of and Haahi, which, the most settled and visited a not last writing. The same thing was also noticeable at other islands. . . . but principally by the government. . . .

the cruel persecution which King George has allowed to be carried on his realm. It is said to have started in this way: The Wesleyan body has operated in those islands since the days of the missions. They had great influence with the natives; the king himself being a strong adherent to the faith, put into a great faith in the missionaries, whose advice was always highly esteemed in all matters, religious or political. One of those ministers, a Mr. Baker, became estranged in some way from the Wesleyan body and his fellow-brethren, and holding a strong political influence, he accepted a position as premier under the Tongan government.

"As the differences greater, the king was persuaded that a continuance of the Wesleyan Church in his islands would seem most amenable to the British Government.

"Accordingly, he was persuaded to start a church of his own, which he did, making a few changes in the form of the sentiment, though with quite agreeable to the teaching and calling it the 'Free Church of Tonga,' or as it is generally called, the 'King's Church.'

"The *meeting-houses* of the *Free Church* were built in close proximity to the Wesleyan buildings, and a law passed that the Wesleyans should not hold any services during the hours that service was going on in the 'King's' or 'Free Church.'

"The appointments were then made as to take up all the established forms of worship in the new church service, and thus compel the Wesleyans to meet without ever the Free Church dismissed, and at dinner time whenever the Free Church chose to leave the table.

"The chiefs were instructed to do all in their power to get the people to join the new church on the ground of loyalty to their King. It is stated by people living in the Friendly or Tongan islands that any child who refused to change over, were very few, and of those there were many went over, but of course there were some who would not change, because that they felt conscientiously bound to the church which brought the gospel to them. Then, it is stated, were marched out, in their different villages, and asked whether they would be loyal to their king and join his church; if they asserted they were connected with the old church, and that they would be loyal to the king, that it would not matter; they must join the King's Church. All who did not change their connections with the Wesleyan, then "persuasive measures" were used. They were placed under guard, said their houses wrecked, every once more was hindered, and even life itself was but little respected, in the presence of the king's officials, of course those officials made free use of any valuables they could find on Wesleyan property. Pigs, fowls, yams, taro, breadfruit, etc., vanished with astonishing rapidity; their plantations also suffered from these depredations, until the poor Wesleyans were suspended. Any resistance was severely punished.

"They were prevented from holding services, a law being made that unless there was a certain number of persons present, no religious meetings could be held; and this established the Free Church.

"As a result of those and other unjust measures, some of the Wesleyans suffered all sorts of indignities; some had their teeth knocked down their throats, others were pricked with bayonets, some were banished to a desolate volcanic island, where they were pretty sure to die of starvation unless the eruption from the active crater should chance to burst forth in time to provide something harmless, merciful but not less horrible death. A few were killed outright. Reform was impossible, as the courts were all controlled by the king's people, who could manage things as they liked.

"The European settlers here are quite indignant, though quite helpless against the persecution.

"Many claim that Mr. Baker, the premier, was responsible for it all, working by intrigue to get revenge on the Wesleyans and make money out of those who were opposed to him. However this may be, Mr. Baker was removed, but still religious laws are still enacted, religious distinctions are still studied; it the statute looks and in all the old town, restrictions on Wesleyan services are still maintained. There are laws in force regarding the use that shall be made of God's Sabbath, and who shall even contribute the use that shall be made of God's nature; that men sacred things are made matters of human legislation, paving the way for still greater persecution in this fair kingdom should have laws to be made.

As Mr. Herbert Newton says, *thinking* Presbyterians is a heresy in a sense, every thoughtful professing Christian holds the National Reform Association that this action would consider heretical views as regards Church and State, and the interference of either in the affairs of the other. This contention, which is by no means wrong from all denominations, together with those three millions of Baptists, of Seventh-day Baptists, and other witnesses. Adventists, the Jews, ought to constitute a sufficiently respectable minority among religious people to command the attention, and the respectful consideration of the "National Reformers."
