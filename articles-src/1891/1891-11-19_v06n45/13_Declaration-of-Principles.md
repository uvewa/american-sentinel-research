## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We are believed to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government: that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.
