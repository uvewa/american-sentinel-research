The Synod of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, at Scranton, has passed a resolution recommending Congress to refuse the loan of $5,000,000 asked for in aid of the World's Fair at Chicago, until the managers of that enterprise give a pledge that they will not permit the Fair to be opened on Sundays.

This carries the inference that if such a pledge is given the money is to be forthcoming. There would be no inducement for the pledge to be made to Congress unless the loan was to follow as a consideration. Besides the assent which this assumes, of purchasing the strict observance of the Sabbath, which the Synod desires, it indicates that the clerical minds of the Synod do not recognize any other considerations with regard to that loan than the Sabbatarian question.

Now it happens that there are several other important considerations. The chief of them is the fact that Chicago was chosen as the site for the Fair under the positive pledge of its representative that it would ask for no aid from Congress except the appropriation for the Government exhibit. Whether that pledge shall be insisted upon or not may be an open question for Congress. But it might occur to the minds of our friends of the Synod to inquire, if Chicago has so soon violated the first pledge, what the exact value of the second pledge will be.

Finally, do our friends of the Synod really mean to take the attitude that if people will adopt their views of Sabbath observance they shall have all the money they want from the national Treasury?
