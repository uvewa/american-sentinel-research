## Who Preserves the Sundays?

THIS *Christian Advocate*, under the "Critical Situation of the Sabbath," has this to say:—

If the Sabbath is to be preserved from desertion under the authority of the Government, and the whole world is not in its advancement; the *American Sentinel* has given place to a European continental Sunday; more keen interest must be aroused and energy exerted. Local, political, and financial interests are combining, in the force of opening the Fair; and the politicians know that *Christian* influences hide when trouble passes, and claims are sure to do it. Every minister, Protestant and Catholic, and every lover of the Sabbath even from a patriotic point of view, should arouse himself and make the rest in his state. Chicago Christians should be sent. a. Christian exhibition lobby in congress must, longer should address personal letters to legislators.

In a partisan context for civil government services between the American and constitutional Sunday the language of the Christian *Advocate* in this item is apt and concerning as much out of keeping with the thought of the paragraph as it is inconsistent with the word Sunday, with which it is erroneously paired as synonymous.

The Sabbath never has been, is not, and never can be, in a "critical situation." The Sabbath is the memorial of the omnipotent Jehovah, and needs no other preservation.

Let those who think to preserve the Sabbath by the authority of Government remember Uzzah, and let those who would institute by law a "civil Sunday" consider well the stern admonition of Christ to the prophecy of Isaiah, "in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."

THERE is no such thing as a "civil Sabbath," and nobody wants such a thing. A "civil Sabbath" could be nothing else than a weekly holiday; what profane treatment men would be astonished and the people would have the same feelings whether they are civil, just as they are upon any holiday. But that is not what the so called "civil Sabbath" will prove a tremendous trial for Sunday; with a vengeance; and that the Sunday-law advocates do say.

A SPEAKER at the Ecumenical Conference in Washington said, "The law which authorized legislatures legitimate made men immoral by law." By parity of reasoning the law which enforces religious observance makes men Christian by law. Are men made either moral or immoral, Christian, or unchristian, by law? The cases are parallel. The absurdity of the one is the absurdity of the other.
