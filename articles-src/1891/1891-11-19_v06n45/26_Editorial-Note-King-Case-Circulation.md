THIS issue of THE SENTINEL contains very valuable matter and should have an extensive circulation. The Corresponding Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association writes,—"The discussion of the King case is attracting a great deal of attention everywhere, and by circulating this number of THE SENTINEL a great influence will be cast in favor of truth and many hundreds may also be interested who will become subscribers to this journal later on. Reports are coming to us from all parts of the field in regard to the good results from the careful distribution of literature, especially THE AMERICAN SENTINEL; and if this number can be circulated widely, particularly among the professional and business men of cities and large towns, a vast amount of good can be accomplished."

Since the commencement of the articles in review of Judge Hammond's decision in the King case, many subscriptions have been received asking for the full series; this will be furnished to all these, and also to all others who, in sending their subscriptions, call for the full series in reference to this important decision.
