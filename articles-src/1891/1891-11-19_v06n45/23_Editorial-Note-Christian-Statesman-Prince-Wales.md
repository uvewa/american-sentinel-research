THE Christian Statesman catalogues the vices and accompanying scandals attached to the name of the heir apparent to the throne of England, and exclaims with the National Baptist—"And this is not only the heir to the throne, but the future head of the Church of England, who will theoretically have the appointing of the bishops and the control of a great amount of patronage!" The Statesman forgets, for the moment, its theories of Christian nationalism. Baptist principles are sound on these questions, and the Statesman must be a little chary of quoting them unreservedly or its own heresy hunters may find a field for activity still nearer home.
