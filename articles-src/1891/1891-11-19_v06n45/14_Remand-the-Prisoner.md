## "Remand the Prisoner."

R. M. KING BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF
HUMAN COURTS.

AN almost tragic interest accrues to the positive words of R. M. King, published in the review of the decision in his case on another page, in view of his unexpected death, notice of which has been received at the last moment before going to press. The Sun publishes the following in its obituary column.

> R. M. King, the Seventh-day Adventist, who acquired inter-State fame through being arrested for plowing on Sunday, died suddenly near Petersburg, Tennessee, on Tuesday. It is a year and a half since King was arrested and fined for Sunday work. The trivial case has been in the State and Federal courts ever since, and is now pending in the United States Supreme Court. The original sentence was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. Then the defense was undertaken by the National Religious Liberty Association, which employed Don H. Dickinson and carried the case to the United States Circuit Court on a writ of habeas corpus. Judge Hammond, in an elaborate opinion, ruled that States had a right to make Sunday laws, and that the Federal Government had no right to review the State's decisions. The case was thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and it is not unlikely the Adventists will still push the case to a conclusion notwithstanding King's death.
