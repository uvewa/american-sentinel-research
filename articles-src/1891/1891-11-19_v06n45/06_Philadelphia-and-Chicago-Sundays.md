*Puck* has seen "what fools these mortals be" on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and expresses some well defined views in the following trenchant paragraphs:—

> The Chicago World's Fair is likely to be the means of settling, once and for all, what is known as the Sunday Question. We do not in the least mean to say that the settlement of the question rests with the directors or commissioners who are now considering whether they shall or shall not keep the Fair open on Sundays. The ultimate judgment lies with the people, whatever the officials of the Fair may see fit to decide; and it needs only such an occasion as a great and widely attended public exhibition to bring the case before the people, and at the same time to present them with the evidence which they need, to pass judgment upon it.
>
> It is possible—we trust it is not probable—that the managers of the Fair may attempt to close it to the public on Sundays. That wicked and cruel blunder was committed in 1876 at Philadelphia, and there may be among the exhibition officials men as weak and timorous as General Hawley showed himself at that time; as fearful of the clamor of the vindictive, bitter little crowd of professional Sabbatarians, and as willing to wrong the many to avoid incurring the wrath of a few. But we do not believe it. Whatever may be the faults of Chicago, she does not grow that sort of man. Chicago is not likely to take the shrill voice of Hartford, Connecticut, for the rear of the whole world. We shall be much surprised if the men who have the World's Fair in charge will seriously and earnestly undertake to do the bidding of the preposterous fanatics who came from New York with Elliott F. Shepard at their head to demand the enforcement of the Puritan Blue Laws in 1893.
>
> But whether Elliott F. Shepard or a man with brains gets possession of the Fair gates on the Sundays of the Summer of 1893, the question will settle itself in that time, and not by the "say so" of any one man or of any set of men, official or unofficial.
>
> If the Fair is to be closed on Sundays, the blunder of Philadelphia will be repeated on a scale large enough to show its criminal folly. Now, let it be remembered, Philadelphia was, in 1876, an exceptionally quiet provincial city of seven or eight hundred thousand inhabitants. It was a "city of homes," with far less public life than most towns of half its size. Yet, when the hundreds of thousands of people who attended the Centennial Exposition were let loose on Philadelphia for long summer Sundays of aimless, hopeless, helpless idleness, with nothing to see, nothing to do, in the way of rational enjoyment, this quiet "city of homes" developed vice enough for a metropolis. People who can not go to a clean and wholesome place of amusement can always go to the devil, who is more constantly with us than even the poor; and the idle strangers in Philadelphia went promptly to the devil, who was imported from New York, and other places, for their special benefit.
>
> And, be it further remembered, that Chicago is a city not only much larger than Philadelphia was in 1876, but as different in character from that dull old town as Denver, Colorado, is different from Salem, Massachusetts. Every large and active city has its vicious side, and must have, under any municipal system that has yet been devised, while vice exists and the willingness of the vicious to make money in evil ways. Chicago's vicious side is a side of all but unexampled magnitude. We believe that she lays claim to the distinction of ranking New York in this particular—but for the credit of both cities, let us avoid a futile and offensive comparison. It is enough to say that, in her ability to satisfy the appetites of those who seek for dissipation in any and every form, Chicago must be counted among the half-dozen great cities of the world which cherish within their bounds other cities of sin and iniquity, of a population alien to the mass of law-abiding folks; Alsatias of crime and intemperance and vile misuse of life.
>
> There is no Sunday closing for these cities within cities. Their day is night; their hours of hardest work the holiday hours of honest folk. Their iniquitous show is ever open, and it is the business of their lives to drag people into it. There is no admission fee. It costs nothing to go in. But there is an exit fee. It costs something to come out. It is to the mercies of this world of tireless, ingenious persistent ubiquitous dealers in vice that the small but noisy handful of Sabbatarians would deliver the idle crowds which will throng Chicago's many streets two years hence. Young men and girls, inexperienced in the world's ways, eager for enjoyment, for adventure, for new experiences and for a wider knowledge of the world around them—these are the people whom the Sunday closers wish to expose to the manifold temptations of a great city for twenty-four hours of enforced idleness, inevitable dullness, unrelieved weariness and emptiness. And that is all these self-constituted defenders of religion care for Christian people. So long as their fellow-men are denied a rational and wholesome amusement on Sunday, these fellow-men may wreck their lives and smirch their souls whenever poor human nature yields to the temptation to exchange a maddening idleness for the illusive excitements of vice.
>
> We have faith enough in the good faith and intelligence of the World's Fair officials to feel sure that we shall see, every Sunday in the summer of 1893, American crowds enjoying themselves in a healthy American manner, decently, good naturedly and soberly, in the walks and aisles of the great Exposition, and proving their American capacity for behaving themselves like good folk and good citizens, on the first day of the week as well as on the other six.

*Puck* is a very bright boy, but he isn't well up in Revelation. For if he were, he would not say; "The Chicago World's Fair is likely to be the means of settling, once and for all, what is known as the Sunday Question." For so long as the devil lives, and until the poor in spirit are given possession of the mansions prepared for them, this Sunday question will remain unsettled.
