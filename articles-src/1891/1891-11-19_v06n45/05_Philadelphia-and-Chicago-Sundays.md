## Philadelphia and Chicago Sundays.

"WHAT has" what "fools these mortals" be! At the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and exposing some well defined views in the following trenchant paragraphs:

The World's Fair is likely to be the pride of nothing more, for all, what is known as the Sunday Question. We do, we in the least care for the directors or commissioners who are now under so much pressure, for we shall be at the Fair open on Sundays. The ultimate decision will rest upon a higher, whatever the officials of the Fair may say to decide; and it needs only such an occasion as a great and widely attended public exhibition to bring the case before the people and make the issue so present the manifest evidence which they need, to pass judgment upon the question.

It is possible, no true it is not probable—that the managers of the Fair may propose to close it to the public on Sundays. That would and cruel bloom was committed in 1876 at Philadelphia, where the Centennial Exhibition was closed that year, and the result; as soon as General Hawley was more, in the almost universal condemnation of the visitors, little little crowd of people marching in and finding the occasion to many to avoid incurring the wrath of a few. But we do not believe it. Whatever may be the facts that are to be said, we are, every one of us, in the interest of 1891. American exercises enjoying themselves in a healthy American way; decently, good-naturedly, and soberly, in the midst and affairs of Grand Expositions. And proving their inherent capacity for tolerating themselves as good folk and good citizens, on the first day of the week as well as on the other six.

But it is a very bright boy, but his isn't going to church in Brooklyn. For it be seen, in a World Fair in July, to be "the Chicago exhibit of visiting," one for all, what is known as the Sunday Question." For as the sun is the devil's levee, and until the poor in spirit are given possession of the mansion prepared for them, this Sunday closing is well enough on purpose.
