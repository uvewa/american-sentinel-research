The Christian Advocate, under the heading "Critical Situation of the Sabbath" has this to say:

> If the Sabbath is to be preserved from desecration under the authority of the Government, and the whole world is not to be advertised that the American Sunday has given place to a European continental Sunday, much more interest must be aroused and energy exerted. Local, political, and financial interests are combining in favor of opening the Fair, and the politicians know that Christians seldom belt when trodden upon, and sinners are sure to do it. Every minister, Protestant and Catholic, and every lover of the Sabbath even from a patriotic point of view, should arouse himself and all whom he can reach. Chicago Christians should be a unit. Christian exhibitors likely to occupy large space should address personal letters to the members of the Exposition.

In a partisan contest for civil supremacy between the American and continental Sundays the language of the Christian Advocate in this item is apt and congruous, but the word Sabbath, twice used, is as much out of keeping with the thought of the paragraph as it is inconsistent with the word Sunday, with which it is erroneously paired as synonymous.

The Sabbath never has been, is not, and never can be, in a "critical situation." It is under the protection of the omnipotent Jehovah, and needs no other preserving hand.

Let those who would think to preserve the Sabbath by the authority of Government remember Uzzah, and let those who would institute by law a "civil Sunday" consider well the stern reference of Christ to the prophecy of Isaiah, "in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
