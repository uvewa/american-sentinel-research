THE question of Sabbath reform has been agitated so much during past years, that the work of the writer will be largely confined between the two opposing elements of religious liberty, and its direction.

WHEN the American Sabbath Union has been attempting to close barber-shops on Sunday, Mr. Weidman, in Cincinnati, and in Grand Rapids, Mich., have solved the whole problem by deciding that the "emulation of Satan's handiwork by terminating the whiskers is against the law of God," and instructing the revision committee to "report a resolution against shaving."

THE *Christian Advocate*, of thirty, in the issue of the 11th inst., remarks that "defenders of the Sabbath are waking up to the magnificent importance of the work before them. A convention of the representative of different Sabbath of New York will be held by the South National Episcopalian Society, Utica, November, 17, 18, to complete the organization for a statewide action, the future plan of the organization of the reform will, to discuss plan for future work, and to discuss various phases of the Sunday question."

A SOUTHERN paper gives publicity to a case of individual conviction, with a very apt critical remark, as follows:—

Though my style of cigarettes, I guess, in more than seven cases out of ten, if not ninety-nine per cent., a special treatment by a course of time could be taken to wipe out the aste completely. Well, even if they did lose the taste, what of it?

Well, why don't you quit the business, Mr. Mi Vernon? Are you a good citizen to carry on; "a curse to the people" by getting more addicted to his taste? So, I may be said to those who want it to be so even if compel themselves to stop "desecrating" the Sunday, and so to serve the Nation from this "curse."

HENRY GEORGE has an ally from an unexpected quarter. The "Church Society for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor" has recently been organized, in this city, and immediately decided by resolution that as "God is the Father of all men and has created the earth for his children," therefore "the land of these United States belongs to all the members of this American Nation, and land monopoly is contrary to the will of God." There seems to be an unnoticed inconsistency between the premises "all men" and the conclusion "American Nation." If the Father of all has created the earth for his children, it does not follow that the United States belongs to the American Nation, alone, but each of his children own a proportionate undivided share, and every individual holds a title, secured to the earth, as tenant in common with all of its inhabitants.

This "Church Society" would do well to review its logic and its law before it brings suit to eject all its "members of this American Nation" from the soil of the United States.

THE *Christian Statesman* catalogues the views and accompanying standing attached to the names of the best arguments to the throne of England, and acclaims with the National *Republic*—"And this is but only the best to the home than the future head of the Church of England, who will theoretically have the appointing of the bishops and the control of a great amount of patronage?" The *Statesman* was forgotten, for the moment, its success of the Christian nationalism. Baptist principles are as wont of some Christian persuasion concerning the Statesmen, and the Statesmen must be a little chary of quoting them unnecessarily or the own historians may truly find a field of activity still nearer home.

A PITTSBURG dispatch to the *Sun*, of this city, concerning the late annual convention of the Pennsylvania Woman's Christian Temperance Union which met at Bradford, gives the following as from Mrs. W. B. Rhoads, State and County's Superintendent of "Young Women's Work:"—

We have the idea of our young sisters getting into thing by politics, and are now confiding ourselves of the thing. We believe in total separation of our class from legislation. It has been shown that if the last century to make a man sober by law. We women who are interested in the working there, and from house to house to now the need of temperance work. Our obligation and duty is to be a Christian first before assuming the role of political partisan.

This is around scene. We are all the women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, both old and young, would learn as much and would practice accordingly. Then they could do some good.

THE number of centennials, expositions, and commemorative exhibitions of one kind and another, in these days, is suggestive of a desire to wind up the world's affairs in a display of human pyrotechnics. The last proposition of this kind come from the Chicago *Evening Journal* and recommends "the celebration of the nineteenth century of Christianity in 1900, as that would be the real anniversary of the birth of Christ." The *Journal's* comment on the participation of the irresistible people in such an event marks the spirit of the whole thought,—"There is no view of Jesus that a *Jew* could take so far as fostering 'to his national pride,' and the relation which his race bears to the Christian religion would 'make every *Jew* hold his head a little higher to the end of time.' This is like the voice of *Nebuchadnezzar* saying again in arrogance, 'Is not this great Babylon, that I have built by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?'"

THIS issue of THE SENTINEL contains very valuable matter and should have an extensive circulation. The Corresponding Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association writes:— "The discussion of the King case is attracting a great deal of attention everywhere, and by circulating this number of THE SENTINEL the needed influence will be set in favor of truth and many hundreds may also be interested and will become subscribers to this journal later on. Reports are coming in from all parts of the field of the good results to the good results from the careful distribution of literature, especially THE AMERICAN SENTINEL; and of this number it can be circulated widely, particularly among the professional men, the citizens of cities and large towns, a vast amount of good can be accomplished."

Since the commencement of the articles in review of Judge Hammond's decision in the King case, many communications have been received asking for the trial series, which will be furnished to all in the series, and also to all others in all, both in their state, and above to all others in, with all, and we have to others all, and in reference to this important case.

Representatives of the American Sabbath Union and National Reform Association are holding meetings in Michigan, and putting forth certain, the credit of the same that we shall all, every one of us, be in the interest of 1891. American exercises enjoying themselves in a healthy American way; decently, good-naturedly and soberly, in the midst and affairs of Grand Expositions, and proving their inherent capacity for tolerating themselves as good folk and good citizens, on the first day of the week as well as on the other six.

**WHAT** this world wants is not so much an increase of gospel, preaching or so-called gospel practice.—*Theodore L. Cuyler.*
