## A Responsible Minority.

THE *Duluth Herald* published a letter from O. H. McMillan, in which some principled articles are plainly so clearly that he who runs may read. Speaking of the action of the Baptist Governors at St. Cloud, Minnesota, he says:—

They not only protested against one of these resolutions for the advancement of Roman Catholic principles in the State of Minnesota, for the interests of "any denomination whatever."

Now, of course, this a kind expression, for the Church to distinctly a Baptist principle; and therefore, if more is felt; or with what it was in a line of feeling; to show that they have ever received a cent from the State for their church, though the Church has paid an instance it has been offered. We are opposed to any alliance whatever between the Church and State. We believe in taxation of church property by the State. This First the Church of Toronto has but recently appeared from their resolution to take their property off the exemption list. Again, the Baptist member in a demand for Bible reading and prayer in the schools. The abandoning of a hope that it is not a charge. Anything you do or Mr. Editor, to bring out these matters and truths will be appreciated by your "interested friends" to the number of 5,000,000, in the United States.

As Mr. Herbert Newton says, *thinking* Presbyterians is a heresy in a sense, every thoughtful professing Christian holds the National Reform Association that this action would consider heretical views as regards Church and State, and the interference of either in the affairs of the other. This contention, which is by no means wrong from all denominations, together with those three millions of Baptists, of Seventh-day Baptists, and other witnesses. Adventists, the Jews, ought to constitute a sufficiently respectable minority among religious people to command the attention, and the respectful consideration of the "National Reformers."
