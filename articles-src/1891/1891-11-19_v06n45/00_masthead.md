THE AMERICAN SENTINEL maintains the inalienable right of every man to profess any religion or none just as he chooses; and it denies the right of any association of religious people—civil-law-made or who are not religious to act as though they were religious, to say or recognize anything religious, or to recognize any religious institution. It likewise denies the right of the State to pronounce any religious or ecclesiastical institution a civil thing and to command its observance.
