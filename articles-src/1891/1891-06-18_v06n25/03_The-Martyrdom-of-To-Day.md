## The Martyrdom of To-Day.

THE *Sun* of June 2, contains the following under the heading given above:—

Some Russian immigrants who landed at Barge Office yesterday from the steamship *Scandia*, told a startling story of persecution for religious and civil civilization of the town of Kavrass, in the province of Kishinev. Three of the Russians at the Barge Office are Ivan Jakubchinsky, Staphni Friedensfeld, and Parleit Dunkelbreit. Their sect is called *Adventists* amongst them. The older man is Alexei Vorobyeenke. He is unmarried, and came here as a railroad at Kavrass. All are free-entry immigrants of the Greek Church, of which the Czar is the head.

A protestant missionary who visited the town of Kavrass converted Jakubchinsky, who persuaded the others to renounce the faith of their fathers and to observe Saturday instead of Sunday as their Sabbath. When they did they began to make trouble for themselves. Jakubchinsky was discharged by his employers. Clubovsky, the head of the police, went to Jakubchinsky's house at midnight and tried to make him recant. But he stood to his new faith like a Bismarck meets authority. Finding that it was useless to argue with the opposition, the priest—Dubravsky Sakharov, had him and his six thrown into jail. Then the police of the town, under orders from the ecclesiastical authorities, had his house and household furniture seized. His wife received 100 lashes. After he was imprisoned she appealed to him by letter and by proxy by letter. He resented it, moreover, and the authorities at Kishinev and St. Petersburg, but his second appeal was also without result. The other members of the sect were also persecuted. Some were demolished and their children were taken from them. The neighboring planters were urged not to buy the products of this opposition, and when they planted their grain, their neighbors would dig up what they were raising. This treatment provoked, is, gave graber wearing on their nerves. The first step they took was they were not intended for a serve, and sold their farms or land to harvest for a serve, and had no further use or religio or all, and where margin have on others to provide. They sold their farms for a source of a quarter of their own; the neighbors knew not that they had to sell in order to emigrate.

This is not persecution of Jews or of Anarchists, but of Christians by others calling themselves Christians. And it would be noticed, it would not, but of Christians by others calling themselves Christians. Not by Christians of any character; but those who are doing the persecuting think that they do God service, for in the words of many of the promoters of the Constitution of the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, in making the Christian subject to its mandate existing Christian features in the Roman Government, in its position the institutions of the family, the religious element is determined, and a public morality, and so to secure community with a general recognition of its allegiance to Jesus Christ and the acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion," as taught by the Greek Church in Russia, and as taught by the Christian nation, and "place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages" right in the understanding and practical basis.

I submit that so long as there is a possibility of the measure of so-called National Reform in this country, so long it is not certain that they may not prevail here. The principle is the same everywhere. The only difference in the nature is essentially different in the two country than what was done to us to-day.
