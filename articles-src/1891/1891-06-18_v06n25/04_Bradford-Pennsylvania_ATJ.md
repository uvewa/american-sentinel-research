Pennsylvania has a Sunday law, as our readers know, enacted in the year 1794—a relic of the days in that commonwealth when a person had to "possess faith in Jesus Christ" in order to be assured of protection in his religious rights. Bradford in that State is a city of about ten thousand inhabitants. The State law is of no more force in Bradford than in most other places throughout the State; as the people pay little or no attention to it, just as they ought.

By some means not clearly defined a movement was begun in that city to secure an enactment of a city ordinance embodying the material part of the State law. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union took the lead in circulating a petition asking the City Council to pass an ordinance, reading in the very words of the State law so far as it could be made applicable in the city. The petition was signed by five hundred and seventy-four voters, and the preachers presented it to the Council. Accordingly the Council framed the desired ordinance which was referred to the joint ordinance committee.

All this time there was considerable discussion among the people and not a little opposition. The committee to whom the ordinance was referred, therefore, decided to have a public hearing of the question. The hearing was appointed for Thursday night, June 4. The editor of THE SENTINEL was invited to be present and speak for the opposition, which invitation, of course, he willingly accepted, glad to speak in so good a cause. The Council obtained one of the largest halls in the city, and the meeting was held according to appointment, Thursday night. Two ministers, a Methodist and a Presbyterian, spoke for the proposed ordinance; the editor of THE SENTINEL and Mr. J. M. McClure, a leading lawyer of the place, spoke against it.

The discussion was opened by the Presbyterian minister, Mr. Eckles, who explained the original, the petition, stating that a good bill had been made of the movement than was either designed or necessary, and protested against the right of the editor of THE SENTINEL to be heard, as he was not a citizen of Bradford nor an inhabitant of Pennsylvania. He then explained that the City Council, before whom he was speaking, was not an ecclesiastical court, that it was not a court before which ecclesiastical or religious questions should be tried. He next explained that in the question under consideration religion was in no way involved, that it was a "civil Sabbath" entirely, and designed only to secure to the people rest. He referred to the law of the State as being of force, and said that if they had chosen to do what they could in prosecution and persecution, they could have enforced that law without resorting to this measure to secure a city ordinance; but they had deemed it best to do this rather than the other. He presented an exemption clause which they had framed, and which they proposed to have added to the ordinance, exempting those who "religiously" observed another day than Sunday "as a day of worship." He said that there were those in Bradford, business men, who feared God and would like to attend church and spend the Sabbath as it ought to be observed, but that they would thus lose the patronage that would otherwise fall to them if their business houses were allowed to be kept open on Sunday; and therefore these would like to have a law that would close all the places of business on Sunday. He then read a passage from Mr. Crafts, the same old one in which that Sunday-law worthy magnifies the oppression of the workingman, wherein he does seven days' work for six days' pay. He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in which the constitutionality of the Sunday law had been maintained, and in which it was declared that the law had no reference to religion, and did not enforce any religious observance, nor place any restrictions upon the freedom of conscience. He argued that men were better for being able to stop work Saturday night and rest Sunday, and closed with a renewal of his protest against the editor of THE SENTINEL'S right to speak, and declared that he ought not to be heard.

As soon as he had taken his seat, the chairman, Mr. Zane, who is also a member of the committee to whom the ordinance was referred, explained that if any one was to blame for the extent of the public notice that had been taken of the movement, it was he, as he was the one who had secured the hall, announced the hearing, and had given such public notice of it as possible; and further, if any one was to blame for Mr. Jones's being there, he was responsible for that too, as he had invited him. (Applause.)

The editor of THE SENTINEL was the second speaker, and argued as follows:—

Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the Council, and citizens of Bradford: I am here, as you perceive, and as you have been twice informed by the speaker who opened the discussion. I have no apology to make for my being here. It is true that I am not a citizen of Bradford nor an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, but I was invited by those who are both citizens of Bradford and inhabitants of Pennsylvania, to come and speak for them upon this question; and I offer it as my opinion that the citizens of Bradford have the right to invite whomsoever they please, from whatever place, to speak for them upon any subject upon which they want to be heard. (Applause.)

You have been informed that this is not an ecclesiastical court, that it is not a court before which ecclesiastical or religious questions are to be tried, that it is a civil Sabbath only, which is contemplated in this movement and in the ordinance proposed. Please bear that in mind while I read the ordinance proposed. It is as follows:—

AN ORDINANCE

Prohibiting all persons in the city of Bradford from desecrating the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, and providing a penalty for the violation of the same.

Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, and ordained, by the Select and Common Councils of the city of Bradford, Pennsylvania:

SECTION 1. By authority of and in conformity with Section 1, Act of April 22d, 1794, all persons are hereby forbidden to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever, within the city of Bradford, on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, or to pursue any game, hunting, shooting, sport or diversion whatever. Provided, however, that work of necessity and charity shall not be construed to be violations of this ordinance.

SEC. 2. Any person convicted of the violation of this ordinance, before the Mayor or any Alderman of the city of Bradford, shall, at the discretion of said magistrate, be fined a sum not exceeding four dollars ($4.00), and in default of payment of said fine and costs of prosecution, may be imprisoned in the city lockup or county jail not more than six days.

Now please bear in mind that this has been declared by the first speaker not an ecclesiastical court, and not a court before which religious questions are to be tried, and let us compare with this statement some of the terms, in fact the material terms, of the proposed ordinance. It is entitled, you see, "An ordinance prohibiting all persons in the city of Bradford from desecrating the Sabbath day." Civil things cannot be desecrated. A thing must be consecrated before it can be desecrated. Let us read, therefore, the definition of this word "desecrate." It is, "To divert from a sacred purpose." And yet we are to suppose there is "nothing religious" about that—sacred things are all "civil." The truth is, as you see, that the ordinance is religious, that by the very first material word in it it is committed to the guardianship of sacred things; so that at the very first step it enters the realm of religion, and they cannot escape it. (Applause.)

Let us read further in this definition, "Desecrate" is to divert from a purpose to which a thing is consecrated. Therefore you see that by the language itself in which we speak, civil things cannot be desecrated; that a thing must be consecrated before it is possible to desecrate it. But let us find what "consecrate" means. The definition of this word is, "To set apart to the service and worship of God." Yet, friends, don't forget that you have been informed that this ordinance is to have "nothing to do with religion"—the first speaker said so; but although the previous speaker told you this, yet the ordinance which is framed in the very words for which they asked, and which they accept as entirely satisfactory, as far declares its object to be to prohibit all persons in the city of Bradford from diverting the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, from the worship of God. The ordinance prohibits "any diversion whatsoever." That covers all manner of diversions. Now, what does "diversion" mean? This word is defined as "that which turns off from any course, direction, or intended application." What then is the intended application of the day?—The worship of God. Therefore the proposed ordinance distinctly declares that no person in the city of Bradford shall turn off Sunday in any way whatsoever from the service and worship of God. But don't forget "there is nothing religious" about that, oh no, that is all civil—a "civil Sabbath."

Another thing, friends. Don't forget that you have been informed that this is not an ecclesiastical court; distinctly bear in mind that this is not a court before which religious questions are to be tried. Yes, I hope you will; for if you do, you will know easily enough what to do with this ordinance which is wholly religious.

Again: the proposed ordinance says that all persons are hereby forbidden "to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever within the city of Bradford upon the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." What is worldly employment, business, etc.? "Worldly" is defined as "secular, temporal, pertaining to this world or life in contradistinction to the life to come." Therefore this ordinance if adopted will forbid any citizen of Bradford from doing anything whatsoever on Sunday that pertains to this world or to this life. All that you can do must pertain to the next world and the life to come.

But let us read further. Worldly things are said to be "secular." What does "secular" mean? It means "pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy, relating to things not immediately or primarily respecting the soul, but the body; worldly." By these definitions from beginning to end, which are but the definitions of the material words of this proposed ordinance, you see as plainly as any one ever need to see anything, that the object of it is religious and nothing else; that its purpose is to guard that which is consecrated, that which is set apart, to the worship of God; that it proposes to prohibit the citizens of this place from having anything whatsoever to do with any thing that pertains to this world or to this life, or the body, or anything not spiritual or holy. And yet you must not forget that you have been informed that there is "nothing religious" about it, that it is a "civil Sabbath" only, and that this is not an ecclesiastical court, not a court before which religious questions can properly be brought. It may not be out of place again to remark that if you but bear in mind that that is the character of this court, you will have not the slightest difficulty in readily deciding what to do with this proposed ordinance.

Further it is a principle recognized by all classes who believe in religion, from Blackstone all the way up, that no statute can of right enforce anything that is contrary to the word of God, and if any such statute is enacted, every one has a right to disobey it and follow the word. Now let us read another passage from the proposed ordinance, and compare it with some statements which I have from respectable authorities on the Sunday law question. The ordinance, you perceive, prohibits any person from pursuing "any game, hunting, shooting, sport, or diversion whatsoever, on the first day, commonly called Sunday." Fishing is put under the head of "sport" in law and in practice. Now the American Sabbath Union in Document No. 9 says that, "All the appearances of Jesus to his disciples after his resurrection, so far as we know, were on the first day of the week;" and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, by Mrs. Bateham, in Leaflet No. 31, says, "With His death the Jewish dispensation passed away, and henceforward we find him invariably meeting with his disciples on the first day of the week." Now admitting that that is so, let us read a passage of Scripture directly upon this point. I turn to John 21:1-6, and read as follows:—

After these things Jesus showed himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself. There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

There is an appearance of Jesus clearly recorded which these two chief Sunday-law organizations positively declare was on Sunday, the first day of the week; and at that appearance of the Saviour, his disciples were not only fishing and had fished without success up to this point, but the Saviour told them where to cast the net so that they could catch fish. They did so, and caught a multitude. Now upon the authority of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the American Sabbath Union, that was on the first day of the week; and according to the word, Jesus distinctly assisted his disciples in catching a "multitude of fishes." Then I want to know by what right they propose to have the city of Bradford prohibit the citizens of this place from catching fish on Sunday.* (Applause.)

The former speaker said that the object of the ordinance was to secure to the people rest. Is it so, then, that the people of Bradford do not know when they ought to rest? Do they not know when they are tired enough, and need rest? Further than this, who is to enforce this if it should be adopted? The citizens themselves, of course. Well then, if they now will not rest, will they then compel themselves to rest? In other words, will you, or the business men of this place, compel yourselves by law to do what now you want to do and will not do? Of course you will not, for everybody knows that when a person wants to do a thing, he can do it without a law to compel him to do it.

Yet more than this, you have a law already. The law of the State is of force in Bradford as well as anywhere else. The law of the State is of force everywhere within the bounds of the State. But that law is not obeyed, and this petition simply asks that that law, word for word so far as applicable, shall be re-enacted into an ordinance for this city. Now as the State law is neither respected nor enforced, how then do you propose to have the same thing enforced by making it a city ordinance?

Here is a practical and familiar illustration. I notice in your daily papers here advertisements of excursions from this city up to Buffalo and Niagara Falls next Sunday and the succeeding Sundays through the summer. Suppose this ordinance were adopted. Will you then draw out your police force and stop all your neighbors of this city from going on that excursion up to Niagara? You know well enough that you will not; and if you do not enforce it upon them, will you enforce it upon your other neighbors who stay at home? If upon some, you will have to upon all. But you know well enough that you will not enforce it upon the first class, and I know well enough that it will not be enforced upon any class except some who observe the seventh day, or upon some one against whom some other one has a grudge. Then the law will be made simply the channel through which certain ones can vent their grudge or spite. You know that the previous speaker said that if they should choose to do what they could in prosecution and persecution, they could have enforced the law of the State, but they didn't choose to do that, and therefore petitioned the council to pass this ordinance: thus simply saying that the enforcement of the law of the State would be but prosecution and persecution, and as they did not want to engage in this themselves, they kindly ask the City Council to do it for them.

It was announced, however, that they propose an exemption, for observers of the seventh day. Yes, that is so; and it proposes to exempt from the requirements of this ordinance those who religiously observe another day, and who, when they shall be arrested and brought before the Mayor or any alderman, shall be able to prove by proper and satisfactory evidence that they "regularly" observe that day, and that they "have observed the day as a day of worship." Precisely. They distinctly propose, therefore, that this ordinance shall require that those who do not observe Sunday shall religiously observe another day as a day of worship.

This does therefore propose positively to enforce a religious observance. And when the requirement is that those who do not observe Sunday shall religiously observe another day, then it is plainly argued that those who do not religiously observe another day shall religiously observe Sunday. That is in the thing itself. It is religious from beginning to end. It is religious in every intent and purpose of its promoters, and although you have been informed that the City Council is not an ecclesiastical court, yet this exemption declares that those who observe another day than Sunday, when arrested and brought before the Mayor and alderman of this city, shall prove by proper evidence that they have religiously observed that day as a day of worship, and that it is a regular thing with them to do so. This does distinctly and positively make the Mayor and aldermen of this city the judges of religious observances. It does make them a court before which religious questions shall be brought and by which religious questions shall be decided. But any person in Bradford or anywhere else has an inalienable right to observe any other day than Sunday without having such observance passed upon by any body as to whether it is religious or not. No man nor set of men in Bradford or anywhere else, has any right to require, or enter into any question or inquisition upon, the religious observance of any day or anything else, by any body. (Applause.)

The gentleman informed us that there are in the city those who fear God and desire to attend church and observe Sunday in a religious way, but in so doing they are compelled to lose the patronage that might otherwise fall to them if they were to keep their place of business open. That is to say, they fear God provided they can be assured that they lose nothing by it. And they want to turn the City Council into an insurance company to insure them against any possible loss by fearing God.

Once more: the ordinance declares that all persons are hereby forbidden to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever within the city of Bradford "on the Lord's day." What can the City Council have to do with that which belongs to the Lord? The Saviour was once asked a question bearing directly upon this point. They said unto him, "Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?" He replied, "Show me the tribute money." And they gave him a piece of Roman money. He inquired, "Whose is this image and superscription?" They said unto him, "Caesar's." Then answered Jesus unto them, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's."

Now, this proposed ordinance says plainly that this is the Lord's day. By their own confession then it belongs to the Lord. And by the word of Christ it is to be rendered to the Lord. Neither the City Council nor any other human authority can have anything at all to do with it. It rests entirely between man and God. As it is the Lord's it is to be rendered only to the Lord according to the word of Christ, and if any man sees fit not to render it to God, he is responsible only to God for such action. (Applause.) Under the word of Christ the City Council has no right to do what they are requested to do, and these petitioners and ministers who argue in behalf of this ordinance have gone directly against the word of Jesus Christ in asking the City Council of Bradford to enact the ordinance which is here proposed. As they profess to be Christians, let them show respect to the Author of Christianity and let this thing alone, and leave men who are perfectly willing to render to Caesar that which is Caesar's, free to render to God the things that are God's. (Applause.) Time expired.

Mr. McClure then spoke. It was impossible to obtain a report of his speech, for which we are sorry, as it was a fine thing. He attacked the original law of 1794, and showed the nature of the law by stating the fact that till within three years before that, there was a law of Pennsylvania punishing witches with death, which showed it to be but a part of the original colonial and Puritanical legislation. He referred to the statement of the first speaker, that if they had chosen to do what they could in prosecution and persecution they could have enforced the law of the State, and with a sarcasm that was scorching, charitably granted that they wished to "abstain from all appearance of evil" in the matter, but were willing to have the same thing carried into effect in fact by kindly passing it over to the City Council, and the Mayor and aldermen of the city of Bradford. He dwelt strongly upon the fact that the proposed ordinance with its exemption-appendix did distinctly commit the Mayor and aldermen of the city of Bradford to the judgeship of religious observances, and to the authoritative decision of religious questions. And further, a most excellent point was made by him to the effect that as the State law not only has no exemption in it, but the Supreme Court has held that the observers of the seventh day could not be exempted under that law, therefore this proposed exemption was utterly worthless and void; and further, that the proposed ordinance as it stood was just what the petitioners had asked for, while this proposed exemption was brought in afterward by the ministers; that none of the petitioners had asked for it; it was without the consent or knowledge of the petitioners, and was thus proposed to be foisted upon the ordinance as a tail-piece, beyond the purpose, intent or knowledge of the petitioners, and utterly without any authority in law.

So much of Mr. McClure's speech we are able to reproduce in substance, but nothing short of a verbatim report could possibly do it justice, and even that would come far short because of its inability to reproduce the tone and the manner which were not the least powerful part of the splendid speech.

The Methodist minister, Dr. Huntington thrashed over again the well-beaten Sunday-law arguments, with which our readers are so well acquainted, such as that the States have Sunday laws, that they have been declared constitutional; that the United States Constitution mentions Sunday; pity for the poor enslaved workingman, etc., etc., and objected to the definitions which had been given of the material words of the proposed ordinance, saying that the dictionary was not the place to go for definitions in such cases, but the law books in the decisions of courts. Mr. McClure suggested to him that the courts had to go to the dictionary for their definitions; but the speaker seemingly did not hear it. With the close of Mr. Huntington's speech the hearing and the discussion ended. All passed off pleasantly, and the audience was well pleased. The whole question was well set before the people of Bradford, and final action will probably be taken by the Council at its next regular meeting, Monday night, June 15. What that action shall prove to be we shall inform the readers of THE SENTINEL.

---

* I was informed after the hearing was over, that when I read the statements of the American Sabbath Union and Woman's Christian Temperance Union that Christ invariably met with his disciples on the first day of the week, after his resurrection, and then read the Scripture about the fishing, some of the women whispered to one another that that was not the first day of the week. It may be that it was not. I do not say that it was. But they say that it was. And if these organizations be mistaken in such an important statement as that, then is there not a possibility that the same organizations may also be mistaken as to Sunday's being the Lord's day? And in enforcing the observance of that day as the Lord's day, is there not danger of compelling men to act directly contrary to the Scriptures, and the commandment of God?
