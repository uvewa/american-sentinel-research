NOTE.—*Any one receiving* THE AMERICAN SENTINEL *without having ordered it may know that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the* SENTINEL *need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. But when you do read it do not throw it away. Please hand it to your friends to read.*

WE do not approve of Salvation Army methods, but the Army should be allowed to have its preaching offered to other people holding public meetings, either religious or otherwise. This is supposed to be a free country, and the law should know no difference between the organs of the Methodist or Presbyterian and the bass drum of the Salvation Army corps.

THE *Los Angeles Herald* thinks that too great a tendency has sprung up of late years to meddle with the rights of the individual.

---

It is said that one of the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art who opposed Sunday opening, would, if he had the power, close even Central Park on Sunday.

---

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has decided that the law does not require the keeper to induce a saloon keeper to give them liquor on Sunday, in order that they may get the penalty allowed by informers, not guilty of conspiracy.

---

We learn from the *China Mail* that a full, entitled "An ordinance to restrict the loading and unloading of cargo on Sunday in certain waters of the Colony," has been read the first time in the Legislative Council of Hong-Kong.

With the celebration of Sunday regulations in the capital city of the Nation is that which drivers of hacks and carriages made for public fare are not allowed to let their flag signal upon their stand or an entrance Saturday when not occupied, and if a vehicle becomes merely a fixed duty of three dollars is imposed for washing it off, and workmen are permitted to go out and clean it any day of work they see fit, at least, so says the *Washington Post.*

SOME two weeks ago we copied from the *Christian Advocate* an item stating that the Grand Jury of Mercer County, New Jersey, had indicted the members of the Salvation Army for making loud noises on drums and tambourines. This *Advocate* says there were a misdemeanor. There was no indictment, but only a presentment of certain facts to the Court by the Grand Jury. "The main cause of complaint," says the *Advocate*, "was the congregating of disorderly persons on the sidewalks in front of the headquarters, which are in the center of the city, attracted there by the public show given by the members of the Army." We would suggest to officers of the town where this annoyance exists that it would be highly proper to arrest the "disorderly persons"

and thus remove all cause of complaint. We do not approve of Salvation Army methods, but the Army should be allowed to have its preaching offered to other people holding public meetings, either religious or otherwise. This is supposed to be a free country, and the law should know no difference between the organs of the Methodist or Presbyterian and the bass drum of the Salvation Army corps.

REV. J. M. CARPENTER, one of the secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, reports, through the *Christian Statesman*, a Sunday exception from Winesburg to Publishing, points out up by one of the claimants of the former for its day of worship:—

"It is one of the most flagrant violations of the Sabbath by a church that I have ever known, that I know of."

---

THE *Globe*, of Erie, Pennsylvania, comments thus upon the work in the interests of Sunday law of Rev. J. L. McIlvaine, Baptist superintendent of the states of Pennsylvania and the two Virginias, for the Rep. organization, superintendent of over work, Pennsylvania—

"Is comprehensible? not what it is not stated, but personality of the personal theory of the people, are making a visit to this vicinity, and stopped over night at Cambridge. They have an acknowledged of no residences, which was adopted religiously wherever proceeded, but at Cambridge, which is especially wicked, they worshipped in the mercy of the assembly."

The trials of the six young ministers of the Reformed Presbyterian Church ended at Pittsburg on the afternoon of June 4th, by a vote of ninety-five to thirty-seven, expelled five of them from the church. The charges against them were unbelief, that, and following division comes in declaring in favor of the right of franchise. Their names are E. M. Milligan, R. J. Milligan, W. H. Reat, W. C. Sauoner, and O. R. Milligan. The Rev. J. W. McFarlin was acquitted, and E. B. Harriett, a student, also charged with heresy, has not yet been tried.

The thirty-seven members of the Synod who voted against the suspension of the young men presented a paper of dissent from the action of the Synod, and asked that it be spread upon the minutes. The scene during the voting was exciting. When the Rev. J. P. Carson's name was called, he said: "I am going to leave the Covenanter Church. I refuse to vote. I will never again speak in this Synod." Elder McAbee spoke for the Fourth Church, New York. He is inferred from what he said that he will go out of the Covenanter Church. Rev. J. L. McIlvaine said: "I would rather stand with the Lord than the Reformed Presbyterian Church." Rev. J. note Rev. J. R. Thompson said: "The vote of this Synod does not represent the sentiment of the people, and you will hear from me later." Rev. E. M. Smith, of Baltimore, said he wanted the world to know how he was going to vote, because next Sunday he will intend his resignation from the denomination and leave the Covenanter Church.

This *Washington Post* credits Commissioner Douglass with the following recommending the matter of the District of Columbia having to Sunday law forces:

I think it one of the greatest complaints which the citizens of the city of what once more, there is only for Sunday law here in the District of Colombia. While we have on Sunday laws in the old District of Columbia. While we have on Sunday laws over here, where I live, the whole community; and communities where before either in another district was at Maryland or Virginia, or practically residing for a different right of the district. Even that of the community has been disrupted congregation and the churches of all other the District for disorder and crime greatly exceeded those for other work, and were more flagrantly violated and more frequent.

Noting these facts the *Baptist Free Press* comments:—

It will be generally agreed that the present state of things regarding Sunday in the District is not in any respect worse, and in some respects better, than it was before the old laws were repealed.

The respect in which things are better, had been that before the Committee was formed it was stated by the same paper:

"That before the enforcement of some ineffective laws, such as the Sunday theater law, the most absurd suggestions by the amendment would be to suggest the enforcement of these laws by the police authorities and the courts; it has now by Congress been simply changed that to a personal appeal it has prevented the legislation that carried against Sunday."

Continuing, the *Examiner* says:

It is, of course, slowly towards granting the premises so as to set a confirmation that the Congress ordinary formal work has been directed, that the majority of past offers the religious offer an opportunity as of the year.

The italics in the last three lines of this quotation are ours; they emphasize the reason for the existence of the New York Sabbath Committee. When it was not for the lasting of said of this offers the religious character of the day, "such communities would be unknown."

The English House of Commons, at one hundred and sixty four to a minority, passed April 28 the second reading of the Irish Sunday closing bill. The bill, if it becomes a law, will shut up the saloons of Ireland from nine o'clock Saturday night until Monday morning.—*Watertown Advocate.*

And yet the Sunday of Bradford and of this State, they are not happy and demand is for Sunday law for the District.
