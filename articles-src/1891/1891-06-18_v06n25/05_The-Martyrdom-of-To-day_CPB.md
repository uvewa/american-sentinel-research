The Sun of June 2, contains the following under the heading given above:—

Four Russian immigrants, who landed at the Barge Office yesterday from the steamship Suevia, told a startling story of persecution by the religious and civil authorities of the town of Karsoon, in the province Kiev. Three of the Russians are farmers. Their names are Ivan Jokofschenko, Stephen Terezinkow, and Farferi Davidinkow. Their wives and children accompany them. The other man is Alexei Szirechenko. He is unmarried, and was employed on a railroad at Karsoon. All were formerly members of the Greek Church, of which the Czar is the head.

A protestant missionary who visited the town of Karsoon converted Jokofschenko, who persuaded the others to renounce the faith of their fathers. It was some time before their neighbors discovered their heresy. When they did they began to make it very warm for the proselytes. Szirechenko was discharged by his employers. Cizhowsky, the head priest of the town, summoned Jokofschenko before him and tried to make him recant. But he stood by his new faith like a fifteenth century martyr. Finding that it was useless to argue with the apostate, the priest, Jokofschenko declares, had him and his wife thrown into jail. Then the police of the town, under orders from the ecclesiastical authorities, had him bound and bastinadoed 200 times. His wife received 100 lashes. After he was released he appealed for redress to the Mayor of the town by letter. He received no answer, and he then wrote to the Governor of the province. His second appeal was also without result. The other converts were not whipped, but their houses were demolished and their children were beaten by the neighbors' children who were of the faith, and after they planted their grain their neighbors would dig it up while they were asleep. This treatment, long persisted in, grew rather wearing on their nerves, and they at last decided that they were not intended for martyrs, and sold their farms to come to a land where they can believe in any or no religion at all, and where martyrs have no chance to grow. They sold their farms for about a quarter of their value, as their neighbors knew that they had to sell in order to get away, and wouldn't pay any more.

This is not persecution of Jews or of infidels, and it would be no better if it were, but of Christians by others calling themselves Christians also, and not only so, but those who are doing the persecuting think that they do God service; for in the words as nearly as may be of the Constitution of the National Reform Association, the Czar's object is to maintain existing Christian features in the Russian Government; "to promote the institution of the family, the religious element in education, the oath, and public morality, and to secure such a general recognition of the nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion," as taught by the Greek Church, as to indicate that Russia is a Christian nation, and "place all its Christian laws, institutions and usages on an undeniable and practical legal basis."

It is manifest that so long as there is a possibility of the success of so-called National Reform in this country, so long it is not certain that there may not be martyrs here. The principle is the same everywhere and in every age, and human nature is not essentially different in this country from what it is in Russia.

"Servetus! that which slew thee lives to-day,
Though in new forms it taints our modern air;
Still in heaven's name the deeds of hell are done;
Still on the high road, 'neath the noon-day sun,
The fires of hate are lit for them who dare
Follow their Lord along the untrodden way."

Already have we seen enough in the persecution of seventh-day Christians in several States of this Union, to show most conclusively that bigotry still lives even in America. National Reform is the very influence to stimulate it to the same baleful activity that it manifests in the dominions of the Czar.
