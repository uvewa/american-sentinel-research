At the present time we find American citizens divided in opinion as to whether or not we should have Government laws enforcing the observance of certain religious institutions. Quite a large number of people wish to see "such an amendment to the National Constitution as will indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions and usages of the Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." Others feel, and certainly with good reason, that this is a menace to our religious freedom, and advocate the total separation between religion and the State assured by our national Constitution as it now is.

This is a question of great interest to every citizen. Like other questions, there is certainly a right and a wrong side. Where stand we? "My kingdom is not of this world." So said Jesus (John:18, 36). It was truth then. Is it not the same to-day? Can it be any less true now than then? Or does time change so that what was once right would not be so to-day? We must regard the statement as Paul regards its author when he says (in Heb. 12:8), "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever." As Christ's "kingdom is not of this world," it is evident that no earthly government is authorized to enforce the observance of any duty we owe to Christ alone. Jesus, when speaking of our duty to government, and to God, said: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's." There is no intimation that this is to be done through the government, but direct to God. Jesus nowhere intimates that the government should see that men "rendered to God the things that are God's." Christ's work here was not to be advanced that way.

That governments are recognized by God, is clearly taught in the Bible, but it is also taught that they have only to do with man's duty toward his fellow-men. Our Government has no right to say how you or I shall serve God, or whether we shall serve him at all. To the State we owe civil duties, while to God we owe religious duties. Civil, that is pertaining to a citizen in his relation to his fellow citizens. Religion, pertaining to man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God. Upon such principles our Government has been founded. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

To fully show the position of our Government in the past it will only be necessary to quote the following as expressing the voice of the Senate:—

It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true or false. Our Government is a civil and not a religious institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely without molestation. . . . What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights of which government cannot deprive any portion of citizens, however small.—U. S. Senate, 1829.

With this have agreed many of our leading statesmen, as will appear from the following quotations:—

Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious faith and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.—Washington.

Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both.—Madison.

Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the Church and the private schools supported entirely by private contribution. Keep the State and Church forever separate.—U. S. Grant.

Others might be quoted, but these are sufficient. It is clearly seen that these are in perfect harmony with the teaching of Christ when he said, "My kingdom is not of this world."

To ask for laws compelling man to subscribe to a religious belief is certainly not to follow the teaching of Christ. What then means the present cry from so many of the clergy, for religious laws? Does religion here in America find it necessary to lean upon the more powerful arm of the State? If we ask for laws in behalf of religious institutions, it is really an admission that we cannot carry out the instruction of Christ given in Matt. 28:19: "Go ye therefore and teach all nations." Religious legislation is always against religious liberty, and what is against liberty in religion is against religion itself.—A. C. Shannon, in Girard (Ohio) Grit.
