# Uncertainties Log - v06n25 (1891-06-18)

## General Notes
This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text throughout most articles.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 6, Article "National Religious Liberty Association"
- **Issue:** The word "SAISON" appears in the National Reform petition text under point 4
- **Transcribed as:** "The American Saison"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error. Context strongly suggests this should read "The American Saloon" based on the pattern of the petition's demands. However, I transcribed exactly what appears in the OCR text per instructions.

### Page 7, Article on Good Health Journal
- **Issue:** Several garbled text fragments appear in the description
- **Transcribed as:** "officers' millions of the nature" and other unclear phrases
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The OCR appears corrupted in this advertisement section. I transcribed as it appears, but the text does not make complete sense.

### Page 7, Pension Advertisement
- **Issue:** Text "SOLENERE SOLENOID SUCH THE WAR ARE ENTITLED"
- **Transcribed as:** Exactly as shown
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This is clearly garbled OCR text that should probably read something like "Soldiers of the late war are entitled" but I preserved the OCR output.

## Note on Footnote
The Bradford, Pennsylvania article contains a footnote marked with an asterisk. This footnote was properly preserved at the end of that article as it appeared in the original layout.
