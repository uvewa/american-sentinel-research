One of the curiosities of Sunday regulations in the capital city of the Nation is that while drivers of hacks and other vehicles for public hire are not allowed to let their rigs stand upon the streets and avenues Sundays when not occupied, and if a vehicle becomes muddy a fine of two dollars is imposed for washing it off, workmen are permitted to go out and do any kind of work they see fit, at least, so says the Washington Post.
