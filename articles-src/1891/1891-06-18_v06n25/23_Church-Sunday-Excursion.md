Rev. J. L. McCartney, one of the secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, reports, through the Christian Statesman, a Sunday excursion from Wheeling to Pittsburg, gotten up by one of the churches of the former city. He says: "It is one of the most flagrant violations of the Sabbath, by a church, that I have ever known."
