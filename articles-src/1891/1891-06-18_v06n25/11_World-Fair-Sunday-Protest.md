May 24, a large mass meeting was held in the Central Presbyterian Church under the auspices of the Committee on Sabbath Observance, to protest against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. Many commissioners to the Presbyterian General Assembly were there, "and," says the report, "the audience was very enthusiastic." Dr. Herrick Johnson was the chief speaker. He is reported in the Mail and Express as follows:—

The Puritan Sabbath gone is the Continental Sabbath coming. Shall the Columbian Exposition be opened on Sunday? Let me give you six reasons why it should not.

1. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would be going back on all the traditions and usages of American life. The American department of the Paris Exposition was closed on Sunday. The exposition which celebrated the hundredth anniversary of American independence was closed on Sunday.

2. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would be importing the Continental Sunday for the first time in American history in a national and governmental way. Should the Continental Sunday be introduced to our States? American citizenship ought to blush for itself if it is not willing to exhibit its own goods at its own exhibition—the American Sabbath.

3. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would make the Government a direct party to an assault on Sunday as a rest day and a day of religious culture.

4. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would lead to a state of damaging and demoralizing things in Chicago, at the thought of which I shudder; it would create a pandemonium, and the country would see scenes it has never seen.

5. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would lead to future license of entertainment on Sunday, which would break down the American Sabbath, and we should have the Continental Sabbath, indeed.

6. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would be selling the Lord's day for a few pieces of silver. There would be no effort to open on Sunday if there were no money in it. I have heard subscribers to the Exposition talk of how Sunday opening would swell the gate receipts. Our immortal birthright of the Sabbath sold for a mess of pottage! Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver. Are the men better than he who would sell the Lord's day for money?

Resolutions recommending to the officers and Directors of the Exposition not to open its gates on Sunday, were unanimously adopted.
