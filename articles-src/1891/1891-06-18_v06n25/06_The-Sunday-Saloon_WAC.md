Some time since, the "Pearl of Days," said:—

Granting all the evil the saloon does six days out of seven, on the seventh day [Sunday it means] it is more a curse than all the other six days combined.

And why so?—Simply because the masses spend the day as a mere civil rest day, or holiday, and consequently have more time then to gratify appetite and indulge in pleasure. As the Christian Statesman of April 4, 1889, says:—

Labor ceases on that day; wages paid on Saturday are still, to some extent, in the hands of workingmen. The Sabbath is the great opportunity for filching these wages for drink.

And this shows that a simple civil rest day enforced upon all classes indiscriminately would prove a curse rather than a blessing. The manner of its observance is of fundamental importance. It must be observed, not in idleness or carousing, nor in pleasure, but *religiously* in order to be of benefit. But to thus regulate its observance would be religious legislation, a thing Mr. Crafts and his party are reluctant to admit they are laboring to secure. But it can not be denied that to close the saloon simply on Sunday manifestly is in the interest of Sunday rather than of temperance. But why favor Sunday more than other days?—Because it is regarded as a religious day. Then Sunday laws, whether for Sunday closing, Sunday rest, or Sunday worship, are *religious laws*, nothing else.

The evil of the saloon lies in the *business*, and not in the *time* when it is done. This being so, consistency demands that if closed at all they should be closed *all the time*.
