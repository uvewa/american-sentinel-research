The Czar has decreed that the pastor of a congregation must be of the same nationality of which the majority of his congregation is composed. This will virtually depose the bulk of the Protestant pastors in the Baltic provinces, where the clergy is predominantly German but the common people are Lithuanians or Estonians. The law will have similar results on the Catholic churches of Poland, where the priests as a rule are Germans.
