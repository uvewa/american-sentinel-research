The Sun of the 9th inst. contained under the heading given above, the following dispatch from Cambridge, Massachusetts:—

Yesterday the Cambridge police stopped an Irish funeral procession and searched every carriage for whiskey. One Mrs. Cowen, of Hingham, had died, and her relatives in Cambridgeport prepared to accompany her mortal remains to their final resting place in Mt. Auburn cemetery. All the livery men in Cambridge were drawn upon for equipages, and when the procession started from the place where the funeral was held in Cambridgeport it was fully half a mile long. The long line of carriages had barely proceeded a quarter of a mile when the horses which drew the first vehicle were rudely seized by the head, by several policemen, and the whole line was suddenly brought to a halt. The occupants of the rear carriages thought nothing at first of the stop, as they imagined that something obstructed the way for a moment, but those in the first carriages were very soon undeceived.

"Have you got any liquor in here?" asked one of the bluecoats. "Come, Cambridge is a prohibition town, and no liquor can pass through here on Sunday. We have it on good authority that you've got something with which to celebrate this funeral. So shell out!"

In vain did the mourners protest and call the policemen's attention to the fact that it was a funeral. The policemen had been told to search the carriages, and search them they did. They felt in the matting and under the seats for the whiskey, but not a drop did they find. The men in the carriages were thoroughly incensed, and a fight was only warded off by the self-restraint of some of the men.

This is very properly characterized as "an outrage." The Constitution of Massachusetts provides that "every subject has the right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions," and that all search must be upon warrant "supported by oath or affirmation" setting forth the grounds of the search and the persons or places to be searched. Therefore this wholesale police search of a funeral procession was in direct violation of the Constitution of Massachusetts, as it was also of the Constitution of the United States which contains substantially the same provision.

We yield to none in the practice and advocacy of temperance, and we have in the past given our reasons for believing that the State may properly prohibit the liquor traffic; but the prohibition that depends upon such methods as those employed on this occasion in Cambridge is nothing short of an outrage that ought not to be tolerated by a free people; in fact a people who long suffer such things are not free, no matter what their form of government may be. A despotism of the many is no better than a despotism of one.
