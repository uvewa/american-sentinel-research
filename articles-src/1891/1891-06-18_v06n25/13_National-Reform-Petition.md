A petition to political parties in conference assembled has been adopted, in set form, by the National Reform Association. It is the intention to first obtain its indorsement, as far as possible, by the "various large religious bodies, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Teachers' National Association, the various reformatory bodies," etc., and then to "present it next year to each of the nominating conventions."

And this is the language of the petition:—

Petition to the Representatives of the — Political Party in Convention Assembled:

As American citizens we respectfully ask you to place in your platform a clear, full recognition of these two great truths, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Sovereign Ruler of our Nation, and that his moral law is the rule of all our conduct in civil and political affairs.

We do not ask this as a mere sentiment, or as a religious creed, nor as seeking a union of Church and State, which we abhor, but as the greatest of political principles. And as the natural application of these principles to present issues in our national life we ask you to declare also for

1. The American Sabbath.
2. A uniform Christian marriage law.
3. The right of the Bible in the public schools.
4. The American Saloon.

We ask you to make your nominations, and conduct the election, in harmony with these great truths.

In His name.

Approved and adopted by a unanimous vote, etc.
