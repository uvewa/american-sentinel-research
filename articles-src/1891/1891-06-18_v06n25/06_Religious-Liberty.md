## Religious Liberty.

At the present time we find American citizens divided in opinion as to whether or not we should have Government laws enforcing the observance of certain religious institutions. Quite a large number of people wish to see "such an amendment to the National Constitution as will indicate that this is a Christian Nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions and images of the Government, on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." Others and certainly with good reason, that to maintain a menace to our religious freedom, and advocate the total separation between religion and the State as secured by our National Constitution as it now is.

This is a question of great interest to everybody. Like other questions, there is certainly a right and a wrong side. Where stood we? "My kingdom is not of this world," said the Saviour (John 18:36). It was truth then. It is not the same to-day? Can it be any less true now than then? Let those then change on what we consider what right would not be so today? We must regard the statements by the great apostle in the same author when he says (in Phil. 3:20), "[For] our conversation [*citizenship*] is in heaven." It was truth then, and to-day, and forever? As "Christ's kingdom is not of this world," Christians are not to earthly government to understand or to enforce the observance of any duty we owe to Christ alone. Jesus, when speaking of our duty to government, and to God, said: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's." There is no intimation that this is to be done under compulsion of law nor by authority of God. Jesus nowhere intimate that the government should see that men "rendered to God the things that are God's." Christ's church here was not to be advanced that way.

That governments are recognized by God, is clearly taught in the Bible; but it is also taught that they have only to do with our duty toward our fellow-men. Our Government has no right to say whether you or I shall serve God, or whether we shall ever bow at all. To the State we owe civil duties, while to God we owe religious duties. Civil religion is pertaining to a citizen in his relation to his fellow citizens. Religion, pertaining to our personal relation of faith and obedience to God. Upon such principles our Government has been founded. Congress—no human body can make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

To fully draw the position of our Government in the past it will be only be necessary to quote the following words from the voice of the Senate.

It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true, or what false. Our Government is a civil and not a religious institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely, without molestation. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are nevertheless equal in rights of civil government, subjects not of any rights of which government deprives or upon any conditions.

With this have agreed many of our leading statesmen, as will appear from the following quotations:

Every time when we condemn hatred of intolerance, it is reasonable to hold for this that religion of faith and should be protected in worshipping God as their own conscience dictates.—*Thomas Jefferson.*

Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both.—*James Madison.*

Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the State and church forever separate.—*Ulysses S. Grant.*

Others might be cited, but more has been said. It is clearly in seen then that all in all is a perfectly the teaching of the inspired text, in perfect with the teaching of all its writers.

So to ask for laws compelling man to be religious, or to be religious in a certain way is to ask for violation. To ask for laws compelling man to follow the teaching of Christianity, or to do a thing that is Christian is to ask for that same thing for the man is a Christian. To ask for laws compelling for how to observe the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, or any other day, is to ask that the Government to do what only the clergy, for religious love. To ask for religion or ask for laws compelling religious love is to ask for America if it is necessary to ask the State of Christian love, in the State of this State. It is set for laws in behalf of religion as institutions is really; is to set the institution that we cannot carry out the instruction. And Christ gives us that. It says, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations." Religion is a matter of the conscience—a matter that concerns the individual and his liberty, rest, and what liberty is right in religion is against religious rest.

The fact has become that the power of a reorganize must is of the same nationality of which the majority of its inhabitants is occupied. This still very distinctly depose the bull of the Protestant pattern in the Baltic provinces, where the religion is predominately German but the climes in Russian. The law will have similar traits on the Catholic churches of Poland, when the patent to act as a rule on German
