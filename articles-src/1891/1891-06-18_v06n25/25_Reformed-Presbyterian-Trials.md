The trials of the six young ministers of the Reformed Presbyterian Church ended at Pittsburg, on the 10th inst. The Synod, by a vote of ninety-five to thirty-seven, expelled five of them from the church. The charges against them were scandal, libel, and following divisive courses in declaring in favor of the right of franchise. Their names are E. M. Milligan, J. R. J. Milligan, W. H. Reed, W. L. C. Samson, and O. B. Milligan. The Rev. A. W. McClurkin's appeal was sustained, and R. B. Burnett, a student, also charged with heresy, has not yet been tried.

The thirty-seven members of the Synod who voted against the suspension of the young men presented a paper of dissent from the action of the Synod, and asked that it be spread upon the minutes.

The scene during the voting was exciting. When the Rev. J. F. Carson's name was called, he said: "I am going to leave the Covenanter Church. I refuse to vote. I will never vote again in this Synod." Elder McAfee spoke for the Fourth Church, New York. It is inferred from what he said that he will go out of the Covenanter Church. Rev. J. L. McElhinney said: "I would rather stand with the Lord than the Reformed Presbyterian Church. I vote no." Rev. J. R. Thompson said: "The vote of this Synod does not represent the sentiment of the people, and you will hear from them later." Rev. E. M. Smith, of Baltimore, declined to vote, because next Sunday he will tender his resignation to his congregation and leave the Covenanter Church.
