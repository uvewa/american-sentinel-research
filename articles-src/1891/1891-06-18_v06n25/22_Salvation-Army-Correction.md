Some two weeks ago we copied from the Christian Advocate an item stating that the Grand Jury of Mercer County, New Jersey, had indicted the members of the Salvation Army for making loud noises on drums and tambourines. This the Advocate now says was a mistake. There was no indictment, but only a presentation of certain facts to the Court by the Grand Jury. "The main cause of complaint," says the Advocate, "was the congregating of disorderly persons on the sidewalks in front of the headquarters, which are in the center of the city, attracted there by the public show given by the members of the Army." We would suggest to officers of the town where this annoyance exists that it would be highly proper to arrest the "disorderly persons" and thus remove all cause of complaint. We do not approve of Salvation Army methods, but the Army is entitled to the same protection afforded to other people holding public meetings, either religious or otherwise. This is supposed to be a free country, and the law should know no difference between the organ of the Methodist or Presbyterian and the bass drum of the Salvation Army corps.
