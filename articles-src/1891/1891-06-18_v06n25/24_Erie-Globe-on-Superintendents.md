The Globe, of Erie, Pennsylvania, comments thus upon the work in the interests of Sunday law, of Rev. J. L. McCartney, district superintendent of the states of Pennsylvania and the two Virginias, and Rev. Crowe, superintendent of north-western Pennsylvania:—

The "superintendents"—of what it is not stated, but presumably of the personal liberty of the people—are making a tour of this vicinity, and stopped over night at Cambridge. They have a stereotyped set of resolutions, which are adopted religiously wherever presented, but at Cambridge, which is especially wicked, they indulged in the rarity of the following:—

Resolved, That we heartily commend the action of Station Agent Beatty in stopping the shipping of calves from our station on the Sabbath as presenting an example of true Christian courage in defense of the right.

True Christian courage! And yet the biggest part of veal Cambridge people eat is butchered on Sunday evening?

Whatever our personal beliefs may be in regard to the Sunday question, we hold that every man should be accorded the utmost liberty in the observance of the day. As well make it compulsory for man, woman and child to light fire crackers on the Fourth of July as to think of enforcing the now obsolete Blue Laws of our forefathers. Times have changed since the days of Salem witchcraft. Religious liberty is fairly dawning. It was "freedom to worship God" that drove the Puritans to Plymouth rock. It was the same spirit which prevails in the churches to-day which led them to persecute the alleged "witches" of Salem. God never orders a draft for his army; his soldiers must be volunteers. It is impossible to compel people by law to embrace this or that religion.
