A Washington City paper credits one of the pastors of that city with the following:—

There is a growing demand on the part of ministers and religious people for the closing of all museums, libraries, and art galleries on Sunday. It is urged that all Sunday newspapers should be suppressed, and all travel by land or sea should stop on Sunday. This indicates a most unhealthy condition of the church. Has the church lost the power to attract the masses? Is it unable to endure the competition of fairs and railroads and libraries? In the year 401 a petition was sent to the Roman Emperor praying that "the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday, and from feast days, to some other days of the week." The reason given was "that in such competitions the theatre was vastly more frequented than the church." Parallel with this we find that at the Elgin (Ill.) Sunday law convention, November, 1887, Sunday trains were opposed "because they get a great many passengers and break up a great many congregations," and the Sunday newspaper is deprecated because "the laboring classes arise late on Sunday morning, read the Sunday papers, and allow the hours of worship to go by unheeded." Sunday is the only day of leisure many workingmen have. If they desire to go to church they are free to do so, but if not, then if all places of harmless recreation or amusement and all opportunities for literary culture are denied them they will find that which is more harmful, perhaps, in the excursion or beer garden.

To us there seems to be a good deal of good sense in the words of this Washington preacher.
