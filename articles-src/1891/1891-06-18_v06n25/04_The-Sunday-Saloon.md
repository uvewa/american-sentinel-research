But to hear the regular observer would be to advocate religious legislation, a thing Mr. Crafts and his party are so hesitant to admit they are laboring to secure. But it can not be denied that to close the saloon simply on Sunday manifestly is in the interest of Sunday rather than of temperance. But why favor Sunday more than other days?—Because it is regarded as a religious day. Then Sunday laws, whether for Sunday closing, Sunday rest, or Sunday sacredness, are religious, nothing else.

The evil of the saloon lies in the business, and not in the time when it is done. This being so, consistency demands that if closed at all they should be closed at all times.
