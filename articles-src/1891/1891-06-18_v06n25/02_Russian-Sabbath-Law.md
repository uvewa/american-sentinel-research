A Reuter's dispatch from St. Petersburg says: "M. Pobiedonostzeff, the Procurator of the Holy Synod, has drawn up, and will shortly submit to the approval of the Council of the Empire, a new ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding the Jews to observe the Hebrew Sabbath by closing their shops or other commercial establishments and manufactories on Saturdays, and ordering them, on the other hand, to close their places of business on Sundays and other religious festivals of the Orthodox faith. Jewish employees in shops, offices, and other establishments, moreover, are, under the new ordinance, to be compelled to work on Saturdays, and to observe Sunday as a day of rest."
