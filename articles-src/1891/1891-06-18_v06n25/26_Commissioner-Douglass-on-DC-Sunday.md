The Washington Post credits Commissioner Douglass with the following regarding the matter of the District of Columbia having no Sunday laws:—

I think it one of the greatest compliments which can be paid our city when visitors come here and remark that everything is so orderly and quiet on the Sabbath. While we have no Sunday laws to amount to anything, I do not think there is a city on the continent where better order is maintained, or where the Sabbath is more generally observed. There is a noticeable absence of ball-playing, prize-fighting, and things of this character. It speaks well for our city.

And yet the friends of Sunday as a religious day are not happy and demand a Sunday law for the District.
