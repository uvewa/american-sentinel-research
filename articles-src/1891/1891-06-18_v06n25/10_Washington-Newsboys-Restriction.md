In Washington City, newsboys are restricted on Sunday morning to two and one-half hours. "The law," remarks the Post, of that city, "says they can cry their papers from 8 to 10:30 o'clock Sundays, but if caught after or before this time they can be fined. It is hard on the boys, but they make the best of it."
