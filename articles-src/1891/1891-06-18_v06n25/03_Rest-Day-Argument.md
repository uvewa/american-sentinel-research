As to a day of rest being necessary for the good of mankind, the Secretary of the Washington Secular Union says: "Workingmen need to sleep at night. Shall we have a civil law decreeing, under a penalty of fine and imprisonment, what time all shall go to sleep? Shall we have an act of the council compelling all persons to eat between the hours of twelve and one. If the people of the United States do not know enough to rest on Sunday or any other day when they need rest, it is certain they much more require a law to send them to bed at night. The rank hypocrisy of the advocates of a civil Sunday law is at once apparent if it is suggested that a law be passed to insure all a day of rest every Wednesday. Every Sunday-keeper indignantly protests, 'O, that would be a violation of our religious rights!' No; they want a law to compel every one, whether he believes it right or not, to keep Sunday as they do."
