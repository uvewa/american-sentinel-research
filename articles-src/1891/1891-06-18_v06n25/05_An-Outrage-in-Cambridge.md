## "An Outrage in Cambridge."

THE *Sun* of the 9th inst., under the above heading gives the above, the following dispatch from Cambridge, Massachusetts:—

Yesterday the Cambridge police stopped an Irish funeral procession and searched every carriage in the procession. The cause was that O'Connor and others had reference to Cambridge's prepared to sell carriages but could not manage to send the funeral along to place in Mt. Auburn cemetery. All the trees in Cambridge were shunt upon the carriages, and when the procession started from the place whence the funeral was held in Cambridge there was a fully half a mile long. The long line of carriages naturally provoked a quarter or a mile to the extent which done the field vehicles were easily seated by the hand, by several policemen, and the officers stopped the cortege. The occupants of the hack resigned themselves to the search, but the others the funeral passed through another district and obtained the way for a moment, but those in the carriages submitted to the officer's question.

Have you got any liquor in here? asked one of the Sergeants. "Unless you find something suspicious form, and be liquor you pass them through in the cortege you can have it and the driver, and if it is smuggling spirit it is next time and nothing else is yet got something which with to celebrate this funeral, instead.

In vain did the mourners protest and the policeman's statement to that their hat it was a solid car. The policemen had been said to search the carriages, and search them they did. They felt in the velvet cushions, under the feet and did not miss not a drop of what they did. The seem in the hat box behind the car, and the interior of the heavy car was mostly sniffed of by the self restraint of some of the men.

This is very properly characterized as an outrage. The Constitution of Massachusetts provides that "every subject has the right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions," and that all, and all, search must be upon warrant "supported by oath or affirmation" setting forth the grounds of the search and the persons or places to be searched. Therefore this wholesale and reckless search of a funeral procession was in direct violation of the Constitution of Massachusetts, or in the law of the Constitution.
