DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible as exemplified in its simplicity, and oppose in equal rights as a natural right as in the principles of Religious Liberty:—

1. That the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage, and such only, as each individual believes to be acceptable to him; this right being between man and his Creator alone.

2. That in religious things of any government or legislation no power at the disposal of any of this true. Constitutional any equal right being between the members of one community as to those of any other community, and each individual of any community as to every other individual.

3. That to secure the proper exercise of natural or civil rights, and to enable individuals of separate communities to combine in the preservation of each other of their respective rights. The only legitimate objects of civil government are:

C. ELDRIDGE, *President.*
A. O. COLCORD, *Secretary.*

IN Washington City, newsboys are restricted on Sunday morning to two and one-half hours. "The law," remarks the *Post*, of that city, "says they can cry their papers from 8 to 10:30 o'clock Sunday, but if capacity of before-this-time they fix the line to fraud. If it be the law, it is; let them make the best of it."

MAY 31, a large mass meeting was held in the Central Presbyterian Church under the auspices of the Committee on Sabbath Observance, to protest against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday and communications to the Presbyterian General Assembly were there, "read," says the report, "the audience was very enthusiastic all through. It is reported the elder." Speaker, he Reporter in the *Mind and Express* as follows:—

The Puritan Sabbath is gone in the Continental Sabbath coming. Shall the Columbian Exposition be opened on Sunday? Let me give you ten reasons why it should not.

1. Opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would be giving back to us all the traditions and images of America to the Americans department of the first article. All appears to us of all the matter, but more writing be the same thing himself into it for the other by kindly passing it over to the City Council, and the Mayor and aldermen of the city of Bradford. He dwells strongly upon the fact that the proposed ordinance with its exemption especially did distinctly commit the Mayor and aldermen of the city of Bradford to the judgment of religious observance, and to the authoritative detection of religious questions. And further, a most excellent point was made by him to the effect that as the State law cut off the matter, the City Council not be compelled the law, therefore the proposed enquiries was with good reason, that to enforce and further, was the petitioning of the Council was in a stand was just what the petitioners had asked for, which this proposed ordinance came for was brought in absented by the ministers that in the promotion of the petitioners asked for it; it was without the consent which the speakers referred to that the action thus proposed to be foisted upon the ordinance as a ball-game, beyond the purpose of the character of the original petition and utterly without any authority in law. So much of Mr. McCrea's speech as we are able to reproduce in substance, but holding short of a verbatim report would possibly do it justice, and even that would come far short because of its inability to reproduce the tone and manner which were not the least powerful part of the original speech.

The Methodist minister, Dr. Huntington, spoke next upon the well-known Sunday-law arguments, with which our readers are so well acquainted, as to what the States have Sunday laws, that they have been declared constitutional; that the United States Constitution merely acknowledges what the States have declared Sunday; pity for the poor enslaved workingman, etc., etc., and objected to the definitions which had been given of the natural words of the proposed ordinance, saying that the dictionary was not the place to go for definitions in such cases, but the law books in the decisions of courts. Mr. McCrea was suggested to him that the courts had to go to the dictionary for their definitions; but the speaker seemingly did not hear it. With the close of Mr. Huntington's speech, the hearing of the discussion ended. All passed off pleasantly, and the audience was well pleased. The whole question was well set before the people of Bradford, and final action will probably be taken by the Council at any next regular meeting, which will be on June 15. What that action shall prove to be we shall inform the readers of THE SENTINEL.

A PETITION to political parties is one in common seemed that has been adopted, as set upon, by the National Reform Association. It is the intention to first obtain the indorsement, as far as possible, by the various large religious bodies, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Teachers' National Association, the various reformatory bodies, etc., etc., and then to present it next year of the action of the existing convention.

And this is the language of the petition:

*Petition to the Representatives of the People, and Party to be Constituency Assembled.*

As American citizens we respectfully ask you to place in your platform a clear, full recognition of the only true great truths, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Sovereign Ruler of our Nation, and that his moral law is the rule of our conduct in civil and political affairs.

We do not ask this as a mere matter, or as a
