## Bradford, Pennsylvania.

PENNSYLVANIA has a Sunday law, as our readers know, enacted in the year 1794—a relic of the days in that commonwealth when a person had to "profess faith in Jesus Christ" in order to be assured of protection in his religious rights. Bradford in that State is a city of about ten thousand inhabitants. The State law is of no more force in Bradford than in most other places throughout the State; as the people pay little or no attention to it, just as they might.

By some means not clearly defined a movement was begun in that city to secure an enactment of a city ordinance embodying the material part of the State law. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union took the lead in circulating a petition asking the City Council to pass an ordinance, reading in the very words of the State law as far as it could be made applicable to the city. The petition was signed by five hundred and seventy-four voters, and the preachers presented it to the Council. Accordingly the Council framed the desired ordinance which was referred to the joint ordinance committee.

All this time there was considerable discussion among the people and not a little opposition. The committee to whom the ordinance was referred, therefore, decided to have a public hearing of the question. The hearing was appointed for Tuesday night, June 4. The editor of THE SENTINEL was invited to be present and speak upon the question; which invitation, of course, he willingly accepted, glad to speak in so good a cause. The Council secured one of the largest halls in the city, and the meeting was held according to appointment, Thursday night. Two ministers, a Methodist and a Presbyterian, spoke for the proposed ordinance; the editor of THE SENTINEL and Mr. J. M. McCrea, a leading lawyer of the place, spoke against it.

The discussion was opened [page 194] by a Presbyterian minister, Mr. Huntington, who explained the origin of the petition, stating that a good "W. C. T. U." lady had been made chairman of the committee that was charged with legislation, and had canvassed the city, and necessarily, and protested against the right of the editor of THE SENTINEL to be heard, as he was not a citizen of Bradford nor an inhabitant of Pennsylvania. He then explained that the City Council, before whom he was speaking, was not an ecclesiastical court, that it was not a court before which ecclesiastical or religious questions are to be tried. He next explained that in the question under consideration religion was in no way involved, that it was a "civil Sabbath" entirely, and desired simply to secure to the people that which is referred to the law of the State as being of force, and said that if they had to do so, to do what they would in the premises of prosecution and persecution, they could have enforced that law whenever it became necessary to secure a city ordinance; that they had deemed it best to do this rather than the other. He presented his own composition clause which they had framed, and which they proposed to have added to the ordinance, exempting those who "conscientiously" observed another day than Sunday as a day of worship. He said that there were those in Bradford, business men, who feared God and would like to attend church and spend the Sabbath as it ought to be observed, but that they would then lose the patronage that would otherwise fall to them if their business houses were allowed to be kept open on Sunday, and therefore these would like to have a law that would close all the places of business in the city on Sunday. He read a passage from Mr. Crafts, the same old one in which that Sunday-law worthily magnifies the oppression of the working classes, whenever it comes down to 'work six days' work for five days' pay or five days' work for six days' pay.' He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in which the constitutionality of the Sunday law had been maintained, and in which it was declared that the law had no reference to religion, and did not enforce any religious observance, nor place any restrictions upon the freedom of conscience. He argued that men were better for being able to stop, and closed with a renewal of his protest against the editor of THE SENTINEL's right to speak, and declared that he ought not to be heard.

As soon as he had taken his seat, the chairman, Mr. Zeno, who is also a member of the committee to whom the ordinance was referred, explained that if any one was to blame for the extract of the public notice that had been taken of the matter could aid in any way, he, as he saw the case and had secured the hall, announcement and hearing, and had given as much public notice of it as possible; and further, if any one was to blame for Mr. Jones's being heard, he and not Mr. Jones was to blame, for he had invited him. (Applause.)

After THE SENTINEL was read, Mr. Stevens, as follows:

Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the Council, and citizens of Bradford: I am here as persons present, and as you have been invited to be present by the person who opened the discussion; I have no apology to make for my being here. I may say that I am not a citizen of Bradford nor an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, but I was invited by those who are both citizens of Bradford and inhabitants of Pennsylvania, to come and speak for them upon this question; and I offer it as my opinion that the citizens of Bradford have the right to invite whomsoever they please, from whatever quarter, to speak either for them on any subject upon which they want to be heard.

You have been informed that this is not an ecclesiastical court, that it is not a court before which ecclesiastical or religious questions are to be tried, that it is a matter in which the law and the customs in this movement and in this ordinance proposed. Please bear that in mind while I read the ordinance proposed. It is as follows:—

AN ORDINANCE

ordained all persons in the city of Bradford from desecrating the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, and providing a penalty for the breach thereof.

Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted, and ordained, by the Select and Common Councils of the city of Bradford, Pennsylvania:

Section 1. By authority of and in conformity with Section 1, Act of April 22d, 1794, all persons are hereby forbidden to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, or to pursue any game, hunting, shooting, sport or diversion whatever. Provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to be a violation of the ordinance.

Sec. 2. That the penalty for the violation of this ordinance, before the Mayor or any Alderman of the city of Bradford shall, at the cost of said magistrates, be found a sum not exceeding four ($4) dollars, and in default of payment of said fine and costs of prosecution, may be imprisoned in the city or county prison or jail not more than six days.

Now please bear in mind that this has been declared by the first speaker not an ecclesiastical question; it is not a court before which religious questions are to be tried, and let us compare with this statement some of the terms, in fact the material terms, of the proposed ordinance. It is entitled, you see, "An ordinance forbidding all persons in the city of Bradford from desecrating the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday." Well, now, in the nature of things cannot be desecrated. A thing must be consecrated before it can be desecrated. Let us read, therefore, the definition of this word "desecrate." It is, "To divert from a sacred purpose." And yet we are to suppose there is "nothing religious" about that—sacred things are all "civil"!!! The truth is, as you see, that this proposed ordinance, which by its very first material word in it is committed to the guardianship of sacred things; so that at the very first step it enters the realm of religion, and they cannot escape it.

Let us read further in this definition. "Desecrate" is to *divert* from a purpose to which a thing is consecrated. Therefore you see that by all things that can be named, *civil*, yet still, things cannot be desecrated; that a thing must be consecrated before it is possible to desecrate it. But let us find what "consecrate" means. The definition of this word is, "*To set apart to the services and worship of God.*" Yet, gentlemen, friends, forget that you have been informed that this ordinance is to have nothing to do with religion!! The previous speaker said so, but although the previous speaker told you this, yet the ordinance which is framed in the very words that which they asked, and which they secure at an entirely satisfactory, are for declared right to establish all persons in the city of Bradford from diverting from the holy day, commonly called Sunday, from the worship of God. The ordinance forbids—"any diversion whatever." That covers all manner of diversions. Now, what are "diversions" mean? Something described as "that which turns or turns from any direction, diverted, or shifted attention." What then is the intended application of the day? "The worship of God. Therefore the proposed ordinance distinctly declares that no person in the city of Bradford shall turn off Sunday in any way whatsoever from the services and worship of God. But don't forget "there is nothing religious" about that, oh no, that is what it is—"civil Sabbath."

Another thing, friends. Don't forget the American Sabbath Union in Document [page 195] No. 5 says that, "All the appearances of Jesus to his disciples after his resurrection, so far as we know, were on the first day of the week," and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, by Mr. Crafts, maintains the same position. With this the death of Jesus the dispensation passed away, and henceforth we find him in variety meeting with his disciples on the first day of the week. Now they say that that is so, let us read a passage of Scripture directly upon that point. I turn to John 21:1-6, and read as follows:— "After these things Jesus showed himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself. There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."

There is an appearance of Jesus clearly recorded which meets the two chief Sunday-law organizations positively declare to be on Sunday, the first day of the week; and at that appearance of the Saviour, his disciples were not only fishing and had fished without success up to this point, but he then told them where to cast the net, so that they could catch fish. They did cast, and caught a multitude! Now upon the authority of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the American Sabbath Union, that was on the first day of the week; and according to the word, Jesus distinctly assisted his disciples in catching a "multitude of fishes." Then I want to know by what right these people propose to have the city of Bradford prohibit the citizens of this place from catching fish on Sunday. (Applause.)

The former speaker said that the object of the ordinance was to secure to the people rest. It is not, then the people of Bradford do not know when they are tired enough, and need rest? Further than this, who is to enforce this if it should be adopted? The citizens themselves of course. Will then, if they now will not rest, will they then compel themselves to rest? In other words, will you, the business men of this place, compel yourselves by law to do what now you are pleased to do and will not do? Of course you will not, for everybody knows that when a person wants to do a thing, he can do it without a law to compel him to do it.

Yet more than this, you have a law already. The law of the State is of force in Bradford as well as anywhere else. The law of the State is of force everywhere within the bounds of the State. But that law is not obeyed, and this petition simply asks that that law itself, or its word for so far as applicable, shall be re-enacted into an ordinance for this city. Now as that State law is neither respected nor enforced, how do you propose to have the same thing enforced by making it a city ordinance?

Here is a practical and familiar illustration. I notice in your daily papers that there is a proposal to take citizens of this city up to Buffalo and Niagara Falls next Sunday and the succeeding Sundays through the summer. Suppose this ordinance were adopted. Will you then draw out your police force and stop your neighbors of this city from going on that excursion up to Niagara? I know well enough that you will not; and if you do not enforce it upon them, will you enforce it upon your other neighbors who stay at home? If upon some, you will have to on all. But you have not strength for all, and I know well enough that it will not be enforced upon them in the first class, and I know well enough that it will not be enforced upon any class except some class upon whom it can be used by somebody, some one against whom some other one has a grudge. Then the law will be made simply the channel through which malicious ones can vent their grudges or spite. You know that the previous speaker said that if they should choose to do what they could in prosecution and persecution, they could have enforced the law of the State, but they didn't choose to do that, and therefore petitioned the council to pass this ordinance thus simply saying that the enforcement of the law of the State would be but prosecution and persecution, and as they did not want to engage in that, they therefore kindly ask the City Council to do it for them.

It was announced, however, that they propose an exception, for the observers of the seventh day. Yes, that is to say, and I propose to exempt from the requirements of this ordinance those who religiously observe another day, and who, when they shall be arrested and brought before the Mayor or any alderman, shall be able to swear to or prove to their satisfactory evidence that they "regularly" observe that day, and that they "have observed the day as a day of worship." Precisely. They distinctly propose, therefore, that this ordinance shall require that those who do not [page 196] observe Sunday shall religiously observe another day as a day of worship.

This alone therefore proposes positively to enforce a religious observance. And when the requirement is that those who do not observe Sunday shall study religiously observe another day, this is plainly argued in favor of those who do not religiously observe another day. That is in the thing itself. It is religious from beginning to end. It is religious in every intent and purpose of its promoters, and although you have been explained that the City Council is not an ecclesiastical court, yet this exemption clause demonstrates that it is a court before which persons who observe another day than Sunday, were arrested in that court before the Mayor and aldermen of this city, plainly prove by paper evidence that they have religiously observed a duty a day of worship, and that is a strange tribunal with them to do so. This alone distinctly and positively makes the Mayor and aldermen of this city the judges of religion and of religious matters; it makes a court before which religious questions shall be brought up and by which religious questions shall be decided. But may no person in Bradford or anywhere else have his inalienable right to observe or not observe any day than Sunday without having such observances inquired upon to know whether it is religious or not. No man nor set of men in Bradford or anywhere else, has any right to require, or enter into any question or inquisition upon, the religious observance of any day whatever by any body, or in any body. (Applause.)

The gentlemen informed us that there are in the city those who fear God and desire to keep the Sabbath; fear God and keep it in a religious way, but in so doing they are compelled to lose the patronage that might otherwise fall to their business if their places of business were closed on Sunday. That is, they fear God provided they may be assured that they lose nothing by it. And yet it is not spiritual or holy. And yet don't forget that there is "nothing religious" about this! It is a "civil Sabbath"—civil! and this is not an ecclesiastical court, nor is it a court before which any religious questions can properly be brought. It may not be out of place again to remind that if you bear in mind that in this the clearness of this court, you will have all the higher evaluation of the character of those who seek to do so with this proposed ordinance. Further it is a position recognized by all classes who believe in religion, from Pharisee all the way up, that ministers are not in God's service anything that is contradictory to the word of God, and if any such situation is received, every one has a right to disbelieve it and follow the word. Now let us read another passage from the proposed ordinance, and compare it with some statements which I have from respective authorities on the Sunday law question. The ordinance, you perceive, forbids any person from pursuing "any game, hunting, shooting, sport, or diversion whatever, on the first day, commonly called Sunday." Pushing it put under the head of "any game" in fact and in practice, as are also to reproduce in substance, but holding short of a verbatim report would possibly do it justice, and even that would come far short because of its inability to reproduce the tone and manner which were not the least powerful part of the original speech.

The Methodist minister, Dr. Huntington, spoke next upon the well-known Sunday-law arguments, with which our readers are so well acquainted, as to what the States have Sunday laws, that they have been declared constitutional; that the United States Constitution merely acknowledges what the States have declared Sunday; pity for the poor enslaved workingman, etc., etc., and objected to the definitions which had been given of the natural words of the proposed ordinance, saying that the dictionary was not the place to go for definitions in such cases, but the law books in the decisions of courts. Mr. McCrea was suggested to him that the courts had to go to the dictionary for their definitions; but the speaker seemingly did not hear it. With the close of Mr. Huntington's speech, the hearing of the discussion ended. All passed off pleasantly, and the audience was well pleased. The whole question was well set before the people of Bradford, and final action will probably be taken by the Council at any next regular meeting, which will be on June 15. What that action shall prove to be we shall inform the readers of THE SENTINEL.
