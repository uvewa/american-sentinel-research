"Left with a Trust," and "Jottings from the Pacific, No. 3," numbers 7 and 8 of the "Young People's Library," are two excellent books. The books of this series are carefully prepared not merely to amuse but to edify their young readers, and parents need have no hesitancy about placing them in the hands of their children. The binding of these volumes is the same as of the preceding ones, namely, fine English cloth, embossed in jet and gold. The price is fifty cents per volume. The same books can be had in paper binding for twenty-five cents per volume. Order of the Pacific Press, Oakland, California, or of the same at 43 Bond Street, New York. After July 1, the price of the cloth-bound books will be sixty cents per volume.
