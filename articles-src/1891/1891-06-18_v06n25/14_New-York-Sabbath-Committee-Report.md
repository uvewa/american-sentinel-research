The report of the thirty-second and thirty-third years of the New York Sabbath Committee has recently been issued. The condition of affairs when the Committee was organized is thus stated in the report:—

There were open every Sunday in this city, which had then less than half its present population, "twenty theaters, chiefly of the lowest class, and eighty dance houses; liquor shops carried on their traffic with glaring defiance; noisy processions, with bands of music, paraded the streets; newspapers and other cries disturbed the quiet of families and congregations; while Sunday arrests for disorder and crime greatly exceeded those on any week-day, and were rapidly increasing."

Noting these facts the Baptist Examiner says:—

It will be generally agreed that the present state of things, though far enough from satisfactory, is not in any respect worse, and in some important respects is vastly better than the condition thus described.

The respect in which things are better than before the Committee was formed is thus stated by the same paper:—

It is entitled to the credit of having secured more effective laws, such as the Sunday theater law, the processions law, amendments to the excise law; it has sought the enforcement of these laws through the police authorities and the courts; it has constantly watched and defeated hostile legislation; by personal appeal it has prevented threatened violations of the rest and quiet of the day.

Continuing, the Examiner says:—

It is, of course, chiefly towards guarding the weekly rest-day as a civil institution that the Committee's formal work has been directed, but the bearing of such efforts upon the religious character of the day is as obvious as it is important.

The italics in the last three lines of this quotation are ours; they emphasize the reason for the existence of the New York Sabbath Committee. Were it not for "the bearing of such efforts upon the religious character of the day," such committees would be unknown.
