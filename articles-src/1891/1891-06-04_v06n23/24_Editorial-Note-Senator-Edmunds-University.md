SENATOR EDMUNDS has an idea of a university, and here it is, expressed in his own words:—

We need a great national university, and we need it right here at the national capital. Not a college, but a great non-sectarian university, an institution which should make plain the liberality of Protestants as compared with the narrowness of the papal power. I have no objection to any one's being a Papist if he or she desires to be, but I do object to the efforts which are being made by the Papacy to combine the Church and the State. The people of the United States must and will see the necessity for taking a firm stand in this matter, and one of the results of their firmness will be a great national university.

Upon this the *Catholic Review* remarks:—

The Senator then desires to erect at the common expense a great Protestant school whose avowed aim shall be to counteract the encroachments of Catholics. It is therefore in order for the present Catholic university to get itself constituted a national affair to oppose the encroachments of Protestants. One is as logical and useful as the other, and quite as constitutional.

And the *Review* is quite right.
