The Sunday Advocate sneeringly remarks, that it is "only seven-tenths of one per cent," who believe in keeping Saturday, and argues that the smallness of this minority renders it no bar to a law compelling the observance of Sunday. But it continues: "What difference does it make if such a few as that are imprisoned? for if they can't think and interpret the Bible the same as the dominant Church they ought to go to jail."

We recommend this dose, taken as often and as long as necessary, to those suffering under the supposition that there is no religious intolerance in this country that would proceed to extremes if it had the power. Such a supposition is one of the most complete delusions. An American citizen who indulges it is asleep on guard. Yes, let them go to jail if they don't believe as the majority believe. But the Advocate is consistent. If we are to have the State take hold of religion, the logical consequence is imprisonment, and for the incorrigible execution. It was the clear sight of this inevitable consequence that led the Patriot from the first to speak out against the Bible in the public schools.

Every attempt to give the State any control of religion or religious matters, is the attempt of the shadow of the Middle Ages to darken and curse our land. Whether understood or not, it has but one object, one logical end, the destruction of that freedom of action by which man is creatively endowed, to accept the good, reject the evil, or the reverse. It is one of the greatest of our present dangers, one of the darkest of our future prospects. The passage of laws dealing directly or indirectly with religious questions, is being urged with a vehemence and, not religious but irreligious frenzy, that speaks in notes of unmistakable warning as to what minorities may expect, should this frenzy become the ruling passion in the land. Every citizen should raise his voice and use his vote against this threatening power of persecution and thralldom.
