## A Baptist Lawyer's Opinion.

THE following letter from a Baptist lawyer of Cleveland, Ohio, was recently received by one of our Religious Liberty workers in Chicago:—

> Your genial courteous attention of this case to hand by due course of mail, but it having been delayed because of the pressure, it accepted my attention till to-day. During the five months I have been the recipient of your kindness in the form of your journal, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, I can truthfully say it is one of the most interesting, literary and appreciative reader of it, and that I always read its contents with interest, the conditions which called it into existence. It is, in my opinion, one which is really engaging the attention and in the most forcible manner the attention of the thinking people of this country. I believe and that its issues is of real vital importance to the people as the preservation of civil and religious liberty—surely a liberine in the interest of which our ancestors left home, friends, property, in fact all that could be near and dear to them, and braved not these savage shores; and founded terra—they proposedly a home for all who wished to enjoy [page 178] day the equal rights of all are preserved the same as upon other days. The government can not justly say to men upon that day anything that it could not do upon any other day of general abstinence from labor; it can simply adapt itself to the conditions of the existing quiet of that day, and leave the people free to spend the hours as they choose.

Socialistic social orders are simply the duty of the government, and parks and swimming pools belong to the people. It follows then that if the people wish to resort to these places on Sunday, it is entirely out of place for those who have charge of them for the people to deny access to any of them upon that day—the only day that many have an opportunity to resort to such places.

"This idea that governments, national, State, and municipal, must close up on Sunday and that and the other avenues of pleasure or recreation on Sunday or else be guilty of sin against the law of God, is rooted in sheer medievalism. To admit the principle is to admit to all that is claimed by the National Reform theocrats. But we can never consent that religion should be made a question of majorship; that the Nation might be obliged to adopt any particular creed, simply by act of Congress or even by vote of the people. If the introduction of the Continental Sunday will tend, in any degree, to relieve the Sunday laws of the country, reform the ideas of the people, the State and its proper relation of the social and religious of the people, it would certainly constitute a lasting benefit upon the community, and especially upon the cause of true liberty. It is a mistake to suppose that the State can place the bloom from the lily of beauty or Christians and send them to the kingdom, 'on flowery beds of ease.' The fact is it ought to do no such thing."
