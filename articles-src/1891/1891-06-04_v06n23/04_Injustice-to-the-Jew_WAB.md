Almost every mail brings to us news of repeated injustice to the Jews of Russia, with now and then an item concerning similar treatment elsewhere. On account of their religious views they have been persecuted by almost every civilized government on the face of the globe. It has only been recently that even the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons have removed disabilities and burdens which former generations had imposed upon this unfortunate people. But while this persecution is now going on in other countries, a sympathetic press in America is protesting against inflicting such ill-treatment upon a people simply because they have a different belief from the dominant cult, and persistence enough to stick to it.

It is gratifying, indeed, to see such journals as the Mail and Express and Voice, of this city, and other papers that are clamoring for religious legislation in this country, deploring the effects of religious legislation in other countries. It will materially aid their readers in seeing the actual consequences of their desired legislation.

The following from the pen of Cardinal Gibbons, published in the Jewish Exponent, on December 19, 1890, and reprinted in the Boston Pilot, December 27, 1890, expresses the sympathy which many at this time claim for the Jewish people:—

Every friend of humanity must deplore the systematic persecution of the Jews in Russia. For my part, I can not well conceive how Christians can entertain other than kind sentiments toward the Hebrew race, when I consider how much we are indebted to them. We have from them the inspired volume of the Old Testament, which has been the consolation in all ages to devout souls, Christ, our Lord, the Founder of our religion, his blessed mother, as well as the apostles, were all Jews according to the flesh. These facts attach me strongly to the Jewish race. I am, yours very sincerely,

JAMES, CARDINAL GIBBONS.

In an interview with a representative of the Exponent the Cardinal said further:—

Long experience has shown that no race or people can be exterminated by persecution; and systematic grinding down, called persecution, as practiced by some nations, has often reacted upon themselves. As opposed to this unfair treatment, the United States furnishes the world with the most beautiful example of religious toleration, by giving the amplest liberty to all, without interfering with any creed. If any individuals of the Hebrew race commit an offense against society or morality in Russia, they should be dealt with according to the law of the country, and the code of laws of all civilized governments ought to be sufficient to protect their people without such drastic remedies as the exterminating process.

The Jews generally have acquired the reputation of being good husbands and devoted fathers, faithful to their domestic duties; and so the charges against their morality can not be true.

I express the ardent hope that all nations, through their governments, will become more and more tolerant in matters of religion, just as we are in this country; that they will take these United States as their guide, where all men standing equal in the sight of God, are equal before the law. They must remember it is not by coercion that men are converted, but by an appeal to their consciences.

Such liberal principles are commendable. But we have the inconsistent Sunday-law advocates here—of whom Cardinal Gibbons is one in a mild way—who deplore the hardships of the Jews in Russia, but work day and night to have laws passed in this country by which the poor Hebrew fleeing from persecution in that intolerant country may be thrown into jail here on account of religion as soon as he arrives. The Russians are an intolerant people, virtually say the Sunday-law advocates, for persecuting the Jews just because they do not conform to the religious views of the Russian people. But after these same Jews have come over to America they change their tone, and practically say: "If those unregenerate Jews do not keep Sunday and stop undermining our Christian institutions, they will have to take the consequences, that's all"; and off to jail the Sabbatarian is marched for violating our Sunday laws. Thus are these unfortunate people punished for their religion, even in America. Judge Cooley notices this point in Constitutional Limitations:—

But the Jew [and it is equally true of all Sabbatarians] who is forced to respect the first day of the week, when his conscience requires of him the observance of the seventh also, may plausibly urge that the law discriminates against his religion, and by forcing him to keep a second Sabbath in each week, unjustly, though by indirection, punishes him for his belief.—Constitutional Limitations, page 476.

There was no point better understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution than that it placed all on an equality before the law—that it insured to the Jews every privilege and immunity that it secured to the Christian. Evidence supporting this assertion can be drawn from the statements of both the enemies and friends of the Constitution—both from those who opposed our secular form of government and from those who advocated it.

Mr. Caldwell of North Carolina, stood prominently among those who opposed the Constitution from this standpoint. "Mr. Caldwell," says Elliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution "thought that some danger might arise. He imagined it might be objected to in a political as well as in a religious view. In the first place, he said, there was an invitation for Jews and pagans of every kind to come among us. . . . I think, then, added he that, in a political view those gentlemen who formed this Constitution should not have given this invitation to Jews and heathens."—Volume IV., page 199.

Madison asserted this point even much more emphatically. In a letter to Dr. De La Motta a Jewish Rabbi, dated Montpelier, August, 1820, he said:—

The history of the Jews must forever be interesting. The modern part of it is, at the same time, so little generally known, that every ray of light on the subject has its value.

Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights which it secures to every religious sect and it is particularly pleasing to observe in the good citizenship of such as have been most distrusted and oppressed elsewhere a happy illustration of the safety and success of this experiment of a just and benignant policy. Equal laws protecting equal rights, are found, as they ought to be presumed, the best guarantee of loyalty and love of country; as well as best calculated to cherish that mutual respect and good-will among citizens of every religious denomination which are necessary to social harmony, and most favorable to the advancement of truth.

From these quotations it is evident that these Sunday-law advocates are not only unjust in making and enforcing Sunday laws, but at the same time they are trampling American principles and the American Constitution in the dust. And while they express their sympathy for the Jews of Russia they go on with their endeavors to persecute the Jews of America just the same. Sometimes here as in Russia this spirit grows much more intense than at other times; but in the Sunday "reform" agitation it is nearly always quite prominent. As an illustration of the extent to which these Christian divines of America go, I quote the following from Dr. Jonathan Edwards's speech in a New York City Convention in 1873:—

Our objectors, then, may learn [when the "reform" measures are obtained] that they are merely a body of men who are in their turn feeling the inconvenience of dissent.

The atheist is the man who denies the existence of a God and a future life. To him mind and matter are the same, and time is the be-all and end-all of consciousness and of character.

The deist admits God, but denies that he has any personal control over human affairs as we call providence, or that he ever manifests himself or his will in a revelation.

The Jew admits God, providence, and revelation, but rejects the entire scheme of gospel redemption by Jesus Christ as sheer imagination, or—worse—sheer imposture.

The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are conjoined with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day shall be observed as holy.

These all are for the occasion, and as far as our amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. They must be counted together, which we very much regret, but which we can not help. . . . They must be named from him [the atheist]; they must be treated as, for this question, one party. . . . What are the rights of the atheist? I would tolerate him as I would tolerate a poor lunatic; for in my view his mind is scarcely sound. So long as he does not rave, so long as he is not dangerous, I would tolerate him. I would tolerate him as I would a conspirator. The atheist is a dangerous man. . . . Tolerate atheism, sir? There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate as soon. The atheist may live, as I said, but, God helping me, the taint of his destructive creed shall not defile any of the civil institutions of all this fair land! Let us repeat, atheism and Christianity are contradictory terms. They are incompatible systems. They can not dwell together on the same continent.

This is the modern doctrine of some of the professed followers of him who said: "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." In their zeal to make this a "Christian Government," they forget that it is now much more Christian than it would be if it should undertake to enforce the Christian religion and Christian morality.

The Jews have always been more tolerant than the other nationalities of the same age. Even of the wicked kings of Israel, when the most wicked of them was reigning, the servants of Ben-hadad the Samaritan king said unto him, "Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings." Their fame had gone abroad to the surrounding nations on account of their tolerance even in that barbarous age. It has often happened, however, that the most tolerant and inoffensive persons have been treated most intolerantly. The history of the Quakers in this country, a number of whom were hanged on account of their religion, is an illustration. The California Sunday case, ex parte Newman, 9 California Reports, 502, is one of the cases of the arrest of Jews in this country, for working on Sunday (in this case keeping open a dry goods store). When the case came before the Supreme Court the Chief Justice rightly argued as follows:—

Now, does our Constitution, when it forbids discrimination, or preference, in religion, mean merely to guarantee toleration? For that, in effect, is all which the case cited [8 Barr 313 and 2 Stoedhart, 508] seems to award, as the right of a citizen. In a community composed of persons of various denominations, having different days of worship, each considering his own as sacred from secular employment, all being equally considered and protected under the Constitution, a law is passed which in effect recognizes the sacred character of one of these days, by compelling all others to abstain from secular employment, which is precisely one of the modes in which its observance is manifested, and required by the creed of that sect to which it belongs as a Sabbath. Is not this a discrimination in favor of the one? Does it require more than an appeal to one's common sense to decide that this is a preference? And when the Jew or seventh-day Christian complains of this, is it any answer to say, "Your conscience is not constrained, you are not compelled to worship or to perform religious rites on that day, nor forbidden to keep holy the day which you esteem as a Sabbath?" We think not, however high the authority which decides otherwise.

The truth is, however much it may be disguised, that this one day of rest is a purely religious idea. Derived from the Sabbatical institutions of the ancient Hebrew, it has been adopted into all creeds of succeeding religious sects, throughout the civilized world; and whether it be the Friday of the Mohammedan, the Saturday of the Israelite, or the Sunday of the Christian, it is alike fixed in the affections of its followers, beyond the power of eradication; and in most of the States of our confederacy the aid of the law to enforce its observance has been given, under the pretense of a civil, municipal, or police regulation.

Mr. Justice Burnett also wrote a well-reasoned opinion concurring with the Chief Justice in his decision. Yet notwithstanding the flagrant violation of justice and religious liberty by fining and imprisoning the Jew for engaging in perfectly legitimate work on the day that some one else considers as sacred, these Sunday-law advocates go on clamoring for new and more stringent Sunday laws, and enforce, against Sabbatarians, to the furthest extent within their power, those old Church-and-State Sunday laws that yet remain upon the statute books of so many of the States of this Union.
