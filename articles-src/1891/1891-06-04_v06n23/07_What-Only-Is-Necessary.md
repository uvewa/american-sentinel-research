## What Only Is Necessary.

"week day." Is this ignorance? Or prejudice? Or what? It certainly is not nothing.

If people who have gone into the picture galleries on the Continent on Sundays will need to be reminded of the number of working people to be met there—many of them in their unmistakable blouse. In the East end of London, where are art gallery, the gift of Mr. Watts, Mr. Rennie-Jones, and Sir Frederick Leighton, recently been opened, a crowd of working people is habitually to be found on Sundays. The Art Museum in Boston has been open on Sunday afternoons for the past fifteen years and the President declares that "most of the visitors on that day (Sunday) are persons whom compulsions would prevent their going on week days. When I go in on Sunday afternoons I always find in the rooms a large number of quietly, orderly, bright appearing persons. Their behavior have never occasioned any complaint."

Philip Brocas, referring to the opening of the Museum, says: "I should not hesitate, if I were asked the question, in saying that I believe it to be good to have museums opened on Sunday after noon." It may be added that the opening of the Art Museum in Boston has not been followed by the opening of places of business.

"For the well-to-do who have their libraries and their picture galleries at home that it necessary to veil the pictures and turn the key on the bookcase in order to preserve the sacredness of the Sabbath?"—*Christian Union.*

Not without candor would I wish to imply incautiousness to the conduct of ministers engaged in so-called National Reform work. It is too grave a matter to be brought against those who in the name of things should have our greatest love and respect, charging as they do between the living and the dead.

But without making, at this time, all things due to specify for things in the doctrine and actions of ministers active in National Reform, and one must earnestly how they may be reconciled.

We are taught that men are saved, if at all, by faith. We have little work after work to this statement. No one of these think of preceding it any other way, he holds it has become a thing scientifically accepted by clergy and laymen. Yet if men are saved by faith what only is necessary? Let to give them a chance to believe? If you are logical, and stick to the text, pay you, dare you, do, more than to tell this truth should as to regular man? Those who believe it, well for them. Those who do not what more can be done for them? If you have shown them the great love of God toward man as manifested and explained in Christ, and they [page 181] fail to be moved to accept such a loveable thing as salvation, is there any other way to save? If they do not believe what you have said how shall they be saved? Is it fair then to it that told that where Bibles and churches are had, that some have not had an opportunity to believe? Will they have more opportunity to hear the story when the National Reform plan is in operation? Does not the awful fact come here that men have heard but not believed nor acted upon this truth? And this terrible state of things is supposed to constitute the necessity of a reform not in the hearts and consciences of individuals but the national head. But if it is right to preach the gospel to every creature, and "he that believeth shall be saved," is it not wrong to go further than that, and effect organization using other means than teaching, or are two methods needed both right? If the latter is true why is an irrelevant given at it is the means of grace?

Again, you preach from the text, and, if it be lifted up, will draw all men unto me. None of you ever explain this any other way than that Jesus lifted up on the cross would draw all classes of men to him by the amazing tenderness of love and pity shown in a man suffering death to save them. If this love ever failed to longer touch the hearts of the multitude, or the sovereign of the dying one could no more or eight not weep over such degradation of all lovely and beautiful thoughts that ever were moved to dwell in the human frame? If the hearts that should be flesh are turned to stone, and no longer grow warm and brave and then break with looking and believing in the sacrifices of their elder brother, how is the remedy to be sought in the making and enforcement of law for the conduct of moral image of stone, however much of a gold it may become?

If we have the freedom paths marked by Christ and his company to follow them required by them we may fear that something is radically wrong. We see in a great and powerful national government things that appeal to the selfishness of man. The politics, the power, the glory, the delusive temporal benefits are all a part of it. Should not such things make us afraid? Here are two hallucinations at danger ahead. First, this political combination is not and is all like the manner of Christ or his apostles. Second, it has within it the elements of selfishness, which is a possible may be the actuating principle. Here are a matter of stating it becomes necessary to be cautious lest it is wrong, as the example of this religious seeking to be perpetuated is precisely the manner now employed. What can but feel a thrill of indignation that any one with the pages of history before him could propose such a thing? No matter with what outward variations or prestige of promoters the place-seekers, it is the same that has made the past red with blood.
