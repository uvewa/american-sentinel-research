"The General Assembly," remarks Mr. Shepard's paper "unanimously adopted the resolution prepared by the Committee on Sabbath Observance; so now the whole force of the Presbyterian Church is behind the request that the Commissioners and Directors of the Chicago Fair shall decide immediately to close the doors of the Exposition on Sundays and shall announce their decision. This matter ought to be decided right, and it ought to be decided at once."
