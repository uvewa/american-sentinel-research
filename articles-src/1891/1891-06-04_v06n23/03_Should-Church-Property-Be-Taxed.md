## Should Church Property Be Taxed?

I MEAN this as a question of principle—a question of right or wrong—and not a matter of expediency or inappropriateness. The sacrifice the adoption of the principle might entail should have no place in the discussion of the principle itself. We should not allow the judgment to be swayed in any degree by the passion of self-interest in the consideration of the question. It is solely a question of logic linking itself to divine revelation, and not a question of sentiment or feeling.

A principle of the gospel ought not to be reversed as a policy. "Buy the truth, and sell it not" for the whole world. Truth to be true to those who know religious principle, than life itself. The principles of Church teaching have too much to be sold out by the lay when they have been securely committed, at any price.

We need not complicate the discussion of this question with multitude and heterogeneousness of assessment and taxation. . . . That is a matter entirely of the State, and with which the Church as such has nothing to do.

Nor is it proper to regard the taxation of church property as a tax upon religion. It is a question solely of property. The church property belongs to the Lord no more than every dollar's worth of property in the stewardship of the individual Christian. Years ago a church purchased ground and built the edifice. The value of property has increased enormously in the locality. The church property has [page 178] not been assessed for the general taxation. The church now sells the property and buys land an immense sum, which builds a shelter for investment. Any proposed tax law, that property would have been around the cry of "a tax on religion." If the taxation of that property is a tax on religion, is there any escape from the conclusion that the enormous increase in value in the direct product of religion? If, in spite of the religious use made of the property, it goes up and has the adjoining property in its neighborhood increased in proportion, in value, in its fairness, in spite of the religious use to which it is put. The property used for purposes of worship is essentially a different thing; the enjoyment of the use of property concerns the surrounding community. Then paying the taxes is not paying for their share of what is received by any community of the use of the property. It costs actually something to secure the maintenance, the sheltering and protection it enjoys in the use of the property. If this is not paid by the Church, it must be paid by somebody else. Taxes are for the general are paid, and not to the Church. They are distributed among the people as interests in the community. If there is anything in the cry of "tax on religion," the tax is even now come the less on religion; the only difference is, that the irreligious are compelled to stand it.

Some will say, these taxes ought, I fancy I hear the advocates of exemption say, "they ought to be Religious tax payers pay."

It needs to be clearly understood that equitable taxation is no penalty on the possession of property. It is doubtful if any man living has a real understanding of the principle of taxation than Mr. Justice Cooley. He says:—

[page 179] or religion? The theology that would not rather pay an imposition tax than go begging and demanding of the world, the flesh, and the devil, to pay it, ought to be hooted out of the world. A church may become the object of the dearest efforts of the world by the unworthy methods of financial support it resorts to.

Yet further, the moral benefit argument has no force in support of the theory of exemption. Churches ought to be free from taxation, we are told, because of the healthful moral influence they are exerting in the community. They are claimed to be a great moral police force. The unapostolic blundering of the theology of Christ in a community can not be disputed. But what on earth is a true church of Christ in a community if it is not to make that community better? But whatever every institution that calls itself a church is a blessing to the community is very open to dispute. In general, if the basis of exemption be the benefit to the community, the question whether it is a benefit or not? What in fact, and who is, to fix the standard by which its value to the community is determined? It will be necessary to have a moral appraising commission appointed by the bishop.

But to inquire into the principles of this theory. The State ought to pay for the Church on the grounds that this—the Church is doing the State. Where will this principle lead us? Is its value to the State fully compensated by its exemption from taxation? If not, then, in accord with the incomplete principle, is not the Church in a position to press its demands on a cash payment of the balance in our judgment, at least, full compensation to a genuine Christian Church would pass the entire support by the State. Adopting the principle there is no logical halting-place short of this, and accepting the support of the State, we must logically accept the authority of the State over the Church. It is practically the argument by which the State church has always been defended.

Its situation is beneficial to the world, the church authorized to seek financial compensation? Is the Church honoring either herself or her Master in allowing herself to be placed in the position of a huckster of good to the public at the rate of so much as a dollar's worth of her property? Did the Master: "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature;" if the State will reimburse you for the good you do the community, by compelling the community to pay the taxes on your church property? Did he say, "It's too much to expect you to build steeple temples as necessary to point souls to heaven, to put in your roasting gentle singles without that cost $65,000, so essential to the holy enjoyment of 'dim religious light;' to hang magnificent bronze doors that cost $10,000, to [page 179] keep out the miserable uncultured sinners who do not know how to appreciate your high and holy religion;"—and pay your own taxes,—if the State will write the taxes on this property out of its taxpayers and thus compensate you in some small measure for good you are doing us.

But Christ accepted exemption in a way that no Christian should, when the Master said, "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."—*Rev. A. F. McDiarmid, before the Baptists of Rochester Conference.*
