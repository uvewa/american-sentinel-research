A MOVEMENT is on foot in Washington to open the Smithsonian Institute, the National Museum, the Congressional Library, and the Corcoran Art Gallery on Sunday. The Washington Post has been publishing the views of different leading men upon the question. "The diversity of these views and the manner in which they have been expressed," says the Post, "show that people are thinking seriously on this subject and their publication naturally results in more light being offered by those who were not originally approached on the subject. Even among clergymen there is no uniform opinion, as some favor the opening at least on an afternoon, while others are opposed to any kind of opening."
