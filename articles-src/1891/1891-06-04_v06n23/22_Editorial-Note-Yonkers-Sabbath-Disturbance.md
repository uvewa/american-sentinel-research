THE following is from Col. Elliott F. Shepard's paper, the Mail and Express:—

The Sunday quiet of Yonkers was disturbed yesterday. Drums were beating and flags were waving, and men were parading through its streets from shortly before noon until long after nightfall. Thousands of people were there to cheer them on. Yonkers was simply flooded by an unwelcome crowd. All this was because the corner stone of a Roman Catholic seminary, the object of which is ostensibly to train men in the ministry of holy things, was to be laid. It began with breaking the Sabbath. It ended with it, too.

This only shows the real animus of the American Sabbath Union, whose president Colonel Shepard is: it not only demands that Sunday shall be observed but it would assume to say how it shall be observed. We have no more sympathy with Roman Catholics than has the American Sabbath Union, but we do maintain that they have a perfect right to do upon Sunday anything that they might properly do upon any other day.
