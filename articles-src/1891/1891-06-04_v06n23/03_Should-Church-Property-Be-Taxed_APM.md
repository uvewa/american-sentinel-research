I REGARD this a question of principle—a question of right or wrong,—and not a matter of expediency or inexpediency. The sacrifice the adoption of the principle might entail should have no place in the discussion of the principle itself. We should not allow the judgment to be swayed in any degree by the passion of self-interest in the consideration of the question. It is solely a question of logic linking itself to divine revelation, and not a question of sentiment or feeling. . . . A principle of the gospel ought not to be sacrificed at any price. "Buy the truth, and sell it not" for the whole world. Truth ought to be dearer than money; religious principle, than life itself. . . . The principles of Christ's teaching have cost too much to be sold out by us, to whom they have been sacredly committed, at any price.

We need not complicate the discussion of this question with methods and theories of assessment and taxation. . . . That is a matter entirely of the State, and with which the Church as such has nothing to do.

Nor is it proper to regard the taxation of church property as a tax upon religion. It is a question solely of property. The church property belongs to the Lord no more than every dollar's worth of property in the stewardship of the individual Christian. Years ago a church purchased ground and built its edifice. The value of property has increased enormously in the locality. The church property has not been assessed for the general taxation. The church now sells the property and has made an immense sum, which it takes elsewhere for investment. Any proposition to tax that property would have aroused the cry of "a tax on religion." If the taxation of that property is a tax on religion, is there any escape from the conclusion that the enormous increase in its value is the direct product of religion? If, in spite of the religious use made of the property, it goes on just as the irreligious property in its neighborhood increasing in value, then, in all fairness, in spite of the religious use to which it is put, it ought to pay its equitable share of the general taxation, without any sanctimonious whining that some financial consideration is due to its peculiar piety.

Religion antedates church property. The Christian religion and the Christian church had place in the world before it possessed a foot of church property, or a stick for a church edifice. To have taxed it for its existence in the world would have been a tax on religion. But the taxation of the property it uses for the purposes of worship is essentially a different thing. The enjoyment of the use of property costs the community something. The church paying the taxes is but paying its fair share of what it costs to secure its enjoyment of the use of the property. It costs somebody something to secure to the Church the advantages and protection it enjoys in the use of its property. If this is not paid by the Church it must be paid by somebody else. Taxes on church property are paid, but not by the Church. They are distributed among the other property owners in the community. If there is anything in the cry of "tax on religion," the tax is even now none the less on religion; the only difference is, that the irreligious are compelled to assist in paying it. "Serves them right," I fancy I hear the advocates of exemption say, "they ought to be religious; let them pay the penalty."

It ought to be clearly understood that equitable taxation is no penalty on the possession of property. It is doubtful if any man living has a better understanding of the principle of taxation than Mr. Gladstone. Not to speak of his eminent ability and long experience in public life, he had, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, at various times, to make a most careful study of the whole subject. He declares the "sound general principle that all property ought to contribute to the taxes of the country, which, if they are justly and wisely imposed, ought not to be regarded as penalties on the possession of property, but as the necessary means of rendering property available for the effective use and enjoyment of the owner." A clear apprehension of the object of taxation will relieve any troubled mind of its distress at the thought of the taxation of religion.

And what, by the way, if it were a tax on religion? The religion that would not rather pay an imposed tax than go begging and demanding aid of the world, the flesh, and the devil, to pay it, ought to be hooted out of the world. A church may become the object of the deserved scorn of the world by the unworthy methods of financial support it resorts to.

Yet further, the moral benefit argument has no force in support of the theory of exemptions. Churches ought to be free from taxation, we are told, because of the healthful moral influence they are exerting in the community. They are claimed to be a great moral police force. The unspeakable blessing of the true religion of Christ in a community can not be disputed. But what on earth is a true church of Christ in a community for if it is not to make that community better? But whether every institution that calls itself a church is a blessing to the community is very decidedly open to dispute. If then the basis of exemption be the benefit to the community, who is to decide whether it is a benefit or not? What is, and who is, to fix the standard by which its value to the community is determined? It will be necessary to have a moral appraising commission appointed by the State.

But let us inquire into the principle of this theory. The State ought to pay the Church something for the benefit the Church is doing the State. Where will this principle lead us? Is its value to the State fully compensated by its exemption from taxation? If not, then in accord with the recognized principle, is not the Church in a position to press its demands for a cash payment of the balance? In our judgment, at least, full compensation to a genuine Christian Church would be no less than its entire support by the State. Adopting the principle there is no logical halting-place short of this, and accepting the support of the State, we must logically accept the authority of the State over the Church. It is practically the argument by which the State church has always been defended.

In its mission to benefit the world, is the Church authorized to seek financial compensation? Is the Church honoring either herself or her Master in allowing herself to be placed in the position of a huckster of good to the public at the rate of so much on a dollar's worth of her property? Did the Master say, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature," if the State will compensate you for the good you do the community, by compelling the community to pay the taxes on your church property? Did he say, "It's too much to expect you to build sky-piercing steeples so necessary to point souls to heaven, to put in your meeting-house single windows that cost $50,000, so essential to the holy enjoyment of 'dim religious light,' to hang magnificent bronze doors that cost $100,000, to keep out the miserable uncultured sinners who do not know how to appreciate your high and lofty religion,—and pay your taxes also,—if the State will wring the taxes on this property out of the taxpayers and thus compensate you in some small measure for the good you are doing, 'go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature'?" If we are not in the world to do the world good without compensation wrung from taxpayers, I frankly confess I do not understand the gospel commission. "The gift of God" is not to be "purchased with money," nor sold for money. But the Church to-day, Gehazi-like, is saying, "My Master has spared this Syrian" (taxpayer) in taking nothing at his hands for the benefit done him, "but as the Lord liveth, I will run after him and take somewhat of him." Did Christ accept exemption in any measure when paying the awful price by which the world enjoys the unspeakable blessing of Christianity? When the world offered its opiate to exempt him from the full measure of suffering he declined the exemption. We try to make it as easy as we can for ourselves, and that in the matter under consideration at the cost of principle, forgetting that the Master has said, "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."—Rev. A. P. McDiarmid, before the New York Baptist Ministers' Conference.
