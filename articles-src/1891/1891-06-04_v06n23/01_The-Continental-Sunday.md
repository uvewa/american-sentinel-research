## The Continental Sunday.

As noted in these columns last week, the opening, on Sunday, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city has been fully decided upon. This action was bitterly opposed by a large number of people on the ground that it would be a long step toward the introduction of the Continental Sunday in New York. The *Sun* of Sunday, speaking of a "museum," said that, "if it is justified as profitable for the instruction and amusement of the public, the opening of all places for public recreation may be demanded and defended for the same reason."

But this the *Sun* remarks—

> Unquestionably it is a sound argument. The question for the community is whether it wants to draw a moral distinction between the situation of the public in libraries, reading rooms, picture galleries, and museums, and their admission to "places of the sporting kind;" but as both are for recreation, let us consider only the Continental basis on the whole question of relaxation. Whether the exhibition is free or not makes no difference so far as concerns the moral question involved. If it is admissible to offer the people the hospitalities of a public establishment of a kind from which the vicious is excluded, the museum for example, it is admissible to allow all similar places to be open for entertainment, since the same demand to which they minister exists every Sunday.

[page 177] that the decision to open the museum on Sunday "accelerates the progress" of the Continental Sunday in New York. This, however, the *Sun* does not regard as a source of regret; on the contrary. The "Continental Sunday is simply liberty for the people to do, upon Sunday, as it seems to them good; if they choose to devote the day to religion, well and good; but if they elect to spend it in some other manner in their business, so long as they do not interfere with the rights of others."

But it is urged by Sunday law advocates everywhere, that Sunday keeping elevates the people who keep it. This is a mistake; it is the people who make the day whatever it is in any country. The difference between Sunday in London and in Paris is simply the difference between the people in those cities, and no amount of law could make it otherwise. Law may restrain the vicious, but it has no power to elevate the immoral, and it is utterly useless for governments to undertake the task. The people must work out their own moral salvation independent of civil government.

Again, the truth of the proposition that it is the people and not the laws that give character to Sunday in every place, is shown by the fact that in every European country, except France, Sunday is by law recognized as a sacred day, and the protection of civil law is thrown around it. It is only, however, as well in those places, where the people voluntarily observe it religiously, that it is a day of religious character.
