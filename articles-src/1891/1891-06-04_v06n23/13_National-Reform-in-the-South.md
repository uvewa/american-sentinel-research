We commend to the special attention of those who think National Reform never can amount to anything, the following from a minister in Graysville, Tennessee:

The National Reform idea is growing rapidly throughout the entire South. Sam Jones has been in Chattanooga (thirty miles south of here) for two weeks past, and has stirred the city wonderfully on the subject of Sunday laws. On the last night of his services, at the mention, by him, of a "Law and Order League" to take Sunday desecration in hand, one thousand men were on their feet at once expressing their willingness to join the organization. Hats were thrown in the air, people shouted at the top of their voices, and the wildest enthusiasm prevailed. I tell you the devil is getting things ripe for the final assault upon liberty of conscience, and I believe that Chattanooga, the "gateway of the South" will be an important point from which the forces will radiate, the same as they did during the memorable struggles of the civil war.

The Chattanooga Daily News, of May 22, also says:—

The amount of enthusiasm Sam Jones created in Chattanooga can best be judged by a little incident. Yesterday a prominent young citizen, heretofore by no means noted for his godliness, stopped a News man and said: "Third party, democrats or what not, I believe this country would be a thousand times better off if Sam Jones was president. A vigorous moral reform administration like unto what his would be would prove the salvation of the country. And I believe if he could be induced to run, he would be elected." And he seemed to be in earnest.
