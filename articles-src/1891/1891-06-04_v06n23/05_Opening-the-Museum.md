It may be said that the question of opening the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (decided, experimentally at least in the affirmative by the Directors last week) is not altogether an easy question, if, as we believe in the case, some of the funds were given to the Trustees on the condition, expressed or implied, that the Museum should not be opened on Sunday. But the larger question whether art museums and libraries shall be closed to the working people on the only day on which many of them can possibly get access to such museums and libraries, seems to us more and more not a question at all, if looked at, not in the light of Puritan prejudice, but of New Testament teaching.

One of our contemporaries makes the remarkable statement respecting such Sunday opening that "whenever a library or a reading-room or an art gallery has been opened on Sunday, few, if any, have been found in it who could not have gone on a week day." Is this ignorance? Or prejudice? Or what? It certainly is not accuracy.

Few people who have gone into the picture galleries on the Continent on Sundays will need to be reminded of the number of working people to be seen there—many of them in their unmistakable blouses. In the East end of London, where an art gallery, the gift of Mr. Watts, Mr. Burne-Jones, and Sir Frederick Leighton, has recently been opened, a crowd of working people is habitually to be found there on Sundays. The Art Museum in Boston has been open on Sunday afternoons for the past fifteen years, and the President declares that "most of the visitors on that day (Sunday) are persons whose occupations would prevent their going on week days. When I go in on Sunday afternoons I always find in the rooms a large number of quiet, orderly, and interested persons. Their behavior has never occasioned any complaint." Phillips Brooks, referring to the opening of this Museum, says: "I should not hesitate, if I were asked the question, to say that I believe it is good to have an art museum opened on Sunday afternoons." It may be added that the opening of the Art Museum in Boston has not been followed by the opening of places of business.

Do the well-to-do who have their libraries and their picture galleries at home find it necessary to veil the pictures and turn the key on the bookcases in order to preserve the sacredness of the Sabbath?
