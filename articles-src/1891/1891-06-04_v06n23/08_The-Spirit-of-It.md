## The Spirit of It.

THE *Smoking Advocate* admittedly referring to Seventh-day Adventists, says that "twenty-nine tenths or one per cent," who believes in keeping Saturday, and argues that the smallness of this minority religion is to do a law compelling the observance of Sunday.

But it continues: "What difference does it make if it make a few so that are important if they don't such think it. I mean the Bible the same as the Constitution Church right to go to it."

We recommend this done, taken as often, and as long as necessary for . . . under the supposition that there is in . . . right in this instance to this extreme if it is cautioned it had the root. Such a supposition in an extreme case or a complete falsehood. An American whom his religion is as willing is as good as any. Yes, let them go to fall if they don't believe as the majority believe. That is already obviously a measure. It was the have to State take hold of religion, the people the State shall support it, and for the incomplete execution. It was the clear sight of this inevitable consequences that caused the Fathers of the Protestant principle to repudiate the practice of it and form a Government by which this principle should be made the basis principle of action.

Who shall be able in a fitting manner to lament the day when the fairest among the nations, the one cause cannot be luring her foundation stone in the broad basis of truth, and sounding an impulse of nations from on high lightly, shall so far forget her God as to take us to her fold? Who would not much rather rely on the aura of truth and of Him who seeketh the living shall rest at the World as it is in Samaria, than to go with a multitude to do that which is wrong? We will stand by Truth even, when she is about to retire from the field apparently defeated by the powerful, for to prove who are her loyal friends.
