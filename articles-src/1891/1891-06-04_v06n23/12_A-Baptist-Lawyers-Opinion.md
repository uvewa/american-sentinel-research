The following letter from a Baptist lawyer of Columbia, North Carolina, was recently received by one of our Religious Liberty workers in Chicago:—

Your printed communication of the 13th ult. came to hand by due course of mail, but it having been mislaid because of the pressure of business, it escaped my attention till to-day. During the few months I have been the recipient of your kindness in sending me THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, I have been an attentive and appreciative reader of it, and I commend the paper equally as much as I condemn the conditions which called it into existence. Of all the questions which are to-day engaging the attention of the thinking people of this country, I consider that there is none of such vital importance to the people as the preservation of civil and religious liberty,—those liberties for the exercise of which our ancestors left home, friends, property, in fact all that could be near and dear to them, and sought out these savage shores, and founded here (as they supposed) a home for all who desired to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and in the exercise of this liberty and others, untrammeled by pseudo-religionists, and earthly potentates. The idea that we, their descendants, are on the eve of cutting loose from the safe moorings of the past, would seem both absurd and ridiculous, did not the stern facts of Sunday conspirators attest the truth of that idea.

It occurs to me that the surest guarantee of the perpetuity of our Republic in the past has been the alienation of the Church and State, and its existence as a Republic has been endangered in that degree to which they have approached to a union in the past, and will be endangered in the same degree in the years to come. Talk about the Government throwing its mantle of protection around the Church! Tie as well for God to beg alms of the devil—equally as absurd. Let the Government once try the experiment, and it will be found that the mantle of protection will assume a different role, and prove the means of stifling the civil power, and bigotry will rule supreme, and all churches and all denominations will bow to the church in power, or lose their heads for disobedience.

I belong to that denomination known as the Baptist, and wish to enjoy in common with all people those liberties which were secured at the cost of burnings, persecutions, and death from the hands of those who believed in a junction of Church and State. I candidly admit that I was ignorant of the magnitude of the effort now being made by the so-called reformers to secure the enactment of State and federal legislation, which, if accomplished, could only bring disaster. I repeat, I have been an attentive reader, and the lessons I have learned I consider invaluable. I wish THE AMERICAN SENTINEL much prosperity, and I am sure its mission will not be accomplished until it has brought every moider of thought and every thinker to a due appreciation of the dangers which are assailing them.

Humbly but truly yours in your effort for reformation of public sentiment, I am, ————
