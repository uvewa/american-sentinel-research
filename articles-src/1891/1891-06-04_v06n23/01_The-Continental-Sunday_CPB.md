As noted in these columns last week, the opening, on Sunday, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city has been fully decided upon. This action was bitterly opposed by a large number of people on the ground that it would be a long step toward the introduction of the Continental Sunday into New York. "If Sunday opening of a museum," said they, "is justified as profitable for the instruction and amusement of the public, the opening of all places for public recreation may be demanded and defended for the same reason."

Upon this the Sun remarks:

Unquestionably it is a sound argument. The petitioners for the opening of the museum undertook to draw a moral distinction between the admittance of the public to libraries, reading-rooms, picture galleries, and museums, and their admission to "places of the paying kind;" but no such distinction exists. Whether the exhibition is free or not makes no difference so far as concerns the moral questions involved. If it is undesirable to offer the people the temptation of public amusement on Sunday, the case is made the worse when the exhibition is free, for vastly more of them will visit the show. If the methods of Sunday observance to which we have been accustomed are salutary, and can not be changed generally without injury to the public welfare, the damage done will be more rather than less if the innovation is started by an institution like the Metropolitan Museum and at the demand of thirty thousand intelligent and influential citizens, including many and prominent clergymen.

The conclusion arrived at by the Sun is, that the decision to open the museum on Sunday "accelerates the progress of the Continental Sunday in New York." This, however, the Sun does not regard as a source of regret; no more do we. The "Continental Sunday" is simply liberty for the people to do, upon Sunday, as seemeth to them good; if they choose to devote the day to religion, well and good; but if they elect to spend it in some other manner that is their business, so long as they do not interfere with the rights of others.

But it is urged by Sunday-law advocates everywhere, that Sunday keeping elevates the people who keep it. This is a mistake; it is the people who make the day whatever it is in any country. The difference between Sunday in London and in Paris is simply the difference between the people in those cities, and no amount of law could make it otherwise. Law may restrain the vicious, but it has no power to elevate the immoral, and it is utterly useless for governments to undertake the task. The people must work out their own moral salvation independent of civil government.

Again, the truth of the proposition that it is the people and not the laws that give character to Sunday in every place, is shown by the fact that in every European country, except France, Sunday is by law recognized as a sacred day, and the protection of civil law is thrown around it. It is not, however, observed as well as people voluntarily observe it elsewhere. Yet men here plead for Sunday laws to preserve us from the "Continental Sunday!" If the so-called Christian governments and Christian rulers of Europe have failed to either make or keep the people Christian by civil law, is it reasonable to expect any better results in this country? Would it not be altogether better to attempt nothing of the kind, and to leave all questions of religious faith and practice to the churches and to individuals? It is a fact that a majority of people are, from choice, idle upon Sunday. It has long been a custom to regard that day as a sort of holiday. The only thing government can justly do is to see to it that upon this day the equal rights of all are preserved the same as upon other days. The government can not justly do upon that day anything that it could not do upon any other day of general abstinence from labor; it can simply adapt itself to the conditions as they exist upon that day, and leave the people free to spend its hours as they please.

So-called rulers are simply the servants of the people; and parks and museums belong to the people. It follows that if the people wish to resort to these places upon Sunday, it is entirely out of place for those who have charge of them for the people, to say that they shall not use them upon that day—the only day that many have an opportunity to resort to such places.

The idea that governments, national, State, and municipal, must close up this and that and the other avenue of pleasure or recreation on Sunday or else be guilty of rebellion against the law of God, is most mischievous. To admit the principle is to admit all that is claimed by the National Reform theorists. But we can never consent that religion should be made a question of majorities; that the Nation might be infidel to-day and Christian to-morrow, simply by act of Congress or even by vote of the people. If the introduction of the Continental Sunday will tend, in any degree, to disabuse the minds of certain reform theorists of the idea, that the State is the proper custodian of the morals and religion of the people, it would certainly confer a lasting benefit upon the country, and especially upon the cause of true piety. It is a mistake to suppose that the State can pluck the thorns from the pathway of Christians and send them to the kingdom "on flowery beds of ease," or that it ought to do so if it could.
