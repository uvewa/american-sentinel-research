### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible, *and in the separation of the civil government from religion.*

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We believe that the legislation upon religious questions is an invasion of the rights of each individual.

We believe that human government was ordained of God to protect men in the enjoyment of their natural rights and to rule in civil things, and that in this realm it is entitled to the respectful obedience of all.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience; that all religious legislation is a violation of the rights of each individual.

We regard it as an error to unite religion and civil government, and hold that this union of Church and State is the "mystery of iniquity" spoken of in the New Testament.

We therefore enter our solemn protest against any movement, either by individuals or by organized bodies, that tends to unite church and state in the enforcement of morals and religion, and in support of any religious observance.

C. ELDRIDGE, *President.*

A. F. BALLENGER, *Secretary.*
