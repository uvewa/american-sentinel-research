## Injustices to the Jews.

ALMOST every mail brings to us news of repeated injustices to the Jews of Russia, with now and then the item concerning similar treatment elsewhere. An account of their religious views they have been persecuted by almost every civilized government on the face of the globe. It has only been recently that even the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons have removed religious disabilities and hardships which former generations had imposed upon this unfortunate people. But while this persecution is now going on in other countries, a sympathetic press in America is protesting against inflicting such ill treatment upon a people simply because they have a different belief from the dominant cult, and persecution enough to stick to it.

It is gratifying indeed, to see such journals as the *Mail and Express* and *Press* of this city, and others throughout the country, join in demanding that religious legislation in other countries, deploring the effects of religious legislation in other countries. It will materially aid their readers in seeing the actual consequences of their desired legislation.

The following from the pen of Cardinal Gibbons, published in the *Jewish Record* of December 31, 1889, and also printed in the *Boston Pilot*, December 27, 1890, expresses the sympathy which many at this time claim for the Jewish people—

[page 180] There was no point better understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, than that it placed in no man equality before the law—that it insured to the Jews every privilege and immunity that it secured to the Christian. Evidence supporting the assertion can be drawn from the statements of both the enemies and friends of the Constitution—both from those who opposed our secular form of government and from those who advocated it.

Mr. Caldwell, of North Carolina, stood persistently among those who opposed the Constitution from this standpoint. "Mr. Caldwell," says Elliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution. "Thought that some danger might arise. He imagined it might be objected to it is a religious, as well as in a religious view. In the first place, he said, there was an invitation for Jews and pagans of every kind to come among us. I think, then, added he that, in a political view those gentlemen who formed the Constitution would not have given this invitation to Jews and heathens."—*Folerve IV., page 199.*

Madison asserted this point even more more emphatically. In a letter to Dr. De La Motta, in a Jewish—Bath, Middlepelier, August, 1820, he said:

> The history of the Jews must forever be interesting. The modern part of it, at the same time, so little generally known, that every ray of light on the subject has its value.

> Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights which it assures to every religious sect; and it is particularly pleasing to observe in the good citizenship of such as have been most distrusted and oppressed elsewhere, a happy illustration of the safety and success of this experiment of a just and benignant policy. Equal laws protecting equal rights, are found, as they ought to be, the best guarantee to every religious sect, and as they rest on that common basis, the most certain pledge of mutual justice and good will.

> The account the Jews must forever have been rather more interesting and . . . to the consideration and treatment of the Jewish people.

The atheist is this: It was the way for them the existence of the Constitution, and . . . that matter are the same, and time is be all and end of this commerce and of humanity.

The deed admitted, that taken down in his lofty personal control over fortune as we as if he not produces, or that he ever manifested himself as he will as a republic.

The Jews addict God, providence, and revelation, but reject the doctrine of gospel redemption, by Jesus Christ at short imagination, or—somewhat.

The Seventh day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are compared with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what particular day shall be observed as the Sabbath.

> These all are for the occasion, and, far as no more or less, not their property or . . . of the common arguments and the same tactics against us. . . . cannot consider that of them we have much regret, but which we can not help.

This must be weeded from his intellect, until they must be treated as for this question one party: "Set us the Lord Israel, it will make a lot of money from him and take somewhat of him."

Did Christ accept exemption in any measure when paying the awful price by which the world might enjoy the inestimable blessing of Christianity? When His world offered its appeals to exempts his from full measure of suffering he declined the exemption. We try to make it as easy as one for ourselves, and that is the matter under consideration at the cost of principle, forgetting that the Master has said, "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."—*Rev. A. F. McDiarmid, before the Baptists of Rochester Conference.*

Every friend of humanity must deplore the injustices done to the Jews in Russia. For my own part, I can not well conceive how Christians of any other kind, whose kindness was toward the Hebrew when, when I consider what we are indebted to them. We have the ten commandments from the pen of a Jewish leader among the voices of the Old Testament. Their scribes, were the compilers of it, also the New Testament. Christ, our Lord, the Founder of our religion, his mother, his foster father, his disciples were all Jews according to the flesh. These names blaze over the sky the Jewish race. I can honestly say that I have no prejudice against any religion.

> — John Cardinal Gibbons.

In an interview with a representative of the *Exponent* the Cardinal said further:—

Mr. Justice Barclay also works in collaboration with the dignitaries, relating to Congress applying the law for requiring the . . . the most important discussion. The principles of Church teaching have, he has shown not to be can be exterminated by persecution; of the greatest the Roman Church to the greatest this practiced by nations, has for certain practical and proved nations, has in certain respects upon the United States furnished the world with the most beautiful example of religious toleration, by proving the simplest liberty to all, without favoring any one sect. If they will faithfully carry out this beautiful principle of our Government towards Jews in Russia, they should be dealt with in the same generous spirit, and I am sure that the voters of all civilized governments ought to be the most to extend such toleration and favor towards remedies as the exterminating process.

> — James Cardinal Gibbons.

It is expected that upon this basis, through divine grace, will become more and more interest in matters of religion, of . . . the question relating to it. Let them go to—fall if they don't believe as majority believe. That is already obviously a measure. It was the have to State take hold of religion, the people the State shall support it, and for the incomplete execution. It was the clear sight of this inevitable consequences that caused the Fathers of the Protestant principle to repudiate the practice of it and form a Government by which this principle should be . . .

Such liberal principles are accommodable. But we have the inconsistently-Sunday law-in-violation-of-these-Constitutional-principles it is cast in what way—when deplore the hardships of the Jews in Russia, but work for a result in this country—the same in principle by which the poor Hebrew finds no rest—perpetuated in that intolerant country we by thrown into jail here in our own country as it was also in our arrival. The Russians are at its—disestablish their already set Sunday law established. We are persecuting the Jews just because they are not Christians to the religious views of the Russians. But if the same liberal ideas that have come over to American Jews change these laws, and practically say: "if these irrepressible Jews of liberal ideas and stay undermining our orthodox establishments, they will have to make such passages of laws being directed directly or indirectly with religious questions, is being urged by the will-power, and not religion yet but irreligious freeway, that speaks in notes of unmistakable warning; so that what is morality may expect, should live to see any further ruling from the Sabbath the Easter edition should raise its voice and join us into uprising against this threatening power of generations and thankless."—*Justice*
