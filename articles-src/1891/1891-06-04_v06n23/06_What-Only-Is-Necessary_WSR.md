Not without carefulness would I wish to imply inconsistency in the conduct of ministers engaged in so-called National Reform work. It is too grave a matter to be brought against those who in the nature of things should have our greatest love and respect, standing as they do between the living and the dead.

But without making, at this time, a charge let me specify a few things in the doctrine and action of ministers active in National Reform, and ask most earnestly how they may be reconciled.

We are taught that men are saved, if at all, by faith. We listen week after week to this statement. No one would think of preaching it any other way, because it has become a thing universally accepted by clergy and hearers. Yet if men are saved by faith what only is necessary but to give them a chance to believe? If you are logical, and stick to the text, can you, dare you, do more than to tell the truth about God as regards man? Those who believe it, well for them. Those who do not what more can be done for them? If you have shown them the great love of God toward man as manifested and explained in Christ, and they fail to be moved to accept such a desirable thing as salvation, is there any other resort? If they do not believe what you have said how shall they be saved? Is it true that in this land where Bibles and churches are had, that some have not had an opportunity to believe? Will they have more opportunity to hear the story when the National Reform plan is in operation? Does not the awful fact come out here that men have heard but not believed nor acted upon the truth? And this terrible state of things is supposed to constitute the necessity of a reform not in the hearts and consciences of individuals but at the national head. But if it is right to preach the gospel to every creature, and "he that believeth shall be saved," is it not wrong to go further than that, and effect organizations using other means than teaching, or are these two methods both right? If the latter is true why is no intimation given of it in the Scriptures?

Again, you preach from the text, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me." None of you ever explain this any other way than that Jesus lifted up on the cross would draw all classes of men to him by the amazing instance of love and pity shown in a man suffering death to save them. If this has now failed to longer touch the hearts of the multitude, can the servants of the suffering man do more or aught but weep over such degradation of all lovely and beautiful things that ever were wont to dwell in the human breast? If the hearts that should be flesh are turned to stone, and no longer grow warm and heave and then break with looking at and believing in the sacrifices of their elder brother, how is the remedy to be sought in the erection of a cold national image of stone, however much of a god it may become?

If we leave the trodden paths marked by Christ and his company to follow those unused by them we may fear that something is radically wrong. We see in a great and powerful national organization things that appeal to the selfishness of men. The pomp, the supposed glory, the delusive temporal benefits are all a part of it. Should not such things make us afraid? Here are two indications of the same kind; first, this political organization is not at all like the manner of Christ or his apostles. Second, it has within it the elements of selfishness, which it is possible may be the actuating principle. But such a manner of stating it becomes too tame when we consider the numerous examples of false religions seeking to be perpetuated in precisely the manner now proposed. Who can but feel a thrill of indignation that any one with the pages of history before him could propose such a thing? No matter with what subtle variations or prestige of promoters the plan comes, it is the same that has made the past red with blood.

Who shall be able in a fitting manner to lament the day when the fairest among the nations, the one that came nearest laying her foundation stones in the beauty of truth, and acquired an impetus of blessings from on high thereby, shall so far forget her God as to look to an idol? Who would not much rather wait on the side of truth and of Him who meekly taught the sinful woman at the well in Samaria, than to go with a multitude to do that which is wrong? Who will stand with Truth now, when she is about to retire from the field apparently defeated by the powerful foe, to prove who are her loyal adherents?
