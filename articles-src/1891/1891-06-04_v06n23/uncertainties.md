# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, June 4, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 23)

## CRITICAL NOTE ON IMAGE QUALITY

The source images for this issue (/tmp/as1891n23-1.png through /tmp/as1891n23-8.png) are low-resolution scans of a newspaper with very small type in three-column format. This has resulted in **significant difficulty** reading many passages accurately. The following files have major sections that could not be reliably transcribed:

**Overall confidence: LOW for most articles due to image resolution.**

A second pass with higher-resolution scans is strongly recommended for the entire issue.

## RECOMMENDATION

**This entire issue should be re-transcribed from higher-resolution source images.** The current transcriptions preserve the general structure and major themes of each article, but the exact wording is unreliable in many passages. A scan at 300+ DPI of the original pages would dramatically improve accuracy.
