# Uncertainties Log: v06n23 (1891-06-04)

## General Notes
- OCR source quality: Good overall readability
- Most content transcribed with high confidence
- Several author attribution judgments required

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 03: "Should Church Property Be Taxed?"
- **Author attribution**: Article signed "Rev. A. P. McDiarmid, before the New York Baptist Ministers' Conference"
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- **Initials used**: APM (assumed from name)

### Article 06: "What Only Is Necessary"
- **Author attribution**: Signed "W. S. RITCHIE" at end
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- **Initials used**: WSR

### Page 1, Opening Editorial Material
- **Content**: Quote beginning with "The doctrine that it belongs primarily to the State..."
- **Context**: This appears to be a quotation without clear attribution in the OCR
- **Decision**: Excluded from article extraction as it lacks context and appears to be a standalone quote
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM - could be part of a larger article not fully visible

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association Section
- **Content**: Declaration of Principles and office addresses
- **Decision**: Excluded from article files as this is organizational boilerplate
- **Confidence**: HIGH

### Various Editorial Notes (Articles 08-26)
- **Attribution**: All unsigned short items attributed as "editorial"
- **Confidence**: HIGH - standard practice for 1891 American Sentinel
- **Editor**: Alonzo T. Jones (per masthead)

## OCR Quality Issues

### Minor spelling/OCR corrections made:
- "BORN ST." likely should be "BOND ST." (Page 6, line 266) - transcribed as written
- "7PM ST." unclear address (Page 6, line 267) - transcribed as written
- Various archaic spellings preserved as per instructions (e.g., "moider" for "moulder" in Baptist lawyer's letter)

## Second Pass Completed
- All articles reviewed for completeness
- Author attributions verified where signatures present
- No significant obstructions or illegible sections encountered
