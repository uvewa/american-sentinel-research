W. J. ALEXANDER, professor of logic and rhetoric, has been expelled from the faculty of the State University at Columbia, South Carolina, because he is a Unitarian. Sunday, May 17, this action was made the basis of a sermon by Rev. H. A. Whitman, Pastor of the Unitarian Church of Charleston. Mr. Whitman is reported as follows:—

"The principles of religious freedom, recognized and taught by Christ, and which have been incorporated in the fundamental law of our country, have been violated here in our own State by State officials. The spirit of free inquiry has been threatened, and the rights of conscience trampled upon so far as this could be done by the imposition of civil disabliities.

"We have fallen back upon mediaeval times, and it seems that the battle, which we all thought had been fought and gloriously won long ago, will have to be fought over again in South Carolina. In this nineteenth century of progress, and under the splendid light of scientific truth, the ruling spirit of the old Spanish Inquisition—the spirit of Torquemada—is being invoked. A professor of the South Carolina college, who is a gentleman of Christian character and of marked intellectual ability, has recently been dismissed from that institution because he holds to Unitarian views of religion. In spite of the statement of this Unitarian professor of logic that he had carefully refrained from giving expression to his religious views, that he held them as private property, and that his text-book on logic was devoid of a single heretical statement, this board of trustees of an institution, presumably committed to no sectarian bias or theological system, resolved itself into an inquisitorial council or commission, with the Governor of the State as inquisitor-in-chief, and proceeded to subject the professor in question to a most searching religious examination, which lasted for an hour or more, and resulted in his dismissal.

"It is exceedingly difficult to believe that such a thing could take place in South Carolina. Why, after reading a report of this examination, I had but to shut my eyes and think of it all to forget the enlightened age in which I live, and wonder how I, a modern, came to be living in the Dark Ages of the world, when men, just struggling into the light of scientific truth, were brought before ecclesiastical tribunals and subjected to similar catechisings. What a spectacle for the gods and men in 1891. Here we have men inquiring as though we had a State religion. By their action these trustees say to the world that no Unitarians can be professors at the college, while Unitarians pay for its support. Look at the action, and we will see nothing to commend in it, but everything to condemn."
