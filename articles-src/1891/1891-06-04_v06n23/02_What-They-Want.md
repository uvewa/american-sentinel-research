REV. W. J. R. TAYLOR, D. D., Corresponding Secretary of the American Sabbath Union writes thus to the "Pearl of Days" of Sunday in the city of Washington:—

National Sunday legislation for the District of Columbia, which has no Sabbath laws, utterly failed in the hurry and excitement of the close of the Fifty-first Congress. The Sunday rest bills introduced by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, in the Senate, and by Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky, in the House, early in the year 1890, failed of action, together with several hundreds of other bills for the District of Columbia, that died with the Congress.

Nothing can be done in this direction until the next Congress, and then action will depend on the pressure of public opinion, upon the wisdom of measures proposed, and upon the disposition of the Senators and Representatives toward any local and national legislation on this subject.

Washington is among the most orderly of American cities on the weekly rest day. The churches of all denominations are well attended, better, indeed, than those of most cities of its rank. The permanent residents embrace a great, substantial, and growing community of worthy people, who would welcome the shield of legal protection of their civil Sabbath against evil workers. The liquor traffic is controlled by the District Commissioners, who have been a terror to transgressors of the license laws of the public peace.

This it would seem ought to be highly satisfactory to the friends of a quiet Sunday, but it is not. Secretary Taylor continues:—

What is most needed now is an organized, wise, and persistent citizens' movement, under the leadership of a local Sabbath committee similar to those of greater cities. This will command special attention as soon as practicable, in connection with public meetings and other local agencies that may be enlisted in its support.

This shows that closed saloons and a quiet Sunday are not the objects sought by the Sunday agitators in Washington: they already have both. What they want is congressional action recognizing the sacred character of the day and committing the national Government to the principle of Sunday legislation. The friends of free institutions should be alert, for they can rest assured that undismayed by past defeats the American Sabbath Union, and its numerous allies, will be on hand with their fraudulent petitions to secure if possible from the next Congress some sort of a law recognizing the religious character of the first day of the week.
