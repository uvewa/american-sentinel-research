A PHILADELPHIA Grand Jury argues the Sunday law of Pennsylvania as a nuisance, "an obsolete law which may have been right and advisable in a small town in 1791, but which is now out of place in the new Philadelphia of 1891."

---

IN Hutchinson (Kansas) *News* of May 19, states that, "the discussion of the Merits of the World's Fair on Sunday is likely to involve the whole Sunday question." It would seem that this subject is attracting the attention of the entire country.

---

BRADENTON, Pennsylvania, is agitated over a rigid Sunday ordinance which the City Council has been asked to pass. The matter was referred to a committee which decided that a full discussion of the measure was desirable and that a meeting had been secured and a discussion arranged for to last three weeks.

---

The Grand Jury of Mercer County, New Jersey, indicted the members of the Salvation Army for making loud noises on drums and tambourines. "Thus," says the *Christian Advocate*, "is the impression in this country but notwithstanding that a good purpose fill one man never indicated a Roman Catholic privilege was merely admire, more or less thought was entitled to any degree never even think of losing a kingdom. 'On flowery beds of ease,' then it ought to do no such thing."

The following is from Col. Elliott F. Shepard's paper, the *Mail and Express*:—

> The Sunday quiet of Yoktan was materially disturbed yesterday. Drums were beating and flags were waving and men were marching up the streets from shortly before noon until long after nightfall. Thousands of people were there to hear them sing. Yoktan was simply flooded by an unexercised crowd. All this was because the central stone of a Roman Catholic monastery, the object of which ultimately to train men in the manner of holy orders, being blessed and dedicated with impressive ceremonies by Cardinal Gibbons. The establishment includes, it robed with it, too.

This only shows the real animus of the American Sabbath Union, whose president (Colonel Shepard) is: it not only demands that Sunday shall be observed but it would [page 184] assume to say how it shall be observed. We have no more sympathy with Roman Catholics than has the American Sabbath Union, but we do maintain that they have a perfect right to spend Sunday in doing anything that they might properly do upon any other day.

The following despatch was published in the *New York World*, of May 11:—

> Five thousand men in Ansonia, Connecticut, on striking at the reduction of wages at the Farrell Brass Works, got a right to smoke to-day owing to a Blue Law of one hundred years ago being revived. Saturday's right is so great indignation in consequence, and the people are determined to get together the Justices of Officers on the Sunday law. The order applies to getting on the street to smoke also with their cigars shining. No complaint on moving . . . the order arose. He imagines its potency by the cities on Sundays that no Roman in particular and the people who cannot get a supply. Although cigars were not sold in Ansonia it was certain that those who wished to be with, and there were many cases of insubordination.

SERIOUS ENQUIRERS has an idea of its own sincerity, and its expression in its own words:—

> We need a great national conscience. We need it right here in the national capital. Not a college, which should make plain the liberality of Protestant government; but a university, that shall breathe power. I have no objection to say our own body is a dying institution. Let us be done in, but let's object to the efforts which are being made by the Paper to the Unitarians or and the bill itself. The paper of the United States must and will run the university. I am looking for the funds in this and once the soul of their firmness will be a great national one.

---

Upon this the *Catholic Review* comments.

The Senator then desires to erect at the enormous cost all that is to construct the unconstructed that it the University. It is therefore in order for the fine old Catholic university to get itself considered a not other after upon an expression of it but Freedoms of.

And the *Review* is quite right.

The price of the paper will remain the same as heretofore, single copies of ten or more copies to one address, 60 cents; forty or more copies to one address, fifty cents per copy, twenty cents for a or its month. Single subscriptions, fifty cents per year. Address, Our Little Friend, Oakland, Cal.*

*The Catholic Review* thinks that the question applying the Metropolitan Museum of New York City (details), experimentally at least in the affirmative by the direction of its board to allow its absorption of all to have.

---

A MOVEMENT is on foot in Washington to open the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Corcoran Art Gallery, the beautie, and the Corcoran Art Gallery on Sundays. *The Washington Post* has been publishing the views of different leading men upon the question. "The diversity of these views and the manner in which they have been expressed," says the *Post*, "show that people are thinking seriously on this subject and their publications notoriously monthly in more light being given to from those who were not originally approached on the subject. Even among clergymen there is no uniformity, as some strongly favor the opening at least on an afternoon, while others are opposed to any kind of Sunday amusement."

---

*The Catholic Review* thinks that the importance of community to the next and all other . . . to see that these statements and that they could be done, on the advice of opinion and refuse to have the Work's Fair . . . the right to close the door for the survey of the doctrine should be submitted on short service, but it is was a woman, and Christ had sinned until the . . . for its . . . for the sake of defeating a harmful and unconstitutional . . . It cannot . . . it to remain . . .

And it is to say that were it not that a visit is to be gained for a dogma of the Church by pushing the Fair on Sunday Christians might consent to its being kept shut. If Sunday is a Christian duty or principle, there is not a Christian duty or principle at all, but simply of advantage to the Church. Certainly there would not be any trouble in settling such a question in Catholic conscience; the church would simply make known its will and the civil power would carry it out. We trust it is not yet so in this country.
