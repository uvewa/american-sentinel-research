THE GRAND JURY OF MERCER COUNTY, New Jersey, has indicted the members of the Salvation Army for making loud noises on drums and tambourines. "This," says the *Christian Advocate*, "is contrary to the spirit of democratic freedom. Let the persons in this country who can not endure noises for a good purpose fill their ears with cotton. That Grand Jury probably never indicted a Roman Catholic procession, however noisy, even on Sunday, nor would its members ever think of doing such a thing."
