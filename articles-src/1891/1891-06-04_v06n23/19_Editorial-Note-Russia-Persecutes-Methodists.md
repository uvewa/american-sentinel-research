THE MAIL AND EXPRESS has the following editorial note:—

Russia is now persecuting Methodists as well as Jews. Our cable news today gives the story of some of the sufferings of the poor people who, for no other crime than nonconformity with the State church, have been banished, imprisoned, robbed and tortured. How long will the civilized Christian nations allow this sort of thing to go on without a sharp and effectual protest? Lord Salisbury's speech shows that he is almost ready, if backed by public opinion, to call the Russian bear to "come down." The barbarities continually practiced in Russia are an affront to the civilized world, and they ought to be stopped.

The *Mail and Express* has not, however, so far as we are aware, entered any protest against the barbarities practiced in our own country upon Seventh-day Christians, merely for following upon Sunday their ordinary vocations, after having conscientiously observed the seventh day. Will our contemporary, whose destinies are presided over by the President of the American Sabbath Union, rise and explain why religious persecution is worse in Russia than in the United States? The principle is certainly the same; the Russians simply carry it farther than the religious bigots in this country have yet been able to do.
