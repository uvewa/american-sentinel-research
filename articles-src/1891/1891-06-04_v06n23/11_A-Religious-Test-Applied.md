## A Religious Test Applied.

W. J. ALEXANDER, professor of logic and rhetoric, has been expelled from the faculty of the State University at Columbia, South Carolina, because he is a Unitarian. Sunday, May 17, this action was taken by the Senate and the result was that Mr. Whitman, Pastor of the Unitarian Church of Charleston. Mr. Whitman is reported as follows:—

"The principles of religious freedom, recognized and taught by Christ, and which have been incorporated in the fundamental law of our country, have been violated here in our own State by State officials. The spirit of the terrors has been threatened, and the rights of consciences trampled upon so far as this could be done by the imposition of civil disabilities.

"We have fallen back upon mediaeval times, and it seems that this battle, which we all thought had been fought and successfully won long ago, will have to be fought over again against both in America. In this nineteenth century of progress, under the splendid light of scientific truth, the burning spirit of the Spanish Inquisition—the spirit of Torquemada—is being invoked. A professor of South Carolina college, who is a gentleman of Christian character and of marked Christian ability, has recently been dismissed from that institution because he holds to a different interpretation of the doctrines of religion. In spite of the statement of this Unitarian professor of having given expression to his religious views, that he held them as private property, and that his text-book or logic was devoid of any heretical statements, of having been satisfied with his record and character, of trustees of a institution, presumably being under the of this most . . . Episcopal system, resolved itself into an inquisitorial council or cormorants, set up the Governor of the State as inquisitor-in-chief, and proceeded to subject the professor in question to a most searching religious examination, which lasted for an hour or more, and then they fired him.

"It is exceedingly difficult to believe that such a thing could take place in South Carolina. Why, after receiving the results of this examination, I had but to shut my eyes and think of it all to forget what age and epoch in which I was living. I wonder how a modern, came to be living in the dark Ages when the light of the scientific discovery into the light of scientific tribulation as subjects to an examination over religious subjects to and subjected in inquisition religion. What is spectacle for the gods and men to hear. . . . Here we have men operating as though we had a State religion. By what action those trustees making us is what that no Unitarian can be professor at the college, while Unitarians are for its tuition? Nothing to commend in it, but their motive nothing to condemn."
