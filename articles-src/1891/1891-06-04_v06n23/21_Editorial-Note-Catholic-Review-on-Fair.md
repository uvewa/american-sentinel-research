THE CATHOLIC REVIEW thinks that the Christians of the country should lay aside all differences of opinion and refuse to have the World's Fair open on Sunday, even though a decorous observance of the decencies should be absolutely guaranteed. . . . To close the doors on Sunday looks extreme, but it is a war measure, and Christians must submit to the inconvenience of it for the sake of defeating a hateful and unscrupulous enemy. In Catholic countries there could not be any trouble in settling a question of this kind.

That is to say that were it not that a point is to be gained for a dogma of the Church by closing the Fair on Sunday Christians might consent to its being kept open upon that day. In other words, it is not a question of Christian duty or principle at all, but simply of advantage to the Church. Certainly there would not be any trouble in settling such a question in Catholic countries; the church would simply make known its will and the civil power would simply obey. We trust it is not yet so in this country.
