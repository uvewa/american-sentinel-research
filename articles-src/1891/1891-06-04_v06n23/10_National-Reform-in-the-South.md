## National Reform in the South.

We commend to the special attention of those who think National Reform never results in anything but good, the following from a minister in Grayville, Tennessee.

The National Reform idea is growing rapidly throughout the entire South. New Jopas has been getting some of this religion of late. Some few weeks past, and has stirred the city wonderfully. Some few weeks ago there came some preacher holding of his services, at the mention, by him, of a "law" and other things. "In matters formerly thought as hard; one thousand men were on their feet at once with terrible demonstration." There at Grayville was there in the air; the people shouted at the pulpit and for the most the next day after three week were in the air, the people at the churches preached.

I tell you the devil is getting things hot for that small town liberty of conscience, and I believe that Chattanooga, the "gateway of the South," it will be no important thing for Nashville, with its religious edifices, the center of all the commodities struggling the area itself.

The *Chattanooga Daily News*, of May 30, says:—

> The amount of enthusiasm that Jesus created in Chattanooga not had a parallel since the Centennial of Yesterday a pronounced young citizen, harnless, energetic for success myself for fair, his expression, Know a few good and said: "Third party, democrat or what it believe this country would be a thousand times better if of this Jesus they produced, a hundred good reform, administration, this minute he wanted to would give the salvation of the country." And I believe if he would be indorsed for run, he would be elected." And he seemed to be in earnest.
