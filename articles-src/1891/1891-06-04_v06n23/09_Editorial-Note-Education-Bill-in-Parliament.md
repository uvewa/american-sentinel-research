A LONDON despatch of May 2 refers to the educational measures now before Parliament, as follows:

Mr. Howorth accurately reflects the Tory fears by saying that even if the Government should now succeed in passing a measure which should give the Church the control of the schools, the next Radical flood would sweep away forever the religious constitution of the school government under the plea of local control.

The Unionists support the bill heartily. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, in a letter on the subject, contends that it is impossible to undermine the existing denominational schools, and that it would cost $50,000,000 to replace them with others, even if the people approved of displacing them. The Roman Catholics, in view of the fact that the bill secures the clerical control of the schools, adhere to it enthusiastically. The Duke of Norfolk, the secular chief of the English Romanists, in a speech at a Unionist society, hailed the Government's proposals as based on the lines of doing justice to everybody.

The Nonconformist bodies have expressed their opinion in a resolution approved by the Baptist Union Assembly, to the effect that no scheme can be satisfactory unless it shall provide for free unsectarian education, controlled by the ratepayers.

This is interesting, and the progress of the bill will be closely watched by the friends of secular education everywhere.
