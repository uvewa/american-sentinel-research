## What They Ward.

REV. J. D. TAYLOR, D. D., Corresponding Secretary of the American Sabbath Union writes thus to the "City of Washington" of Sunday in the city of "Washington:"—

National Sunday legislation for the District of Columbia, which has no Sabbath laws, have steadily failed in the tardy and unfortunate cities at the close of the Fifty-first Congress. The Sunday rest law, introduced by Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, in the Senate, and by Representative Breckinridge, of Kentucky, in the House, only one year past, along the same lines, together with several hundred thousand petitions of the District of Columbia, that died in committee.

Nothing can be done in this direction until the Fifty-second Congress meets in December. In the possession of public opinion, upon the wisdom of the measure proposed and upon adequate . . . the State of Representatives whoever any local aid . . . national legislation on this subject.

Washington is among the most orderly of American cities on the weekday one day. The churches of all denominations are well attended, better than in most of our cities and towns; and the permanent resident embrace a great, substantial, and growing community of worthy people, who [page 177] would welcome the shield of legal protection of . . . Sunday their ordinary vocations, after having consistently observed the sacred day. With our contemporary whose destinies are presided over by the President of the American Sabbath Union, rise and explain why religious persecution is not in Russia than in the United States? The principle is certainly the same, the Russians simply carry it farther than the religious bigots in this country have yet been able to do.

[page 178] day the equal rights of all are preserved the same as upon other days. The government can not justly say to men upon that day anything that it could not do upon any other day of general abstinence from labor; it can simply adapt itself to the conditions of the existing quiet of that day, and leave the people free to spend the horses as they choose.

Socialistic social orders are simply the duty of the government, and parks and swimming pools belong to the people. It follows then that if the people wish to resort to these places on Sunday, it is entirely out of place for those who have charge of them for the people to deny access to any of them upon that day—the only day that many have an opportunity to resort to such places.

"This idea that governments, national, State, and municipal, must close up on Sunday and that and the other avenues of pleasure or recreation on Sunday or else be guilty of sin against the law of God, is rooted in sheer medievalism. To admit the principle is to admit to all that is claimed by the National Reform theocrats. But we can never consent that religion should be made a question of majorship; that the Nation might be obliged to adopt any particular creed, simply by act of Congress or even by vote of the people. If the introduction of the Continental Sunday will tend, in any degree, to relieve the Sunday laws of the country, reform the ideas of the people, the State and its proper relation of the social and religious of the people, it would certainly constitute a lasting benefit upon the community, and especially upon the cause of true liberty. It is a mistake to suppose that the State can place the bloom from the lily of beauty or Christians and send them to the kingdom, "on flowery beds of ease." The fact is it ought to do no such thing."

This it would seem ought to be highly satisfactory to the friends of a quiet Sunday, but it is not. Secretary Taylor continues:—

> What is most needed now is an organized, vigorous and permanent movement among the laity under the leadership of a broad Catholic committee—under the leadership of a great executive. This will commend special attention as soon as practicable, in connection with political contests and other local agencies that may be available to this end.

This shows that closed saloons and a quiet Sunday are not the objects sought by the Sunday agitators in Washington; they already have that. What they want is congressional action recognizing the sacred character of the day and commanding people to observe it as a religious duty. The theological principles of Sunday legislation. The friends of free institutions should be alert, for they can rest assured that all efforts to defeat put the legislation in the American Sabbath Union, and its numerous allies, will be in vain with their franchised petitions to secure it possible from the next Congress a recognition by act of law recognizing the religious character of the first day of the week.
