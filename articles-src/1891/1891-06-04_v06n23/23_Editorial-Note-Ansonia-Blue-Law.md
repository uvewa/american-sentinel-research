THE following dispatch was published in the New York World, of May 11:—

Five thousand men in Ansonia, Connecticut, on the other side of the Naugatuck River, could not get a cigar to smoke to-day owing to a Blue Law order issued by Prosecuting Attorney Walch. There is great indignation in consequence, and the people are determined to apply the brakes to other offenses under the Sunday laws. The order applies to confectionery, ice-cream and soda water stores. Birmingham is profiting by the order. Shelton has no license and its people also cross the river to get a supply. Although cigars were not sold in Ansonia, it was evident that whiskey was to be had, and there were many cases of intoxication.
