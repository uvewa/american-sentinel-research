The proprietor of the only bath houses at Bay Shore, Long Island, has recently been converted, and has ordered all his bath houses closed all day Sunday. The hotel keepers are highly indignant at this action and threaten to build other bath houses and run the Sunday-keeper out of business. Of course it is their privilege to build other bath houses, but the threat to run any man out of business because he observes Sunday, or any other day, strictly, is unworthy of free men in a free country. The man has a perfect right to close his bath houses on Sunday if he sees fit to do so. The spirit of compelling people either to observe or not to observe Sunday is wholly un-American.
