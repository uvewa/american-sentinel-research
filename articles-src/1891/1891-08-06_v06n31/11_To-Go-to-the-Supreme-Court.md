The famous King case, from Obion County, Tennessee, will now go to the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Hammond, of the United States Court, having dismissed the State's appeal proceedings and remanded the case to the custody of the sheriff of Obion County, thus sustaining the State Sunday law. King's offense was plowing on Sunday, after having observed the seventh day in accordance with the fourth commandment.

It is stated that the officials in charge of the Barge Office, the place now used for the landing of immigrants, have decided to apply favorably to Attorney General Miller upon the proposition, to close the place on Sunday. If this be done it will work great hardship upon the thousands of steerage passengers.

The Church of England has recently, for the first time since 1852, made a report of its revenues to Parliament. The report shows the Established Church to be enormously wealthy. Its annual revenue amounts and reaches to $30,000,000, which, it is remarked, "goes far toward accounting for the great disinclination to disestablishment."
