The Sunday Observance Association of Kings County, New York, has been holding meetings in Brooklyn, where printed slips were distributed containing a statement of "Some of the things done;" among which is the appointment of a "State Committee" of one from each county to assist in the enforcement of Sunday laws throughout the State, and to organize influence for the prevention of any amendments which shall tend to weaken or do away with existing Sunday laws. With this is also a list of fifteen things they wish to do, among which is "Special education and pledge work among Sabbath-school children," and the offering of "prizes for essays on various phases of the Sabbath question."

In an address to the "Friends of the American Sunday," prefacing an abstract of the eighth annual report of the Association, which was also given out at the same meetings, is the following remarkable language.

> More than one of our loved, honored, and respected institutions are in danger, and none more so than religious liberty, represented by the old flag. Religious liberty is wantonly assailed by vandal hands. The rights, privileges, and protection guaranteed the people is jeopardized. Abolish our Sunday laws, and the inalienable right of every American citizen to rest and worship is denied. The same thing is accomplished if these laws are not enforced. Shall they be? It all depends on you. You can control and dominate the situation if you will. As perilous as the conditions surrounding the Sabbath are, you can change them; not by prayer alone, but by work. Our Sunday laws are well nigh perfect, but they are not enforced. They can be. They will be if you will support and co-operate with our efforts. The Church and you must do their duty in this crisis.
