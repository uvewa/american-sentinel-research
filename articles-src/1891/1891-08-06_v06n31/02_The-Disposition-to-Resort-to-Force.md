THE disposition to resort to force to effect reforms, either real or imaginary, has reached a development in this country which is ominous. The National Reformers have long since warned those who oppose them that if necessary resort will be had to the bullet; the more radical Prohibitionists talk of resort to arms to wipe out the saloon; American Sabbath Union speakers threaten bloodshed if their theories are not adopted by the Government; in Tennessee a mob of miners have just secured from the Governor a virtual pledge for the repeal of the law permitting the letting of convicts; while from Louisiana comes the news that at a meeting in the Grand Opera House, in New Orleans, the other day, Rev. Dr. B. L. Palmer, one of the foremost pulpit orators of the South, delivered a thrilling arraignment of the lottery, and declared that the people should and would, if necessary, resort to revolution to overthrow it. "Thousands of men," it is stated, "have signed a resolution to shed their blood, if necessary, in order to free Louisiana from the great gambling institution." In view of this it is perhaps only fitting that "Parkinson, who led the lynchers when the eleven Italians were shot down in the parish prison of New Orleans, has recently come out as an anti-lottery man."

The lottery, and the convict contract labor system, and the saloon ought to go, but the methods invoked to destroy them are none the less dangerous. Government by clamor and by mobs is the worst kind of a substitute for constitutional government; but it is the exchange which is being made in this country; and the responsibility when it has been made will lie at the door of various reforms, real and so-called.
