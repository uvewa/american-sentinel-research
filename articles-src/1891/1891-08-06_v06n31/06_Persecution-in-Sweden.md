Sweden and Russia have allied themselves closely to one cause of religious persecution, according to the following letter from a Swedish correspondent to the London *Daily News*:

There has lately been formed in Sweden a society, calling itself a Union to Party, with the object, as far as I can learn, of promulgating the views of the Utilitarian (Jeremias Sundback's) Mill's primary. It counts principally as members university students and young men of letters; and some of these, with the enthusiasm of converts, have been going about the country lecturing, and in this stronghold of Lutherian orthodoxy are of tolerance getting themselves into trouble with the authorities. Prominent among these has been a gifted young man of letters, Henry Bergdahl, a bachelor of philosophy, and he also was prosecuted some time ago for a lecture he had given in a country town, and sentenced by the court to three months' imprisonment, on the ground that the doctrines propounded in the lecture were subversive of the Christian religion.

"There exists a convention between Sweden and Russia for the mutual surrender of criminals belonging to either nation, and Bergdahl being now a criminal in the eyes of the law, having been condemned to imprisonment, it was decided to send him over to Russia, so soon as his prison term was completed. Poor decision, and having probably the mines of Siberia before his mental vision, pleaded hard to be allowed to go to England or America; but no, the 'ukase' had gone forth from Stockholm, and his native land he must go. Last Wednesday morning, accordingly, he was conducted by the Swedish police to Copenhagen; a steamer *Noderne*, leaving for Hanyo, in Finland; and sure comes almost the most dangerous part of the proceedings.

"On arriving on Danish ground, Bergdahl claimed to be free, and refused to move further, but the Danish police were only too ready to lend a willing hand. Their conduct was most shameful, for Bergdahl had infringed no Danish law, his offence only being that he had held [page 245] ians views differing from those of the Swedish clergy. Bergdahl was induced to enter a cab to be driven to a police-station, but instead he was taken to the steamer, and pushed on board (Kirkegard), indeed, a Swedish police officer accompanying him to Russia. It is most distressing to read in the Copenhagen papers that he looked like a man whose last of life was, done, and one can not help shuddering for the fate that may await him.

"On the evening of the same day a question was asked in the Swedish Second Chamber of the Riksdag about the reasons of the Government for this expulsion, but the chamber decided with one hundred and sixteen votes to eighty-three that the question should not be put, and of course in parliamentary speaking, the Government has kept within the letter of the law."
