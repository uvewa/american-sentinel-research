We see that this that political institution with the power, if consistently carried out, would result in a perfect image of the Papacy of the past, and in a repetition of all its inquisitions, and bloody history, it is often objected, that we are living in a different age; different people are at a different altitude of thought, whereas then they were ignorant, and narrow, and intensely bigoted. It is argued that all this alters the case, and that broad-minded, intelligent and bigoted fanatics to dictate in the affairs of State; it is admitted, as far as we can be, we are our change—intelligent but falsely evangelical— the terrible curse—but to concede the point of Government to educated and liberal minded Christian people, who will control everything in the interest of Christianity, is entirely different. Only the most willful and determined misrepresentative, it is thought, can account for the association of these two things together, and reasoning as if they were one and the same. Briefly Christianity is the goal of all true-heartedness, the passion of this movement, and the possibility of its application to all the life of the individual and the State all, with every resource of strength, morally, intellectually, and spiritually, that the human may, the command of the entire direction toward which all hearts strive. Why should not the civil Government, and everything else then, be enrolled, to minister to all this?

This argument is specious, and to many minds it is conclusive against the possibility of evil from THE MOVEMENT. For the day demands it and logical answer, the error consists in reasoning as though notwithstanding the existence of this impossibility.

The sympathy which the Christian is continuously expressing for the persecuted Jews in Russia, for the victims of the slave trade in Africa, and for the mob almost Christian spirit of civilization, is virtually all put out, to pull forth contempt for other faiths and other peoples, so that the Reformers of the Sentinel, so establish a religious despotism in this country will not create a suspicion that would be prejudicial to their success. It is the sympathy of the crooked tiger for the hapless victims which has fallen a prey to its cunning.

National Reform folk, we are not dared to use any "arguments" or "tactics" against the so-called National Reformers, would had the opponents in this country the same as it is in Russia to-day. Will the people allow themselves to be fooled?
