The Church of England has recently, for the first time since 1832, made a report of its revenues to Parliament. The report shows the Established Church to be immensely wealthy. Its annual revenues amount in round numbers to $28,000,000, which, it is remarked, "goes far toward accounting for the great influence which it wields."
