The subject of the union of Church and State is very imperfectly understood by very many people. It has been generally held that in order to form a union with a State one sect or denomination must be made the State Church; but a little consideration will show any one that such is not the case. The National Reformers say that they do not want a union of Church and State, but a union of religion and the State. In a speech before the National Reform Convention, held in New York in 1873, Rev. Jonathan Edwards said:—

> We want such a religion, and we want it in the government. It shall be so far as the affairs of the State go, a religion that is Christian, and is based on Jesus Christ. The Christian oath and Christian morals shall be at the bottom of its laws and all its legal basis. We use the word "religion" in a broad sense, as meaning a recognition of a personal God of faith and obedience to God.

Now, even in the face of such a statement as this, made by one of their prominent men, the National Reformers insist that they are opposed to a union of Church and State; but their denial amounts to nothing. Religion and the State is only another name for that unholy alliance between the civil and the ecclesiastical power which has always been an unmistakable curse to both the Church and the State. Everybody admits that Constantine united Church and State. But he [page 241] did not set out to declare Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire; when he had taken that step, however, it was necessary that he should in some way define Christianity. Then, as now, those who professed to be Christians were divided, not into organized denominations as at the present time, but into simmering parties and factions under the leadership of their respective bishops. Between the extremes there was probably as great a diversity of opinion as exists now between Catholics and Protestants. Beside this there was a multitude of minor differences; and as the Emperor had declared the Christian religion to be the religion of Rome, it was necessary that that religion should be defined, and for this purpose a general council was convened at Nice to decide the question as to what constituted the Christian religion. The National Reformers of our own day propose to take similar action.

When the Blair Educational Amendment bill was under discussion in the Congress of the United States, the question was asked, how it would be possible to carry it out owing to the diversity of views among the Christian people. The answer given by the author of the bill was:—

> I believe that a text book of instruction in the principles of religion, outside the Christian religion, has been proposed for use in the public schools since this Government was established by any one of the branches of the Christian Church, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.

Again, Dr. Schaff, in defining what part of the Bible should be taught in the public schools, said:—

> The people of the United States, under a better and a more perfect Union, would establish justice, domestic tranquillity and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, including the blessings of a common Christianity to every American citizen of the United States of America.

> Is it not my purpose to enter upon a full discussion of the many delegated and implied powers which could be embodied in the several articles and sections of the Constitution of the United States; but that even granted power national authorities to the State, those with which Congress invested power, leaving of view those which pass it by in legitimate. But I do want, and it is well to keep it in mind the jealous care which walked hand in hand with the patriotic men who framed the Constitution which the people adopted. As divisions of this common Christianity amongst the delegations of powers to Congress, the Constitution of our Government evidently was intended to guard against the mischief which so often flow from their origin in generalizations, and which declares that.

[page 242] To be taught in the public schools, how much would we lack of having a union of Church and State? Then, we might as well have a denominational organization known as the State Church, and supported out of public treasure, for we would have practically the same thing, for we would have a creed officially recognized by the Government.

There is one phase of this question which is generally lost sight of, and that is the rights of nonchurch people, of people who are non-Christian people. The National Reform idea is that every government is a government of God, and that the powers that be derive their power from God, and this not in the sense in which the apostle declares that "the powers that be are ordained of God," but in the sense that its law should be the law of God, or in other words, the law that men adjudged to be governed by the divine law as administered by their fellow-men.

But on the other hand, the Declaration of Independence declares that "Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed;" this, however, National Reformers deny. In the Missouri Sunday Convention held in Sedalia in 1889, Mr. W. T. Gray said:—

> I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and this movement is an effort to change that doctrine so far as Puritanism is concerned.

Now if the National Reformers be correct, and governments do derive their just powers directly from God, and not from the consent of the governed, and if it is their duty to administer the law of God; it follows that they must decide what that law is, and what it requires; and if they have that right, then all organized opposition to their decisions is rebellion against every law they make. But to seek to do such a thing would be to deny God, or at least to place men in the place of God, which amounts to the same thing.

For instance, under a Catholic government, it would be the duty of the citizen to adore pictures and images; while under a Protestant government, it would be sin and crime for him to do the same thing.

The only safe and tenable ground is to declare, as did the Saviour, that those things which are Caesar's should be rendered to Caesar, and those things which are God's should be rendered to God; or, in other words, that those duties which we owe to the State should be discharged to the State, and those which we owe to God should be discharged to God. In short, that the State can of right have absolutely nothing to do with settling or enforcing the individual's duty toward God.

Anything more than this puts men in the place of God, because it makes them judges of the divine law and allows to the same the places of conscience and authorizes persecution for conscience' sake.

The Grecian age was not an age of ignorance. An age that could give us poetry, and sculpture, and architecture and models of beauty to all the future, was not an age that had something of refinement and knowledge.

There were philosophers in those days, who spent their time in discussing the great questions of life, death, and destiny, according to the best knowledge they could command, surrounded as they were by a sinful world, and trained by the word of God. The age of the Antonines, said to be the happiest era of human history, was an age of religious liberty; in some sort, the prevailing religion was in union with the State, and this was a disadvantage; but paganism believed in such a multiplicity of gods, in such varied forms of worship for different individuals and different nations, and the result is in its own terms, that it did not greatly restrict the intellectual speculations of the age, if it did require the philosopher to outwardly conform, in act, to that in which theory they secretly, and in every respect, despised.

Not so with Christianity. It believed, and believes, in one God revealed through Christ. It had, and has, definite ideas of duty, not to be evaded by the worldly. Claiming, therefore, it was allied with the State, and the predominant sect of the clergy sought by every means of fine, and then severe, and rack, to compel the world, not only to act, but to think and say they believed what human reason was then bound by evidence of fact, and since thinking had become so dangerous men ceased to think, as became after generations passed by, the people all the while becoming more ignorant, and narrow, and bigoted, the clergy too became ignorant, for they had no need of study of speech to such people; and then they were content not as far enough than the people, by their superiors. And then until every had experience to think, since their word, however faulty, its challenge, was law; and accepted by the ignorant multitude as from God.

True, learning, and the desire for it, almost perished from the earth. All that remained was the wildest tales of saints and mysteries, and miracles, and legends of sages and holy-bodies, all of which passed for genuine history, and was implicitly believed. And as was this at that time in the vernacular for the people to read, the more one read, the more ignorant he was, and so far as we know not even his beliefs were of well intellectured, [page 243] as the most advanced scholar. At one time had it not been for the schools of the Island Mohammedans, in Spain, this union of Church and State had almost entirely paralyzed the human mind. This did the insidious union of the Church of Christ with a sinful world, generate the ignorance and bigotry to support the otherwise intolerable burden of superstition, and put to death all dissenters. It would be the same again. This thing may be put in its most seductive light, as a means of raising the Nation, by putting the Government solely into the hands of good men; and yet coiled up in the thing itself, is all that evil willing to unfold, and that is to record around the human mind and heart, till the intellect and soul are paralyzed, and the animal man is ready, for the sake of enforcing his one remaining idea, to torture his brother, and spill his blood.

To fully realize this, one has only to contemplate the bigoted and intolerant spirit that has animated and that animates all the leaders of this modern religio-political movement. If they had the power, and carried out their threats, all the dark past would be repeated. But that all this is the unavoidable result of a union of Church and State, is still denied; and the array of the facts, the denial puts itself in, and say, "Here is a union of Church and State, and still a liberal, and an inflexible tool."

The reply is not difficult. All the power that Satan wields, has been for evil, and not for good. It has made a monopolizing clergy, and it is worldly and selfish in the Church. In the State, it would not be difficult to show that almost every evil and oppressive law that England has passed for the past two centuries, was supported, if not championed by her bench of bishops in the House of Lords; and almost every really liberal and good law has been opposed by them. The only reason, however, that the intolerable results do not follow the union of Church and State in England, is because England herself does not really believe in that union, and so she practically makes it inoperative by a policy of universal toleration. The United States, as its greatest glory, has been teaching this lesson of liberty to the world; and England has not been slow learning from her once lost child. All the tendency in England for years has been toward disestablishment. This reasoning, however, could not apply to the prospective union of Church and State in this country.

If the United States, after almost leading the world these glorious principles of the independence of the human soul, should herself forget, and, leaving the truths so thoroughly taught by the founders of the Nation, and embodied in our Federal Constitution, should go back to a union of Church and State, and a national religion enforced as a part of the completed education of the human intellect, the whole religio-political scheme is in the interests of ignorance and bigotry. It would not only bid the sea of human knowledge, now mounting onward toward the zenith, to stand still in the heavens, but it would do more than that. It would reverse it in its course toward the dial of progress till the shadows of a gloomy and persecuting past once again enshroud the world.
