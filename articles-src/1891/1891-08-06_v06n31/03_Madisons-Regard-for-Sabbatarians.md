It was a noble characteristic of our statesmen that they regarded all men as equal, social, or, in other words, they recognized all persons in whatever sect or faith as equally entitled to carry out their religious views. It was not the spirit of the modern Sunday-law agitator who would drive Christians to keep the day of his choice sacred and compel all others to do so too; but it was freedom for the Christian, freedom for the Jew, freedom for the pagan, and freedom for the agnostic. Madison, in a different frame, heard and considering, assigns himself to reference to the law as "perfect equality" with all Christian sects, and in the following letter he makes his admiration in the plan that such a course is the surest way of securing ultimate harmony. He writes to a Jewish Rabbi, changing as follows:

Having ever regarded the freedom of religious opinions and worship as equally the right of every sect, and the secure enjoyment of it as the best human provision for bringing all either into the same way of truth, or into the mutual charity which is the only substitute, I observe with pleasure the view you give of the spirit in which your sect partake of the civil and political rights of the (the Jewish people) partake of the blessings of your Government.

If the principles of the Constitution were adhered to it would not be necessary to publish the notes of the far-seeing old Sabbatarians every now and then, and it became more Scotts Snider keeps talks a little close to his ideas and actions in reference to his fourth commandment. Ever since they adopted the Sabbatarian, both Jew and Christian, has unceasingly approved and hastily supported American principles—especially allowing every one to do as he pleases in religious matters so long as he does not interfere with the same right in others. Why can not the Sunday-keepers do the same, and leave the Sabbatarians unmolested in their seventh-day worship and first-day work? It always gave [page 242] Madison pleasure to see American principles carried out, and the "Unitings offered by our Government" and laws appreciated.
