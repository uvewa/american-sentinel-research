When we show that the religio-political schemes of the present, if consummated would result in a perfect image of the Papacy of the past, and in a repetition of all its iniquitous, and bloody history, it is often objected, that we are living in a different age; people are now educated, and liberal of thought, whereas then they were ignorant, and narrow, and intensely bigoted. It is argued that this alters the case entirely. To allow a set of narrow and bigoted fanatics to dictate in the affairs of State, it is admitted, was as bad as we claim—language could hardly exaggerate the terrible curse—but to consign the reins of Government to educated and liberal minded Christian people, who will control everything in the interests of Christianity, is entirely different. Only the most willful and determined misrepresentation, it is thought, can account for the associating of these two things together, and reasoning as if they were one and the same. Surely Christianity is the goal of all true evolution; the panacea for all the ills of the individual and the State; the highest possible attainment, morally, intellectually, and spiritually, of the human mind; the summit par excellence toward which all should strive. Why should not the civil Government, and everything else, if possible, be made to minister to all this?

This argument is specious, and to many minds it is conclusive against the positions taken by THE SENTINEL; it therefore demands a candid and logical answer. Its error consists in reasoning as though the ignorance, and bigotry, which in the Dark Ages, made the union of Church and State such a terrible means of persecution and bloodshed, were something entirely independent of that union—a mere unfortunate accident of the times, which made such a union dangerous. This is not so. That ignorance and bigotry were the direct and unavoidable result of that union of religion with the State.

The ignorance itself being a direct and unavoidable result of that union of Church and State, the bigotry and persecution, consequent from the ignorance, were also unavoidable results of that union. However harmless, or even beneficial, they may seem at the first, the fact is, if they remain in force long enough, all religious laws always have, and always will generate the ignorance and the bigotry necessary for their own enforcement to the relentless persecution of those who oppose them. We speak of the Dark Ages, but the world had not always been in ignorance and darkness. It is true, modern science has made wonderful advancement in the past few years. Since the unshackling of the human intellect by the greater disunion of the Church and State resulting from the Reformation, the march of mind has been one mighty procession of successive triumphs; but compared with the darkness of the medieval age, the light and learning of the centuries immediately before and after Christ, is as the noonday.

The Grecian age was not an age of ignorance. An age that could give its poetry, and sculpture, and architecture as models of beauty to all the future, must have had something of refinement and enlightenment.

There were philosophers in those days, who spent their time in discussing the great questions of life, death, and destiny, according to the best knowledge they could have, surrounded as they were by a sinful world, and unaided by the word of God. The age of the Antonines, said to be the happiest era of human history, was not an age of ignorance. It is true that in this age, the prevailing religion was in union with the State, and this was a disadvantage; but paganism believed in such a multiplicity of gods, and in such varied forms of worship for different individuals and different nations, and believed in it all so loosely, that it did not greatly restrict the intellectual speculations of the age, if it did require the philosophers to outwardly conform, in act, to rites which in theory they secretly, and even openly, despised.

Not so with Christianity. It believed, and believes, in one God revealed through Christ. It had, and has, definite ideas of what was due to his worship. When, therefore, it was allied with the State, the predominant sect of the clergy sought by every means of fire, and thumb-screw, and rack, to compel the world, not only to act, but to think as they did.

The human mind was thus bound by fetters of fear, and since thinking had become so dangerous men ceased to think. As generation after generation passed by, the people all the while becoming more ignorant, and narrow, and bigoted; the clergy too became ignorant, for they had no need of study to speak to such people; and then they too were bound not less strongly than the people, by their superiors. And what need had these superiors to think, since their word, however fanciful or absurd, was law, and accepted by the ignorant multitude as from God.

Thus, learning, and the desire for it, almost perished from the earth. All that remained was the wildest tales of saints and mysteries, and miracles, and legends of satyrs and hobgoblins, all of which passed for genuine history, and was implicitly believed. And as this was all there was in the vernacular for the people to read, the more one read, the more ignorant he was; and so he who knew not even his letters was as well off intellectually, as the most advanced scholar. At one time had it not been for the schools of the hated Mohammedans, in Spain, this union of Church and State had almost entirely paralyzed the human mind. Thus did this iniquitous union of the Church of Christ with a sinful world, generate the ignorance and bigotry to support the Spanish Inquisition, and the Scotch kirk, and put to death all dissenters. It would be the same again. This thing may be put in its most seductive light, as a means of raising the Nation, by putting the Government solely into the hands of good men; and yet coiled up in the thing itself, is all this evil waiting to unfold, and then to recoil around the human mind and heart, till the intellect and soul are paralyzed, and the animal man is ready, for the sake of enforcing his one remaining idea, to torture his brother, and spill his blood.

To fully realize this, one has only to contemplate the bigoted and intolerant speeches and threats of almost all the leaders of this modern religio-political movement. If they had the power, and carried out these threats, all the dark past would be repeated. But that all this is the unavoidable result of a union of Church and State, is still denied; and in support of the denial, men point to England, and say, "Here is a union of Church and State, and still a liberal, and an intellectual people."

The reply is not difficult. All the power that this union has had, has been for evil, and not for good. It has made a money-seeking clergy, and a worldly time-serving Church. In the State, it would not be difficult to show that almost every bad and oppressive law that England has passed for the past two centuries, was supported, if not championed by her bench of bishops in the House of Lords; and almost every really liberal and good law has been opposed by them. The only reason, however, that the lamentable results, in full, do not follow the union of Church and State in England, is because England herself does not really believe in that union, and so she practically makes it inoperative by a policy of universal toleration. The United States, as its greatest glory, has been teaching the lesson of liberty to the world; and England has not been above learning from her growing child. All the tendency in England for years has been toward disestablishment. This reasoning, however, could not apply to the prospective union of Church and State in this country.

If the United States, after almost teaching the world these glorious principles of the independence of the human soul, should herself forget it, and, denying the truths so thoroughly taught by the founders of the Nation, and embedded in our Federal Constitution, should go back to a union of Church and State, and a national creed enforced as a part of the compulsory education of the State schools, if she should do this at all, it is presumable, that she would do it because she believed in it; and if she believed in it, she would make it effectual. If so, the effect I have described, is the only one that could possibly follow.

Some of these self-styled reformers pose as champions of education; but their whole religio-political scheme is in the interests of ignorance and bigotry. If successful it would not only bid the sun of human knowledge, now mounting grandly toward the zenith, to stand still in the heavens, but it would do more than that. It would command it to go backward on the dial of progress till the shadows of a gloomy and persecuting past would again enshroud the world.
