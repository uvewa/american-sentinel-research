At the threshold of the constitutional temple of the Republic of the United States of America, there has ever stood a silent sentinel, warding off the encroachments of the beginning, in each enterprise the bar has borne the name of interpretation. The formulas of the never varying responses which every inquiring mind received, was prescribed directly by which strictly encircled the temple, and was similar to, the sentries atop the exterior; the fortification, nightly, the defense of political faith and the protector of distinguished statesmen.

This may not frequently occur, but whenever it does it intensifies the demand for repeated changes. Hence, absolute reform can not be placed in the direction of the judicial outreach, and the fact tends to intensify and multiply the demands for that character of legislative action which fails to take account of constitutional limitations, and is bringing the country into a condition of over-legislation. This is an uncertain era for Nation and State to enter upon. It is not only uncertain, but also positively harmful. Once entered upon, the self-reliance of our people will diminish. They will gradually drift away from their observance of that forceful aphorism which advocated them that "self-help is the best help." A comparatively composed lot of individuals will not easily adopt that aphorism as a guide of life and of conduct, and keep themselves in harmony with the true signification of the constitutional phrase which placed the constitutional limitation on the legislation, to which it appends, will always be blamed with political order and prosperity, and avoid the dangers which ever attend over-legislation.

Over-legislation engenders a habit of looking to the government for things, and to pin fair share of effort to the proper enforcement of the law. No law, no matter how wisely framed it may have been, will execute itself. The wisdom of statesmen has never discovered any successful device for the enforcement of law. If the law redress to criminal conduct, it will remain a negative force, when violated, until some state officers shall put it into active operation. If it dishonor with the civil right and privilege of the citizen, it has not the power to appear in court and of its own motion demand that the party in interest shall apply the remedy which its provisions indicate. In either case the protection of the doctrine of the ends must be resorted to, and so crying evils demand the enactment of additional laws, respect to the subject matter involved, will present the community or give them resort to the citizens. Additional enactments will be so more automatic in their action than are those to which they may be additions or amendments. They will all remain dead letters on the statute books, until "self-help" shall put them into action.

If from the date of the first enactment of a statute by Congress, and by the Legislatures of the several States, on down, to the present time each and every act had been framed with perfect conformity to the constitutional provisions upon which they rest for support, and one of them would have been exempt from the operation of the rule stated. A review of the various laws now in force in this Nation and in the several States, would reveal the fact that there is scarcely a right or interest, public or private, which is not enjoying statutory protection, and yet, [page 244] notwithstanding the existence of this impossibility, in fact, denser there has been a time in the history of this country when the demand for the enactment of additional laws has been as great as now.

This suggests the consideration of an older element in the cause of which was so tending, which may be presented by the questions, "Have we not reached a point where the constitutional limitations in respect of the protection of the general welfare should be applied as a check to the present tendency towards over-legislation? Can we protect the general welfare by engaging in a practice which tends to confuse the citizen's sense of duty to the matter of the enforcement of existing laws by both the public officer and himself?" We have a vast population; but this great aggregation does not eliminate the evil of over-legislation; it intensifies principles. Each is a part of the whole, and as such must be taken into the account when we come to act for the promotion of the general welfare. Hence the question is, which we should be engaging in practice from our legislative action every day, is with reference, to which affair is better, to let all law, and to encourage demands for additional legislation, or to encourage the observance of what is already provided for. This in a full shield, true conservatism should dominate, and every citizen should actively aid in its administration. It is a most interesting fact, surveying the course of this country's legislation, from them to rapidly settling down into the responsibilities of ruling over the civil, and private affairs and interests that add to the possibilities of its administration years of this Republic. If the tendency of the present times towards over-legislation will add to each their satisfaction and enrichment, support, how important our right and our own powers become in the interest of the promoting the general welfare. If cruelly for additional legislation, supplemental to acts already provided for by law is to dominate legislation, extrade the practice of the rule of self-help, and diminish the American respect for the enforcement of the laws and the protection of the general welfare, then indeed may we look for serious experiences in the future.

But come what may, the subject is one which all, and especially the young men of every nationality—*James P. W. Butler, United States District from the State of Indiana.*

Barnum is the corresponding paragraph to union of Church and State. Whoever and whenever this contest has arisen they have invariably stood on the side of liberty of conscience, and, if need be have marked with their blood their undying devotion to this principle. The Bible must not maintain a religious establishment.—*Southern Baptist.*
