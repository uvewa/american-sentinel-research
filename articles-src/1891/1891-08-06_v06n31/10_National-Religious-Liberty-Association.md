NATIONAL
Religious Liberty Association.

A CORRESPONDENCE of a California paper writing from southeastern Tennessee, names of the some facts published in these columns last week relative to the manner in which the Sunday law is enforced in that State, and says:—

"Having some acquaintance here, and where no Sunday law exists, and in States west of the Rocky Mountains, I have been a minister, and I can truthfully say that Sunday is observed there more scrupulously than here in Tennessee, with all her Sunday laws."

The same correspondent testifies that the law is not enforced except against those who observe the seventh day, or in some other way render themselves ridiculously obnoxious to their neighbors. In short, law is used as a means of persecution pure and simple.

The Chief of Police of Hartford, Connecticut, and the Sunday law officer of the United States, finds that a few stands are open and the result has been to arouse an Italian religious and in the Italian sentiment, having been debarred from selling bananas on Sunday devotes his time to assisting in the enforcement of Sunday closing of business in general. What an effective method of Christianity the simplicity, the National Reformers have discovered!

Referred by City Attorney Richmond, the fruit dealers of Norwich, Connecticut, are also experiencing the pleasures of the national law, with the exception of Elias Raghee, a Hebrew, whose shop is closed until sundown on the seventh day, according to the commandment of the Bible, and open all day Sunday contrary to law. But this is the law of man. How long will it be before a Roman, whose right he asked for in the case of the Jew of Norwich?

Is it not true that the Methodist Church was the prime moter in the organization of the American Sabbath Union, which has for one of its objects, the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws, which will stop the running of street cars on Sunday, and all Sunday railroad trains, be statement that for five years this denomination, represented by the Chicago district, has been receiving twenty per cent. of the earnings of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroads from Sunday excursion trains, to and from the Methodist camp-meeting, will no doubt surprise the readers of THE SENTINEL.

A Presbyterian minister recently declared in the presence of a number of Methodist ministers that the Methodist Church was one of the chief desecrators of Sunday by their Sunday camp-meetings, bath sent and, and later, another Presbyterian, at a Union meeting on the West Side, held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, in a Methodist Church, stated [page 247] that next to the Sunday newspapers, the Methodists were, by means of their campmeeting, the worst enemies of Sunday observance. The Methodist ministers do not accept this statement of the situation with much grace. They noted by calling attention to the number of Presbyterian who use the street cars on Sunday.

While thus pointing out each other's inconsistencies, they all arrive at beautifying harmony in demanding a rest-day all for all which allows a seventh-day observer to follow his usual vocation on Sunday. It is but fair to state that a majority of the Methodist ministers at a recent Monday morning meeting, opposed receiving any more Sunday excursion profits, although no action was taken.

MAYOR BRADLEY, of Asbury Park, New Jersey, has issued a general order for the closing of all business on Sunday. Nevertheless, Sunday, July 19, the druggists sold cigars and soda water all day. The cigar and candy stores in the hotels also did a good business. A lemonade show also conducted its business, on a vacant lot, or fountain, on property owned by Mr. Bradley, supplied all creatures, while, until last o'clock, Mr. Bradley's own employees resorted bathing suits to all applicants, and among his patrons were many young people from Ocean Grove. The Sunday papers also were sold along the beach.

Any reasonable-minded person would think that all the inconvenience that is developed in the attempt to enforce Sunday and other religious laws, would open the minds of the promoters to the civil impropriety of all such legislation; but when the god of this world would destroy his first makes mad.

Arguments of the Dogmatists Against the Employment of Force in Religion.

"Do the apostles ever persecute any one, or did Christ ever deliver any one over to the secular power? Christ commands us to fee persecution. Matt. 10:33.

Then who rather allowed thyself a disciple of Christ ought not to imitate the will of the heathen. Think you then to do more than God—by destroying, with your hand? Ye are, ye, ever, poor mortals, if ye believe this, for God has not executions for his priests. Christ persecutes no one, for he was for inviting, not for citing men to the faith; and when the man complained to him of the foundation, or separate parties (Luke 9:50), he said to them: "He who is not against us, is for us;" and as Paul, to Philippians 1:13. Our Lord Christ says: "No man can come unto me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him." But why do you not permit every man to follow his own free will, since God, the Lord Himself, has bestowed this free will on man? He has simply pointed out to man the [page 247] way to righteousness, that none might be lost through ignorance. Christ, in dying for them, has given Christians nothing else to do, but not to kill. Christ teaches us to suffer wrong, not to revenge, not to kill. The apostle tells of what he had endured, not of what he had done to others.—"*Danieland Bishop Petiliam"—Neander's Church History, Torrey's Translation, Vol. IV, Footnotes, pp. 312, 313.*
