At the international session of the Congregationalists, recently held in London, Mr. Little, of Dorchester, Massachusetts, read a paper in which he argued that the religious observance of Sunday concerned the highest duties of the State. There seems to be a good deal of talk of late in regard to the benefits the State derives from Sunday observance. It is all talk, however. There has not, nor can there be, any evidence produced that will show the assertion to be true. In not the history of the past sufficient to teach us the lesson, that the State can not legislate in favor of religious dogma without great evils resulting from it?
