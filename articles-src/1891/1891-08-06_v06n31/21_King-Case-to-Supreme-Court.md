The famous King case, from Obion County, Tennessee, will now go to the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, having dismissed the habeas corpus proceedings and remanded King to the custody of the sheriff of Obion County, thus sustaining the State Sunday law. King's offense was plowing corn on Sunday, after having observed the seventh day according to the fourth commandment.
