Is view of the fact that the Methodist Church was the prime mover in the organization of the American Sabbath Union, which has for one of its objects, the enactment and enforcement of Sunday laws, which will stop the running of street cars on Sunday, and all Sunday railroad trains, the statement that for five years this denomination, represented by the Chicago district, has been receiving twenty per cent. of the earnings of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad from Sunday excursion trains, run to and from the Methodist camp-meeting, will no doubt surprise the readers of THE SENTINEL.

A Presbyterian minister recently declared in the presence of a number of Methodist ministers that the Methodist Church was one of the chief desecrators of Sunday by their Sunday camp-meetings, and later, another Presbyterian minister, at a Union meeting on the West Side, held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, in a Methodist Church, stated that next to the Sunday newspapers, the Methodists were, by means of their camp-meetings, the worst enemies of Sunday sacredness. The Methodist ministers do not accept this statement of the situation with much grace. They retort by calling attention to the number of Presbyterians who use the street cars on Sunday.

While thus pointing out each other's inconsistencies, they all arrive at beautiful harmony in denouncing a state of affairs which allows a seventh-day observer to follow his usual avocation on Sunday. It is but fair to state that a majority of the Methodist ministers at a recent Monday morning meeting, opposed receiving any more Sunday excursion profits, although no action was taken.
