The following appeared in the Ligonier (Indiana) Leader, of July 23:—

> A case of considerable public interest was tried before Squire Jackson on Monday, the plaintiff being the people of the State of Indiana, and the defendant, Mr. Miller, who keeps the candy stand on the corner opposite the Ligonier house. The trial was by jury and resulted in a disagreement, nine being for conviction and three for acquittal. The prosecution grew out of the agitation of the Sunday closing law and was rather a test case, but owing to Miller being a poor man, or reported to be, he elicited sympathy through the efforts of his attorney, and as near as we can learn the jurors who were opposed to convicting him, were more or less influenced in that direction through sympathy. Whether the fight for Sunday closing is to be continued we do not know, but certainly the Law and Order League cannot stop at this juncture.

> If Sunday business is to be stopped it will require vigilance and determination. It is not simply a question whether one or two poor men shall be prevented from doing business on Sunday, but whether there is a sentiment in this community sufficient to enforce a law that is in the interest of good morals and good government. The fight is now on and must be fought to the finish. There can be no backing down or postponement.

> But in this matter the extremes should be avoided. Let the spirit of the law be observed and good will result, but if the war is "carried into Africa," the end is likely to be damaging both to morals and the public good. Be careful.

This editor talks out on the question with a good deal of earnestness and in no uncertain language. It is another proof of how men in all parts of our country are committing themselves to Sunday laws, and in doing that they are virtually acting over the scenes of the fourth century, that began with Sunday laws and ended in the supremacy of the Church, tyrannizing over the consciences of men during the long night of the Dark Ages.

It is not a matter of surprise that the same paper publishes an announcement that the pastor of the Presbyterian Church would speak on the "Sabbath question" on the following Sunday evening.

While this agitation is going on some one should be there to show up the fallacy of such work.
