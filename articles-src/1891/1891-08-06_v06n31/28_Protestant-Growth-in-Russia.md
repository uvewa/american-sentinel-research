"A good idea," says the Christian at Work, "may be formed of the rapid growth of the great Protestant movement in Russia when we mention, on the best authority, that four hundred and fifty persons were admitted to church membership during 1890 in the two small provinces of Cherson and the Taurida. There are no accurate statistics from the other provinces in which the movement has taken root, but we are credibly informed that the total number of new members in 1890 exceeded fourteen hundred. In the first five months of this year, notwithstanding the terrible persecution raging against these brethren, the number of members who have joined exceeds seven hundred. Over two thousand in seventeen months!"

What an illustration have we here of the utter impotence of a State Church! The Orthodox Church, corrupt to the core because of its connection with the State, has lost its hold upon the people who are honestly trying to serve God, and they are leaving its communion in the face of bitter persecution. The only service that any human government can possibly render true religion is to let it alone.
