The official organ of the National Reform Association, the *Christian Statesman*, in its latest of July's publishes three articles and notice expressive of its sympathy for the persecuted Jews in Russia. The first one claims is that "there is no consolation in the persecutions of the Jews in Russia. Not a week passes without new and persecuting edictions. The latest act, to compel all Jewish news doctors or nudges to be converted to Christianity, and another to expel all foreign Jews from southern Russia." Another article says:—

The abomance we feel at the persecution of a race, has asking people, whose real offence is that they are, in an additional reason for our wishing to enjoy the safeguards of a constitutional protection for conscience.

It would be well if the National Reformers were sincere in their sympathy, but they are not. A book containing the proceedings of one of their national conventions, purchased at the office of the National Reform Association, and contained in that paper contains the following dialogue:—

> *Rev. opponent*, one may learn that you are merely a body of men who to their turn desire the inconveniences of dissent. And are they not also men who, to the extent of their ability, and to the essentials of their citizenship will be none the less entitled on that account?

> The atheist is a man who denies the being of a God and a future state. "Citizens" and State be the same, and time is to be all and the end and who does not?

> The deist admits God, but denies that he has any personal contact with men of whom we call professions; or that he ever manifests himself to be a ruler by revelation.

> The Jew admits God, professions, and revelation, but rejects the other volumes of gospel revelation, as one class of deposed religions on occasion, about importants.

> Tolerate atheism, sir! There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate sooner.

But these men profess to believe in God Godward, and are confounded with the other class of deists, "those who reject in common with the mass of Christians upon the question of of what parts of the work shall the contrary of means?

These are all, for the occasion, and as far as our assessment is concerned, one class. They are put down in the same category and the same tactics against them. They must be rounded together, which we very much regret, but which can not be avoided. They must be treated, this question, as one party.

What are the rights of the atheist? I would tolerate him as I would a poor lunatic; I would give in my law him mind in scarcely sound. So long as in does no an, so long as he not dangerous, I would tolerate him. I would tolerate him as I would a conspicuous lunatic. The atheist is a dangerous man.

> Tolerate atheism, sir! There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate sooner.

The atheist may live, as I said, but, no attempt by him on the destruction need shall not defy any of the civil institutions of all this I would say for, repeat, advocates Christians as are consistory men. They are inconsistencies upon. They cannot lived together on our life and customs.

By comparing the foregoing quotations it will be seen that Russia is a typical National Reform country, so far as the treatment of dissenters is concerned. Any one who dares to open his mouth against the religion of the Czar, or against his political tyranny, runs the risk of losing his head, or of being banished from the country. After the National Reform style, the Czar has placed "all Christian laws," institutions and usages on an undeniable legal basis;" and whoever dares to against them is, as, the Reformers say, to incite "the inconveniences of dissent." Both the Jews and the Lutherans of Russia, have for some time been feeling this "inconvenience."

When people are punished in Russia it is clearly because they are not "Christian laws," the National Reformers call out, "Religious persecution!" yet for this country, they simply call it "feeling the inconvenience of dissent." And all who dare to use any "arguments" or "tactics" against their doctrine fall under their laws of persecution. Let an individual use any arguments or tactics against their scheme of attempted religion to rule in the name of God, and to enforce his will, and he is pretty sure to suffer the inconvenience of losing all of his property, and finally his life. His prosperity for himself or his family is not morally, intellectually, in the sacred of religion; and as the man is opposed to it, all its evil and baleful consequences are upon him, and he is handled or banished for the good of the State.

The National Reform book already states with sufficient clearness, what is to be a minority involves more or less of inconvenience, and it is to be expected, in morals, and in religion, whoever differs materially from the majority of his associates, will feel it more or less in the loss. All law, all government, all society, is founded upon the principle of self-sacrifice, and demands on acquiescence and his independence by submitting to it.

Yes, you have heard about this "inconvenience" and "principle" in almost every country on the globe. And we have noticed that the more National-Reform—State and Union—led's paternalism there was in the government, the greater was the inconvenience and the pressure. The law say to maintain one's conscience and morality is the property to disbelieve all laws that interfere with conscience, and then suffer the penalty. This is what Daniel and his companions did; and Christ and his apostles, with all the martyrs of the Dark Ages, pitted the same course. To be in error it was somewhat inconvenient to use their ideas, or to be empirical, to be shout-up in thin darkness, and to be tortured on the rack; but not nearly so much as it will be in the day of judg- [page 246] ment for the intolerant bigots who heaped these wrongs upon them.

The sympathy which the Christian *Statesman* is continuously expressing for the persecuted Jews in Russia, for the victims of the slave trade in Africa, and for the mob almost Christian spirit of civilization is virtually all put out, to pull forth contempt for other faiths and other peoples, so that the Reformers of the Sentinel, so establish a religious despotism in this country will not create a suspicion that would be prejudicial to their success. It is the sympathy of the crouched tiger for the hapless victim which has fallen a prey to its cunning.

National Reform folk, we are not dared to use any "arguments" or "tactics" against the so-called National Reformers, would had the opponents in this country the same as it is in Russia to-day. Will the people allow themselves to be fooled?

The following appeared in the *Lucifer* (Indian) *Leader,* of July 2:—

A case of considerable public interest was tried in the Indian Courts last spring, the defendants being the people of the Blind of Tolsian, and the charge brought against the Lepers Indian Reservation. The prosecution grew out of the agitation in regard to religious instruction, how the schools, and the discussion was very sharp. The excitement felt, be elicited sympathy through the office of the school Superintendent. Dr. Dorchester decided, and the children to be somewhat influenced in that direction through sympathy for the Protestants we do not know, but certainly the local superintendent gave orders that both Catholic and Protestant children should attend his church, and of course there was vigorous indignation and determination. "It is not enough that these children be taken away by force and imprisoned here, in a house of correction, but whether there is a settlement in this community or not, it shall be enforced." The appeal was denied, a very good and government. The good people of various religious denominations living in this section heard of this and offered their aid and with them came some of them. The commission in the reservation should be so constituted as to deal fairly with all, "and in this country the national Government which protects the native American, she and he is likely to be disregarding both he and she.
