A correspondent of a California paper writing from southeastern Tennessee, notes some of the same facts published in these columns last week relative to the manner in which the Sunday law is enforced in that State, and says:—

> After having spent seventeen years in California, where no Sunday law exists, and in States west of the Rocky Mountains, where none is operative, I can truthfully say that Sunday is observed there more scrupulously than here in Tennessee, with all her Sunday laws.

The same correspondent testifies that the law is not enforced except against those who observe the seventh day, or in some other way render themselves religiously obnoxious to their neighbors; in short, the law is used as a means of religious persecution pure and simple.
