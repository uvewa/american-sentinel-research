A few days since Rev. McGill, of the Methodist *Episcopal Record*, Chicago, said in the course of a sermon, that this Sabbath movement is about to take its place among the great American movements, by a union of all the believers in Sabbath reform, and intimated that a great national party would be formed on that issue. A circular letter has just been sent to every evangelical minister in the United States, soliciting co-operation in this Sunday movement.

If fate is to be argued that all about liberty to natural action, because those in favor of opening the World's Fair on Sunday are really depriving the people of their religious liberty?

Any one who will read the foregoing items and not see that there is name for this movement save religious legislation, is certainly not familiar with the facts of history. The religion of Jesus Christ does not interfere with human liberty, but, on the other hand, it does not force men indeed, but ecclesiasticism, calling itself Christianity, has often caused the most cruel persecution in the name of Him who said to the almost spirit of Peter seen in some of the movements of our day and country? We are then quietly assumed that there is no danger. But when a national movement is seriously talked of, what when a similar circular is sent out asking assistance in securing the observance of a day of religious rest, it is not time for us to open our eyes? Yes, we should remind these people that they do not want the religious-Sunday. No they don't! for the religious phase of Sunday is as inseparably connected with it as an ermine rips in the wool. And it would be just as reasonable to make a green pariah of the good-wool of wool, even though it is dyed red, and extol its great benefits for the laboring man especially, and everybody in general, [page 245] and urge that all be compelled to wear garments made from wool and say no attention is to be made of the entrance of erring matter. But it is there, nevertheless, and no amount of washing or rubbing of wool existing will take it out. You can not read by the whole fabric if you get rid of the color. Just so with Sunday. The religious element has been so thoroughly wrought soaked into all its particles by its continued association from the age of Constantine till the present day, that it would completely destroy the proposed Sunday rest day if the religion was taken out of it. Says Dr. Crafts, "take the relics and hundrds of Sunday, and what have left out."

But as simply as such a thing as ever asserted and enforced by law, if they have another adjectively generally decided and practised, and it will do it itself by the correct. RELIGION or Sunday. It has been with it, is therewith to-day. Its institution is really composed of but one element it is useless to talk of requiring its observance without talking of its elements.

Let those who believe they should observe Sunday do so if they like. But no one comes to our country to secure anything else. Such a thing cannot be done under our Government.
