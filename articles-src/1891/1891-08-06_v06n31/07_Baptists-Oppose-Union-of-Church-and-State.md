BAPTISTS are uncompromisingly opposed to union of Church and State. Wherever and whenever this contest has arisen they have invariably stood on the side of liberty of conscience, and, if need be, have sealed with their blood their undying devotion to this principle. The State must not maintain a religious establishment.
