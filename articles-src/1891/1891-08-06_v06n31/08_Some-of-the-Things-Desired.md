The Sabbath Observance Association of Kings County, New York, has been holding meetings in Brooklyn, through which slips were distributed containing a statement of "Some of the things desired," among which is the appointment of a chaplain for the county institutions. It contains in the usual statement, that the Sunday laws throughout the State, and for signature indicates for the promotion of any amendments which shall tend to maintain or do away with existing faults. With this is also a list of fifteen "Sunday Observance" measures, including "Special educational and pledge work among children and young people," the offering of "prizes for essays on Sabbath observance," etc. In short their idea is, in an address to the "Citizens of American Sunday," embracing a picture of the Mayflower, which was also given out at the same meeting, "Sabbath observance, has a beautiful language."

The adoption of one of these, and some others associated in character, and range of importance, might not require additional legislation. In another proof of how some in all parts of our country have no committees Tuesday or Sunday laws, and in doing that they are virtually acting on the sentiments of the editor of that, than begin with Sunday laws and believe in the supremacy of the Church, trampling over the conscience of men during the long night of the Dark Ages. It is not a matter of surprise that the same paper publishes an announcement that the pastor of the Presbyterian Church would speak on the "Sabbath question" the following Sunday evening.

While this agitation is going on some are enabled the better to show by the fallacy of such work.
