At an international session of the Congregationalists, recently held in London, Mr. Little, of Dorchester, Massachusetts, made a paper in which he argued that the religious observance of Sunday concerned the highest destiny of the State. There seems to be a good deal of talk of late in regard to the bounds the State derive from Sunday observance. It is all talk, however. There has not, nor can there be, any evidence produced, that will allow the assertion to be true. Is not the history of the past sufficient to teach us the lesson, that the State can not legislate in favor of religious dogma without great evils resulting from it?

The proprietor of the only house bath at Bay Shore, Long Island, has recently been convicted, and has ordered all its bath houses closed all day Sunday. The hotel keepers are highly indignant at this action and threaten to build other bath houses and run the Sunday-keeper out of business. Of course it is their privilege to build other bath houses, but the threat that any man out of business because he observes Sunday, or any other day, certainly, has the man in not a perfect liberty. The man has a perfect right to close his bath houses on Sunday if he sees fit to do so. The spirit of compelling people either to observe or not to observe Sunday is wholly wrong.

The Philadelphia *Record* says:—

Sabbatism has had a severe attack of Sabbatarians, under the influence of which a few of the zealous makers in various cities of the time are making themselves ridiculous and rendering many other people very uncomfortable. In contributing placing these strange extravagances to the civil day of intolerance the philosophical mind is sometimes tempted to forget that the broader spirit of liberty of and regard for free liberty have increased in their dominion in our country. Religious exercises were hampered, and unlucky Quakers' ears were nailed to the posts.

The truth is, this revival of intolerant religious legislation is not confined to Connecticut. Pennsylvania and Philadelphia are not exempt from the same craze for a legal religion. In the convention of the Sabbath Union just held at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, Laird E. Vail, a lawyer of Philadelphia, declared the Pennsylvania [page 248] Act of 1794 on Sunday observance to be "all right," and gloried in the failure of an attempt in the last Legislature to weaken its force. "This Sunday law," said he, "must be kept on the statute books and men sent as legislators who will retain them and enact better and stricter if necessary."

Dr. Fernley, also, Secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, wanted to focus on himself and the city of Philadelphia, the Record and excepted,—"with a ten hours' fence—such boasted a commandment of the Lord ... in such a form would be a National Reform improvement." Philadelphia which runs along Philadelphia streets on Sunday.

"A good idea," says the *Christian at Work*, "may be formed of the Christian growth of the great Protestant movement in Russia when we mention, on the best authority that with our hundred and fifty years were admitted to church membership during 1890 in the two small provinces of Chernozum and the Tavrillia. There are no accurate statistics from the other provinces to which this the movement has taken root, but we are credibly informed that the total number of accessions during 1890 exceeded three hundred. In the south of Russia for two years, notwithstanding the terrible persecution raging against these bodies, the number of converts who have joined exceeds eight hundred. Over two thousand in several provinces."

What an illustration have we here but the other imposter at a State Church? The Orthodox Church, corrupts to the core of its being, would persecute, because it has at last its hold upon the people who are honestly to serve God, and they are leaving its communion, on face of the very persecution. The only service that any set with human government can possibly render true religion is to let it alone.

Ministers and others interested in Sunday movements at Racine, Wisconsin, are threatening to impeach the mayor of the city because he does not enforce the Sunday law. The mayor has told them that he will not close the on Monday, or they stop Sunday baseball, and that they any community responsibility-held are to meet.
