Sweden and Russia have allied themselves closely in one instance of religious persecution, according to the following letter from a Swedish correspondent to the London Daily News:—

"There has lately been formed in Sweden a society calling itself the Utilistic Party, with the object, as far as I can learn, of promulgating the views of the Utilitarians (Jeremy Bentham's and Mill's I presume). It consists principally of university students and young men of letters, and some of these, with the enthusiasm of converts, have been going about the country lecturing, and in this stronghold of Lutheran orthodoxy and intolerance getting themselves into trouble with the authorities. Prominent among these has been a gifted young man of letters, Henry Berghell, a bachelor of philosophy, and he also was prosecuted some time ago for a lecture he had given in a country town and sentenced by the town court to three months' imprisonment, on the ground that the doctrines propagated in the lecture were subversive of the Christian religion. Mr. Berghell lodged an appeal to a superior court, which doubtless would have quashed the sentence, but unfortunately he lacked means to proceed with it, and so the sentence was confirmed. He was then arrested and sent to the prison at Malmo, on the sound, to undergo the punishment. While there, it seems the government authorities at Stockholm found out that Berghell had been born in Finland, and was, therefore, not a Swedish subject. A bright idea then occurred to them, by the carrying out of which this troublesome young enthusiast could be got rid of.

"There exists a convention between Sweden and Russia for the mutual surrender of criminals belonging to either nation; and Berghell being now a criminal in the eyes of the law, having been condemned to imprisonment, it was decided to send him over to Russia as soon as his prison term was completed. Poor Berghell, on being acquainted with this decision, and having probably the mines of Siberia before his mental vision, pleaded hard to be allowed to go to England or America; but no, the 'ukase' had gone forth from Stockholm, and to his native land he must go. Last Wednesday morning, accordingly, he was conducted by the Swedish police to Copenhagen, there to be put on board the steamer Nidaros, leaving for Hango, in Finland; and now comes almost the most disgraceful part of the proceedings.

"On arriving on Danish ground, Berghell claimed to be free, and refused to move further, but the Danish police were only too ready to lend a willing hand. Their conduct was most shameful, for Berghell had infringed no Danish law, his offense only being that he had religious views differing from those of the Swedish clergy. Berghell was induced to enter a cab to be driven to a police-station, but instead he was taken to the steamer and pushed on board (kidnapped, indeed), a Swedish police officer accompanying him to Russia. It is most distressing to read in the Copenhagen papers that he looked like a man whose tale of life was told, and one can not help shuddering for the fate that may await him.

"On the evening of the same day a question was asked in the Swedish Second Chamber of the Riksdag about the reasons of the Government for this expulsion, but the chamber decided with one hundred and sixteen votes to eighty-three that the question should not be put, and of course, literally speaking, the Government has kept within the letter of the law."
