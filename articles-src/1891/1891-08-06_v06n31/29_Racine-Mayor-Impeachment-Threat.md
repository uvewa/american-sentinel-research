MINISTERS and others interested in the Sunday movement at Racine, Wisconsin, are threatening to impeach the mayor of the city because he does not enforce the Sunday laws. The mayor has told them that he will not close the saloon on Sunday nor stop Sunday baseball, and that they can commence impeachment proceedings as soon as they please.
