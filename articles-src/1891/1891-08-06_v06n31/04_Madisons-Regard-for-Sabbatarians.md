It was a noble characteristic of our early statesmen that they regarded all sects equal, or, in other words, they regarded all persons in whatever sect as equally entitled to carry out their religious views. It was not the spirit of the modern Sunday-law agitator who would allow the Christian to keep the day of his choice sacred and compel all others to do so too; but it was freedom for the Christian, freedom for the Jew, freedom for the pagan, and freedom for the agnostic. Madison, at different times, had occasion to express himself in reference to the Jew being on "perfect equality" with the Christian, and in the following letter he expresses it as his opinion that such a course is the surest way of securing ultimate harmony. He writes to a Jewish Rabbi, closing as follows:—

> Having ever regarded the freedom of religious opinions and worship as equally belonging to every sect, and the secure enjoyment of it as the best human provision for bringing all into the same way of thinking or into that mutual charity which is the only substitute, I observe with pleasure the views you give of the spirit in which your sect [the Jewish people] partake of the blessings offered by our Government and laws.

If the principles of the Constitution were adhered to it would not be necessary to publish the news of the arrest of some Sabbatarian every now and then, simply because some Sunday keeper takes a dislike to his ideas and actions in reference to the fourth commandment. Ever since their adoption the Sabbatarian, both Jew and Christian, has unqualifiedly approved and heartily supported American principles—especially allowing every one to do as he pleases in religious matters so long as he does not interfere with the same right in others. Why can not the Sunday keepers do the same, and leave the Sabbatarian unmolested in his seventh-day worship and first-day work? It always gave Madison pleasure to see American principles carried out, and the "blessings offered by our Government and laws" appreciated.
