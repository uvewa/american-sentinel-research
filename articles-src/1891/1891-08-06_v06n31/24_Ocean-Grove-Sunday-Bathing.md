"If Nobody Sees You. How to Bathe Conscientiously on Sunday at Ocean Grove," is the heading given by the Sun to the following dispatch:—

> Asbury Park, July 26.—The Bible class of the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association meets every Sunday afternoon during the summer. It is conducted by the Rev. Dr. John Hanlon. A question box is one of the features of the meetings. Dr. Hanlon reads the questions and then answers them.

> Dr. Hanlon read and answered questions to-day as follows:—

> Question.—Is it wrong to bathe on Sunday, if you have no other time?

> Dr. Hanlon.—To bathe here, where it is against the rule, would be wrong; but if you have no other time, and nobody will see you, it's no harm.

> Question.—How can the ministers advocate Sabbath observances calling it a day of rest, yet some who will speak to-morrow are now traveling by train and by boat to reach here?

> Dr. Hanlon.—If a man cannot preach without traveling on the Sabbath he had better not preach at all. I, for one, do not advocate Sunday traveling.

> Question.—Is James A. Bradley consistent when he tries to stop the sale of cigars and soda by the storekeepers on Sunday, and yet rents lands to a man who sells mineral water on Sunday; also rents his bathing houses and does all he can to increase his profits?

> Dr. Hanlon.—I am not James A. Bradley's judge; you must take him to a higher court.

Another dispatch of the same date published in the World of July 27, says that notwithstanding Mr. Bradley's announcement that he would stop Sunday traffic, business was carried on as usual, and Mr. Bradley's employee rented bathing suits during the early morning hours to all applicants.
