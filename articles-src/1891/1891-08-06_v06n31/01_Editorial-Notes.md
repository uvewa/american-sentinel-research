In Chicago, Union meetings are being held every Sunday in different parts of the city, and the ministers at least, are working very earnestly to create sentiment in favor of a rigid Sunday closing of the Fair, which will, if accomplished, add strength, they think, to the agitation for a national Sunday law.

This disposition to resort to force to effect reforms, either real or imaginary, has reached a development in this country which is ominous. The National Reformers have long since warned those who oppose them that if necessary resort will be had to the ballot; the more radical Prohibitionists talk of resort to arms to wipe out the saloons; American Sabbath Union speakers have declared that if their theories are not adopted by the Government, a Tennessee mob of mature laws threatens violence against Italian fruit dealers; a pledge for the repeal of the law permitting the letting of contracts, while from Lexington comes the news that at a meeting in the Grand Opera House, in New Orleans, the other day, Rev. Dr. B. I. Imes, of the Grand Avenue Church of the South, delivered a thrilling arraignment of the lottery, and declared that its people should and would, if necessary, resort to revolution to overthrow it. "Those of arms," he said, "have signed a resolution to shed their blood, if necessary, in order to free Louisiana from this great gambling institution." In view of this, it is perhaps not telling that "Parkerson, who led the lynchers who [page 241] eleven Italians were shot down in the parish prison of New Orleans, has recently come out as an anti-lottery man."

The lottery, and the convict contract labor-system, and the saloon ought to go, but the methods invoked to destroy them are none the less dangerous. Government by chance and by mobs is the worst kind of a substitute for constitutional government; but it is the outgrowth which is being made in this country; and the responsibility when it has been made will lie at the door of various reforms, real and so-called.
