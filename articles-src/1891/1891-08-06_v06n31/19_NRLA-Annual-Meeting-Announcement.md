THE National Religious Liberty Association will hold its next regular annual meeting at Battle Creek, Michigan, August 13, 1891. The importance of the work of the Association is becoming more and more apparent. All the members are delegates, and we trust that a good representation will be present.

By Order of the Executive Board,

A. O. Tait, Cor. Sec'y.
