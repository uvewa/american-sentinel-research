The Philadelphia Record says:—

> Connecticut has had a severe attack of Sabbatarianism, under the influence of which a few of the restless zealots in various cities of the State are making themselves ridiculous and rendering many other people very uncomfortable. In contemplating these strange retrocessions in the evil days of intolerance the philosophical mind is sometimes led to question whether, after all, the knowledge of and regard for true liberty have increased in New England since the misty years when wicked witches were hanged, and unlucky Quakers' ears were nailed to the town pump.

The truth is, this revival of intolerant religious legislation is not confined to Connecticut. Pennsylvania and Philadelphia are not exempt from the same craze for a legal religion. In the convention of the Sabbath Union just held at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, Lewis K. Vail, a lawyer of Philadelphia, declared the Pennsylvania Act of 1794 on Sunday observance to be "all right," and gloried in the failure of an attempt in the last Legislature to weaken its force. "The Sunday laws," said he, "must be kept on the statute books and men sent as legislators who will retain them and enact better and stricter if necessary."

Dr. Fernley, also, Secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, wanted to fence in himself and the city of Philadelphia, the Record not excepted—"with a ten board fence—each board a commandment of the Lord." Such a fence would be a National Reform improvement on the chains which once closed Philadelphia streets on Sunday.
