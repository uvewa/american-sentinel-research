"DID the apostles ever persecute any one, or did Christ ever deliver any one over to the secular power? Christ commands us to flee persecutors. Matt. 10:23. Thou who callest thyself a disciple of Christ oughtest not to imitate the evil deeds of the heathen. Think you thus to serve God—by destroying with your own hand? Ye err, ye err, poor mortals, if ye believe this; for God has not executioners for his priests. Christ persecutes no one; for he was for inviting, not forcing men to the faith; and when the apostles complained to him of the founders of separate parties (Luke 9:50), he said to them: 'He who is not against us, is for us;' and so too Paul, in Philippians 1:18. Our Lord Christ says: 'No man can come unto me, unless the Father, who hath sent me, draw him.' But why do you not permit every man to follow his own free will, since God, the Lord himself, has bestowed this free will on man? He has simply pointed out to man the way to righteousness, that none might be lost through ignorance. Christ, in dying for men, has given Christians the example to die, but not to kill. Christ teaches us to suffer wrong, not to requite it. The apostle tells of what he had endured, not of what he had done to others."—Donatist Bishop Petilian.—Neander's Church History, Vol. 2, pages 247, 248, Fourteenth American Edition.

"God created man free, after his own image. How am I to be deprived of that by human lordship, which God has bestowed on me? What sacrilege, that human arrogance should take away what God has bestowed, and idly boast of doing this in God's behalf. It is a great offense against God, when he is defended by men. What must he think of God, who would defend him with outward force? Is it that God is unable to punish offenses against himself? Hear what the Lord says: 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you.' The peace of the world must be introduced among contending nations by arms. The peace of Christ invites the willing with wholesome mildness; it never forces men against their wills. The Almighty God employed prophets to convert the people of Israel; he enjoined it not on princes; the Saviour of souls, the Lord Christ, sent fishermen, and not soldiers, to preach his faith."—Donatist Bishop Gaudentius.—Ibid, page 248.
