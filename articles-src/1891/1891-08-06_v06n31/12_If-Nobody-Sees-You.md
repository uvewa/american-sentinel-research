"If Nobody Sees You. How to Battle Conscientiously on Sunday at Ocean Grove," is the leading given by the *Sun* to the following dispatch:—

*Asbury Park, Aug. 2.*—The Bible class of the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association meets some brave villainous efforts during the summer, is conducted by the Rev. Sir John Hadden. A case that came to a law of the features of the meeting, is as follows. He Hadde and answered questions of persons.

*Question.*—Is it wrong to bathe on Sunday, if one does not do it publicly?

Dr. Hadden.—To bathe here, where it is against the law of the place in which you have your habitation, and nobody will see you, it's no harm.

*Question.*—But, then, if they see a Sabbath observant-one calling it a day of rest, yet are they, who will speak to anyone now are travelling by roads and by foot to reuch here?

Dr. Hadden.—If a man cannot preach without traveling on the Sabbath he had better not preach at all. I for one do not advocate Sunday travel services.

—Is James A. Bradley consistent when [page 248] he tries to stop the sale of cigars and soda by the storekeepers on Sunday, and yet treats them like a man who will-conceived water on Sunday; also runs his bathing business and he on not let the man increase his pathos.

Dr. Hadden.—I am not James A. Bradley's judge; your must take him to a higher court.

Another dispatch of the same date published in the *World* of July 27, says that notwithstanding Mr. Bradley's announcement that he would stop Sunday traffic, business was carried on as usual, and Mr. Bradley's employer rented bathing suits during the early morning hours to all comers.
