A few days since Rev. McClain, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, said in the course of a sermon, that this Sabbath movement is about to take its place among the great American movements, by a union of all the believers in Sabbath reform, and intimated that a great national party would be formed on that issue. A circular letter has just been sent to every evangelical minister in the United States, soliciting his co-operation in this Sunday movement.

Of late it is being argued that all should arouse to earnest action, because those in favor of opening the World's Fair on Sunday are really depriving the people of their religious liberty.

Any one who will read the foregoing items and not see that there is cause for serious reflection in regard to this question, is certainly not familiar with the facts of history. The religion of Jesus Christ does not interfere with human liberties, but, on the other hand, it alone makes men free indeed; but ecclesiasticism, calling itself Christianity, has often caused the most cruel persecutions in the name of Him who said to the ardent Peter, "Put up thy sword." Is not the spirit of Peter seen in some of the movements of our day and country? We are often quietly assured that there is no danger. But when a national movement is seriously talked of, and when a national circular is sent out asking assistance in securing the observance of a day of religious rest, is it not time for us to open our eyes and look around? It will be said that they do not want the religious Sunday enforced, only the "civil," "American" day is desired; but the religious phase of Sunday is as inseparably connected with it as the crimson dye in the wool. And it would be just as reasonable to make a great parade of the good offices of wool, even though it be dyed red, and extol its great benefits for the laboring man especially, and everybody in general, and urge that all be compelled to wear garments made from wool and say no account is to be made of the crimson coloring matter. But it is there, nevertheless, and no amount of washing or rubbing or scouring will take it out. You must destroy the whole fabric if you get rid of the color. Just so with Sunday. The religious coloring matter has been so thoroughly soaked into all its particles by its continued associations from the age of Constantine till the present day, that it would completely destroy the proposed Sunday rest day if the religion was taken out of it. Says Dr. Crafts, "take the religion out [of Sunday] and you take the rest out."

It sounds very nice, unless we think of it closely, to talk of a civil American Sunday. But as surely as such a thing is ever secured and enforced by law it will have another adjective greatly emphasized and prefixed, and it will be enforced as the civil American RELIGIOUS Sunday. It could not possibly be otherwise. When an institution is really composed of but one element it is useless to talk of requiring its observance without having that element in it.

Let those who believe they should observe Sunday do so if they like. But compel no one to observe any religious institution. Such a thing cannot be done without serious harm growing out of it.
