# Uncertainties - American Sentinel (1891-08-06) Volume 06, Number 31

## General Note

This issue presented **extreme difficulty** in transcription. The scan quality is very poor throughout all 8 pages, with small, dense text in narrow columns that is frequently illegible or ambiguous. Many words and phrases throughout the issue were reconstructed based on context rather than clear letter-by-letter reading. The transcriptions should be considered LOW to MEDIUM confidence overall and require thorough verification against a higher-quality scan or the original document.

## Overall Assessment

This issue requires verification against a better quality scan. The extreme difficulty of the scans means that while the general sense and structure of each article has been captured, individual words and phrases throughout should be treated as uncertain. Priority articles for re-verification:
1. "The Church and the State" (longest article, many uncertainties)
2. "Madison's Regard for Sabbatarians" (very difficult to read)
3. "National Reform Sympathy" (extensive quoted material that is unclear)
4. "Dangers of Over-Legislation" (long article with many uncertain passages)
