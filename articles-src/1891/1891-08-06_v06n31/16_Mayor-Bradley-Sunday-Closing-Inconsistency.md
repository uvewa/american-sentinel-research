MAYOR BRADLEY, of Asbury Park, New Jersey, has issued a general order for the closing of all business on Sunday. Nevertheless, Sunday, July 26, the druggists sold cigars and soda water all day. The cigar and candy stores in the hotels also did a good business. A Saratoga water fountain, on property owned by Mr. Bradley, supplied all customers, while, until ten o'clock, Mr. Bradley's own employees rented bathing suits to all applicants, and among his patrons were many young people from Ocean Grove. The Sunday papers were also sold along the beach.

Any reasonable-minded person would think that the ludicrous inconsistencies, developed in the attempt to enforce Sunday and other religious laws, would open the minds of the promoters to the civil impropriety of all such legislation; but whom the god of this world would destroy he first makes mad.
