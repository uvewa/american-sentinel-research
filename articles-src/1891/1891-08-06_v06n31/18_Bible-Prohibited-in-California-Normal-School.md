THE Directors of the State Normal School at San Jose, California, passed a resolution some time ago prohibiting the reading of the Bible as a part of the exercises in the school. Their action was reported to the Evangelical Alliance by a director who voted against the resolution, and was much pained by its adoption. The subject was brought up at the last meeting of the Alliance, and a committee was appointed to consider the matter. Rev. John Kimball, a member of the committee, said recently to a reporter of the San Francisco Examiner: "The committee has not met as yet, and I do not know what it will do. I have no information about the reasons for the action of the Normal School Directors, but I suppose it was only another manifestation of the policy that has left the Bible out of the public schools of the State. It is to be regretted very much that the Directors took such action. The Normal School trains the teachers who are to take charge of the education of the children of the State, and they ought to be fitted to give the children moral and religious education."
