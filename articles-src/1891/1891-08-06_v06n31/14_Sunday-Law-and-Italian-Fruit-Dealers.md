The Chief of Police of Hartford, Connecticut, enforced the Sunday law against the Italian fruit stands a few weeks ago, and the result has been to arouse an intense religious zeal in the Italian heart, being now debarred from selling bananas on Sunday they devote this time to assisting in the enforcement of Sunday closing of business in general. What an effective method of Christianizing the ungodly, the National Reformers have discovered!

Exhorted by City Attorney Browning the fruit dealers of Norwich, Connecticut, are also experiencing the same kind of religion, with the exception of Elias Raphael, a Hebrew, whose shop is closed until sunset on the seventh day according to the commandment of the Bible, and open all day Sunday contrary to the commandment of man. How long will it be before a Russian ukase will be asked for in the case of the Jew of Norwich?
