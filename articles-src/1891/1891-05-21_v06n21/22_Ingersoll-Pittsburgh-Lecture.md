A PITTSBURG dispatch of the 11th inst. says:

Col. Robert G. Ingersoll may not lecture in Pittsburg. Mr. J. O. Brown, Chief of the Department of Public Safety, has set his foot down on Sunday lectures where an admission fee is charged. The Chief received a letter from David Henderson, manager of the Duquesne Theater in Chicago, asking whether it would be in accordance with the law of Pittsburg to have Mr. Ingersoll deliver one of his lectures on Sunday night at the theater. Chief Brown replied as follows:—

"In answer to yours of the 8th inst. I would reply that it would be directly contrary to law for Mr. Ingersoll to lecture upon the Saldedi day or evening where an admission is charged. I hope you will not attempt to have such a lecture delivered, for it would be my imperative duty to prevent the same. This letter is written after consultation with the attorney of this department with reference to the law."

Chief Brown, in speaking on the subject, said: "I am unalterably opposed to opening the doors any wider on the Sunday question. We have freedom enough, and lectures of this kind are only gotten up for money, and I think we might as well open the theaters for theatrical performances as a lecture of the kind Mr. Ingersoll would naturally give."

Fine Sunday law that! Great possibilities are certainly bound up in it.
