## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible.

We believe in the right of every man to a free exercise of his civil and religious convictions.

We believe in the separation of the civil and religious departments of government.

We believe it is the right of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Every civil right of every citizen of this government is guaranteed by the Constitution; and we are opposed to any legislation, national or State, which is designed to determine, foster or enforce any religious observance whatever.

We believe it is un-American, unchristian, and sinful to deprive any person of his civil rights on account of his religious belief, and we are opposed to the use of civil power to enforce religious observance.

We believe that all attempts to unite Church and State are inimical to the best interests of both, and are subversive of human rights; and we are opposed to any union of Church and State.

We believe that all rightful authority in government is derived from the people, and should be exercised for the protection of civil rights alone.

We believe that every civil right may be properly exercised on every day of the week.

We believe in the golden rule, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them;" and in the principle embodied in the motto, "Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political."
