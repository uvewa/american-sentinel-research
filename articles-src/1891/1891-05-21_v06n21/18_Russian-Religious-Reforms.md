A CORRESPONDENT of the Observer, says:

The sects which have broken from the Russian Church number between one and two hundred. An American missionary, who is familiar with Russia, assured me that there were even now as many as one hundred and seventy-five of these dissenting bodies, and they contain three million members. They arose at the time of Peter the Great, and were one manifestation of the objection of the people to the arbitrary and sweeping reforms which he inaugurated and enforced.

Which is another evidence of the impossibility of effecting moral and religious reforms by law.
