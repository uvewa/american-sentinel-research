THE ministers of Cincinnati are waging quite a war on Sunday baseball. The Enquirer states that it looks as though there will be no baseball Sundays. Is it possible for a purely civil law to make anything a crime when done one day in the week, that when done on another day ministers and all can enjoy as perfectly harmless? This civil Sunday farce is so thin that it can be seen through from all sides.
