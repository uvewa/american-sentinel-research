THE *Mail and Express* remarks that a great deal of trouble is written about closing the Metropolitan Museum on Sundays. We have often thought as much while reading the insane editorials which appear in that paper upon this subject. We are glad that Editor Shepard sees it himself; now, of course he will come to add to this respect much to the relief of the reading public.
