UNDER a decision of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island a bequest based upon the religious belief of the beneficiaries falls to the ground. One, Joseph Greene, a Quaker, was greatly disturbed during his latter years by members of his family marrying outside the pale of the Society, and he attempted by his will to bestow his estate for the benefit of those persons whom he considered Orthodox Friends or Wilberites, as distinguished from the schismatic branches of the Society. The argument of the contestants of the will was that while it might be possible to ascertain one's religious professions, it is not within capabilities of human determination to ascertain belief, that being a subjective state which has no unerring external marks which may be passed upon. This position was sustained. "So that," remarks the Christian at Work, "whether Quaker or of 'the world's people,' if you would have your money go only into the hands of orthodoxy—that is, your doxy—you must place it there during your lifetime, for the courts will not undertake to place it there when your tombstone is set up."
