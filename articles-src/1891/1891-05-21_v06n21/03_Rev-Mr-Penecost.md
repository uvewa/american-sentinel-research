NOTICE the fact that the Rev. Mr. Penecost, the agent of the American Bible Society, has not been in prison in California for eight months for holding religious services according to the Protestant standard, has been released, the *Presbyterian* asks:—

> How shall he be equal for equality of opinion in religion in the midst of civilization?

Upon this, the *Christian at Work* says:

> We see and. We cannot be mistaken in never having taken our naturalization papers. On it would be well that every missionary of an American Missionary or Bible society should be required

to decline. Then in the event of unjust injuries our Government would be heard from.

Yes; Mr. Penecost ought by all means to have taken out naturalization papers either in this country or Russia, because either Government could have no consistently demanded reforms from Persia noting that they never allow protection for conscience' sake in their own domination? The graves should at least be upon upon the grave of the last victim of religious persecution of this country before we talk of demanding compensations for sufferers from religious intolerance and hate in other lands.
