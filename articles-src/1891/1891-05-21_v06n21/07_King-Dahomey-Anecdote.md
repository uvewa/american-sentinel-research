A SEA captain, trading regularly to the African coast, says an exchange, was invited to meet a committee of a society for the evangelization of Africa. After numerous questions touching the habits and religion of the African races, he was asked:

"Do the subjects of King Dahomey keep Sunday?"

"Keep Sunday?" he replied, "yes, and every other thing they can lay their hands on."
