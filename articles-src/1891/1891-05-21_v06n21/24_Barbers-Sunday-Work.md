THE Sun has the following note which is significant in view of the changes which have been rung by certain unscrupulous Sunday-law advocates upon the demand of certain barbers for only six days' work with seven days' pay:—

Every humane man must sympathize with the barbers employed in the up-town shops, when it is known that they get no more pay than the downtown barbers and yet have to work until 9 o'clock at night, and on Sundays until 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The down-town barbers get the same pay, $12 or $13 a week, and are free at night and on Sundays. But now comes the strangest news. The down-town barbers consider themselves very ill used by Fate if they can not find an up-town shop in which to work on Sunday for an extra $2.

We believe that we have before remarked that there is a good deal of humling about the demand for Sunday laws in the interest of barbers and others accustomed to do more or less Sunday work.
