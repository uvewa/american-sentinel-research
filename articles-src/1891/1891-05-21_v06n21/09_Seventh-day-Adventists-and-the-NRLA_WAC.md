## Seventh-day Adventists and the National Religious Liberty Association.

THAT Seventh-day Adventists are the progressive and prime movers of the National Religious Liberty Association will neither be concealed nor denied by any of its members. There could be no reason for such concealment or denial. There would be no more use in denying this idea than there would be in denying that Methodists are the first step in forming of the American Anti-Slavery Union, or in denying that the Reformed Presbyterians are the originators of the National Reform Association. And what is more, when we come to examine the principles, and objects of these different organizations, we find that so far as the denomination are concerned, there is far more cause for shame in the first case than in either of the latter; for while the objects and work of the latter two organizations named, are directly subversive of civil and religious liberty, and, though unintentionally so it may be, tend directly toward a union of Church and State, the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association is to call the attention of the people to the time principles of civil and religious liberty, and sound a note of warning against the uniting, in this country, of Church and State.

Rev. Z. R. H. Ward, a prominent Methodist minister, of South Dakota, attempted to criticize the National Religious Liberty Association, in the *Parker* (South Dakota) *Press,* of March 14, 1891, the following manner. He said:—

> It is simply the Seventh day Adventists carrying on that controversies under different aliases as the National Religious Liberty Association. The *American Sentinel,* etc.

It is stated simply in the same paper, under date March 28, as follows:—

> That Seventh-day Adventists are the organizers of this Association is true; but it is also true that more than one-half of its members are those who agree with it, and advocate its principles. A letter just received from West Sanctuary, Pennsylvania, dated March 14, 1891, says:—

> Last October I sent you one dollar to pay my annual membership. I have just received the SENTINEL for which I am very thankful. I was converted to the principles of the National Religious Liberty Association in the summer of 1889, and since then have done all I could to advance the cause.

> As to aliases, we might inquire why Mr. Ward himself, does not drop his aliases, and let it be known as he is, Rev. Z. R. Ward of the Methodist Episcopal Church [by the way the writer has signed himself simply Z. R. W.]; and that church, in 1888, took the initiative in the movement to organize, and has ever since been called the American Sabbath Union, the object of which, according to article I of its Constitution, is "to preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship," and to seek to preserve it also in the military? To be ashamed of any of these things, the means resorted to bring the controversy into disrepute, should not forget that he has a demonstration of the error he defends. There are thousands of arguments as much right to form an association to oppose religious legislation as the Methodists, to form one to seek legislation.

If the principles are sound, the originators and advocates of them need not be ashamed to show their colors. And if of the Declaration of Principles of the National Religious Liberty Association, Mr. Ward, in the *Parker Press* of April 11, is forced to say:

> The Declaration of Principles is quite commendable. They are very good. They are them that are all originated founding of Christians and churches. It is just what the Methodist Episcopal Church believes, and what the American Sabbath Union is organized to protect and defend.

This is why we replied:—

Well, we wonder! Then, wherein is the cause for discommendation? But let us see. Let us read it from another stand point. We do say the right of every individual to maintain his religious convictions and express them as he pleases, is one of these principles. Well if that is, why is it they are demanding the civil power and its laws to restrict a national the civil coercion of for certain State Sunday laws, when we have no established upon a religious institution.

We think from the above it will be seen that there is no similarity whatever between the different organizations as such, or between the religious demonstrations which gave birth to them, the question simply narrows itself down to the principles and objects of each association, and trust, after all, be settled upon its merits. If the objects of the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association are bad, they cast just as much reflection upon the denominations which originated them as they are of the other hand, the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association are good, by so much, has the denomination which gives it birth whereof to be proud. And the fact that members of other denominations can indorse the principles of the National Religious Liberty Association, become members of it, and engage in the distribution of its literature, and that even its avowed enemies are forced to confess that its principles are good, speaks volumes in its behalf.

W. A. COLCORD.
