THE Mail and Express remarks that "a great deal of twaddle is written about opening the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday." We have often thought as much while reading the inane editorials which appear in that paper upon this subject. We are glad that Editor Shepard sees it himself now; of course he will cease to offend in this respect much to the relief of the reading public.
