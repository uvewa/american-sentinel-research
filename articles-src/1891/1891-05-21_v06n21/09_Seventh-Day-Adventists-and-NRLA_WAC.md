THAT Seventh-day Adventists are the progenitors and prime movers of the National Religious Liberty Association should neither be concealed nor denied by any member of the Association or of the denomination. There could be no more use in denying this than there could be in denying that Methodist took the first step in the organization of the American Sabbath Union, or in denying that the Reformed Presbyterians are the originators of the National Reform Association. And what is more, when we come to examine the principles and objects of these different organizations, we find that so far as the denominations are concerned, there is no more cause for shame in the first case than in either of the latter two; while the principles and work of the latter two organizations named, are directly subversive of civil and religious liberty, and, though unintentionally so it may be, tend directly toward a union of Church and State, the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association are to call the attention of the people to the true principles of civil and religious liberty, and sound a note of warning against the uniting, in this country, of Church and State.

Rev. Z. R. Ward, a prominent Methodist minister, of South Dakota, attempted to criticize the National Religious Liberty Association, in the Parker (South Dakota) Press, of March 14, 1891, in the following manner. He said:—

It is simply the Seventh-day Adventists carrying on their controversies under different aliases, as the National Religious Liberty Association, *The American Sentinel*, etc.

To this we replied in the same paper, under date March 28, as follows:—

That Seventh-day Adventists are prime movers in this Association is true; but it is also true that members of other denominations are also connected with it, and advocate its principles. A letter just received from West Sunbury, Pennsylvania, dated March 12, 1891, says:—

Last October I sent you one dollar to have my name enrolled as a member of the National Religious Liberty Association, for which I have been given the benefits, for therefore, I hope you will entrust me with leaflets and literature for distribution. I think I could do a good work in the Presbyterian Church, of which I am a member. I was a subscriber to *The American Sentinel* in Oakland and ever since, and approve its teachings, all but its leasing toward the seventh-day Sabbath. I shall look for literature.

As to aliases, we might inquire why Mr. Ward does not come with his full name, and tell us that he is Rev. Z. R. Ward, of the Methodist Episcopal Church [to his articles he signed himself simply "Z. R. W."], and that that church, in 1888, took the initiatory steps in organizing an association called the American Sabbath Union, the object of which, according to article 3 of its Constitution, is "to preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship," and to seek to preserve it thus by law? Is he ashamed of any of these things? He seems anxious to bring the controversy into denominational lines. But when he does this, he should not forget that he has a denomination of his own to defend. Have not Seventh-day Adventists as much right to form an association to oppose religious legislation as have the Methodists to form one to favor such legislation?

If the principles are sound, the originators and advocates of them need not be ashamed to show their colors. And of the Declaration of Principles of the National Religious Liberty Association, Mr. Ward, in the Parker Press of April 11, is forced to say:—

This Declaration of Principles is quite unobjectionable. . . . They are very good. They are just such as all evangelical churches of Christendom believe in. It is just what the Methodist Episcopal Church believes in, and what the American Sabbath Union is organized to protect and defend.

To this we replied:—

Well, we wonder! Then, where is the cause for disagreement? But let us see. Let us read the fourth Principle: "We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions." Does Mr. Ward and the Methodist Church endorse this? If so, why is it they are demanding the civil Government to enact a national Sunday law, and clamoring for stricter State Sunday laws, when such laws are legislation upon a religious question?

We think from the above it will be seen that whether the controversy comes between the different organizations as such, or between the religious denominations which gave birth to them, the question simply narrows itself down to the principles and objects of each association, and must, after all, be settled upon its merits. If the objects of the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association are bad, they cast just so much reflection upon the denomination which originated them; and if, on the other hand, the objects of the National Religious Liberty Association are good, by so much has the denomination which gave it birth whereof to be proud. And the fact that members of other denominations can endorse the principles of the National Religious Liberty Association, become members of it, and engage in the distribution of its literature, and that even its avowed enemies are forced to confess that those principles are good, speaks volumes in its behalf.
