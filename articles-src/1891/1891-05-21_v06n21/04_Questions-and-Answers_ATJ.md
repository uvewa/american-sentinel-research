## Questions and Answers.

We have received from a friend in another State, a series of questions called out essentially by our discussion of Mr. Rosborne's book on "Ethics for Society and Schools," with the request that the questions be answered in THE SENTINEL, for the benefit of the writer and others. We willingly comply.

*Question.*—"Is this, please, to treat morality as the ten commandments? And if so on what is it based to put the delivery of the law at Sinai?

*Answer.*—True morality is based on the ten commandments. Yet not merely upon speaking the ten commandments are they the expression of the supreme moral rule. They are the summary of all morality, because they are the expression of the will of God. For says Romans 7:14, this "law will be living instruction out of the law;" and the law there referred to, as the context plainly shows, is the law which teaches that men should not steal, should not commit adultery; nor idolatry. Men delight to do the will of God only when his law is written in their hearts. Psalm 40:8. These texts, with many others which might be cited, show plainly that the law of God, the ten commandments, is the expression of the will of God in respect to character, and God's will is supreme morality, because it is the expression of the will of him who is supremely moral.

True morality was based upon the ten commandments before the delivery of the law on Sinai as well as afterward, because the ten commandments existed before Sinai as really as afterward. Abraham knew the will of God, and kept the commandments. (Genesis 26:5). Sin is the transgression of the law of God, and by the law also is the knowledge of sin. [p.162] John 3:4; 1 Romans 3:20. Nor is sin imputed where there is no law, for where there law is, there is no transgression. Romans 4:15 and 5:13. "The law of God, therefore, was known to man before he sinned, and his sin was the transgression of that.

"All unrighteousness is sin" (1 John 5:17), and so sin is the transgression of the law of God, it follows that the law is the expression of the righteousness of God, that is, it is the expression of the supreme rule of right. Accordingly, it is written, "My tongue shall speak of thy words for all thy commandments are righteousness." Psalms 119:172. And "hearken unto me ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law." Isaiah 51:7. Therefore, as the law of God, the ten commandments, is the expression of the will of God, in respect to character, and is the expression of the supreme idea of the right, it stands demonstrated that the ten commandments are the basis and the expression of all true morality or morals.

The delivery of the law at Sinai, therefore, was not by any means the first evidence of the existence of that law. It was there given upon the tables of stone to perform its part in the work of the gospel which was shadowed forth in the sanctuary and its services. For the tables of stone were placed in the Ark of the Covenant beneath the mercy seat in the most holy place, shadowing that the law of God was actually in the institution of Christ in his priesthood, went above once a year in the great day of atonement to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. This "the law was to them oftener eight about. But more

that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness only eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."

The law of God, the ten commandments, are therefore and really are afterword, for it is a truth well and eloquently expressed by Phillips: "The God of nature has written his existence in all his works and his law in the heart of man."—*Decline and Fall, chap. 38, part, 11.*

*Question.*—"If the principle of the moral law as implanted by the Creator in every person's body does it not follow that every person has a ready access within himself?"

*Answer.*—"It does not follow, because all have sinned, transgressed the law, and come short of the glory of God. Morality does not consist in a knowledge of the law of God, but in the doing of it. He has to learn who is in the heart of man, but by transgression man has made himself unrighteous. God has planted in the heart of man a knowledge of morality, a knowledge of right, but by transgression man has made himself immoral, and by that also has obscured the knowledge of morality which was at the first planted therein, and which would have ever remained had man remained moral.

More than this, by his transgression, by his immorality, man has robbed himself of the power to do fully according to the standard of right which every one knows. Every man on earth knows that it is so; therefore we may say without fear to such people as Mr. Rosborne's book that it is not enough for man in this world to know what is right to do, but they must have the power to do the right which they know. This power comes alone by faith in Jesus Christ for the Gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.

This statement is clearly expressed in Romans 1:19-20. "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped; and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin [immorality]. But now the righteousness [the morality] of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness [the morality] of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: for all have sinned, [have become immoral] and come short of the glory of God: being justified [accounted morally] freely by his grace [accounted morally] through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness [his morality] for the remission of sins [immorality] that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness [his morality] that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus." Therefore we have always said and always do say, that outside of a genuine abiding faith in Jesus Christ, there is no such thing as morality in this world.

*Question.*—1st Descartes, Aristotle, Seneca, and many other Greek philosophers teach morality? and if so did they not teach successfully?

*Answer.*—"They taught what they called morality, but they taught but practiced what was really immorality. Solon and Zeno both practiced adultery. The Greek worship of Venus like that of the Babylonians and Egyptian was essentially an open prostitution. The celebration of the mysteries, which was the supreme rite of Greek worship, was but the practice of things unfit to be named, and of which the Scriptures has well spoken that "it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret." Plato taught both the expediency and the lawfulness of prevarication. Aristotle counseled the falsehood of representing fables in particular cases, and Aristotle counseled abortion. Both at Sparta and at Athens the exposure to die, or even the killing of children, who were weak and imperfect in form, was practiced. Customary swearing was commended by the example of Socrates and Plato. Aristippus maintained that it is lawful for a wise man to steal, to commit adultery, and sacrilege when opportunity offered. Menander taught that it is better than a twofold truth. Plato taught that "he may lie, who knows how to do it in a suitable time." And Socrates practiced such lowliness as is fit to be named.

So, far from what the Greek philosophers from teaching morality that they both taught and practiced what would not be allowed in the category of common civility in our day. Indeed, if the Greek philosophers could be set down in the United States society of to-day and made to practice here what they had taught and practiced in Greece, and consider it morality too, the whole group of them would be in the penitentiary inside of a week; and that would be the place for them too. Because American civilization, to say nothing at all of morality, would not countenance it for a day."

*Question* 4 and 5 on cards as simply as they are given:—

"*Q.—4.*—If the teaching of what is called morality is destructive to both the public school and the State, and should not the schools be excluded from the teachers' curriculum, is not a set to teach the pupils to be kind, truthful, honest, industrious, pure, etc. by precept and example, taken from every teacher in our public schools?

"*Answer.*—Not by any means. On the contrary the way is opened for every teacher to do these very things in the way in which only it is proper to teach them, and according to the design of the public school. The public school is designed to accomplish two principal things in the youth of the country.

First, to give them such an education as shall fit them, as citizens or members of [p.163] the body politic, to take care of themselves. It therefore teaches them to read and write, and apply the principles of arithmetic.

Second, to be good citizens. It should therefore teach the principles of citizenship. And this is not to say that they should be taught the principles of the government of which they are to be citizens. What then are the principles and elements of citizenship? Religion? morality and a body of rules of morality? No. The law of the land declares the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. If religion be an element of citizenship, it is only a logical step to religion as a test, as a qualification for office. But again, the supreme law declares that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for holding any office under this Government." If religion be no element of citizenship, it is only a second step at once to say that the Government should define and regulate it. But still the supreme law declares: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Therefore as religion is not in any way an element of citizenship, it can have no place in a course of instruction which is designed to teach the principles and elements of citizenship from religion; it falls in the same category with these principles.

Yet more than this, while in the science of right and wrong, the fact that men should and can't, know right, and such thing as right or wrong, but only civil right, civil and social wrongs, or in that civil virtues and civil vices. The State can not say that God does not punish him because he is doing what is right. The State can only consider the rights of the individual, citizen, and him and a civil wrong. And as the Government of the United States, as well also that of the several States, is founded upon the rights of men, there is an essential and open before all the teachers in the public schools for the teaching of all that pertains to good citizenship under these Governments without entering the field of ethics or such, nor touching the questions that belong to religion.

As the rights of the nation are simply the combined and aggregated rights of the individuals that compose the nation, it follows that the sole object of civil government is simply to establish and protect the rights of each individual in the government, and it may be asked: Why can not the individual protect his own rights? The answer is—he ought in justice and in a true morals, provided that individual has all the advantage of strength, or wealth, or knowledge. Some do, some can not often the case. The arguments put forth are some such advantages of strength, etc., else he will not attempt such aggression. It has the other advantage too, that if knowing his own plans and strength it is easy out of there to exorcise against it ignorance. Then it often happens that greed and lust cause different persons to combine their power and resources to rob one individual of his rights. Against these combinations the person alone would be powerless.

We have seen, then that from this arising out of human imperfection, comes the necessity and the sole necessity of civil government. The ideal civil government, is that under which nothing is oppressed or confiscated, of each individual in the nation to unite with all, under a creed, for the maintenance of the rights of any one, and to unite with all others for the maintenance of the combined rights of the whole when each rights are menaced by other nations. Mark, all this is for the maintaining and protecting of rights. That is the sole necessity.

That is the sublime truth of the immortal Declaration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Here is the idea of what ought to be teaching in the public State schools, and the basis is broad enough and sufficient to build a whole school or prayer to be taught in the public schools. It is the inalienable right of every individual in the Government to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Let all the public school teachers teach to the youth of this Nation, [p.164] and diligently inculcate upon their minds respect for the rights of every other person.

This is the perfect principle of civil government, and if every person in the United States would recognize this principle and practice accordingly, this would be a perfect civil Government. The recognition of this principle and the intelligent understanding of it, ought to be made, not only the public school instruction upon citizenship, but the qualifications for citizenship, in the naturalization of all who make application for admission. When a person acts in anything, in such a way as to interfere with the free possession, by any other person, of its right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, then let it decide the principles upon which the Government takes his own civil notice and it determines his rights in it. Because as rights are equal, what one that has the right to do, another has an equal right to do. The citizen claims the right to act in such a way as to interfere with the free enjoyment of other right to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness, that equal right has an equal right to do the same thing, and it should be done to him by all others; and if he should do that, then all government would be gone and only anarchy reign. Therefore, as the Government is established to secure the equal inalienable rights of men no one can invade the rights of another, to any degree, without at once striking at the foundation of the Government itself.

If these principles be taught to the youth of the country, in the public schools, and there will be much more success in the effort to secure good citizens, and them in their places and the teaching now being done. As it is now, these principles are neglected if not ignored, and by an attempt to introduce what is called morals, neither morality nor good citizenship is secured. As we have shown in the discussion of Mr. Rosborne's book, which is the book now adopted in the Chicago public schools, such teaching is never upon sound principles. The basis of it all is militarianism only, and so was it at the time in the immortal pages. But this is not the only one. The same type of ethics is inculcated in other schools of the country. In the city of Greensboro, Michigan, the youth are taught, just as Rosborne's book teaches, that whatever they think to be right that *is* right, and a child who tells her playmate to throw a child into the river Ganges, also does right.

The same was actually used to illustrate a class in that school. Such teaching as that is open heathenism, and the morals of it that is believed by men, the worse they will be.

Again, how can good citizenship be inculcated better, or in any other way in fact, than by teaching the principles of the government to which the citizen belongs? This is plain enough in itself. Therefore, as the principles of the United States Government are the best on earth, the faithful teaching of these principles will secure the best citizenship. Let the principles of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution of the United States be taught in the public schools, and let questions and principles of morality and religion, be considered and taught in and by the family and the Church.

*Question 7.*—When the teacher produces a pupil by fetching, being wronged, or stealing does not this employ the most superlative method of teaching morality?

*Answer.*—Indeed he does not. Morality never can be secured by punishment. The Lord himself can not make men moral by punishment. To bring men to morality by punishment, is the Augustinian, the inquisitorial, the papal, the programed theory. Augustine's doctrine is that often it is necessary to punish men until they reach the highest stage of religious devotion. That is the theory and practice, and doctrine of the Inquisition. Therefore it was always from love of men's souls and to save their souls that the inquisitors tormented man's bodies. And as a good inquisitor-general said: "The body of the Inquisition could get hold of them, it was necessary to find a place, and invent a scheme of punishment that they were to be dead, so that that might reach this highest standard of religious development; in other words that they might attain to morality, and to purgatory, so that justification for immortality, was established, and they burn as one of the institutional capital penalty. If men could have been made sound by punishment then Christ need never have died.

Our quarrel is probably couched in his idea that this is the most "capitalistic" method of teaching morality, but it is certainly not the most efficient method. Nor is it in fact any method at all properly explained. No, as we have before shown, men have lost morality, by the transgression of the law of God, and it is not in their power in them to attain to it. Consequently, the only power by which they can attain to it, is the power of God which is manifested to men in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Morality in the gift of God through faith in Jesus Christ, and the writing the law of God anew upon the heart by the Spirit of God which is received by faith in Christ, the shedding abroad of the love of God in the heart by the Holy Spirit. This is the only means of bringing men to morality, and the only proper method of teaching morality. Punishment is the penalty inflicted in vindication of the majesty of violated law, but punishment neither changes the disposition, nor bestows power. The love of God does both.

Even if it should be admitted, however, that punishment is an element of moral instruction and a means of inculcating morality, it would still remain a fact that the exercise of it is not the prerogative of man. That would pertain to God alone as being the only one who is capable of truly knowing the measures of moral guilt and the proportion of punishment. Man's assumptions of authority to punish for immorality, established the Inquisition, and that is the logic of every such claim to-day.

*Question 8.*—Does not the teacher of morality teach something when he gives instruction from good books, on physiology, and hygiene, which shows the dire effect of alcohol on the elements of the system, the necessity of fresh air, and the like?

*Answer.*—He does not. A man may study physiology and hygiene all his school days, he may never touch a drop of alcohol; he may bathe three times a day; he may take clean his clothes each time; he may never wear a corset; he may do all these and more such things; yet never be a moral man. In fact, so far as mere sin is concerned, right lasting we apprehend is not a very important element in the immorality which attaches to them. Nor is it immorality that woman by means of tight lacing in order to be esteemed. It is doubtless a foolish practice, but that the elements of morality in him, the interested person is referred to might be exclusive, can give it to him, and he teaches and teaching morality when he gives instruction on these principles.

*Question 9*—Does not the teacher of morality teach something when he teaches the laws of health as connected with the republican form of government, and the general principles contained in the spirit of Independence and the Constitution of the United States?

*Answer.*—He does not. He teaches only civility. The principles of justice of justice connected with any government on earth, is only such as is comprehended in, and as it therefore only civility. And this principle, as connected in the principles of government which is framed on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, the teaching of the principles, and the practice of the principles there set forth is the practice of civility. It is the principle of justice comprehended, by just which alone is the distinction and which is up to the standard of civility. God's justice is the ideal or faculty in civil government, which applies to equal the nature which is recorded to be only on man's comprehension of the principles of right in relation to his fellow-men. Therefore civil government in all any earthly government ever can, and is all should ever attempt to be anything. For its attempting to be more, it always fails.

We know that in many instances men use the term morality when they mean just what we mean by the term civility. When such is the meaning in their use of the term, we agree with all that they may say about it; but we never can consent to call it morality. Morality is infinitely a deeper [p.164] and a broader term than is the term civility, and in fact is something infinitely distinct from that of civility. Therefore, we again emphasize the distinction which there is between them, and which should always be made and recognized between them.

We know that the term morality has become, to a considerable extent, established in usage in a sense in which it makes morality not civility, but is sort of sentimentalized theoretical something which all theorize may have formed for themselves, meaning much more than civility and infinitely less than morality. But morality in image or wrong. It comes down to one time from the time when the Papacy was supreme and when according those of this had stopped. And he stopped all the calling out of all things pertaining to the Church and to the State, of the civil and the religious; when in short everything was laid to be moral, according to the papal idea of morality. And now every who looked into the matter of those times, knows full well that under that standard and in that papal system there never was any such thing as morality or civility.

Moral government is God's government. Morality is the realm of God. He is the Author and the conservator of. Civil government is ordinance of God, and its supremacy is civil only. For you may constantly insist upon a clear distinction in the terms morality and civility and in doing so occupy Protestant ground. Augustinian in 11th declared no rules. This statement is clearly expressed in Romans 1:19-20.

This is Protestant truth. It is Christian truth. It is God's truth. And as we Protestants and Christian and worshippers of the Most High God, we insist upon maintaining a distinction between the temporal and the secular, the moral and the civil; rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's and to God the things that are God's.
