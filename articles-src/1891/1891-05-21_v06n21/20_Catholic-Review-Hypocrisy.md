SPEAKING of some who make a plea in behalf of the workingmen for the opening of museums on Sunday, the Catholic Review says:—

They are hypocrites in their pretense of consulting the workingmen's comfort and pleasure, for were not Christianity an element in the problem the poor workingman might work half the night and live on grass for all they cared.

This could be said much more truthfully of those who, in the name of the workingmen, demand rigid Sunday closing of everything but the churches, in order, professedly, that the toiling masses may rest; in reality, that those same masses may be constrained to resort to the churches. Political demagoguery is bad enough but religious hypocrisy is doubly despicable.
