## The Use of Civil Government.

In an ideal state of existence, there need be no civil government, for there would be no need of it. For Heaven has no civil government. The only law is that which the angels are amenable to is God's moral, which is the basis of his government of all intelligent beings in his universe. Even this law exercises no arbitrary restraint over the angels, for it is all fulfilled in love, and therefore requires no outward enforcement. For where men's own love for God, and love for their fellows, leads them of their own free will, to do just those things which the law requires, hence all constrainment of legal action is gone. Here is perfect liberty, and this is the only perfect liberty possible to intelligent beings anywhere in the universe of God. When each one, from the most unworthy motive of love, pleases to do just what the law of love requires him to do, then the law is the government of the man's love in love, and each one does just as he pleases. If the law is a just one, there is one time, and only one, that harmonizes the conflicting ideas of perfect confidence and liberty, and that one thing is perfect love. This is the love of God, "that ye keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous." "I delight to do thy will, oh my God;" "yea, thy law is within my heart."

From this it is seen that all approach toward perfect love is a corresponding approach toward possible liberty, and toward the utter uselessness and needlessness of all governmental restraints. Thus in an ideal existence there would be no [p.165] need of government to protect the rights of individuals, for love would be their full protection. There would be no need for an army, or system of police, or police officers, or prisons, or any of the paraphernalia of government, and hence no need of taxes for their support. From this it will be seen that civil government is simply a necessity of an imperfect state of being. It is because men, and societies, and nations of men, are not wholly unselfish, idleness and hate, and not love, that civil government becomes necessary, to protect the rights of the individual, and to maintain the rights of the nation.

In such a state of imperfection as this, the absence of government would be the presence of anarchy and confusion; and therefore God who is a God of order and not of confusion, has ordained civil government for a special purpose. That purpose is simply the maintaining of harmony and of order and protecting the rights of each individual of the nation, and in a general way, the rights of the nation, and protecting the rights of the nation, and inalienable rights from other nations.

As the rights of the nation are simply the combined and aggregated rights of the individuals that compose the nation, it follows that the sole object of civil government is simply to establish and protect the rights of each individual in the government, and it may be asked: Why can not the individual protect his own rights? The answer is—he ought in justice and in a true morals, provided that individual has all the advantage of strength, or wealth, or knowledge. Some do, some can not often the case. The arguments put forth are some such advantages of strength, etc., else he will not attempt such aggression. It has the other advantage too, that if knowing his own plans and strength it is easy out of there to exorcise against it ignorance. Then it often happens that greed and lust cause different persons to combine their power and resources to rob one individual of his rights. Against these combinations the person alone would be powerless.

We have seen, then that from this arising out of human imperfection, comes the necessity and the sole necessity of civil government. The ideal civil government, is that under which nothing is oppressed or confiscated, of each individual in the nation to unite with all, under a creed, for the maintenance of the rights of any one, and to unite with all others for the maintenance of the combined rights of the whole when each rights are menaced by other nations. Mark, all this is for the maintaining and protecting of rights. That is the sole necessity.

That is the sublime truth of the immortal Declaration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Here is the idea of what ought to be teaching in the public State schools, and the basis is broad enough and sufficient to build a whole school or prayer to be taught in the public schools. It is the inalienable right of every individual in the Government to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

All the Governments of the world could not create a single individual right, neither could they all combined take away a slap from a single soul, for these rights are inalienable. The right still remains, however much of the individual is denied the exercise of it. The legislative function of the government is simply to state those rights in plain unmistakable language or law. The judicial function of the government is to investigate individual cases for the purpose of determining whether those rights as stated by the law have been infringed. The executive department of the government, with its prisons and police, and detectives and sheriffs and higher officers, is solely for the purpose of directing, apprehending, and punishing criminals, i. e., persons who disregard those rights in others. It may be asked, that all this also as a preventive of crime, by furnishing to those who are morally weak, the additional motive of fear, to incline them to regard the rights of others.

From all this it will be seen that all the paraphernalia of government is solely for the purpose of maintaining the individual in the citizens. Not for the purpose of creating rights or taking them away, both of which are impossible, nor for the purpose of adding to or diminishing the individual in the exercise of those rights. The only restriction that can rightfully be made by any civil government, on the exercise of individual rights by such citizens, is such restriction as is implied in the pledge of such citizen to do his part in protecting the rights of each and all. On such restriction, the very existence of government depends. To illustrate, the government demands for its existence on the power to levy taxes for its support.

It may be argued that to compel a man to pay taxes is a restriction of his rights; but if so, it is only such a restriction as it is implied that he agreed to when he became a citizen of the government, and such restriction exists solely for the purpose of taking away his rights, but solely for the purpose of securing them. It is the pledge by which he obtains the government's protection it guarantees. It can not fairly said to be a restriction of a man's rights to compel him to pay the government he has received, any more than to compel him to pay the individual for value received. The same may be said of the power of the government to raise armies, and to compel men to serve in them. In the present imperfect state of human development, the very existence of the nation, as a nation, depends on the power.

It may be said that it is a restriction of individual liberty to draft a man, and compel him to serve in the army; and, indeed, the draft should never be resorted to till the call for volunteers fails to bring a sufficient supply of men for the emergency. Where, however, the nation's existence, and consequently the rights of every individual in the nation, are endangered, the government may then draft men, and compel them to fight to protect their own rights and the rights of their fellows. This is really no restriction of individual rights, for it is simply calling upon all the people to fight for their own rights. If all are not needed in the army, those who stay at home have to provide for the support of those who go outside, and there seems to be a natural law of equalization which in many other ways, compels them to bear their just part in the great struggle for the maintenance of the rights of each and all.

Moreover, it is not a restriction of the man rights to compel a man to fulfil his covenants, and the very existence of a government implies the contract and the pledge of the individual to support it. He would otherwise be at once an outcast and a government to whipsaw witnesses. This power is necessary that the rights of each and all may be maintained; and is therefore included in the implied pledged of each to maintain such, rights, on which pledge the very existence of government depends.

Again I say it is no restriction of human rights to compel the fulfillment of such a pledge. The most that such an individual can demand is a fair remuneration for his services, or compensation for his damages. Under such circumstances, if he refuses to go and witness, it is not that he is trying to maintain his own rights, but that he is trying to infringe the rights of others, or is in sympathy with those who have infringed such rights. Such act becomes a criminal disregard of human rights, and may justly be punished.

From all this it is evident that, without exception, the sole legitimate use and function of a government is to establish and protect rights, never to give or take away rights, both of which are impossible; not to restrict or control people in the exercise of those rights. In so much as it attempts to restrict or direct the individual in the exercise of his rights, it just so much, it exceeds its rightful limits of power, and is just so much it becomes a paternal government.

So much for the use of civil government. The crisis of a patriarchal government will be considered next week; it is an article on the abuses of civil government.
