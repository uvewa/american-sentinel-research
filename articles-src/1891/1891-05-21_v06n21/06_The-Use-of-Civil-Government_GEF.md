In an ideal state of existence, there would be no civil government, for there would be no need of it. Heaven has no civil government. The only law to which the angels are amenable is God's moral law, which is the basis of his government for all intelligent beings in his universe. Even this law exercises no arbitrary restraint over the angelic host, for it is all founded in love, and therefore requires only such service as love dictates. Supreme love for God, and love for their fellows, leads them of their own free will, to do just those things which the law requires, hence all consciousness of legal restraint is gone. Here is perfect liberty, and this is the only perfect liberty possible to intelligent beings anywhere in the universe of God. When each one, from the indwelling motive of love, pleases to do just what the law of love requires him to do, then the law and the government itself is lost in love, and each one does just as he pleases. If the law is a just one, there is one thing, and only one, that harmonizes the conflicting ideas of perfect obedience and liberty, and that one thing is perfect love. This is the love of God, "that ye keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous." "I delight to do thy will, oh my God," why? "yes, thy law is within my heart."

From this it is seen that all approach toward perfect love is a corresponding approach toward possible liberty, and toward the utter uselessness and needlessness of all governmental restraints. Thus in an ideal existence there would be no need of government to protect the rights of individuals, for love would be their full protection. There would be no need for armies, or courts of justice, or police officers, or prisons, or any of the paraphernalia of government, and hence no need of taxes for their support. From this it will be seen that civil government is simply a necessity of an imperfect state of being. It is because men, and societies, and nations of men, are actuated by selfishness and hate, and not love, that civil government becomes necessary to protect the rights of the individual, and to maintain the rights of the nation.

In such a state of imperfection as this, the absence of government would be the presence of anarchy and confusion; and therefore God who is a God of order and not of confusion, has ordained civil government for a special purpose. That purpose is simply the maintaining of harmony and order by protecting the rights of each individual in the nation, and by protecting the rights of the nation against infringement from other nations.

As the rights of the nation are simply the combined and aggregated rights of the individuals that compose the nation, it follows that the sole object of civil government is simply to maintain and protect the rights of each individual in the government. But it may be asked, Why can not the individual protect his own rights? The answer is—he might do it against one individual at a time, provided that individual had no advantage of strength, or wealth, or influence. Such, however, is not often the case. The aggressive party has some such advantage, or imagines he has it, else he would not attempt such aggression. If he has no other advantage, he has that of knowing his own plans and intentions, and of these the party he conspires against is ignorant. Then it often happens that greed and lust cause different individuals to combine their power and influence to rob one individual of his rights. Against their combined aggression he alone would be powerless.

We have seen that from these facts arising out of human imperfection, comes the necessity and the sole necessity of civil government. The ideal civil government, then, is simply the pledge, expressed or understood, of each individual in the nation to unite with all others, if need be, for the maintenance of the rights of any one, and to unite with all others for the maintenance of the aggregated rights of the whole when such rights are menaced by other nations. Mark, all this is for the maintaining and protecting of rights. The rights already exist.

That is the sublime truth of the immortal Declaration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

All the governments of the world could not create a single individual right, neither could they all combined take away a single right from a single soul, for these rights are inalienable. The right still remains, however much or long the individual is denied the exercise of it. The legislative function of the government is simply to state these rights in plain unmistakable language or law. The judicial function of the government is to investigate individual cases for the purpose of determining whether these rights as stated by the law have been infringed. The executive department of the government, with its prisons and police, and detectives and sheriffs and higher officers, is solely for the purpose of detecting, apprehending, and punishing criminals, i. e., persons who disregard these rights in others. It may be added, that all this acts also as a preventive of crime, by furnishing to those who are morally weak, the additional motive of fear, to induce them to regard the rights of others.

From all this it will be seen that all the paraphernalia of government is solely for the purpose of maintaining the individual rights of its citizens. Not for the purpose of giving rights or taking them away, both of which are impossible, nor for the purpose of restricting or directing the individual in the exercise of these rights. The only restriction that can rightfully be made by any civil government, on the exercise of individual rights by each citizen, is such restriction as is implied in the pledge of each citizen to do his part in protecting the rights of each and all. On such restriction, the very existence of government depends. To illustrate, the government depends for its existence on the power to levy taxes for its support.

It may be argued that to compel a man to pay taxes is a restriction of his rights: but if so, it is only such a restriction as it is implied that he agreed to when he became a citizen of the government, and such restriction exists not for the purpose of taking away his rights, but solely for the purpose of securing them. It is the price charged by the government for the protection it guarantees. It can not fairly be said to be a restriction of a man's rights to compel him to pay the government for value received, any more than to compel him to pay the individual for value received. The same may be said of the power of the government to raise armies, and to compel men to serve in them. In the present imperfect state of human development, the very existence of the nation, as a nation, depends on this power.

It may be said that it is a restriction on individual liberty to draft a man, and compel him to serve in the army; and, indeed, the draft should never be resorted to till the call for volunteers fails to bring a sufficient supply of men for the emergency. When, however, the nation's existence, and consequently the rights of every individual in the nation, are endangered, the government may then draft men, and compel them to fight to protect their own rights and the rights of their fellows. This is really no restriction of individual rights, for it is simply calling upon all the people to fight for their own rights. If all are not needed in the army, those who stay at home have to provide for the support of those who are needed; and there seems to be a natural law of equalization which in many other ways, compels them to bear their just part in the great struggle for the maintenance of the rights of each and all.

Moreover, it is not a restriction of human rights to compel a man to fulfill his contracts, and the very existence of a government implies the contract and the pledge of the individual to support it. The same may be said of the power of the government to subpoena witnesses. This power is necessary that the rights of each and all may be maintained, and it is therefore included in the implied pledge of each to maintain such rights, on which pledge the very existence of government depends.

Again I say it is no restriction of human rights to compel the fulfillment of such a pledge. The most that such an individual can demand is a fair remuneration for his time and trouble, and this the government grants. Under such circumstances, if he refuses to go and witness, it is not that he is trying to maintain his own rights, but that he is trying to infringe the rights of others, or is in sympathy with those who have infringed such rights. Such act becomes a criminal disregard of human rights, and may justly be punished.

From all this it is evident that, without exception, the sole legitimate use and function of government is to maintain and protect rights; never to give or take away rights, both of which are impossible; nor to restrict or direct people in the exercise of these rights. In so much as it attempts to restrict or direct the individual in the exercise of his rights, in just so much it exceeds its rightful limits of power, and in just so much it becomes a paternal government.

So much for the use of civil government. The evils of a paternal government will be considered next week, in an article on the abuse of civil government.
