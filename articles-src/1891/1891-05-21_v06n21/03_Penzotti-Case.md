NOTING the fact that the Rev. Mr. Penzotti, the agent of the American Bible Society, who has been in prison in Callao for eight months for holding religious services according to the Protestant order, has been released, the Presbyterian asks:—

How shall he be repaid for months of unjust incarceration in vile prisons and in the midst of vile associations?

Upon this, the Christian at Work says:

We can't say. Mr. Penzotti is not an American, never having taken out naturalization papers. But it would be well that every missionary of an American Missionary or Bible Society should be required to do this. Then in the event of unjust imprisonment our Government would be heard from.

Yes, Mr. Penzotti ought by all means to have taken out naturalization papers either in this country or Russia, because either Government could have so consistently demanded redress from Peru seeing that they never allow persecution for conscience' sake in their own dominions! The grass should at least be green upon the grave of the last victim of religious persecution in this country before we talk of demanding compensation for sufferers from religious intolerance and hate in other lands.
