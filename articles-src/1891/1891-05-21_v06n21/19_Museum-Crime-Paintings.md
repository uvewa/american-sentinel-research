ONE of the reasons (?) urged by the Mail and Express for the Sunday closing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is that some of the paintings are demoralizing. "There are," says that journal, with a most reckless disregard of truth, "in the Museum representations of almost every crime." But why in the name of common sense, if this were true, would the influence of such paintings be any worse upon Sunday than upon any other day? It seems, however, that an over-mastering desire for "civil" Sunday regulations robs those who have it of even the commonest kind of common sense, in regard to Sunday and all that pertains to it.
