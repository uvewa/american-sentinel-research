## Religious Liberty.

CARDINAL GIBBONS, in a sermon on civil and religious liberty, delivered in the Baltimore Cathedral, March 8, on being elevated in the Cardinalate, said:

> A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience and of practicing a form of religious must in accordance with his beliefs.

Speaking on the same subject, the *Münchener Zeitung* (Baptist) says:

> Religious liberty is driven in the wrong conscience as well as for the right determines; no State can tolerate as far as the right determines, no State can tolerate an worship as all are for the privilege of worship. That is to say, conscience and worship, as between the individual and soul and God are things with which the State has nothing whatever to do; therefore it must neither help one worship nor hinder another, and the State may not on its own behalf as a party interfere, the State must remain absolutely neutral as regards to the form of worship, and must leave every man perfectly free in the use of his religious liberty, just as free as nature created him, for God himself created man free, and will compel no man to worship him, but wishes only a free and voluntary worship to be offered him.

In the United States we have religious liberty in the free right of the man of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience to a greater degree than can be said of any other nation on the face of the earth. This we owe to the fathers of our Republic, and to the grand old Constitution that they framed. It is a privilege bought at a sacrifice, for before its procurement by those who founded this Nation, the human race had never known such a thing. First, the Pilgrims, then the Baptists with Roger Williams, the Catholics with Lord Baltimore, and the Quakers with William Penn, and finally the fathers of the Republic, all tended toward the same result. In putting liberty of worship foremost in the grand amendments of the Constitution, they made the formal announcement that, in the estimation of the law, the conscience of the citizen was free. When the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, it makes the formal announcement that the Nation, as a Nation, cannot legislate in favor of or against any form of religion. In this the Constitution of the United States stands alone among the Constitutions of the Nations of the world. In what other country of Europe and in South America.

Toleration is not liberty, though it is an improvement upon persecution. It implies a superiority, and it is in the power of the one tolerating to withdraw or abridge the permission when this appears a sufficient motive. Toleration is the act of a power supreme right in its own opinion as well as in its actions. Liberty is a natural right of each and all, dependent upon no such concession. Protestantism in all countries it is established, tolerates dissent; toleration is all that it can grant. Catholicism, in Austria for instance, tolerates Protestantism; toleration is all that it can grant. The Government of the United States, by virtue of its Constitution, is restricted thereby to recognizing the equal rights and privileges of every citizen in matters of religion. No other Government on earth is in a similar position. This is a circumstance of which the American Catholic has every reason to be proud.

> The Government of the United States of America as established recognizes no form of religion. It neither aids nor prohibits one, but leaves each one free to worship God according to his own conscience. No other Government in the world so completely recognizes religious liberty—"toleration" is not the proper word.

In the United States we have religious liberty in the free right of the man of worshiping God according to the dictates of conscience and the law. It is a priceless heritage, the product of centuries of experience among nations, the final outcome of the spirit of Christ that, second through the heroic endurance and sufferings, and manifestly of many of the noblest of human benefactors. It can be maintained only as an individual and civil virtue among the people. It can be maintained only by the first faith, with the open Bible and an enlightened conscience ever looking to Christ in height. Among our highest duties to day is the preservation of this inestimable inheritance of liberty, against all enemies, open or disguised.
