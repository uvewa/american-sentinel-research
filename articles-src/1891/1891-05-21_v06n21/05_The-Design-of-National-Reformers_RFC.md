They are positive and persistent in the denial of any desire for the union of Church and State; but admit that they desire the union of religion with the State. In reply to this it may be asked, What religion? and the answer must be, The Christian religion; for they do not mean Mohammedanism, Buddhism, or any other religion but the Christian. But a union of the Christian religion with the State would be a union of the Christian Church with the State, unless Christianity can exist without Christians.

That their real object is an alliance of the Christian Church with the civil Government is too plain to be doubted. They ask Congress to enact laws to enforce the observance of what they call the Christian Sabbath. The plea for a "civil Sabbath" for the benefit of over-worked laborers, does not come from the laboring men. It is only a disguise—a sugar-coating—to make the religious Sunday go down with legislators. But the disguise is too thin. And all may know, if they will, that a movement which calls fraud and hypocrisy to its aid, is not from above.

The very name of their first and leading paper declares their object unmistakably. The Christian Statesman!—that means a union of Church and State.—"A Christian party in politics," striving to get the Government under their control, so as to legislate for "Christian laws and usages." Of course, they do not ask that any one of their numerous sects should be established by law; but they want the Government to espouse the cause of Christianity and enforce a portion, at least, of their creed—such portion on which the leading denominations can agree.
