WHEN Harriet Martineau wrote that she had awakened from a state of aristocratic prejudice to the clear conviction of the equality of human rights, she confessed to just such a mental and moral change as is needed by the ecclesiastical aristocracy which is now so enthusiastically urging legislation upon Sunday observance and other religious questions. Religious prejudice is dangerous enough, but the prejudice of a religious aristocracy is doubly to be feared.
