THE Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has decided that Sunday shaving is illegal in that State.

A MOVEMENT is on foot to open the Public Library in Portsmouth, Ohio, on Sundays, and the active members of the place are opposing it with all their might.

---

THE police authorities in Buenos Ayres have closed the Salvation Army hall in that city, asserting that the army is not recognized by the Church. The Salvationists have appealed to President Pellegrini, on the ground that the action of the police is a violation of religious liberty.

THE ministers of Cincinnati are waging quite a war on Cincinnati Sunday. The *Reporter* states that it looks as though there will be no baseball Sundays. Is it possible for a purely civil law to make anything a crime when done one day in the week, that when done on another day ministers and all can enjoy as perfectly harmless? This civil-Sunday farce is so thin that it can be seen through from all sides.

"Is the toilet of the 'Pearl of Days' to be asked a distinguished citizen of another State."

> What are some of the chief causes of the neglect and desecration of the Sabbath? Many see that it is not enforced. It is entirely a matter of indifference to the State and also of the legal. Then somebody must see to it that the case gets investigated, and the investigation should be thorough. No. The indictments in the case are very clear; to my mind the chief cause of the non-enforcement of the Sabbath law is the influence exercised by the publishers to understand that the only use we have Sunday for publishing that this is in a free country and they are free. What is this sort of liberty?

This continual insistence upon the idea that it is the duty of those who would be considered Christians to pray and practice is sure to bear fruit sooner or later.
