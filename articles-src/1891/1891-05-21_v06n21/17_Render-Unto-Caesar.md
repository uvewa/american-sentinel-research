An Omaha religious paper, devoted to National Reform, has the following item:

An able but skeptical lawyer, in referring to the answer which Jesus gave to the entangling question of the Pharisees and Herodians: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's," said, "That is the most brilliant reply I have ever heard."

The skeptical lawyer spoke none too highly of Christ's answer, and one beauty of it is that it is just as apt when applied to National Reformers as to the Pharisees. It is utterly crushing in either case.
