In the report of the Grand Jury for the January term of the criminal court of Baltimore there are two paragraphs devoted to Sunday laws, the one in reference to the Sunday closing of saloons, and the other a recommendation in regard to Sunday laws in general. The latter is as follows:—

There is a class of laws which might be called "Sunday laws," and which are undoubtedly in the best interests of the mass of the people, and which are violated, with seeming impunity by a certain class, to the serious detriment of any one in a similar business, and who keeps the law. This is neither legal, nor is it treating the better citizens with any common fairness. No evil could be much greater to all citizens than that each place of business should be in full operation on Sunday.

The Sunday laws are, in many of their features, police laws, and ought to be more rigidly enforced, and we would recommend that the Legislature, at the next session, be requested to appoint a special committee of the Senate and House to make a thorough examination of all laws relating to Sunday restrictions, with a view of determining what laws are obsolete or of impracticable enforcement, and to recommend to their respective bodies the repeal of such laws and the enactment of new statutes relating to the same subject. These laws should be drawn with special reference to their enforcement in large cities.
