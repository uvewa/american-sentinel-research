WHEN Harriet Martineau wrote of what she had awakened from a state of artificial philanthropic to the clear construction of the equality of human rights, she confessed to just such a mental and moral change as is needed by the ecclesiastical aristocracy which is now so enthusiastically urging legislation upon Sunday observances and other religious questions. Religion by progressive smugness strengthens, but the prejudices of a religious aristocracy is hardly to be feared.
