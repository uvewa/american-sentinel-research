THE editor of the "Pearl of Days" says he asked a distinguished citizen of another State

What are some of the chief causes of the non-enforcement of Sunday laws?

And the answer returned was:—

No law will enforce itself, therefore somebody must see that it is enforced. It is unnecessary to say that this obligation is on the executors of the law. But what if they are remiss in their duty? Then somebody must see to it that the officers of the law do their duty, else step down and out. Who will do this? The transgressors of the law? No. The disbelievers in the sanctity of the Sabbath? No. The careless and indifferent? No. Hence to my mind the chief cause of the non-enforcement of our Sabbath laws is found in the indisposition of Christian people to demand their rights and to give the politicians to understand that the only use we have for them is to see first that good laws are enacted, and, second, that these laws are enforced.

This continual insistence upon the idea that it is the duty of those who would be considered Christians to pray and prosecute is sure to bear fruit sooner or later.
