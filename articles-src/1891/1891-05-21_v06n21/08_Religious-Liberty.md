CARDINAL GIBBONS, in a sermon on civil and religious liberty, delivered in the Baltimore Cathedral, March 8, and printed in the Catholic Mirror, of March 14, said:

A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience, and of practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God.

Speaking on the same subject, the Minneapolis Ensign (Baptist) says:

Religious liberty is liberty for the wrong conscience as well as for the right conscience, for false worship or no worship at all as well as for true worship. That is to say, conscience and worship, as between the individual soul and God, are things with which the State has nothing whatever to do; and are also things over which no church has any control or authority, except in so far as the individual may freely and voluntarily accept its teachings. It is infinitely important that our conscience be right and our worship be right; our eternal destiny depends upon our being right in these matters, but no State and no church has the authority to say what is right for all men, and to compel men by force to obey their decisions. The State can define crimes, but can not define sins; and it can command what is necessary for good order, enforcing its commands by proper punishments, provided it does not seek to invade the sacred precincts of the individual conscience.

The church may say upon what terms it will receive persons to its membership and communion, but it can not touch with its little finger any one who does not freely receive its terms and enter its membership. Any man can leave any church as freely as he enters it, without physical or civil pains or penalties, or compulsion.

Religion is purely a matter between God and the soul, with which no outside person or power has anything to do, except in the way of advice and persuasion and accepted instruction. Freedom to worship God includes the freedom not to worship him, and the freedom to worship him rightly includes the freedom to worship wrongly, so far as any human power is concerned. To God alone every man must make his supreme answer.

Toleration is not liberty, though the two are often confounded, ignorantly or for some other sinister purpose. Toleration is the act of a power that claims the right to prohibit as well as permit. Liberty disclaims all right or power of prohibition or proscription in matters of religion, and leaves each one free to do as he pleases. England "tolerates" dissenters, but imposes upon them some civil or social disabilities. France, and even Italy, "tolerate" Protestants, with what restrictions those speedily know who attempt to exercise religious freedom. In Spain, according to the present Constitution, "a restricted liberty of worship is allowed to Protestants, but it has to be entirely in private, all public announcements of the same being strictly forbidden." Similar conditions prevail in the other countries of Europe and in South America.

In the United States we have religious liberty in the full sense of the word, guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws. It is a priceless heritage, the product of centuries of controversy and conflict, secured through the heroic endurance and suffering and martyrdom of many of the world's noblest benefactors. It can be maintained only by intelligence and virtue and pure religion. The chief agencies of true freedom are the home, the school, the free church, with the open Bible and the untrammeled proclamation of the gospel as Christ taught it. Among our highest duties today are the appreciation and the defense of religious liberty, against all enemies, open or disguised.
