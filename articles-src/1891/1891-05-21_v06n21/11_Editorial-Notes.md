NOTE.—Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent by some friend. Those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it. No one will ever be called upon by us to pay for the paper unless he has ordered it.

In answer to inquiries we would say that no decision has been handed down in the case of R. R. King, the Tennessee farmer, imprisoned for hoeing potatoes on Sunday in his own field.

An Omaha religious paper devoted, has the following items:

As a side not skeptical lawyer, in referring to the answer which force have given to the entangling questions of the Pharisees and Herodians: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things which are God's," said: "That is the greatest truth ever spoken to mortal ears."

The skeptical lawyer spoke more true regarding to Christ's monarchy, and one beauty of it is that it is just as apt when applied to National Reformers as to the Pharisees. It is utterly crushing in either case.

A CORRESPONDENCE OF THE *Observer,* says:

> The anole which have broken from the Roman Church number between one and two hundred. An American missionary, who is familiar with Russia, asserted that there were there now as many as one hundred and seventy five of these organizations and that hundreds of thousands of them are manifested. They are as the manifesto of the objections of Old Catholics everywhere. And the work should be inaugurated and enforced.

While it is another evidence of the growing failure of everything moral and religious to decline.

One of the reasons (?) urged by the *Mail and Express* for the Sunday closing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is that "the paintings and statuary are art—not recreation." "There are," says that journal, with a most reckless disregard of truth, "is the Museum representative of almost every creation." But why in the name of common sense, if these were true, would the influence of such paintings be any worse upon Sunday than upon any other day? It seems, however, that an overreaching desire for "civil" Sunday regulations rules those who have it of even the commonest kind of common person, in regard to Sunday and all that pertains to it.

SPEAKERS of some who make a plan, in behalf of the working-men for the opening of museums on Sunday, the *Catholic Review* says:—

> They are hypocrites in their pretence of consult-

[p.168] ing the workingman's comfort and pleasure, for were not Christians so element in the problem the poor workingman might work half the night and five or grant for all they care!

This could be said much more truthfully of those who, in the name of the working-men, demand rigid Sunday closing of everything but the churches, in order, professedly, that the toiling masses may rest; in reality, that the same masses may be constrained to resort to the churches. Political demagoguery is bad enough but religious hypocrisy is doubly despicable.

A Pittsburgh dispatch of the 11th inst. says:

> Col. Robert D. Ingersoll may not come to Pittsburgh. Rev. J. C. Brown of the Department of Public Safety, has set his foot down on Sunday lectures where an admission fee is charged. Chief Brown received a letter from David Hutchinson, manager of the Duquesne Theater, in Chicago, asking on what terms it would be possible to get through at Pittsburg to have Mr. Ingersoll deliver one of his Sunday lectures here.

> Chief Brown replied as follows:—

> "In reply to your letter of the 8th inst., I would say that it would be directly contrary to law for you to open any theater for a Sunday lecture here for the charge of admission, and that I for one will not attempt to have such a lecture delivered or such a theater opened, and will not permit the same. The belief is a within safe confines and will be enforced."

Chief Brown, in speaking on the subject, said: "I have responded negatively to queries the same way on the Sunday question. We have freedom enough, and believe of this that our only gates to money, and I think we might as well open the theaters for theatrical performances every night in the land. He would what Saturday gave."

Free Sunday last then? Great possibilities are certainly bound up in it.

Under a decision of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island a bequest based upon the religious belief of the beneficiaries fails to the ground. One, Joseph Greens, a Quaker, was greatly disturbed during his latter years by members of his family marrying outside the pale of the Society; and he attempted by his will to bestow his estate for the benefit of those persons whom he considered Orthodox Friends or Wilburites, as distinguished from the unilateral branches of the Society. The argument of the contestants of the will was that that while it might be possible to ascertain one's religious preferences, it is not within the capabilities of human determination to ascertain belief, that being a sub- [p.168] jective state which has no exerting external marks which may be passed upon. This position was sustained. "So that," remarks the *Christian at Work,* "whether Quaker or of the world's people; if you would have your money go only into the hands of orthodoxy—that is, your doxy—you must place it there during your lifetime, for the courts will not undertake to know it then where your legatee-lord is not known."

SEX DON has the following which is significant in view of the changes which have been rung by certain unscrupulous clergyman advocates upon the demand of certain barbers for only six days' work with seven days' pay:—

> Every humane man sympathizes with the barber; but as long as a barber keeps a shop, he knows that they get no more pay that the down-town man would keep his shop open the week—he ought to have a day of rest like all other people. He simply changes his occupation for one day that keeps his shop closed on Sunday but not changed the man who keeps his a closed on some other day from the one who keeps it is in every respect a more worthy citizen than the one which is to work on Sunday for an extra dollar.

We believe that we have before remarked that there has been a good deal of humbugging about the demand for Sunday laws in the interest of barbers and similar classes, to do more on less pay.

In the report of the Grand Jury for the January term of the criminal Court of Baltimore there are two paragraphs devoted to Sunday laws, the one in reference to the Sunday closing of saloons, and the other is a recommendation to repeal that, as the law itself in general. The latter is as follows:—

> There is a class of laws which might be called sumptuary, that do not seem to be in the best interests of the mass of the people, and which appear to be class legislation. We refer to a class claims, to the serious disturbance of any one in a situation where these laws could be violated, if that is the legal, nor is it tending the better citizen with true community. To them it could also be a repugnance to all citizens than that each place of business be at its full expectation on Sundays.

> The Sunday laws are in, as far as we can see, and a relics from the time that religion and government were more closely connected than they are to-day. The next season, he responded to appeal a strict enforcement; and there should be prompt and thorough examinations of all laws relating to this subject, with a view to their repeal on such revision as circumstances of the time require.

We do not of course consider all these findings correct but at considerable their respective inspection, the report of such laws with reference as is not made to this whole subject. These laws have not deserve to deal with special or distinct points by the Grand Jury.
