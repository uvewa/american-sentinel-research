## General Notes
- OCR source quality: Good overall
- Most text was clear and legible
- Author initials clearly identified: ATJ, RFC, GEF, WAC

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 5, Article "Ingersoll Pittsburgh Lecture"
- **Text:** "Saldedi day or evening"
- **Interpretation:** Likely OCR error for "Saturday day or evening" or possibly "said day or evening"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed exactly as appeared in OCR ("Saldedi")

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association section
- **Text:** "W. A. COLORED, Secretary"
- **Interpretation:** Based on known authors list, this should be "W. A. COLCORD"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed as "COLORED" to match OCR exactly; flagging for review

### Page 8, Subscription Information
- **Text:** "In clubs of 2 to 100 copies, per year, each, . . . - No."
- **Interpretation:** Price information appears garbled in OCR
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed exactly as appeared; likely formatting issue

## Author Attribution Notes
- ATJ = Alonzo T. Jones (explicit signature at end of Questions and Answers)
- RFC = R. F. Cottrell (explicit signature)
