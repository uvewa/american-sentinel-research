# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, May 21, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 21)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from scanned images at a resolution that made many words in the smaller typeface difficult to read with confidence. The three-column layout and dense text compounded reading difficulties. Multiple passages required best-guess interpretation. The major articles ("Questions and Answers," "The Use of Civil Government") are lengthy and complex, making exact transcription especially challenging.

### Short Editorial Items (Left Column)

- **Obstruction:** Small typeface at scan resolution makes precise reading difficult throughout the short editorial items.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM for all three short editorial items (Mail and Express, Harriet Martineau, Rev. Mr. Penecost)
- **Specific issues:**
  - Item 1 (Mail and Express): The final sentence "now, of course he will come to add to this respect much to the relief of the reading public" — reads somewhat oddly; may contain transcription errors.
  - Item 2 (Harriet Martineau): "Religion by progressive smugness strengthens, but the prejudices of a religious aristocracy is hardly to be feared" — this sentence reads awkwardly and may contain errors. "smugness" might be another word.
  - Item 3 (Rev. Mr. Penecost): Multiple uncertain readings throughout. The quoted text from the *Presbyterian* and *Christian at Work* is particularly difficult to read. The sentence "How shall he be equal for equality of opinion in religion in the midst of civilization?" reads oddly and may be incorrectly transcribed. The response "We see and. We cannot be mistaken in never having taken our naturalization papers" also reads oddly.
  - The continuation at the top of the middle column (about Persia, government, graves) contains several uncertain phrases. "either Government could have no consistently demanded reforms from Persia noting that they never allow protection for conscience' sake" — "noting" may be wrong.

## Pages 161-164 - "Questions and Answers" (A.T.J.)

### General

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM overall. This is a very long article with dense theological and legal argument. The general arguments and structure are clear, but specific word-level accuracy is uncertain in many places due to scan quality.

### Specific Uncertainties

- p.161, right column: "this 'law will be living instruction out of the law'" — the phrase "living instruction" is uncertain; could be "lasting instrument" or similar.
- p.162, left column: "come short of the glory of God. Morality does not consist in a knowledge of the law of God, but in the doing of it. He has to learn who is in the heart of man" — the sentence "He has to learn who is in the heart of man" reads oddly; may be misread.
- p.162: "the institution of Christ in his priesthood, went above once a year in the great day of atonement" — "went above" is uncertain; likely "went in above" or similar liturgical language.
- p.162: "This 'the law was to them oftener eight about'" — this phrase is clearly garbled; unable to determine the correct reading at this resolution.
- p.162: "that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness only eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord" — "only" should likely be "unto."
- p.162: "Decline and Fall, chap. 38, part, 11" — the reference to "Phillips" in the preceding sentence is uncertain; this may be a reference to Edward Gibbon's *Decline and Fall*.
- p.163: Multiple passages about civil government, individual rights, and the Declaration of Independence — while the arguments are clear, exact wording is uncertain in many places.
- p.163: "The answer is—he ought in justice and in a true morals, provided that individual has all the advantage of strength" — "in a true morals" reads oddly.
- p.164, left column: "Augustinian in 11th declared no rules" — clearly a misreading; the original text cannot be determined at this resolution.
- p.164: "In the city of Greensboro, Michigan" — "Greensboro" may be incorrect; could be another city name.
- p.164: "The basis of it all is militarianism only" — "militarianism" is uncertain; could be "utilitarianism."

### Duplicate Text Warning

- Several paragraphs about individual rights, the Declaration of Independence, and civil government appear very similar between the Q&A article (pp.163-164) and "The Use of Civil Government" article (pp.164-165). Both authors (A.T.J. and G.E. Fifield) make nearly identical arguments. It is possible that text I attributed to one article actually belongs to the other, particularly around the page 163-164 boundary. The column layout at this scan resolution makes it difficult to determine the exact boundary between articles.

## Page 164 - "The Design of National Reforms" (R.F. Cottrell)

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- The phrase "At Christian men in politics" may be incorrect; likely "As Christian men in politics."
- "legislate for 'Christian laws and images'" — "images" is uncertain; could be "usages" or another word.

---

## Pages 164-165 - "The Use of Civil Government" (G.E. Fifield)

- **Confidence:** MEDIUM-HIGH for the main text on page 165; MEDIUM for the text on page 164.
- p.164: "the most unworthy motive of love" — "unworthy" is uncertain; may be "worthy" or "inworthy."
- p.165: "neither could they all combined take away a slap from a single soul" — "a slap" is uncertain; could be "a right" or another word.
- p.165: "He would otherwise be at once an outcast and a government to whipsaw witnesses" — "outcast and a government to whipsaw witnesses" is uncertain.
- p.165: "The crisis of a patriarchal government will be considered next week" — "patriarchal" is uncertain; could be "paternal."

## Page 165 - "Religious Liberty"

---

## Page 166 - NRLA Declaration of Principles

## Summary

This issue presented significant transcription challenges due to the scan resolution and the density of the text. The major articles are captured in their argumentative substance, but many individual words and phrases throughout the issue are uncertain. A higher-resolution scan would be needed to resolve these uncertainties. The articles most in need of verification against a better source are the short editorial items on page 161, the news items on pages 166-167, and the editorial notes on page 168.
