SPEAKING of the opening of the recent Cincinnati Conference of the party calling itself "The People's Party of the United States of America," the *Chicago Daily News* says:

> A chorus from the Farmers' Alliance sang first, and what songs came from temporary chairmen. Two clergymen, then a temperance man, and two ministers, preceded a prayer by the Rev. Gilbert Delamatyr, the presiding minister. Mr. Delamatyr was roundly applauded when he arose to pray. Frequent amens arose from the congregation during the invocation, after which the delegate seemed to

better and better and settled contentedly into their seats as a Western woman arose and began to lead the multitude in a hymn that echoed this refrain:

> "The *News* says further:

> And a perfect cyclone of enthusiasm a delegate moved the adoption of the platform as read. The convention wild with the delegates and visitors cheering and shouting and yelling and clapping their hands. A portion of the convention sang "Praise God, from Whom All Blessings Flow." General Weaver cried, by the words; "Good, Good, Good."

Think of introducing a prayer in between two campaign songs, and singing the doxology immediately after a chorus has been sung to the tune, "Good-by, My Lover, Good-by." Yet there are those who think that such a religious farce is useful to the people, and that a God is to be carried out in all departments of government at public expense.
