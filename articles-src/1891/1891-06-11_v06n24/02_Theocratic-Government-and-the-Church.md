A WESTERN religious paper has the following sensible note on the International Sunday-school lesson for the 7th inst.:—

"The theocratic government of Israel came to an end with the ending of the old covenant,—it was really the administration of the old covenant. Since that time the Church of God has been distributed amongst the nations of the earth, having no secular authority. 'My kingdom is not of this world,' says the Master. 'They [his disciples] are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.' The Church may reform itself in its own way, according to the word of the Lord, which is given for its guidance; but it has not, nor has any of its members, any special prerogative in the matter of interference with the secular governments of the earth.

Nor has the secular government any right to interfere in the matter of purifying the Church. When the professed servants of God in this age assume to dictate to the State by virtue of any pretended theocratic authority, they simply assume the authority of God. When the State assumes to dictate the policy of the Church, it also assumes the authority of God. Both positions are alike presumptuous and blasphemous."
