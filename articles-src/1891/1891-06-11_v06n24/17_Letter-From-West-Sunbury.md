THE Treasurer of the National Religious Liberty Association, W. H. Edwards, received the following communication from a gentleman who, though busily engaged in the manufacture of brick and tile, not only finds time, but has an inclination to enlighten his Christian brethren on the important subject of civil and religious liberty and the dangers of religious legislation. The letter reads of follows:—

West Sunbury, Pa., March 12, 1891.

MR. W. H. EDWARDS—Dear Sir: Last October I sent you one dollar to have my name enrolled as a member of the National Religious Liberty Association, for which I have your receipt dated October 28. Therefore I hope you will entrust me with leaflets and literature for distribution. I think I could do a good work in the Presbyterian Church of which I am a member. I was a subscriber to THE AMERICAN SENTINEL in Oakland, and ever since, and approve its teachings, all but its loaning toward the seventh-day Sabbath. I shall look for literature.
