ON Sunday, May 24, two baseball clubs attempted to play a game near Cincinnati, Ohio, after they had received notice from the police that it would not be allowed, and after they had given their promise not to play. Both nines were arrested, and it is said that the adventure will cost them $1,600, besides fines and costs.
