The *Christian Union* published the question, "Can the State furnish adequate education without teaching religion?" and solicited answers to it. Several answers were given, one of the best of which is as follows:—

"This whole article is based, it seems to me, on an erroneous view as to the proper functions of government, especially in our own country. It is the business of the government of a republic, as distinguished from that of a monarchial or paternal government, to govern as little as possible and to leave the individual citizen to develop himself. The object of State education, therefore, is to give a man mental tools sufficient to prevent his becoming a burden on the State. What is most necessary for this end? That the State should furnish, at the lowest cost to the taxpayer, these tools. They should be thoroughly good, but no more. What is next necessary? That the State should establish trade schools where mechanical trades may be learned and the American be no longer deprived of his birthright at the dictation of trades-unions of foreigners. These schools might be in part self-supporting. . . ."

"Can the State educate men in honesty, truthfulness, and purity, in short in religious teachings—which is what your question means—without becoming sectarian? It can not. There is no such thing as pure religion in distinction from sectarianism. The pure religion of one body of believers is sectarianism to another. Does any one imagine, for instance, that six each of the most learned Protestants, Romanists, and Jews could draw up a code which all should unite in recommending for use in public schools, or that the beliefs of one of these bodies would not be denounced as sectarian to the others?"
