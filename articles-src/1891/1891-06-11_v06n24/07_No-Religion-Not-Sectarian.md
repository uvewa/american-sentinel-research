The Christian *Citizen* published the question, "Can the State furnish adequate education without teaching religion?" and editorial answers in the affirmative. Several letters were given, one of the best of which says:

"This article is based, it seems to me, on an error obvious on a moment's reflection, that is, that there is a form of religion proper to be taught in the schools of our own country. It is the business of the government if a republic, as distinguished from that of a monarchical or paternal government, to govern as little as possible and to leave the individual citizen to develop himself. The object of State education, therefore, is to give a man mental tools sufficient to prevent his becoming a burden on the State. What is most neces- [page 189] sary for this end? That the State should furnish, at the lowest cost to the taxpayer, common tools. They should be thoroughly good, but no more. What is next necessary? That the State should establish trade schools where mechanical trades may be learned; and the American laborer be no longer deprived of his birthright at the dictation of trades-unions of foreigners. These schools might be in part self-supporting.

"Can the State educate men in honesty, truthfulness, and purity, as short in religion and kindness—which is what your correspondent means—without becoming sectarian? It can not. There is no such thing as pure religion in distinction from sectarianism. The pure religion of one body of believers is sectarianism to another. Does any one imagine, for instance, that six each of the most learned Protestants, Romanists, and Jews could draw up a code which all should unite in recommending for use in public schools, or that the laity of one of those bodies would not denounced as sectarian to the others?"
