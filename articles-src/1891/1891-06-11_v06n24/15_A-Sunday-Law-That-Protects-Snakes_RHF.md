Birmingham, Ala., May 30, 1891.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: Sometime ago, I was employed to defend in the Criminal Court of this County a party, indicted by the Grand Jury and charged with shooting on Sunday. The evidence substantially showed that the defendant was the owner of a frame-building at Blossburg, near this city; that he rented this building to a family; that on the premises near the building—in the woods—was a water-spring, which furnished drink to the tenant and his family; that a moccasin snake was in the habit of crawling near the spring, thus frightening any person who desired to drink. Complaint was frequently made to the defendant about "His Snakeship," so, one Sunday morning (the only time he could leave his work), he takes his gun, goes to the spring, watches for the dangerous reptile and then deliberately kills it. On cross-examination, the defendant was asked why he did not use a stick, and his reply was that he had previously done so, but it was unsuccessful except to frighten the snake away temporarily.

I argued that the defendant was perfectly justified in killing the reptile, but the Court fined the defendant $10 and costs—aggregating about $40 to $50.

Yours truly,
RICH'D H. FRIES.
