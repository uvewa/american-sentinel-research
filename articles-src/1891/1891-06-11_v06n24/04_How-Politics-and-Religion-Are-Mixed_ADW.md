SPRAKING of the opening of the recent political convention which brought into being "The People's Party of the United States of America," the *Chicago Daily News* says:—

A chorus from the Farmers' Alliance song book, and three bangs from temporary chairman Cunningham's iron hammer, preceded a prayer by the Rev. Gilbert Delamatzy, the greenback ex-congressman. Mr. Delamatzy was roundly applauded when he arose to pray. Frequent and earnest amens from the audience punctuated the invocation, after which the delegates seemed to feel better and settled contentedly back in their chairs, while the Kansas Glee Club regaled them with a humorous ditty.

The News says further:—

Amid a perfect cyclone of enthusiasm a delegate moved the adoption of the platform as read. The convention went wild and the delegates mounted tables and chairs, shouting and yelling like Comanches. A portion of the convention in thunderous chorus sung to the tune of "Good-by, My Lover, Good-by," the words "Good-by, old parties, good-by," and then the doxology.

Think of sandwiching a prayer in between two humorous songs, and singing the doxology immediately after a chorus has been sung to the tune, "Good-by, My Lover, Good-by"! Yet there are some who think that such a religious farce is a benefit to the people, and that it ought to be carried out in all departments of the Government at public expense.
