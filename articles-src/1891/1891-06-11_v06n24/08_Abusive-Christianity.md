MAJOR M. C. CONNORS, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, addressed a letter to the *Daily Times*, of that city in reply to Knoxville Bass, devoted intolerant abuse of all who do not believe and practice as he teaches that they should. The Major's letter is only a manly rebuke to intolerance. We quote from it:—

> Suppose I should assent to some of the theories of Mr. Bass, and demanded of him the reasons "Why he is so determined to contravene? What right does he have to be assumed so one-sided, but 'only contending for truth?' In such language he might repeat and repeat like the echoes of heaven, "worthy of being recorded as the greatest and highest." It is not pure partisanship.

> The very strong community that this demonstration of form of Government has have is that of patriotism; and it matters not to what form it may take, the genuine is destructive of the national rights of that truly government, because instead of government becoming simply the people, it is the prerogative of disclaiming to refuse to legislate on the emotions, not on exercise, with regard to the people, then placing a different construction upon the affairs of the people, so as for that instead of the people being the guardians of the government the government enrolls itself into an entity separate from the people and becoming the guardian and protector of the people. Instead of the government being a product and an instrumentality of the people for the protection of the government, those powers then taken from the government and became the paternal principles, and the thing for taking a paternal government to do is a dangerous thing for any government to do, because no government should be paternal.

> This brings us to the one chief point and all these of our correspondents make, and upon which they all three agree. As expressed by our friend of this

I am willing to be judged, and not by my eye, by my future, not any other claims or those of my daily life, but let them be before their sincere face.

I repeat to say that "Abusive Christianity" contradicts its own definition. A. and I do believe that there are men before who talk about Christianity in one of the languages as less than their own "sincere." It is a burning shame that this is the fact. Christianity has far more and speak kindly of those who hold different or opposed religion and belief from them, and from all who take delight in the humiliating of the people.

The representative hatred of our churches must cure this the fallen, and discharge of practicing is a greater religion at all. And those same ones. Those who believe the Scriptures can say those who refuse to believe have equal rights, it can not be denied that those of our belief are to expect to enjoy tolerantly all reflection upon Christian or Christianity. Yet any of this reason of outcasts of others is attended of a very hard line indeed.

The Disciples differed, and were rebuked to shame for their bigotry. "The Samaritan of an old record, and a counsel told in its belief in Paul's day was hated and despised. And tolerance was not demanded of the Christians, but was the very first duty of Christians. But difference of opinion is tolerance of differences. There is always room for discussion. This is immovable and more important; there is always room for praise, and none can say with his picture, words for work or evil that language.

This institution has taken the place of the larger way in its own practice as the spirit of truth that we owe this greatest of all works and tribute.

This is good common sense and clear reasoning as well. We know of nothing of the writer, he may be a Christian or he may not, but certainly his practice is a better understanding of the principle of Christianity than has any man who indulges in coarse and bitter denunciations of his fellow men who differ from him in belief.
