MAJOR GEO. C. CONNOR, of Chattanooga, Tennessee, addressed a letter to the *Daily Times*, of that city in reply to Evangelist Sam Jones's intolerant abuse of all who do not believe and practice as he teaches that they should. The Major's letter is such a manly rebuke to intolerance of every kind that we give a few paragraphs from it:—

Suppose I should deny some of the dogmas, am I to be denounced as contemptible? What right has a preacher to say on the public restrum that he has "only contempt for such?" Is such language gentlemanly, befitting the lips of an "ambassador of heaven," worthy of being recorded as the pleadings of a friend? Is it not pure partisanship, genuine impudence? Does not the fellow who insults his equals take advantage of his opportunities, and degrade the liberty of the rostrum to the license of a pot-house?

The reign of "Abusive Christianity" has been most disgusting. It has attracted the crowd, which always enjoys the humiliation of its kind. It has loosened the mouths of coarse men, who falsely declare that they "are called of God" to indulge filth of speech. It has turned our holy Christianity into buffoonery, and put it on a par with the circus and the variety show! Such degradation of the precious lessons and sweet teachings of Jesus of Nazareth is the disgrace of this last decade of the nineteenth century.

I admit that I have a soul to save. I know that there is a God, and I know that he is my heavenly Father. I know that my heavenly Father is defamed by those who, in order to frighten weak men and timid women into a "profession of religion," make him a tyrant, a murderer, and an unrelenting punisher of men and women who do not accept the dogmas of these self-called declaimers. I am as capable as they of understanding the will of the Supreme, and I will go to the Judgment to answer for myself and not for another. I am glad to have the advice of friends in matters spiritual as I am in matters temporal, but I want denunciations in neither. No man has any more right to open his vile jaws and denounce me for my religious belief than he has to abuse me for my judgment in making an investment in land or stocks. By my fruits I am willing to be judged, and not by my professions of "belief." Let my fellow-citizens look at my daily life, but let them not bother their anxieties about my beliefs. . . .

I regret to say that "Abusive Christianity" has its counterpart in "Abusive Infidelity." I know that there are non-believers who talk about Christians in the same vile language as Sam Jones talks about "sinners." It is a burning shame that this is so. . . . I have no patience to listen to men who speak bitterly of those who hold differing opinions of religion and moral duty. I turn away from all who take delight in the humiliating of the professors of Christianity.

This reprehensible hatred of Christianity prompts men to assail the Bible, and challenge proofs of its authenticity. There is only partisanship in such denunciation. Those who believe the Scriptures are so entitled, and must be protected in so doing; those who refuse to believe have equal rights. It is not proof of activity of brain or of purity of morals to enjoy boisterously all reflections upon Christians or Christianity. To my mind, joy at the sorrows of others is absolute proof of a very bad heart.

The Disciples differed, and were rebuked by the Master for their bigotry. The early Christians differed, and a council had to be called in Paul's day to settle these differences. The Jewish dispensation was set aside by reformers who took the name of Christians. But difference of opinion is tolerated to-day only so far as the orthodox churches differ among themselves. This is unreasonable and un-American. Here we believe or disbelieve as we prefer, and none can nip with hot pincers, scorch with fagots or cast into dungeons. But "Abusive Christianity" has taken the place of the Inquisition and the flames of Smithfield. In the fear of God we enter this protest against all such ostracism and bigotry.

This is good common sense and also good religion. We know nothing of the writer; he may be a Christian or he may not, but he certainly has a better understanding of the principle of Christianity than has any man who indulges in coarse and bitter denunciations of his fellow-men who differ from him in belief.
