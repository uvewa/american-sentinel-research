The very worst enemy that this democratic form of Government can have is that of paternalism, and it matters not as to what form it may take, the principle is destructive of the natural rights of man, under government, because instead of government becoming simply the preserver of the liberties of the people, it assumes the prerogative of dictating to the people what rights they shall or shall not exercise, with regard to the government, thus placing a difference between the government and the people, in so far as that instead of the people being the guardians of the government the government evolutes into an entity separate from the people and becomes the guardian and protector of the people. Instead of the government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed, these powers are taken from the governed and become part of the government itself and held separate and distinct from the people. This, of course, is the foundation of every monarchial government in Europe, to-day, as well as of those of all antiquity.
