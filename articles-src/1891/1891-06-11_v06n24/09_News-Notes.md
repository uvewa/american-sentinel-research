A LOCAL organization to create sentiment favoring Sunday legislation was formed at Terre Haute, Illinois, on May 19. The pastor of the Christian Church was elected president, and all the other pastors of the city, vice-presidents. Why not select a few citizens outside of the ministry who is wholly civil?

On Sunday, May 24, two baseball clubs attempted to play a game near Cincinnati, and after they had received permission, the police said that it would not be allowed, and after they also knew that it was private not to play. Both sides were arrested, and it is said that the adventure will cost them $1,600, besides fines and costs.

The Christian *Statesman* credits Col. John H. Barrows, of Chicago, with saying that "the greatest boon to the American workingmen is the Sabbath, or rest day, which is the gift of American Christianity." The Sabbath was instituted by Jehovah at the creation, and all well informed men know that the Sunday rest day is the gift of papal Christianity, so if Dr. Barrows and the Christian *Statesman* desire a rest day, which shall be the individual's gift of American Christianity, it is evident that they will have to choose still a third day out of the seven. This ought to be definitely understood before the political parties are asked to insert it as a plank in their platforms at the nominating conventions next year.
