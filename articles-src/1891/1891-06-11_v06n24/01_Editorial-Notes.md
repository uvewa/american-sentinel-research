SPEAKING of the *Independent's* symposium of preachers on Sunday opening of the Fair at Chicago, the *Toledo Blade* says: "The question is one that is not to be decided either by church dignitaries or by church member exclusively. A very large part of the people of the United States do not formally affiliate with any church organization, and they have a right to be consulted if everybody's advice is to be taken, of the comments of public opinion is to decide the matter. The fact remains that there will be millions and tens of thousands of people in Chicago every Sunday who would attend the World's Fair if it were open on that day, but if it is not it will gravitate to the salons and worse places of amusement."

A WESTERN religious paper has the following sensitive motto on the International Sunday-school lesson for the 18th inst.:

"The theocratic government of Israel came to an end with the ending of the old covenant—it was really temporary. Since that time the Church of God has been distributed amongst the nations of the earth. But the absolute authority: 'My kingdom is not of this world,' says the Master. 'They [his disciples] are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.' The Church may reform itself in its own way, according to the word of the Lord, which is given for its guidance. But it has not, nor has any of its members, any special prerogative in the matter of interference with the secular governments of the world."

Nor has the secular government any right to interfere in the matter of purifying the Church. When the professed servants of God in this age assume to dictate to the State by virtue of any pretended theocratic authority, they simply assume the authority of God. When the State assumes to dictate the policy of the Church, it also assumes the authority of God. Both positions are alike presumptuous and blasphemous.
