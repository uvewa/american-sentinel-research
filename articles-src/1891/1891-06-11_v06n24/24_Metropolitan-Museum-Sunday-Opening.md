On the afternoon of May 31, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in this city, was open to the general public for the first time on Sunday. Over ten thousand people availed themselves of the privilege thus afforded, a large majority of whom had evidently never visited the Museum before. Nearly all the visitors belonged to the better class of working people, people of a good degree of intelligence but of little leisure, and they seemed to be happy in their new enjoyment. "It was," says the *Sun*, "a good-natured crowd, as became the occasion. It trod on its own toes with impunity and laughed. It talked freely and confidingly with itself, and told of its personal enjoyments and troubles." Everything passed off very pleasantly, and the press of the city was nearly unanimous in declaring Sunday opening of the Museum a grand success.
