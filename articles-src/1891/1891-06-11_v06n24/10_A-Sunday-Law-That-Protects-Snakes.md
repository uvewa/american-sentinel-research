Birmingham, Ala., May 31, 1891.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL.— Some time ago, I was employed to defend in the Criminal Court of this County a party, indicted by the Grand Jury and charged with selling on Sunday. The evidence substantially showed that the defendant was the owner of a frame-building at Broadway, near this city; that he rented this building to a family; that on the premises near the building—in the woods—was a water-spring, which furnished drink to the tenant and his family; that a moccasin snake was in the habit of crawling around the spring, and frightening persons who desired to drink. Complaint about it "His Snakeship," was one Sunday morning (the only time he could leave his work), he killed this pest, gone to the spring, watched for the dangerous reptile and then deliberately killed it. On cross-examination, the defendant was asked why he did not kill it on a week day; he said that he previously done so, but it was unsuccessful except to frighten the snake away temporarily.

I argued that the defendant was perfectly justified in killing the reptile, but the Court fined the defendant $10 and costs—aggregating about $16 to $18.

Yours truly,

BAIN H. FENN.
