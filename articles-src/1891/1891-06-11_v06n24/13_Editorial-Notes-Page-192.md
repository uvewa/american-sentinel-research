The General Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in session at Pittsburg, has adopted by a vote of one hundred and twenty to sixteen, the Pittsburg memorial characterizing the action of the young men's ministers in voting at an election as a "heinous sin and scandal."

THE Standard Oil Company has decided to discontinue its drilling privileges on Sunday. The reason for the action does not appear; but knowing the policy of the company it may be to limit production, and again, it may be to relieve Sunday work to show respect for the day; the former, however, seems the more probable as the Standard Oil Company has never figured prominently as a corporation governed by great religious principles.

WE print on another page of this paper, "A Catechism on Religious Liberty," which contains much food for reflection. As it is an exercise that is given to the question, each reader can now devote them for himself. The author, Mr. Frank W. Howe, 75 Fuller Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan, the price twenty-five cents per copy, or all for the corresponding in the collection. In writing to him about obtaining them, the numbers should be given.

ON another page we print a letter from a lawyer in Alabama, giving, without comment, the facts relative to a case wherein the defendant was adjudged guilty of a violation of the Sunday law of that State. The Alabama statute provides that

> any person … engages in shooting, hunting, gaming, card playing, or racing on that day, or who compels his apprentice, servant, or slave to perform manual labor on that day, shall on conviction be fined not less than twenty nor more than one hundred dollars and may also be imprisoned in the county jail, or sentenced to hard labor for not more than three months.

The fine imposed therefore in this case was the minimum, which shows that the Court did not regard the offense as a grave one. It is evident that in this as in almost every such case, a bad law was used as a means of venting petty spite, of getting even on some neighborhood quarrel, of gratifying religious bigotry and intolerance. Alabama would do well either to employ a Saint Patrick to expel all the snakes from the State or else repeal her Sunday law. The latter would be the easier and decidedly the better plan, for even if the last snake were dead, bigotry would still live, and nurtured by Sunday and other religious laws, have it in its capacity to develop a venom more deadly than any ever carried in the fangs of a Southern moccasin.

DECENT advice from London state that the Czar, in response to a personal appeal made by an exalted personage on behalf of the Jews in Russia, said he was determined to continue his measures of Jewish repression with a view to a solution of the Jewish question. The *Freeman*, the Czar said, had forced this policy. Czar had ever been a Nihilist plot hatched in which they were not concerned; and he was firmly engaged in propagating subversive movements.

Rev. Dr. HEWES, of Reading, Pennsylvania, is reported to have said in a his Sunday-law meeting address:

The Sunday is the most prominent papering throughout the country, and cannot be defied any day only. *If we could a paper that is much read, such as the Daily Eagle now, would our readers read.*

We would kindly call the attention of the *Mail and Express*, of this city, to this opinion, and also volunteer the information that in our opinion this is just as true of New York papers as it is of Philadelphia papers.

On the afternoon of May 21, the Metropolitan Museum was thrown open to visitors in the general public for the first time on Sunday. Over ten thousand persons availed themselves of the privilege; and incidentally offered, a large majority of whom had ordinarily never visited the Museum before. Nearly all the visitors belonged to the better class of working people, people of a good degree of intelligence who simply made a quiet tour of the rooms to be happy in their new enjoyment. "It was," says the *Sun*, "a good-natured crowd, as became the occasion. It trod on its own toes with impunity and made no fuss about it." It talked freely and confidingly with itself, and told of its personal enjoyments and troubles. Everything passed off very pleasantly, and the press of the city was being satisfied that the Sunday opening of the Museum is grand success.

In a recent Sunday-law meeting in Reading, Pennsylvania, the Sunday paper came in for the usual amount of dynamite. The meeting was held in the First M.E. Church. The discussion was opened by Rev. Dr. Orrick, who argued that the less men observe Sunday as a holy day the more they become parts of great machines put into operation by big corporations, and if they did not move with the rest of the machinery they would be crushed. A young man, a member of his class, said he wanted to keep his store [page 192] closed on Sunday, but certain customers said that they were in the habit of meeting there on Sunday, getting their cigars there, and talking over matters, and if he didn't open on Sunday they would patronize somebody else. "He didn't keep open on Sunday," said the speaker, "but frequently he had a good trade *during the even*." What the young man would have done the next Sunday had his trade during the week been so as not to make him, is not certain; and we, however, left to suppose that it would have materially altered the case; hence the urging of the demand for enforced Sunday closing that this man and others similarly situated may not be subjected to temptation.

It is wonderful how the Sunday-law advocates cling to the delusion,—that, in it they are sincere,—that they are doing a great favor to the helpless workingman, in keeping outside his lot or duty of voluntarily keeping a slave without their honest convictions. But that some slaveholders, the workingmen, who have reduced thinking to a system, is pertinent in the following declarations regarding the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art:

> It is further urged against the petition and of the strongest objection that the Sunday opening will tend to make Sunday another day of toil for workmen now on duty six days a week.… Ages ago, he is now able to determine the practice is a good one and well worth providing for those who wished for its enforcement.

And the simple truth of the matter is, the plan of the workingman's need is only a rest—to get a rest they want desire. Where—Has not the Col. Elliot F. Shepard already said.

> They *themselves* in their privilege of rest and constitution of the privileges and right of Christianity as divines as the problem of the right of a slave to the freedom of his rights, was great for all history.

But when the scheme is fully exposed, and the workingman's declarations will soon be seen, they will learn that their mind has nothing to do; that it is a religious civilization and worship, and that they want and are determined to be free.

The National *Reformers* must, however, ever believe for what shall be deemed," and being satisfied in their own minds that true said of it, those are but only saying, they are not willing to wait for the permission to begin in God's time; but they still enjoy taking the exercising of it into their own hands.
