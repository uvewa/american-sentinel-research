Because I believe in religious liberty.

Because I believe that all religious legislation is opposed to religious liberty.

Because I am opposed to all religious rites and institutions being made obligatory by law.

Because I believe that the State can only legislate in the relations of man with man, and not in the relations of man with God; and the commandment says "it is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

Because I consider this appeal to law as tending toward a union of Church and State, and that it would soon open wide the gates to religious intolerance and religious tolerance.

Because religious legislation delivers religion to the mercy of the majority, and the majority has no right to decide the religious belief of the minority.

Because the basis of liberty is the right to be of a different opinion, and that right should be held sacred.

Because I detest that charity which would destroy liberty, and because the fruits of the gospel are abundant where there is religious liberty.

Because I wish this "land of the free" to be preserved from the malign influence of the religious tyranny which has made so many nations of the Old World suffer.

Because I believe that religious legislation is a subversion of civil liberty as much as of religion, and that it constitutes a like danger to the State and to the Church.—The false union kills the true.

Because the State can not make Christianity; whenever it has undertaken it, it has been the ruin of nations.

Because I believe all men are created equal, and that consequently they have the same right as I to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences.

Because in conformity to the Golden Rule I am disposed to accord to each one the same rights that I claim for myself.
