THE *Sabbath Recorder*, the organ of the Seventh-day Baptists, has declared in favor of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair. The *Recorder* says:—

The question of opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday is bound to be a live one till the Directors give their decision; and we are glad that we can show an authoritative utterance to our people which can not in any way bring us into the company of the enemies of religion in their clamor for a Sunday opening. We can safely oppose this demand upon high religious grounds without compromising ourselves as keepers of the Bible Sabbath, because the attack upon Sunday is really an attack upon American Sabbath-keeping, represented by Sunday, and involves not the question of a day, but the Sabbath idea and principle. So it is our fight in common with all Christians who love the Sabbath idea. In this connection it is significant that there are reactions in Europe against Continental Sunday-keeping. France has passed a law making one day in seven a rest day, and a bill has been introduced into the Spanish Senate by the Prime Minister making Sunday a day of rest in government establishments. The duty of Seventh-day Baptists lies in the direction of teaching the true Sabbath idea. The times are going to give us work enough to do, but we hope we shall never be found with those who are helping the evil root the Sabbath, as a principle, out of men's minds and hearts.

This is not a question of company either good or bad, but of correct principles. We do not join in the demand for the Fair to be open on Sunday; to us it is a matter of indifference. If the Directors see fit to close the Fair on Sunday we have no objections to offer, neither shall we join in the demand that the Fair shall be closed; certainly not for the reason given by the *Sabbath Recorder*.

If the Chicago Fair ought to be closed on Sunday to preserve "the Sabbath idea and principle" in America, it follows that the United States mails should stop on Sunday for the same reason. If keeping the Fair open all or a part of Sunday violates "the Sabbath idea and principle," certainly the carrying and handling of the mails upon that day is even worse, for it involves the labor of many more people, and exerts a wider influence.

The same argument would justify also laws requiring all corporations to suspend business on Sunday. They are creatures of the State, and the State is in a measure responsible for their actions; if, therefore, the Chicago Fair should be closed on Sunday in the interests of the Sabbath-keeping idea, all public business should cease on the same day for the same reason. In short, the *Recorder's* logic would justify not only all the Sunday legislation at present on the statute books of the States, but all that has ever been asked for, both State and national.

Our conception of the Sabbath is that it is a sign between God and his people. Its purpose is to keep God in mind as the Creator of all things. Its observance is worship of the divine Being. This is the only Sabbath idea or principle worth preserving, but it is an idea entirely foreign to civil government, an idea that the State has no more right to foster than it has to cultivate any other religious cult.

In 1829–30, when Congress was asked to suspend the Sunday mails, Seventh-day Baptists in New Jersey very properly remonstrated against the passage of such a bill, on the ground that it

would be made a precedent for others of the same kind, and more alarming; would pave the way to a union of Church and State; . . . would be the deathblow to our civil and religious liberties, . . . and end in the worst of all tyranny—"an ecclesiastical hierarchy."

The danger was no greater then than it is now, and we marvel that Seventh-day Baptists, of all people, do not see it now even as they did then. The friends of a legal Sunday are doing their utmost to secure official recognition of Sunday as a sacred day. They are determined that the Government shall in some way be committed to the defense of Sunday as a religious institution; that it shall become a party to a religious controversy. The question therefore with us is not shall the Fair be closed on Sunday? but shall the matter be so manipulated by the advocates of a legal Sunday as to practically make the Government the tool of a religious cult?
