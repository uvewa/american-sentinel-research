[Translated from *Le Citoyen Franco-Americain*.]

BECAUSE I believe in religious liberty.
Because I believe that all religious legislation is opposed to religious liberty.
Because I am opposed to all religious rites and institutions being made obligatory by law.
Because I believe the State can only legislate in the relations of man with man, and not in the relations of man with God; and the commandment says it "is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
Because I consider this appeal to law as tending toward a union of Church and State, and that it would soon open wide the gates to religious legislation and intolerance.
Because religious legislation delivers religion to the mercy of the majority; and the majority has no right to decide the religious belief of the minority.
Because the basis of liberty is the right to be of a different opinion, and that right should be held sacred.
Because I detest that charity which would destroy liberty, and because the fruits of the gospel are abundant where there is religious liberty.
Because I wish this "land of the free" to be preserved from the malefic influence of the religious tyranny which has made so many nations of the Old World suffer.
Because I believe that religious legislation is subversive of civil liberty as much as of religious, and that it constitutes a like danger to the State and to the Church.—The false union kills the true.
Because the State can not make Christians; whenever it has undertaken it, it has been the ruin of nations.
Because I believe all men are created equal, and that consequently they have the same right as I to worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences.
Because in conformity to the Golden Rule I am disposed to accord to each one the same rights that I claim for myself.
