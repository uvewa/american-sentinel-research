The *Sabbath Recorder*, the organ of the Seventh-day Baptists, has the following in review of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair. *The Recorder* says:—

> We are inclined to agree with an article from a correspondent on the Columbus Exposition. On Sunday it is to be based on a being free out the Decrees of the rest alone, and above all, such as can show an unfitness uniformity which deprives those who are in any way with us to begin with the common of the commune of religion in their classes in a common government.

[page 188] The same argument would justify also laws requiring all corporations to suspend business on Sunday. They are creatures of the State, and the State is in a measure responsible for their actions. If, therefore, the Chicago Fair should be closed on Sunday in the interest of the Sabbath-keeping idea, all public business should cease on the same day for the same reason. In short, the *Recorder's* logic would justify not only all the Sunday legislation at present on the statute books of the States, but all that has ever been asked for, both State and national.

Our conception of the Sabbath is that it is a sign between God and his people. Its purpose is to keep God in mind as the Creator of all things. Its observance is the test of that divine Being. This it is: only Sabbath idea or principle worthy of propagation; but it is an idea entirely foreign to civil government, an idea that the State has no more right to foster than it has to cultivate any other religious cult.

IN 1876-78, when Oregon was asked to suspend the Sunday mails, Seventh-day Baptists in New Jersey very properly remonstrated against the passage of such a bill, on the ground that it

> was opposed to a radical feature of the same kind; and more strongly, would pave the way to a union of Church and State, and thus imperil the foundation to our civil and religious liberties and it was a measure of only ecclesiastical hierarchy.

The danger was no greater then than it is now; and we marvel that Seventh-day Baptists, of all people, do not see it now even as they did then. The friends of a legal Sunday are doing their utmost to secure official recognition of Sunday as a sacred day. They are determined that the Government shall in some way be committed to the defense of Sunday as a religious institution; that it shall, at least, be a party to a religious controversy. The question therefore with us is not shall the Fair be closed on Sunday? but shall the matter be so manipulated by the advocates of a legal Sunday as to practically make the Government the tool of a religious cult?
