On another page we print a letter from a lawyer in Alabama, giving, without comment, the facts relative to a case wherein the defendant was adjudged guilty of a violation of the Sunday law of that State. The Alabama statute provides that

Any person who ______ engages in shooting, hunting, gaming, card-playing, or racing on that day [Sunday] ______ must, for the first offense, be fined not less than ten nor more than twenty dollars, and, for any subsequent offense, must be fined not less than twenty nor more than one hundred dollars, and may also be imprisoned in the county jail, or sentenced to hard labor for the county, for not more than three months.

The fine imposed therefore in this case was the minimum, which shows that the Court did not regard the offense as a grave one. It is evident that in this as in almost every such case, a bad law was used as a means of venting petty spite, of getting even on some neighborhood quarrel, or of gratifying religious bigotry and intolerance. Alabama would do well either to employ a Saint Patrick to expel all the snakes from the State or else repeal her Sunday law. The latter would be the easier and decidedly the better plan. Even if the last snake were dead, bigotry would still live, and warmed by Sunday and other religious laws, it is sure to develop a venom more deadly than any ever stored in the fangs of a Southern moccasin.
