REV. DR. HICKMAN, of Reading, Pennsylvania, is reported to have said in a late Sunday-law meeting:—

The Sunday paper is the most prominent paper. I take a Philadelphia daily paper, but not the Sunday edition. If you want a paper that is worth anything you must take a paper that publishes a Sunday edition.

We would kindly call the attention of the *Mail and Express*, of this city, to this opinion, and also volunteer the information that in our opinion this is just as true of New York papers as it is of Philadelphia papers.
