It is wonderful how the Sunday-law advocates cling to the delusion,—that is, if they are deluded,—that they are doing a great favor to the helpless workingman, in keeping inviolate his day of rest, as if he would be simply a slave without their humane intervention. But the true status of the workingmen, who have reduced striking to a system, is portrayed in the following declaration regarding the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum in this city:—

It is further urged against this petition and in behalf of the working classes that the Sunday opening will tend to make Sunday another day of labor. To this the New York workingman replies that he is prepared to prevent any such intrusion on his rights. As he is now able to determine the number of hours he shall labor a day, so can he also determine the number of days he shall labor in the week.

And the simple truth of the matter is, the plea of the workingman's need is only a cut's-paw to get what they want themselves. Has not the *Catholic Review* aptly said,

They are hypocrites in their pretense of consulting the workingmen's comfort and pleasure, for were not Christianity an element in the problem the poor workingman might work half the night and live on grass for all they cared?

When their scheme is fully exposed, and the workingmen's declarations will soon do that, they will drop their mask and say boldly that it is a religious Sunday-Sabbath they want and are determined to have.
