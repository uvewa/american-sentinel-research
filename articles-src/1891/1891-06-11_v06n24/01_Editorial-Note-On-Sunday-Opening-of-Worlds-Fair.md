SPEAKING of the *Independent's* symposium of preachers on Sunday opening of the Fair at Chicago, the *Toledo Blade* says: "The question is one that is not to be decided either by church dignitaries or by church members exclusively. A very large part of the people of the United States do not formally affiliate with any church organization, and they have a right to be consulted if everybody's advice is to be taken, or if the consensus of public opinion is to decide the matter. The fact remains that there will be thousands and tens of thousands of people in Chicago every Sunday who would attend the World's Fair if it were open on that day; but if it is not will gravitate to the saloon and worse places of amusement."
