DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible and in the government of the people.

We believe that the commandments of God and the rights of conscience are above any law that man can make.

We also believe in civil government as divinely ordained to regulate the relations of men with their fellow-men.

We also believe, however, that in all its jurisdiction, civil government is to exercise only civil power, and that religious legislation extends beyond its legitimate province.

C. ELDRIDGE, *Secretary.*
