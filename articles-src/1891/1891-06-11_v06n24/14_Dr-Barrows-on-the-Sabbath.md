THE *Christian Statesman* credits Dr. John H. Barrows, of Chicago, with saying that "the greatest boon to the American workingman is the Sabbath, or rest day, which is the gift of American Christianity." The Sabbath was instituted by Jehovah at the creation, and all well informed men know that the Sunday-rest day is the gift of papal Christianity, so if Dr. Barrows and the *Christian Statesman* desire a rest day, which shall be the individual "gift of American Christianity" it is evident that they will have to choose still a third day out of the seven. This ought to be definitely understood before the political parties are asked to insert it as a plank in their platforms at the nominating conventions next year.
