THE Standard Oil Company has decided to discontinue pumping on the Ohio fields on Sundays. The reason for this action does not seem to be known by the public; it may be to limit production, and again it may be to reduce Sunday work out of respect for the day; the former, however, seems the more probable as the Standard Oil Company has never figured prominently as a corporation governed by great moral ideas.
