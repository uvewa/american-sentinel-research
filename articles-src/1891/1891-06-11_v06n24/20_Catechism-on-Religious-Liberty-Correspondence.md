WE print on another page of this paper "A Catechism on Religious Liberty," which contains much food for reflection. As no answers are given to the questions, each reader can answer them for himself. The writer, Mr. Frank W. Howe, 75 Fuller Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan, invites correspondence upon any or all of the questions in the catechism. In writing to him about specific questions the numbers should be given.
