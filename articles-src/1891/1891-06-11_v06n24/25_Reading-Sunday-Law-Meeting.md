In a recent Sunday-law meeting in Reading, Pennsylvania, the Sunday paper came in for the usual amount of denunciation. The meeting was held in the First Reformed Church. The discussion was opened by Rev. Dr. Orrick, who argued that the less men observe Sunday as a holy day the more they became parts of great machines put into operation by big corporations, and if they did not move with the rest of the machinery they would be crushed. A young man, a member of his class, said he wanted to keep his store closed on Sunday, but certain customers said that they were in the habit of meeting there on Sunday, getting their cigars there, and talking over matters, and if he didn't open on Sunday they would patronize somebody else. "He didn't keep open on Sunday," said the speaker, "but fortunately he had a good trade during the week." What the young man would have done the next Sunday had his trade during the week been poor we are not informed: we are, however, left to suppose that it would have materially altered the case; hence the urging of the demand for enforced Sunday closing that this man and others similarly situated may not be subjected to temptation.
