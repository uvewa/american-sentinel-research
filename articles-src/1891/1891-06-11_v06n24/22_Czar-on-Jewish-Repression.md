RECENT advices from London state that the Czar, in responding to a personal appeal made by an exalted personage on behalf of the Jews in Russia, said he was determined to continue his measures of Jewish repression with a view to a solution of the Jewish question. The Jews themselves, the Czar said, had forced this policy. There had never been a Nihilist plot hatched in which they were not concerned, and they actively engaged in propagating subversive movements.
