WE have received three long letters from three different individuals, in the East, the South, and the West—one in this city, one in North Carolina, and one in Iowa—criticizing our article of three weeks ago on positions in government, and especially that part of it which refers to the Farmers' Alliance. We cannot print all three of the letters, nor indeed is it necessary to: they all speak the same thing in the main; and as we do not wish to seem partial we print none in full, but notice the material points of each, and of all.

Two of the letters we received shortly after the article appeared; but as one of them thought we had not studied the Alliance from the right side, and as the National Conference of the Alliance was soon to be held in Cincinnati, we thought it best to wait till we could have the official and authoritative statement of just what they propose the people to settle for.

The Alliance met and conferred, and established a platform of principles, and upon the point to which we had referred this platform says:—

"Money, such as legal tender treasury notes, issued in sufficient volume to transact the business of the country on a cash basis … a just and equitable means of exchange … to be obtainable for all.—That the amount of the circulating medium be increased (not less than $50 per capita) to a legal tender for all debts, public and private, and such other laws demanded by the people shall be enacted as will have a tendency to do away with the monopoly power, or to restrict its unjust and destructive influences."

As this is precisely what we said the Alliance proposed to do, certainly it can not be said that we misrepresented the Alliance in the least. Not only can it not be said that we misrepresented the proposals of the Alliance; but it cannot be said that we misrepresented in the least the inevitable results of this carrying into effect of such proposals. The words which we have here quoted from the platform of the National Alliance, contain all that we said in the article which these three friends purpose to criticize. It is not necessary for us to retrace those results, that would be but to reprint that article. We simply ask our friends to turn again to that copy of THE SENTINEL and read it with this quotation from the National Alliance before them.

The proposal of the Alliance contains all that Rome ever was; and every person who will take these three steps as a process of thinking, and they are but the inevitable steps following the proposal, must admit that this is so. Let this plan be adopted as the course of governmental action. The first and inevitable step following, will be that the Government will soon become possessed of a large amount of land and "imperishable products." Then the second and inevitable step will be that this land will be absorbed by individuals, by the "imperishable products" be handled by the individuals, "cash" and the price of both in land and the "imperishable products" will be in the highest that the speculators can force them up to, carrying in their train yet heavier stress upon the farmer and producer, and greater distress and greater punishment wait upon the day laborer. Then the third and inevitable step will be a general distribution of the land and the "imperishable products" by the Government. The destruction of trusts and monopoly. The decay of capital as such. This course will be followed round and round in a few times, gradually exhibiting the power of the spirit of self-dependence which alone makes money itself, as all self-dependence vanishes at the same time, and the people, instead of governing themselves, must be governed by the Gov- [page 186] ernment; instead of the people looking to themselves for the government they look to the Government for government itself, as well as for everything else; and the only possible outcome is an unambitional despotism. And the despotism will be there, and has been and now the same evil, though it be by many rather than by one.

In Rome there was a despotism of the many long before there was a despotism of one. In a government of the people, and before it first a government of the people, it is impossible to be otherwise. In a government of the people there must be a despotism of the many before there was possible a despotism of one. And when there is a despotism of the many, it is only a question of time when there will be a despotism of one. One gradualism is first of the many, next of a few, and then of one. Only in the freedom of all, in liberty, is there free government.

In this view we touch the main point of the letter of our Iowa friend, in his demand that he said that *"free election," "direct and effective,"* is in our opinion what constitutes a government of the people according to American principles. The American principle is not a government by management of the people, but a *free government* of the people, while the principle of our Iowa friend and the Farmers' Alliance plan is that of a despotic government of the people—a government of the people according to the paternal and despotic principle of the Roman government of the people. The true and American idea of a government of the people is self-government—the government of the individual by the individual; the Roman paternal Farmers' Alliance idea of government of the people is government of many by many, by few or by one. The American principle is *self-help* and governmental protection. The Romance Farmers' Alliance principle is governmental help and self-protection or no protection at all.

Our friend in this point, upon a miscomprehension of the above related situation, endorsing of Rome in this particular, in the following words:—

"Now let us go to Rome. Where did those men who had large estates get them? By what power did they hold them? What tenure gave them title? The plain fact is they were granted to them by the emperor; that it is none of your government, they held titles by power of the government, and it was the government afforded by government itself for political purposes. They held the lands and the people on them by governmental aid. The poor were simply riddlers of those poor people; they were really high-salaried employees, by voice of law, labor and other things of value from those who had no power to resist them.… Instead of doing a wrong the emperors who sought to convert the state of affairs did just the right thing; only they did not go far enough. And the fact that they failed because of the low moral condition of the people, and the standard that which they tried to do."

This is well put, and to all of it we heartily reply, Why, indeed? It is no more the province of the Government to help the rich than it is to help the poor, to help the banker or the stock gambler than to help the farmer or the hod-carrier. And as it is to help the one, logically it must help the other. If it is to help the one it must be the same to all. But there is the rub, and that is the point. It is not to help any of them; it is not in the power of any.

And here is just the difference between THE SENTINEL and our three correspondents and the whole movement in behalf of which they speak. THE SENTINEL is totally opposed to any of it and all of it and to the principle upon which any of it is done; while on the other hand this movement intends, in effect, to dispel and makes great capital, of the evil of applying the principle to a few, and proposes the cure for the evil by applying it to all. That it is an evil which accumulates to the disadvantage of the Government, they propose to cure it by firmly fixing it as a principle of the Government, and by multiplying it ten thousand fold. In other words, they simply propose to make this evil the follower: they will in turn fix themselves into the place and power where they can do for themselves a great deal more than has ever been done in this Government or any other already. The truth of the matter is what the result, eventually, must and will amount to, mainly, if not in this particular line then in some other, the end of all it will be but a sort of general scramble to see who shall get the most. And this is the sum and the substance of the whole scheme.

It may be that our correspondents will complain that it is just so now; but that matters nothing to us. Five years ago when THE SENTINEL first raised its voice against a movement to establish a religious despotism, we were criticized and pooh-poohed for that; more than we are for calling attention to this street forerunner of it. But THE SENTINEL knew then just what it was doing; and it is known now that it is doing just as well as it did then. Those who objected then, know now that we were right; and those who object now may soon know something of the results of our present utterances.

Clearly our friend has misconceived the situation.

*First.* What he speaks of as having been done by the emperors, was not done by them. This work was put before the emperor came in fact, though the first step in it involved the one quality which afterward did come in fact.

*Secondly.* The land was not "granted" to those who held it, in the common acceptation of the term, and as we suppose the word is here used. "The land was public land. It belonged to the State, and was and still really possessed by the State, and was rented to these occupants for a stated price, or for a period of time—the tenant at hand held it under formal contract, and for a consideration. The only flaw in the relation was that some of the tenants occupied more land than the ancient law allowed; and across that this flaw rather ethical than real because the law was obsolete; and in fact fallen into corruption and "unconscious desuetude." And it was alike "entered and inherited," just as in our ad for farming in Sunday-laws are no occasion, when no reason special advantage is to be gained by it.

*Thirdly.* From these facts it is evident that it cannot justly be said that they held the lands and cultivated them by injustice and oppression; or that they kept highwaymen robbing the poor people, etc., who had no power to resist from. The land had not power as to whatever to this, inasmuch as the State could receive more revenue from it. For this reason it was rented, and the revenue from the rental went to the State, that is to the people, for the government was of the people. And most of the people having no part to resist this "oppression" they had power to resist it, they *did* resist it, and it did, shall it, and gave away the land in large alterations of law to return whatever.

And then it was demonstrated that the former system had been one of neither oppression nor robbery of the people, because from the very beginning the most of those to whom the land was given were so dissatisfied that they actually sold out their allotments to the very people who had formerly occupied the lands. The others lived beyond their means, got into debt, mortgaged their holdings, and then had to let them go, on the mortgage, so that in a very few years all the public lands were again held by the very individuals from whom they had been taken. And more than this; they were now held by individuals in their own right and not by government. They were *owners*, having no reform to the State, whereas they had formerly paid an annual rental. So that the only tangible result of this proceeding was to deprive the State, and therefore the people of a certain fixed annual revenue and therefore to increase the burdens of the people heavier than they were before.

The same thing has gone through with and on and again, and each time accompanied with worse results both to the govern- [page 187] ment as such, and to the people as individuals, developing more and more the despotic in the many; till it was merged in a despotism of three—the first triumvirate—which ended in the despotism of one, whom they murdered, which was followed immediately again by a despotism of three—the second triumvirate—which was ended in the despotism of one—the Augustus—and the final establishment of the imperial despotism; the most horrible despotism that ever was, and which persisted until Constantine and the bishops turned it into a religious despotism, the most terrible religious despotism that ever was.

That is the history of that story and there, and the *sequel* lifetime of it, is the end of this story now and here.

And this answers the query of our correspondents, as to what business has THE SENTINEL, a religious paper, to touch this question which is political. It does not intimate that that is political. We are not unmindful the fault, nor spend its efforts in vain in this respect. THE SENTINEL is a religious paper, that is true and it exists for the sole purpose of pointing to the American people the movement for the establishment of a religious despotism under the model of the Papacy.

But no religious despotism ever rose or existed of itself. It requires a political order actually to establish it. A religious despotism over the royal fortress was a despotism over the royal persons who made the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution.

This gradual but steady perversion and destruction of the genuine principles of this Republic as established by our forefathers, this slowly inculcating of the principles of despotism, is but *eroding away* the elements of the opposition to a religious despotism. That is the point. Whether it be done by the efforts of the few, of one, it matters nothing; which at the opportunity offers: that once done by the political practices, and out upon the political alliance has formed, there will come the religious despotism in the perfect likeness of the one which was set up against and against which the continuance was of The American Revolution. Except that even that was but the beginning; it has not been ever and shall be directed.

And yet, reason enough, and THE SENTINEL, a religious paper, exists to show all the evil in its fullest consequences.

There is another point or two in the letters, such as what constitutes real money, etc., which it is not necessary to discuss, and which perhaps need not to have been introduced in the first place; as the only object that we had in view was to call attention to the civil despotism that lies in the Supreme Court decision coupled with the general movement which corresponds to it. And we are perfectly willing to trust the event to demonstrate that the existing religious despotism will be established substantially in the manner we have indicated.

Now in closing, let us not be misunderstood, and let us not be misapplied, in this matter. We would not be understood as reflecting upon the farmers nor upon the Alliance as such. It is entirely at the principles that we aim. THE SENTINEL has nothing at all to do with parties of any kind either for or against, but with principles only. We are so far from the moment that the Farmers' Alliance as such, nor the individuals who compose it, intended what we have pointed out. We simply say that the mischief is in the principles, and it will appear and full and that we have said is the face of their best intentions.

It is the same way with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and others who are working for religious legislation. They do not all intend to establish a religious despotism, they do not all intend to persecute, but a religious despotism lies in the actuated precedents, persecution is in the principle of the thing, and will all appear as surely as the sun ever rises; and they demand, nor will either the wickedness or the cruelty of the thing be relieved, by the fact that they did not intend it.

We say to all, have nothing to do with either the religion or the civil despotism. In religion let your dependence be upon God, and not upon the Government. And in civil things, let your dependence be upon your own manly self and not upon a paternal, pampering, coddling, meddling government, which takes care of you, what you shall eat and drink and wear, how long you shall work; when you shall rest, when you shall eat, and when you shall be religious.
