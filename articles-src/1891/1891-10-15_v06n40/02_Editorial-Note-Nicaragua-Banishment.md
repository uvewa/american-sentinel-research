THE Catholic party in Nicaragua has recently banished some of its enemies, just as National Reformers propose to do in this country. The fellows who were banished might have remained in Nicaragua if they had not "raved," if they had been content to allow the priests to manage the Government and manipulate everything in the interests of "the Church"; but this they would not do, and so they have been banished, possibly "to some wild desolate land, there to set up a government of their own, and to stay there till they die."
