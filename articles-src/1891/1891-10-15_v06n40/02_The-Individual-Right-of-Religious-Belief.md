Last week, in our notice of Judge Hammond's discussion of the subject of freedom of religious belief, we found that "sectarian freedom of religious belief" is all that only which, according to his view, is guaranteed by the Constitution. In the whole discussion, there is not the slightest appearance of any such thing as the individual right of conscience, or of religious belief. Yet the individual right is the American idea, and is the one that is contemplated in the United States Constitution, and the Constitutions of the States, as far as they have followed the example set by the national Constitution.

So entirely to the individual right of religious belief established from Judge Hammond's view, that when he actually refused to entertain or give any credit to a suit in law, because he said the petitioner had not proved that the point was "held as a part of the belief of an organized sect," a word or two are in order.

Although he stated that the fourth amendment is as nothing in its bearing on the case it does not prove that it is held as a part of the belief of an organized sect.

By this it is clear that the Judge's idea of sectarian freedom of religious belief led him to ignore, yea, even to deny, the individual right of religious belief. For in demanding that the prisoner should in the realm prove that his plea is held by a sect, and religiously observed as such by that sect, and in refusing to entertain the plea, because the accused had not proved that it was a part of some creed, and was so recognized by a church or Court, is to deny the right of the individual to believe for himself, and to practice accordingly, without reference to any creed, or the belief of any sect as such. And this is only to deny the right of individual belief, and of the individual conscience. Such, however, is neither the American nor the Christian principle of the rights of religious belief.

The Christian and American principle is the individual right of conscience—the right of the individual to think for himself religiously, without reference to any sect; and without any interference in the act of anybody, much less on the part of the Government. The idea of the national Constitution on this point is clearly expressed in the following words of Mr. Bancroft, which have often been quoted in these columns, but which cannot be quoted too often:—

No one thought of vindicating religion for the conscience of the individual until a voice in Judea, breaking day for the greatest epoch in the life of humanity, by establishing a pure, spiritual, and universal religion for all mankind, enrolled the duty to Caesar and the duty which is Caesar's. The rule adopted during the infancy of the great sect. So secure was the religion adopted by that of the Roman Empire, that it was above the reach of the magistrate, and was subject to nobody's association with the unholy State. . . .

In no country was the connection between the affairs of the Government and religion so intimate as in the Roman republic.

That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience.

We cannot conceive of a church without doctrine. And religion cannot be introduced into the public schools unless it is doctrinal in the sense of being definite, positive, and precise. To speak of the Church without doctrine is to talk of daylight without the sun, of an effect without a cause.—*Rev. Dr. Strong.*

view of the primeval relation of faith and obedience to God, and can rest only between the individual and God. Thus the right of religious belief inheres in the individual and is only the exercise of the belief of the individual, as his own thought shall lead him with respect to God, and his duty toward God, according to the dictates of his own conscience. And as this is the inherent, absolute and inalienable right of every individual, no many individuals as may choose, have the right of associating themselves together for mutual aid and encouragement.

If Mr. Bancroft's words of the national Constitution, as expressed in the above extract, need any confirmation, it can be furnished in superabundance.

We need, indeed, be well to give a few facts further in this line, showing that as Mr. Bancroft has expressed the sense of the Constitution in this respect, so upon this point it was the understanding and intent of some of those who formed it.

During the whole time in which the preliminary steps were being taken to the formation of the national Constitution, the question of the freedom of religious belief was being thoroughly discussed, and especially by the one man who had more to do with the making of the Constitution than any other single individual, except perhaps George Washington. That man was James Madison.

June 11, 1776, the Virginia Assembly adopted a Declaration of Rights, Section 16 of which contained the following words:

That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience.

July 4, following, the Declaration of Independence of all the Colonies was adopted. Shortly afterwards, the Free State of Virginia, by her Assembly in session at Hanover, in Virginia, added by the Presbytery of Hanover, in Virginia, added by memorial to the Assembly of Virginia, asking that the Episcopal system be abolished, that disestablishment of that State, and that the example set by the Declaration of Independence should be extended to the question of religion according to section 16 of the Bill of Rights. In this memorial they said,

The duty that we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and but at the tribunal of the universal Judge. To judge for ourselves, and to engage in the exercise of religion agreeable to the dictates of our own consciences is an inalienable right, which upon the principles upon which the gospel was first propagated, and the reformation from popery carried on, can never be transferred to another.

The Episcopal Church was disestablished, but in its place a move was made to establish a general tax, by which a general tax should be levied in support of the Christian religion. Again the Presbytery of Hanover, the Baptists and the Quakers came with a strong memorial in behalf of the free exercise of religious belief, according to the dictates of conscience. Jefferson and Madison gladly and powerfully championed their cause, yet the movement in favor of the general law was so strong that it was certain to pass if the question came to a vote. Therefore Madison and Jefferson offered a motion that the bill be postponed to the next Assembly, and that meantime it be printed and circulated among the people. The motion was carried. Then Madison drafted a memorial and remonstrance in opposition to the bill, and this memorial was circulated and discussed more largely among the people than was the bill which it opposed.

We remonstrate against the said bill: *First*, because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, that religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence. The religion of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated in their own minds, cannot follow the dictates of other men. It is unalienable also because what is here a right towards men is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage, and such only, and as believers to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent both in order of time and in degree of obligation to the claims of civil society. Before any man can be considered as a subject of the Government of the country, and is a member of civil society who enters into any subordinate association must always do it with a reservation of the duty to the general authority; much more must every citizen who becomes a member of any particular civil society do it with a saving of his allegiance to the universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of religion no man's right is abridged by the institution of civil society, and that religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.

To say that they can control the freedom of the press, and punish every thing published against it; to say that they can control the freedom of religion; to say that they may and will make laws to govern the exercise and judiciary powers of Virginia; say that they may and shall deny any of the right of suffrage, and rend themselves into an indefinite and hereditary Aristocracy;—or may say that they have no authority to enact into law the bill under consideration.

This remonstrance created such a tide of opposition to governmental forces in religion that the bill was not only overwhelmingly defeated, but there was adopted in its place, Dec. 26, 1785, "the question," being in the Court's idea, in fact,

to her to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, unfettered and untrammeled with all our other rights. If we never to interfere with the people in the right to get such weight in importance, it cannot be less four to say for reasons the declaration of principle which "which pertain to the good people of Virginia as the best and foundations of government, is as measured with equal advantage, or rather with absolute emphasis. Either way, we may say that the will of the Legislature is the only measure of authority; and that is, the principles of that authority that may sweep all our inalienable and natural rights; or that they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred."

may say that they may control the freedom of religion; to say that they may govern how the executive and judiciary powers of Virginia say that they may deny any of their right of suffrage, and rend themselves into an indefinite and hereditary Aristocracy;—or may say that they have no authority to enact into law the bill under consideration.

This remonstrance created such a tide of opposition to governmental forces in religion that the bill was not only overwhelmingly defeated, but there was adopted in its place, Dec. 26, 1785, "the

Immediately following this splendid campaign, direct steps were taken for the formation of a national government. And this was made a vital one of the working spirits; and the cause of the victory he had gained in his campaign in Virginia was by this turned to account in the making of the national Constitution, and approaching that dominant, in the clause declaring that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under the United States." But even this was not sufficient to one who had learned by experience where ideas had been adopted, by those whose ideas had been absorption, by whom the idea had been adopted, by those whom the idea had been absorption into control and victory in Virginia.

Therefore an amendment was demanded of the nation, more fully securing the right of religious belief, and to this convention, of every free Citizen of the Constitution ever assembled under the Constitution, reported the first ten amendments for approval by the requisite number of States, that which is now the first Amendment to the national Constitution, declaring that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Thus it is demonstrated that the words of Bancroft expressed precisely the ideas of the national Constitution upon that question, and that the freedom of religious belief contemplated and guaranteed by that Constitution is the freedom of the individual, and not in any sense such as Judge Hammond contemplates, and calls "sectarian freedom of religious belief."

And from this, it further follows that the analysis of the national Constitution of Tennessee, following, as Judge Hammond himself says, the example of the national Constitution, declares that "no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience;" it means the rights of the individual conscience, and in no sense refers to or contemplates any such thing as the rights of a "sect," but "conscience;" and that when that same Bill of Rights declares that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship, it means precisely what it says.

Therefore, nothing can be clearer than that when the Supreme Court of Tennessee, using the force of this constitutional provision, to the Christian religion, and its modes of worship, it distinctly violates the Constitution; disregards and invades the rights of the people of Tennessee, as by that Constitution declared. Likewise nothing can be clearer than that Judge Hammond in setting aside and defining the belief he calls "sectarian freedom of religious belief," instead of recognizing "the individual right," "the right of conscience" of the Constitution of Tennessee, misses at lot the American idea of freedom of religious belief.

According to the proofs here given, it is evident that Mr. King occupied the originally and constitutionally patriotic, and national and claimed only his constitutional right, when he presented the plea of individual belief which Judge Hammond refused to entertain. And it is equally clear that Judge Hammond extended the jurisdiction of a Court of the United States, when he refused to entertain the plea, and demanded that the prisoner should produce evidence that the point pleaded was a part of organized sect's religion.

Further than this, and as a matter of literal fact, it is but proposed just to say that the sect to which Mr. King belongs may not be one, but unless it has actually applied the rights of religious belief.

The sect to which Mr. King belongs recognizes the Christian and constitutional basis of the individual right of conscience, and holds the Christian and American idea, that it is every man's right to believe for himself alone, in the exercise of his own individual conscience as directed by the word of God; and to worship accordingly.

Therein, the Court, either State or United States, demanded that Mr. King should prove that this plea was held as a part of the creed of his sect, it not only demanded what it was impossible for him to prove, but it demanded what he has the inalienable and constitutional right to refuse to prove.
