Rev. Dr. De Witt (Episcopal) takes Dr. Lorimer (Baptist) of Tremont Temple, Boston, severely to task for his utterances on the subject of the sacredness of Sunday, in his sermon preached in Chicago, September 7. Dr. Lorimer said in substance that he believed with Martin Luther that the first day of the week ought to be observed in commemoration of the resurrection of Christ as a day of rest and rejoicing—a day of cessation from toil, but it ought not to be accounted sacred time. Men should do as they like on that day, but they should not forget its significance.

Rev. De Witt, referring to it September 14 says:—

Of all the men from whom the friends of the Christian Sabbath have recently suffered, there is no more unfortunate instance than in the case of the eminent preacher from Boston who preached a remarkable sermon on the opening of the Fair. It is to be regretted. He was wrong, both in historical reference and scriptural exegesis.

Referring to Dr. Lorimer's rest theory, he said:—

Rest was one of the last ends for which the Sunday was instituted. From the earliest days of the Church, the leaders of Christianity have sought to impress their followers with the fact that Sunday is a day of general cessation of labor and for worship. All great men who have taken their stand for Christianity, have insisted that first and foremost, Sunday should be kept sacred.

With reference to the history of Sunday, Rev. De Witt said:—

The ancient pagans named the day Sunday in honor of their chief god, the sun, which was their highest deity, and our Lord honored the day by his own ascension from the grave.

The advocates of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, have insisted that it is not the sacred Sabbath that they want observed in closing the Fair, but the "American civil Sabbath," the "humanitarian Sabbath," and for the reason that the laboring man needs rest. But when Dr. Lorimer asserts his belief in that kind of a Sunday, and securing a cessation from labor, and securing freedom from Sunday slavery; when he is content to let every man enjoy himself as he thinks best, how quickly these men fly to the other side of the question and take up the cudgel in defence of Sunday sacredness. It is all right to talk about the civil American Sabbath when advocating the closing of the Fair on Sunday, but when any one rises to speak in favor of opening the Fair on that day, it will not answer to say that Sunday is civil and not sacred, therefore open the gates and let the people in as on other civil days, as the fourth of July, Christmas, and New Year's. The day suddenly becomes very sacred and these men can even see sacredness in the fact that this day was dedicated by the heathen to their highest deity and named after their chief god. Then the object of all this agitation on the subject of Sunday laws and Sunday closing is not to secure rest merely for the laboring man as they would have us believe, but to secure the compulsory religious observance of Sunday. "Consistency, thou art a jewel."
