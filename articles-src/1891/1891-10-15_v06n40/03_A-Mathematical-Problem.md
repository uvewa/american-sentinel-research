The editor of the *Chicago Tribune*, in issue of September 5, referring to the recent visit of Colonel Shepard and others to Chicago in the interest of closing the Columbian Exposition on Sundays, says:—

They claim that there are 30,000,000 people in this country opposed to Sunday opening, and that is only 1 per cent. of the whole number. Their argument is easily answered by figures, if their figures are admitted as correct. If 30,000,000 people are opposed to Sunday opening, signed by more than 1 per cent. If they were losing, a baker's half of 60,000,000 it would be immeasurable in a country where majority rule.

The voice of the woman movement is suggestive. Fifty-one of them voted to close on the last day of the week, and thirty-six to open. When it is considered that whatever feeling is most stronger among women than men such a division is made as not indicate any unanimity of sentiment among the men in favor of Colonel Shepard's demands. It shows, on the other hand, that the matter of these men have to base by, not said was there to go themselves on Sunday, would find that they had a much larger contract on hand than it would take more than Colonel Shepard and Professor Herrick to carry out.

If the Colonel's statement that "50,000,000 people in this country are opposed to Sunday opening" be correct, it would hardly seem necessary to go all the way from New York to Chicago in order to look after closing the great Exposition to keep. If 30,000,000 opposed to opening it on Sunday, they will, of course, stay away on that day. And if such a very large number stay away, if they say nothing upon the subject, the small fraction that remains, provided they were all at the Fair at once on Sunday, would be so lonesome that they would not want to go again. According to our best information of last census there were only about 20,000,000 of people. This number would include the last babe that was born to the census was made. Now the Colonel would not have us believe that babies not old enough to know that there is to be a World's Fair, or children too young to take any interest in such things, should be included in the list of 30,000,000 who are opposed. Again if all the children were also opposed to it then there will not be much above 50,000,000 left. Then in the place of saying that 30,000,000 are opposed to opening the Fair on Sunday, why not say that the whole adult population of the United States are opposed to it, unless it would be possible that some of the children should grow up enough to develop a little opposition between now and May 1, 1893. If it is possible for any danger to arise from this quarter, a department for mothers' meetings could be opened up in the American Sabbath Union and easily keep the refractory babies in their places. With such an array of figures, one would hardly seem necessary for Colonel Shepard and the American Sabbath Union, the Sabbath Observance Department of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, etc., would fold their arms with the air of one who had finished his work and quietly go to rest. But without any disrespect for the Colonel, it is hard to forbear the reflection that in making stock, he has "come too late" and his stock have been "watered."
