The editor of the Chicago Tribune, in his issue of September 9, referring to the recent visit of Colonel Shepard and others to Chicago in the interest of closing the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, says:—

They claim that there are 50,000,000 people in this country opposed to Sunday opening, and that their petitions are signed by 500,000, which is only 1 per cent. of the whole number. Their argument would have more weight if their petitions were signed by more than 1 per cent. If they were signed, for instance, by half of 50,000,000 it would be unanswerable in a country where majorities rule.

The vote of the women managers is suggestive. Fifty-six of them voted to close on the first day of the week, and thirty-six to open. When it is considered that religious feeling is much stronger among women than men such a division as this does not indicate any unanimity of sentiment among the men in favor of Colonel Shepard's demand. It shows, on the other hand, that the number of those who because they do not want or care to go themselves on Sunday, would have others forced to stay away who do want to go, is much smaller than Colonel Shepard and Professor Patton imagine.

If the Colonel's statement that "50,000,000 people in this country are opposed to Sunday opening" be correct, it would hardly seem necessary to go all the way from New York to Chicago in order to look after closing the great Exposition on Sunday. If 50,000,000 oppose opening it on Sunday, they will, of course, stay away on that day. And if such a very large number stay away, even if they say nothing upon the subject, the small fraction that remains, provided they were all at the Fair at once on Sunday, would be so lonesome that they would never want to go again. According to our best sources of information we have only about 65,000,000 of people. This number would include the last babe that was born when the count was made. Now the Colonel would not have us believe that babies not old enough to know that there is to be a World's Fair, or children too young to take any interest in such a question, are included in the list of 50,000,000 who oppose opening. And if the children are counted out there will not be much above 50,000,000 left. Then in the place of saying that 50,000,000 are opposed to opening the Fair on Sunday, why not say that the whole adult population of the United States are opposed to it, unless it would be possible that some of the children should grow up enough to develop a little opposition between now and May 1, 1893. If it is possible for any danger to arise from this quarter, a department for mothers' meetings could be opened up in the American Sabbath Union and easily keep the refractory babies in their places. With such an array of figures, one would suppose that the American Sabbath Union, the Sabbath Observance Department of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, etc., would fold their arms with the air of one who had finished his work and quietly go to rest. But without any disrespect for the Colonel, it is hard to forbear the reflection that his statistics, like what sometimes happens to railroad stock, have been "watered."
