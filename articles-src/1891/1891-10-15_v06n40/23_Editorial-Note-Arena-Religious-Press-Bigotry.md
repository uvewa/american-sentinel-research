Of an article in the October Arena (which we print on another page of this paper), the Independent says:—

Referring to the conviction of a Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee for working on Sunday, the Arena said, and now repeats, that "the prejudice of the majority sustains the infamous law;" and that "the religious press is so dominated by bigotry and ancient prejudice that it is blind alike to the Golden Rule and the inexorable demands of justice." The Arena has no right to make that statement. The Independent is sufficiently prominent among religious papers to be considered before one makes such a general charge. The Independent has followed that case all through the courts, and has again and again, and most emphatically, condemned the Tennessee law. That is the general view of leading religious papers in the North at least, and the Arena has spoken out of an ignorant prejudice, and with no effort to find out the facts.

Nevertheless, the Arena was right. The Independent has done all that it claims in regard to this case, but unfortunately it is not the religious press even of the North; it is simply one of a very few religious journals that have had the courage and the nobility to denounce the outrage perpetrated upon Mr. King. The religious journals of the country have for the most part ignored the case entirely; a few, and among them the Independent, have cried out against the injustice; but on the other hand some have even defended the law and its enforcement; for instance, of that part of Judge Hammond's decision which says: "Malice, religious or otherwise, may dictate a prosecution, but . . . this fact never shields the law-breaker," the Michigan Christian Advocate said:—

We respectfully advise our Adventist friends in Michigan, especially those who are unusually noisy on Sunday, to paste the above statement in some conspicuous place where they can see it often.

The Christian Advocate, of this city, did very little better in its notice of the case. The Independent and Examiner stand alone, we believe, in this city, and nearly so in the country, among religious papers in denouncing a law which makes possible persecution for conscience' sake. The Arena has stated the matter none too strongly.
