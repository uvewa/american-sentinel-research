There is anything which is unsound in Judge Hammond's view. If there is nothing to fight in the Bible, and if there is anything which it is unwise to fight about it is the Bible in public schools. Our readers know that our position has always been that the public schools shall be absolutely unsectarian; that religion should not be taught in the public schools; that does give the business of teaching religion to the Church, and not to the State; that the State has the privilege and the duty of giving intellectual and secular education, and that we most earnestly remember a long series of articles written by the late Dr. Samuel T. Spear, fully expounding and supporting this position of the *Independent*. As unanimity also guard against this matter that lately occurred in the schools of Reading, Pennsylvania. A member of the School Board made the charge that one of the teachers, Miss Maggie O'Roorke, was using the Douay Version of the Bible in her school, and a committee was appointed to investigate the charge. She stated to the committee that was the use of it; and she also read the Scriptures from this version without note or comment. The Board thereupon acquitted her of the charge of having violated any law of the charge. But the Board then voted to purchase twelve copies of the King James Version of the Bible and distribute them among the schools, and required that the teachers should read only from those copies.

It is we observe, we understand, that since not Professor Bibles shall be used in the schools of Reading. That we have not misstated the facts, the following statement made to us by Samuel S. Burr, City Superintendent of Schools, will prove:—

The facts in regard to the Bible business in our schools are these:

One of the rules of the Board requires that at the opening each morning the teacher shall read a part of the Scripture without comment. It was found that one of the Roman Catholic teachers in the employ of the board used her own the Douay version. This resulted in the Board ordering twelve copies of King James Version for distribution among the schools, and a committee of investigation appointed. The teacher using the Douay Version stated she had not violated any rules of the Board, inasmuch as she had not been told what version to use, and there was no specified which Bible should be read. This position was sustained in a manner; but a resolution was passed in the form of an amendment to this report, that hereafter teachers shall read only such Bibles as are furnished by the Board. The Board, of course, supplies only the Protestant version.
