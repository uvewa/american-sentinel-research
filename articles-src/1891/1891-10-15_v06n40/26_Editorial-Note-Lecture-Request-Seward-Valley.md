Some one has written a letter to Allen Moon, Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Lecture Bureau, 28 College Place, Chicago, from Seward Valley, Schoharie County, New York, desiring to arrange for a lecture at that place, but the individual failed to sign his name to the communication. If he will kindly furnish his name, Mr. Moon will be glad to correspond with him on the subject and arrange for a lecturer to visit the place if possible.
