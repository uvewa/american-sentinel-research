"THE director of the United States mint," says the United Presbyterian, "was instructed by the late Congress to secure new designs for our silver coins. It was thought that these designs, particularly those on the dollar, could be easily improved. But, although a prize of five hundred dollars was to be paid for each design accepted, all of those offered were rejected by the committee. If at any future time these designs should be changed, we hope the words, 'In God we trust,' will be allowed to remain."

About the only objection to these words on our coins is that it is a bit of sentimentalism, or rather of religious cant, which, in the very nature of the case, can not be true of the Nation, and is certainly not true of more than a small number of the individuals who compose the Nation.
