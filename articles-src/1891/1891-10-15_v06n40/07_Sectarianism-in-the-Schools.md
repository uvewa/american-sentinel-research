If there is anything which is unseemly to fight over it is the Bible, and if there is anything which it is unwise to fight about it is the Bible in public schools. Our readers know that our position has always been that the public schools shall be absolutely unsectarian; that religion should not be taught in the public schools; that God gave the business of teaching religion to the Church, and not to the State, but that the State has the privilege and the duty of giving intellectual and moral instruction. Our readers will also remember a long series of articles written by the late Dr. Samuel T. Spear, fully expounding and supporting this position of the Independent. An unseemly quarrel over this matter has lately occurred in Reading, Pennsylvania. A member of the School Board made the charge that one of the teachers, Miss Maggie O'Rourke, was using the Douay Version of the Bible in her school, and a committee was appointed to investigate the charge. She stated to the committee that such was the fact, and that she read the Scriptures from this version without note or comment. The Board thereupon acquitted her of the charge of having violated any of its rules. But the Board then voted to purchase twelve copies of the King James Version of the Bible and distribute them through the schools, and required that the teachers should read only from those copies.

It is now ordered, we understand, that none but Protestant Bibles shall be used in the schools of Reading. That we have not misstated the facts, the following statement made to us by Samuel A. Baer, City Superintendent of Schools, will prove:—

The facts in regard to the Bible question in our schools is as follows:

One of the rules of the Board requires that at the opening each morning the teacher shall read a portion of the Bible of at least ten verses. At least one of the dozen Catholic teachers in the employ of the Board used her own, viz., the Catholic Bible. The matter was finally brought before the Board, and a committee of investigation appointed. The facts were found as stated, but the teacher claimed she violated no rule of the Board, inasmuch as it was not specified which Bible should be read. This position was sustained in a manner, but a resolution was passed in the form of an amendment to this report, that hereafter teachers shall read only such Bibles as are furnished by the Board. The Board, of course, supplies only the Protestant Bible.

There is no question that this is making public schools sectarian, and that it is unjust and contrary to the principles of our Government, which allows of no establishment of religion. The only consistent and the only truly Christian way is to give religion to the care of the Church, and let the State take care of secular matters.
