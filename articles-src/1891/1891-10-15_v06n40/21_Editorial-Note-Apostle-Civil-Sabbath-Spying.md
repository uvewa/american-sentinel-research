It seems that the great apostle of the "civil Sabbath," with the religion in it, who has traversed this country from the lakes to the gulf, and from ocean to ocean, telling people how Sunday is violated in some of our great cities, has eminent example for the spying methods which he has confessedly followed. According to the Westminster Review, of July, 1830, the Bishop of London pursued similar methods sixty-one years ago.
