A WAR BETWEEN THE METHODIST CONFERENCE AND THE GOVERNOR.

THE Methodist Episcopal Conference recently held at Des Moines, Iowa, passed, among others, the following resolution:—

We protest against the policy of special executive clemency towards the violators of the prohibitory law, and respectfully suggest that it is the sworn duty of our chief executive to enforce said law rather than to wink at its violation and then insist upon its repeal because it is not enforced.

In a speech at Tipton, Iowa, September 26, the Governor noticed this, and very fittingly remarked:

If it is true, I am both in morals and in law guilty of the commission of a high crime, for which I should be impeached and consigned to a falon's cell, instead of occupying the position of chief magistrate of a great State. It cannot, therefore, be expected that any degree of deference for the profession in which these reverend gentlemen are engaged can close my lips when a charge so serious is made against me.

Further along in his speech the Governor said:—

I fully recognize the individual rights of these gentlemen to mix politics with religion if they so elect. I cannot, however, help reminding them that there is a very strong aversion in the ordinary American breast to the mixing of politics and religion. So strong, indeed, that in the fundamental laws of most, if not all the States of this Union, they will find express provisions completely divorcing the Church from the State.

I think I can safely say that so far as worldly people are concerned they do not believe that our politics and religion can be mixed without converting the entire mixture into politics alone in a very short time. I want to say farther that those who attempt to do this will sooner or later learn that their churches have become political instead of religious organizations and that they must thereafter be content to wield such influences over the consciences of men as other political organizations are able to do, and no greater or better.

From this it is evident that the only result of this religious conference passing such a resolution is a war between the Church and the State. Let it be observed also, that in this war the Church is the attacking party. By passing this resolution it is attempting to dictate how the State should be run in regard to civil affairs, and the only logical inference is that had it the power it would step into the executive shoes and run the State. But this is, in embryo, simply Church and State united; that is, both the ecclesiastical and the civil power vested in one body. The "respectful suggestion" to the Governor by this Iowa Methodist Conference is simply a mild threat that if he does not run things about as they want them run he may hereafter feel the lash of the Church and hear the thunders of her excommunication, and worse than all—lose his office. But in all this they are

NOT FOLLOWING THEIR PATTERN.

Christ did not come protesting against the policy of the Roman Government under which he lived, and send up "respectful suggestions" to Cesar that he should do his "sworn duty." He did not come to run the Government, but to call sinners to repentance and show all the way of life. His work was not to regenerate mankind through the power of law, but to lift up the fallen through faith in him; and this work he committed to his followers.

However much good a church may have done, or however free it may have been from attempts to ally itself with worldly powers and unite Church and State, there can be no evading the fact that when it begins to dabble in politics and dictate to civil authorities how they should conduct themselves in civil affairs it steps outside the pale of its rightful domain, and lays itself open to the charge of attempting to marry itself to the State. Its legitimate work lies in another line.
