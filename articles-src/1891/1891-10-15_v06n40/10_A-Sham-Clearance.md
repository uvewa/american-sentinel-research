WITH the foregoing title the following appeared in the editorial columns of the *Chicago Tribune*:—

The *Chicago Herald* calls attention to the fact that while the Columbian Exposition had been from the start a closed Exposition on Sunday, the Exposition was a thing apparently closely closed. The Exhibition was a thing approximately closely associated. It was open by official consent and construction to anybody who had business there, and the thoughtful who, out of mistaken belief, had kept away during the week because they had another Exhibition.

It was a good deal. And that our contemporary is correct in its statements. It is generally admitted and the statement. The *Independent* is sufficiently pointed among a larger number of journals whose concurrence makes such a general charge. The *Independent* has followed that cast all through the courts, and has again and again, and most emphatically, condemned the Tennessee law. That is the general view of leading religious papers in the North and East, and the even the spoken out at an opposed position, and with no effort to find out the facts.

Nevertheless, the *Arena* was right. The *Independent* has done all that it claims in regard to this case, but unfortunately it is not the religious press even of the North. It is simply one of a very few religious journals that have had the courage and the nobility to demonstrate the courage perpetuated upon Mr. King. The religious journals of the country have for the most part ignored the case entirely; a few, and among them the *Independent*, have cried out against the injustice; but on the other hand some have now commended the law and its enforcement; for instance, of that part of Judge Hammond's decision which says: "Malice, religion or otherwise, may furnish Clara Morrison, but . . . this fact never shields his law breaking."

The *Michigan Christian Advocate* said:—

We especially advise our Adventist friends in Michigan, especially those who are arrested only on Sunday, to paste the above denounce in some conspicuous place where they can see it often.

The *Christian Advocate*, of this city, says very little better in its notice of the case. The *Independent* and *Examiner* alone, we believe, in this city, and mainly so in the country, among religious papers to demonstrate in which there is no possible persecution for conscience' sake.

The *Arena* has stated the matter none too strongly.

THE most Ecumenical Methodist Conference is now in session in Washington, D. C. to the 7th inst., and will continue its sessions until the 26th. It will be interesting to see whether the religio-political opinions now before the nations of the world.

It seems the great apostle of the civil Sabbath, with the religion in it, who has traveled this country from the lake to the gulf, and across the ocean, telling people how Sunday is violated in some of our great cities, has not been enough for the styling methods which he has confessedly followed. All according to the *Westminster Review*, of July, 1890, the Bishop of London parsed similar methods only some years ago.

The Christian Author thinks, or says, at least, that he are misrepresent National Reformers and their methods. That our contemporary thinks there is not strange, as he, a Shakespeare puts it—

There's faults so often in themselves appear. Twos are too conspicuous permit their members own, and how are they real in substance, natures then. Or, as the Scriptures of truth more largely express it, "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the last thereof are the ways of death." Did National Reformers themselves see the too hideous things of their own; and notwithstanding all the tendency of their efforts, their eyes, they were permitted, no longer be National Reformers. Christ said to his disciples:—

"The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service."

This is exactly the case of those so-called reformers; preaching 'peace' and all the goodness of the gospel, and yet in promulgating them they think that they are honoring Christ.

Or an article in the October *Arena* (which, we print on another page of this paper), the *Independent* says:—

Referring to the conviction of a Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee for working on Sunday, the *Arena* said, and now repeats, that "the prosecution of the majority sustains the infamous law that rides into the right and that "the religious press is so dominated by bigotry and ancient prejudice that it is blind alike to the Golden Rule and the inexorable demands of justice." The *Arena* has the right to make the

statement and the observation that in effect declaring as that "Almighty God" hath created the mind free," all acts to influence it by temporal grandizations remain and those, or by civil disqualifications, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness; and is a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, being Lord both of body and mind and, yet chose not to propagate it by coercion on either, as was in his almighty power to do;" and that—

the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, where, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such seeking to impose them on others; who established and maintained false religions over the greater part of the world, and through all time;—

that man shall be compelled to frequent or support this or that religious institution or teacher whatever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall he otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or beliefs; but that all men be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.

And words to the effect that this liberality should be guarded by the people to the influence of legislation, and habits of body, and by preserving to them their rights, and to the good and peaceful example and virtuous examples and holding such sentiments would be of and the spirit of the times.

SUNDAY ACCIDENTS are frequently cited as evidence of God's care for the day and of his wrath against those who "desecrate" it. But how about this one:—

Marietta, Georgia, Sept. 21.—Yesterday was Mrs. F. E. Swatney, her sister Mrs. Morris, Mrs. Mattie Reynolds, and Miss Alma Kitchens, a married couple, started out from the Church in a buggy drawn by two spirited horses and driven by a negro coachman. At a point just at the compulsory institute the horses became frightened. This was at the top of a hill near the outpost. Three of the ladies were courageous. The driver leaped out over the dashboard. Mrs Reynolds jumped out, and receiving injuries from which she died. Mrs. Mattie, who was on the front seat, endeavoring to stop the horses when they started to run. Just as the carriage struck a stump and was dashed about, the occupants being thrown out. Miss Reynolds was thrown against the stump and her waist was broken. Mrs. Merritt received injuries upon the head from which died in a few hours. Miss Kitchens received probably fatal internal injuries.

Had this sad accident happened to a party of thoughtful young people on pleasure bent, it would have been made the text for numerous sermons on Sunday observance. The fact, however, is that accidents are no more frequent upon Sunday than upon any other day when an equal number of people are spending their

time in some other than their accustomed way. All holidays are fruitful of casualties, and Sunday is no exception. The divine harmony of the universe gives no proof that Sunday is sacred; and it is significant that Providence and revelation are likewise silent upon the subject.

In a short speech at the formal opening of the Tabard Sanitarium, Dr. J., University, at Palo Alto, California, on the 1st inst., James McNab Shaffer, one of the trustees of the Law School, remarked, as reported by the San Francisco *Chronicle*,

There was one thing which he hoped no man would try to bring within these walls, and that was the sectarianism of any religious creed or denomination. It was on our national Constitution the explicit injunction that their should be no religious test applied, and hoped that the error of the eastern institutions of this country would never be repeated at Leland Stanford.

This places Mr. Shaffer on the side of the American Sabbath Union, and with the National Reform Association, each of which, especially, has for the object of its advocacy the Christianizing the people. The question is, however, not much held in the next week, for in the 8 Sunday periods of revival held in Belaire, Missouri, in 1891 for the purposes of organizing a State auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union, Rev. D. M. B. Gray, who subsequently elected Secretary of this organization.

I do not believe that government duties them on this right to consult the present; and the object of this instrument is to show that future for us Constitutions.

It will be a source of encouragement to all holding such sentiments to know that they at least have a University in America that is likely to support their cause and hold their to understand and theistic theories of government.
