Under the heading, "The Secret of American Liberty," the *New York Ledger* last year gave utterance to the following comments on the character of and reasons for the principles of the American political system:—

No one has higher credentials Count Tolstoi, the great Russian novelist, with a specially extended study of American liberty. Yet he sends a recent the other day which shows that no other European since Henri de Tocqueville has more distinctly grasped the "secret" of our national greatness.

"In the United States," he told an American, "you have a great country—a great country— amazin, because yo scarcely know why you have so great a country." He wished us to reflect up on, that outside of the embraced cities, America entered through the customs house the average American is never brought into direct contact with the Federal Government, except through the postal service. Every year, with the State Government, he is drawn to immediate and considerable relations only through the higher courts of law. In his day, as in the early epoch of New England history it is the unit of social organization, and the government of the town, hamlet, village, municipality, with which the average citizen is brought most frequently into contact, and wherever else in the world—for Englishmen, from Russia to Patagonia—Government usually means the law—it is the habit of local and real self-rule and real confidence in it, of local self-government and sovereignty in it to its most circumscribed limits.

In this habit lies the safeguard of a personal liberty inseparable from public order, the secret of exemption from murderous conspiracies on the one hand and from anarchic revolutions on the other. It is the absence of the habit which makes republican government in France unauthorized and unstable—"constitutionless" because present French Republic is more intensely centralized than many monarchies, and intensely centralized also for absorbingness rooted in the national character, and department's acquisitions the functions of provinces, and departments acquire the functions of provinces, and departments acquire the functions in this country is to be knowledge, custom, and the institutions antecedent; for the first time, be thoroughly satisfied, the true Principles will have learned to govern themselves.

Count Tolstoi perceives, what is overlooked by our European Theorists, that the character of our modern government upon a people before it has the safest republic of the citizens themselves, is dangerous, in large as at the same. Count not may be said, if you give a nation a parliament, a standing army, and a supreme court, they have a good self-government. Such is not the lesson the United States teaches. It is a free country, yet the traces of local self rule are not the same for each. Nations with what they have under the Bourbons, it too, the British Parliament itself the most powerful results in the world, might itself accomplish only history. The establishment of colony councils had long been an accustomed local liberties. The framers of our own Federal Constitution discerned the tendencies in a national Assembly toward centralization and absorption, and provided barriers against them; but for whole our own habit or self-government.

Every day we have evidence of the truth of the statement made by Professor Gierke, the great German critic and writer, in his "Introduction to the history of the Nineteenth Century." In the following safe words:—

Roger Williams founded, in 1636, a small, new colony in Rhode Island, upon the principles of

native liberty of conscience, and the unconditional self-government of congregations. The theories of freedom in Church and State taught us the fallacies of philosophy in Europe long, found brought into practice in the governance of a small commonwealth. It was prophesied that the same demoniac attempts to obtain universal suffrage, a government solely founded upon public opinion, constitutional equality, and religious freedom, absolute disregard of the Government, and the Militant right of the whole nation, set of soul-less theories. . . .

The *Herald* and *Tribune* together would not make much and tokens and claims of those who are no ground for it. And so it is clearly seen that when an institution is so much endorsed in the interests would be found to evade it, either openly or under cover.

A NATIONAL REFORM organ publishes the following from "a gentleman who has had a wide experience in national legislation matters":—

Those who are opposed to the opening of the Fair on Chicago in the buildings of which the city this winter positively prohibiting the opening of the Exposition on Sunday, will find that such a deed good enough in embracing it. Under ordinary circumstances this would be sufficient to secure the permanent closing. Unless the bill is held up and a point, for all difficulty will be removed when the time comes if proper management is made to use.

When the bill for that purpose comes before Congress, making the loan contingent upon the closing of the Fair on Sunday, the necessary votes will be obtained for its passage. I know from personal efforts that the delegates will take trouble to make their wishes made known to their Representatives in Congress. It is no longer an experiment for local organization, will be no doubt in anybody's mind about the result. Our opponents have been organized. The opportunity is not taken advantage of the Board of Managers to show its strong Sunday sentiment. Favorable action by the local directory of the opposition is based upon the actions of members of the board of government of the Exposition are to achieve on this question, and there has been much public opinion and find its expression on this matter, which should be noted before its opponents are in their condemnation that they fully intend that it shall be closed. A proper respect for their wishes on the part of the directory and managers will save the need of any national legislation, which is the only way it can be done.

There is little doubt that every positive effort to close the Exposition should receive all the support that it deserves on its own merits. In this event it should receive some substantial recognition of Sunday on the part of the directory, and we have a proper satisfaction for all that is demanded by the American Sabbath Union and National Reformers. The question is no longer, shall the Fair be closed? but shall it remain? on the part of the friends of Sunday observance shall their demand make their contribution financial to the support of a religious institution?

THE Baptist Association of Austin, Texas, at its recent meeting passed the following:—

*Resolved*, That we should organize in connection with our churches, societies to labor especially under our influence and voice, the Lord's day's, and to cultivate a fuller knowledge of the Word of God, and a higher respect for the Lord's day, and for its destruction.

It must some present think that the "Christian Sabbath" is desperately in need of help, when it is proposed to organize an army to save it. The enemies of God in Israel of old, and the enemies of Egypt with the children of Israel present to the same thing, that when power for the Lord is left within the limits of the imagination, just feel left. If 600,000 men, or even four millions of Christians of even or 50 NAME is quite different from to any further extent organizing a crowd in which to develop bigotry and intolerance as has shown and it to the world by wanton violation. For when principles can be so far denied that men and so held from an action to constitute a record of what they believe, it is hard to tell to just what ends they are ready to go, when, for instance, the Austin Association is quite in of harmony in the respect with the tone of Sunday legislation. Its labor in the Baptists from the institution to its laboring for principles that would be imitated by the
