In a short speech at the formal opening of the Leland Stanford, Jr., University, at Palo Alto, California, on the 1st inst., James McM. Shafter, one of the trustees of the new University, said, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, that—

There was one thing which he hoped to see taught in this institution. He was sorry to see embodied in our national Constitution the sophism that Government derives its power from the consent of the governed, and hoped that the error of this assertion would be impressed upon the students.

This places Mr. Shafter right in line with the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association, the latter of which, especially, has for its object the subversion of the Constitution. The former is, however, not much behind in this evil work; for in a Sunday convention held in Sedalia, Missouri, in 1889, for the purpose of organizing a State auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union, Rev. W. D. Gray, subsequently elected Secretary of the organization, said:—

I do not believe that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and so the object of this movement is an effort to change that feature in our fundamental law.

It will be a source of encouragement to men holding such sentiments to know that they at last have a University in America that is likely to espouse their cause and teach their un-American and despotic theories of government.
