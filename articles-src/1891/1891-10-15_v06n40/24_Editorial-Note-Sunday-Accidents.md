SUNDAY accidents are frequently cited as evidence of God's care for the day and of his wrath against those who "desecrate" it. But how about this one?

MARIETTA, Georgia, Sept. 28.—Yesterday evening Mrs. F. P. Reynolds, her sister, Mrs. Merritt, Miss Mattie Reynolds, and Miss Alma Kohlheim, a cousin, started from church in the family carriage drawn by two spirited horses and driven by a negro coachman. At a point just at the corporation limits the horses became frightened. This was at the top of a bill near the railroad. They soon became unmanageable. The driver was dragged over the dashboard. Mrs. Reynolds jumped out, but the others remained in the carriage, Miss Mattie, who was on the front seat, endeavoring to control the running horses. Half way down the hill the carriage struck a stump and was demolished, the occupants being thrown out. Miss Reynolds was thrown against the stump and her neck was broken. Mrs. Merritt received injuries upon the head from which she died in a few hours. Miss Kohlheim received probably fatal internal injuries.

Had this sad accident happened to a party of thoughtless young people on pleasure bent, it would have been made the text for numerous sermons on Sunday observance. The fact, however, is that accidents are no more frequent upon Sunday than upon any other day when an equal number of people are spending their time in some other than their accustomed way. All holidays are fruitful of casualties, and Sunday is no exception. The divine harmony of the universe gives no sign that Sunday is sacred; and it is significant that Providence and revelation are likewise silent upon the subject.
