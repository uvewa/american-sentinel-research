It will be remembered that the City Council of Bradford, Pennsylvania, last July voted adversely upon a proposed Sunday ordinance for which certain of its citizens had petitioned, alleging that the proposed ordinance was unnecessary, as the State Sunday law of 1794 covered the same ground. They also stated in their report that that law was a dead letter, and that it was their belief that such a law belonged to the Dark Ages and should never have been enacted in the great commonwealth settled by William Penn and his Quaker friends. Not long afterward Mr. Crafts visited the place. In his lecture there he characterized the attitude of the City Council toward the law of 1794 as "anarchy," and remarked that over in Chicago "they hang anarchists." Referring to this statement, Mr. John P. Zane, a member of the City Council, in the Bradford Era, of September 1, says:—

Inferentially Mr. Crafts's method of purifying the morals of this city is to hang the members of the select branch of the Councils. It is true this is a thorough way to silence an opponent, but the "world moves for all that," and moves onward and upward to a better and higher civilization. I plead guilty to voting to kill the Sunday observance ordinance. I never have, and hope I never may, vote to punish or inconvenience any one who differs from my religious or political views. I have always, in my humble way, contributed to all the various churches in the places where I have lived. I believe in every one worshiping according to the dictates of his own conscience, and am willing to assist him in the opportunity of doing so. I consider the Sunday law of 1794 a relic of the Dark Ages, and in the present it is simply instrumental in religious persecution. No one is any better or happier for its existence, and good people of the Seventh-day Baptists, have suffered wrong by its enforcement.
