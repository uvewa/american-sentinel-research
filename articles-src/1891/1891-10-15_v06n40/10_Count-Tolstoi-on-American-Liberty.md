UNDER the heading, "The Secret of American Liberty," the New York Ledger last year gave utterance to the following comments on the characteristics of the principles of the American political system:—

No one has hitherto credited Count Tolstoi, the great Russian novelist, with a specially exhaustive study of American history. Yet he made a remark the other day which shows that no other European since Henri de Tocqueville has more distinctly recognized the peculiar merit of our institutions. "In the United States," he told an American visitor, "you have the best of all governments, because you scarcely know that you have any government at all." It is true, if we reflect upon it, that outside of the seaboard cities, where merchants feel the arm of the Federal Executive exerted through the custom-houses the average citizen is never brought into direct contact with the Federal Government, except through the post-office machinery. Even with the State Government, he is drawn into immediate and conscious relations chiefly through the higher courts of law. To this day, as in the early epoch of New England history, it is the unit of social organization, the local government of the county, township, and municipality, with which the average citizen is most intimately and constantly concerned. Nowhere else in the world—for Englishmen, from whom we inherited the blessing, have in a large measure lost it—is the habit of local self-rule so universal and inveterate as it is in the United States.

In this habit lies the safeguard of a personal liberty inseparable from public order, the secret of our exemption from reactionary conspiracies on the one hand and from anarchic revolutions on the other. It is the absence of this habit which makes republican government in France unsatisfactory and unstable—unsatisfactory because the present French Republic is more intensely centralized than many monarchies, and unstable because the people hold the rulers of the moment accountable for shortcomings rooted in the national character. When the French communes, arrondissements, and departments acquire the functions of local self-help and self-control, which are exercised in this country by townships, counties, and States, free institutions will, for the first time, be impregnably established, for then Frenchmen will have learned to govern themselves.

Count Tolstoi perceives, what is overlooked by too many European liberals, that to confer parliamentary government upon a people before it has shown itself capable of managing the affairs of a township, is to begin at the wrong end. But, it may be said, if you give a nation a parliament, that parliament will have the good sense to encourage local self-government. Such is not the lesson of history. France has had a parliament for a century, yet the traces of local self-rule are now few and faint, compared with what they were under the Bourbons. So, too, the British Parliament, until the recent reaction which led to the establishment of county councils, had long been encroaching on local liberties. The framers of our own Federal Constitution discerned the tendencies of a national Assembly toward centralization and absorption, and provided barriers against them; but for which our own habits of self-government might have been gradually extinguished.

Every day we have evidence of the truth of the statement made by Professor Gervinus, the great German critic and writer, in his "Introduction to the history of the Nineteenth Century," in the following words:—

Roger Williams founded, in 1636, a small, new society in Rhode Island, upon the principles of entire liberty of conscience, and the uncontrolled power of the majority in secular concerns. . . . The theories of freedom in Church and State taught in the schools of philosophy in Europe, were here brought into practice in the government of a small community. It was prophesied that the democratic attempts to obtain universal suffrage, a general elective franchise, annual parliaments, entire religious freedom, and the Miltonian right of schism, would be of short duration. But these institutions have not only maintained themselves here, but have spread over the whole Union. They have superseded the aristocratic commencement of Carolina and New York, the high-church party in Virginia, the theocracy in Massachusetts, and the monarchy throughout America; they have given laws to one-quarter of the globe; and, dreaded for their moral influence, they stand in the background of every democratic struggle in Europe.

Some of the more notable examples of the truth of this are in the great Constitutions of the world which have been recently formed; and what Professor Gervinus calls "their moral influence," not so easily seen, has been felt by every nation of the civilized world. The Independent Patriot remarks on this point that "the Constitution of the United States has been largely copied in Brazil, in Australia, and followed to some extent in Japan. How far the principles of liberty that document contains may yet go in the political world we may not now know; but if we will compare the condition of the political world when that instrument was framed, with its condition now, we may see something of the effects produced upon the race by its presentation."
