It will be remembered that the City Council of Bradford, Pennsylvania, last July voted adversely upon a proposed Sunday ordinance after only two-thirds of its citizens had petitioned, alleging that the old Pennsylvania Sunday law, and the general Sunday law of 1794 covered the same ground. They also stated in their report that this was not a wise course, and that it was then their belief that such legislation as by Mr. Penn's Act should never have been enacted. Speaking of the principles laid down by William Penn and his Quaker friends. Not the liberty of some persons to coerce others, but the liberty to leave others free to the exercise of their own right, and the law of "live and let live" or as it was said, and resembled the attitude of "every soul toward the law of the lord of lords," and remarked that ever in Chicago "they were about to revive the old Pennsylvania Sunday law."

Mr. John F. Fane, a member of the City Council, as the Bradford *Era* of September 4 says,

Intensely Mr. Crafts's method of purifying the morals of Mr. King's county. "They do not want to keep men from their beer on Sunday, but tend upward to a better and higher civilization." If his words represent to all that his reading teaches us, "Not to let us judge one another any more, nor to punish or inconvenience any one who for Christ's sake thinks it his duty to observe the Seventh day; and that that man, who prefers to visit the various churches to the places where I have charge of his own conscience." My responsibility of the discharge of his own conscience, "a right of conscience" in that matter. He spoke of the fact that in those times we are brought back to the Dark Ages, and in the present it is simply a question of "the survival of the fittest." And the Seventh-day Baptists, who have suffered for keeping the Sabbath instead of Sunday.

Does not run things about as they want them run is easy to remember that she had the last of his Church and hear the thunders of her excommunication, and worse than all—lose his office. But in all this they

NOT FOLLOWING THEIR PASTOR.

Christ did not come protesting against the policy of the Roman Government under which he lived, and send up "respectful suggestions" to Caesar that he should do his "sworn duty." He did not come to run the Government, but to call sinners to repentance and set all the way of life. His work was not to repentance standard through the power of law, but to lift up the fallen through faith in God.

However much good a church may have done, the moment it comes into politics and begins to ally itself with worldly powers and noble lords of State, there was not long for her to feel that when it begins to dabble in politics and civil, in civil authority. Nothing her duty and put themselves in civil affairs it stops outside a part of its rightful domain, and lays itself open to the charge of attempting to marry itself to the State and run in his dominion by his authority.

W. A. COLCORD.
