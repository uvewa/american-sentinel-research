A NATIONAL REFORM organ publishes the following from "a gentleman who has had a wide experience in national legislative matters":—

Those who are opposed to the opening of the World's Fair at Chicago on Sundays have a splendid opportunity to get a law enacted by Congress this winter positively prohibiting the opening of the gates to visitors on Sunday, if they are energetic enough in embracing it. Under ordinary conditions it might have been very difficult to have persuaded Congress to legislate upon the subject, but all difficulty will be removed when the World's Fair management makes its application for a loan of $5,000,000 from the Government. When the bill for that purpose comes before Congress it will be easy to offer an amendment thereto making the loan contingent upon the closing of the Fair on Sundays. If this be done and all of those opposed to opening the Exposition on Sundays will take the trouble to make their wishes known to their Senators and Representatives, the amendment will certainly become a law and there will be no doubt in anybody's mind about the closing of the Exposition on the Sabbath. If this opportunity be not taken advantage of the Board of Managers of the Fair will, in my opinion, sanction the opening of the Fair on Sundays. This opinion is based upon the actions of members of the Board. Attempt after attempt has been made to get the members of the Board to commit themselves on this question, and there has been such unanimity in their replies to the effect that there was plenty of time and that they would not decide the question until just before the time for the opening of the Exposition, that I have come to the conclusion that they fully intend that it shall be open on Sundays, but do not care to so announce until it shall be too late to prevent it by Congressional legislation, which is the only way it can be prevented.

There is little doubt that every possible effort will be made to secure from the Fifty-second Congress some substantial recognition of Sunday sacredness, a recognition that will serve as a precedent for all that is demanded by the American Sabbath Union and kindred organizations. The question is no longer, shall the Fair be closed? but shall the Government of the United States commit itself to the support of a religious institution?
