NOTHING but the grace of God will keep men from sin, no matter what the consequences may be, and that grace is not imparted by legislative enactment, nor by fear of the stake. It is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance, and nowhere has he commissioned either his ministers or the State to drive men to repentance by burning or stoning, or even by fines and imprisonment.
