SUNDAY ACCIDENTS are frequently cited as evidence of God's care for the day and of his wrath against those who "desecrate" it. But how about this one:—

Marietta, Georgia, Sept. 21.—Yesterday was Mrs. F. E. Swatney, her sister Mrs. Morris, Mrs. Mattie Reynolds, and Miss Alma Kitchens, a married couple, started out from the Church in a buggy drawn by two spirited horses and driven by a negro coachman. At a point just at the compulsory institute the horses became frightened. This was at the top of a hill near the outpost. Three of the ladies were courageous. The driver leaped out over the dashboard. Mrs. Reynolds jumped out, and receiving injuries from which she died. Mrs. Mattie, who was on the front seat, endeavoring to stop the horses when they started to run. Just as the carriage struck a stump and was dashed about, the occupants being thrown out. Miss Reynolds was thrown against the stump and her waist was broken. Mrs. Merritt received injuries upon the head from which died in a few hours. Miss Kitchens received probably fatal internal injuries.

Had this sad accident happened to a party of thoughtful young people on pleasure bent, it would have been made the text for numerous sermons on Sunday observance. The fact, however, is that accidents are no more frequent upon Sunday than upon any other day when an equal number of people are spending their time in some other than their accustomed way. All holidays are fruitful of casualties, and Sunday is no exception. The divine harmony of the universe gives no proof that Sunday is sacred; and it is significant that Providence and revelation are likewise silent upon the subject.
