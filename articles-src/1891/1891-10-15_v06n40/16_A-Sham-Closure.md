With the foregoing title the following appeared in the editorial columns of the Chicago Tribune, September 9:—

The Chicago Herald calls attention to the fact that the pretended closed Sunday at the Philadelphia Exposition was a sham. It says:—

"The Exhibition was indeed apparently closed, and it was actually closed to the common people. But it was open by official consent and connivance to officials and their families and friends. . . . So well known was this fact in Philadelphia that the thoughtful who, out of mistaken belief, had favored the closed Sunday, freely declared that if another Exhibition were held there it should be open to all the people."

There is no doubt that our contemporary is correct in its statement. It is generally admitted that thousands of the persons named enjoyed a nice, quiet inspection of everything within the gates on Sunday, but the artisans were locked out.

The Herald and Tribune together would not make and inform such a statement if there were no ground for it. And so it is clearly seen that when an institution is not enshrined in the heart, means will be found to evade it, either openly or under cover.
