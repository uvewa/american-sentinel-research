This decision recently handed down by Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, in the celebrated case of R. M. King, is rich in lessons of vital importance to thoughtful minds at the present time of unrest, when conservatism is seeking on every hand, even under the cloak of radical movements, to secure statutes and legal constructions of laws which may at an early day be used to fetter thought, crush liberty, and throttle the vanguard of progress. Briefly stated, the important facts in the case in question are these: Mr. King is a respectable, hard-working farmer. He is charged with no trespass of morals; in fact, it appears that he is a remarkably upright man. But he is a Seventh-day Adventist; that is, he does not hold the same religious views as the majority in his State. He stands in the same relation to his countrymen as that occupied by the early disciples of Christ to Roman society when Nero undertook to punish Christians by letting nightly human fires for the delectation of connoisseurs of martyrdom. He is of the minority, even as the Huguenots were in the minority when the Church tortured, racked, and burned them for the image of God and the good of humanity. He is of the minority, as was Roger Williams was, in 1635, the popular and unworthy thought of Salem banished him.

Mr. King is not an infidel or even a doubter. On the contrary, he is ardently religious, being a most exemplary Christian member of a sect of Christians noted for their purity of faith. He is an Adventist, of whom he is an honored member, it must be remembered, held somewhat peculiar views about the second advent of Christ. They believe they find in the Bible commands making it obligatory upon them to keep holy the seventh day of the week, or the Hebrew Sabbath, instead of Sunday, the holiday and rest-day observed by most Christian denominations.

Now, it was always in the trial that, continuing to be halted, Mr. King strictly observed the Sabbath, or Saturday, but being a poor farmer he could not afford to rest two days each week, or ever one hundred days in the year, and therefore, after having kept the Sabbath he plowed in his field on Sunday. This accused the pious indignation of the narrow-minded and bigoted members of the community in the prosecution that followed, and then hardened us to God not, to resist not evil, and to do unto others as we would that others do unto us. These Christians (!) who, unfortunately for the cause of religion and religious liberty, are in the majority in Tennessee, had indictments, convictions, God-fearing man arrested at a country, fined, and convicted of the heinous crime of Sabbath-breaking by plowing on Sunday. He appealed to the Supreme Court, and the sentence was affirmed. Then the Adventists and the National Sabbath Association took up the case. Hon. Don. M. Dickinson was engaged as counsel, and the case was taken to the United States Court. But Judge Hammond refused to set aside the conviction of the lower courts, the contention being that this conviction was contrary to the Bill of Rights of Tennessee and the Constitution of the United States, and that the defendant was held prisoner by the shall not due process of law.

The publication, which argued several months ago, and Judge Hammond has since his decision was given to the public when his decision was resumed for back to the body of the sheriff to pay his fine or serve the time according to the sentence. He decides that states, religious, or otherwise, may dictate a procedure, correction, or not shift the law themselves. Neither do the courts require that there shall be any material control enough to support a given doctrine or enforcing teaching, and it is not in order to remarking that to violate the Sunday observance statutes shall be of the kind that it could to remain in the set type of the individual.

The lessons needed, indeed, are the issues of this great judicial crime against liberty, justice, and God. In the first place it illustrates the fact which must long since have become apparent to the public mind, that corruption now, we may see nothing of, and constituting the condition of the political world as what the instruments produced. . . .

minority, regarded by the majority as dangerous innovators or disseminators of false theories and doctrine. In my article on Socialism I noted the case of Mr. King, observing that:—

It is in way deserves the shameful impertinence in nothing; yet the prejudice of the majority sustains the infamous law that cruises into the right of the innocent, and takes into consideration the rights of the minority. And what of those same rights, religious press as dominated by bigotry and ancient prejudice that it is blind alike to the Inquisition and the shameful deeds of the burning of heretics. And this agitation on the subject of Sunday laws and Sunday closing is not to secure rest merely for the laboring man as they would have us believe, but to secure the compulsory religious observance. "Consistency, thou art a jewel."

This act of legislation is no legislation.—*Evening Sun.*
