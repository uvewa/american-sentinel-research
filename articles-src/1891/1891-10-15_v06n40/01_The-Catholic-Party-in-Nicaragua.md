The Catholic party in Nicaragua is essentially the National Reform party of this country, just as the National Reformers propose to do in this country. The followers who were banished might have remained in Nicaragua if they had just "raved;" if things had been content to allow the Government to manage the churches and manipulate everything in the interest of the "Church of Christ;" as they would not do, and so they have been banished; possibly "to some wild desolate land, there to set up a government of their own, and to stay there till they learn better."
