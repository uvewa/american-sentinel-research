A WAR BETWEEN THE METHODIST CONFERENCE AND THE STATE.

This Methodist Episcopal Conference recently held at Des Moines, Iowa, passed, among others, the following resolution:—

We protest against the policy of special privileges to corporations violating the Sunday rest-day law, and respectfully suggest that if the law is not good enough to be enforced it should be repealed; but we respectfully insist that the State cannot ignore its repeal because it is not enforced.

From this it is evident that the only result of such political conference passing such a resolution is a war between the Church and the State. Let it be observed also, that in this war the Church is the attacking party. By this resolution the Methodist Episcopal Conference virtually demanded, in respect to civil affairs, and the only logical step is from the legislature into the executive, and into the executive above and run the State. For this is the only logical conclusion and when Church and State are united; that is, both the ecclesiastical and the civil power are in one body. The "respectful suggestion" to the Governor by this Iowa Methodist Conference is simply a still liberal effort of the
