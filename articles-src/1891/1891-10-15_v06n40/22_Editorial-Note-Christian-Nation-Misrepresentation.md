The Christian Nation thinks, or says, at least, that we misrepresent National Reformers and their methods. That our contemporary thinks thus is not strange, since, as Shakespeare puts it—

Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear. Their own transgressions partially they smother. Oh! how are they rapt in with infamies, That then their own misdeeds askance their eyes. Or, as the Scriptures of truth more tersely express it, "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death." Did National Reformers themselves see the hideous deformities of their own system, and realize the innate wickedness of their scheme, they would, we are persuaded, no longer be National Reformers. Christ said to his disciples: "The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." This is exactly the case of these so-called reformers; their principles kill the spirit of the gospel, and yet in promulgating them they think that they are honoring Christ.
