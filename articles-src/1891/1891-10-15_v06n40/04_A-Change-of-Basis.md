REV. DR. WM. R. NICHOLLS (Episcopal) takes Dr. Lorimer (Baptist) of Tremont Temple, Boston, severely to task for his utterances on the subject of the sacredness of Sunday, in his sermon preached in Chicago, September 6. Dr. Lorimer, in the substance that he believed with Martin Luther that the first day of the commemoration of the resurrection of Christ as a day of rest and rejoicing—a day of commemoration, but denied that it might not be a holy day or consecrated sacred time.
