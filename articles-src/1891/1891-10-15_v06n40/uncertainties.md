# Uncertainties Log - Volume 6, Number 40 (1891-10-15)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from a Mistral OCR file. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text throughout most of the issue. The following items were noted during transcription:

### Page 2, Article "The Individual Right of Religious Belief"
- **Line:** "...and was so religious'v observed..."
- **Transcribed as:** "religiously"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear OCR error - "religious'v" should be "religiously" based on context

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association section
- **Text:** "carve to society" (line 235)
- **Transcribed as:** "carve to society"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error, likely should be "curse to society" based on context discussing the liquor traffic, but transcribed as appears in OCR

### Page 6, Officers section
- **Names:** "R. C. PORTER", "A. F. SALLENGER", "SIGNATURE"
- **Note:** These appear to be signature lines or officers' names but formatting unclear in OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Unclear if these are actual names or placeholder text; transcribed as appears

### Page 6, Article "Church and State in Iowa"
- **Text:** "falon's cell" (line 279)
- **Transcribed as:** "falon's cell"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - OCR error
- **Reason:** Should likely be "felon's cell" but transcribed as appears in OCR

### Advertisements and images
- Multiple advertisement sections on pages 7-8 were not transcribed as they are not substantive articles
- Image references (img-0.jpeg, img-1.jpeg, img-2.jpeg) noted but not described in detail
