THE Baptist Association of Austin, Texas, at their recent meeting adopted the following resolution:—

Resolved, That we should organize in connection with all Christians of any or no name, to protect, by our influence and votes, the Lord's day, or Christian Sabbath, against the influences at work for its destruction.

An association must think that the "Christian Sabbath" is desperately in need of help, when it is willing to organize with Christians of any or no name. The "mixed multitude" that went out of Egypt with the children of Israel presents to the mind the picture of a motley crowd; but it is left within the limits of the imagination; just what kind of an organization could be effected out of all Christians of any or NO NAME is quite difficult to imagine. It certainly would make a good crowd in which to develop bigotry and intolerance equal to that of the twelfth century. For when principle can be so far sacrificed that men are ready to confederate with everybody regardless of what they believe, it is hard to tell to just what ends they will go. It is evidently true that the Austin Association is quite out of harmony with many of the rest of their Baptist brethren. As a people the Baptists have a record for a firmer stand for principle than would be indicated by the foregoing resolution.
