# No Sunday Law Needed.

THIS is a land of liberty. This is the clearest spot on the face of the earth. The nations have flocked in hope to find a haven of freedom. Here, if anywhere, should the shackles be taken from the mind as well as from the body. Here, if anywhere, should free thought and free action and of intellect, denied in the Old World, be not only permitted, but encouraged as a right.

The *Bar* is manifestly opposed to any Sunday law that will in any way manner restrict the freedom of the individual. For that reason, it is in heart and soul against the measure which a few people would force that relief for the pleasure down the throats of the citizens. The State has no more moral right to pass a Sunday law than it has to pass a Saturday law; for Saturday is the Sabbath of the Jews and of the Seventh-day Adventists. To the law-giving power, all religions should be equally sacred, and all should be kept therein, and not allowed to flaunt above its Constitution.

The *Bar* believes in one day's rest out of seven, but it does not believe that the churches should be permitted to crack their whips over the shoulders of the people. Those who do not go to church, and they are fully two-thirds of the population, certainly have equally as much right in the country with those who do. Those who aim to enforce a proper, respectful and orderly treatment of the usually observed Sabbath day are well meaning, and to them we could have no objection. But we certainly do protest against any such measure as is now before the Legislature as a measure reckless of observed and a crushing of individual liberty.—*Stevens Point (Wis.) Bar.*
