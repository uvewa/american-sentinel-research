This is a land of liberty. This is the chosen spot to which the oppressed of all nations have flocked in hope to find a haven of freedom. Here, if anywhere, should the shackles be taken from the mind as well as from the body. Here, if anywhere, should that independence of action and of intellect, denied in the Old World, be not only permitted, but sacredly guarded as a right.

The Bee is unalterably opposed to any Sunday law that will in any manner interfere with the freedom of the individual. For that reason, it is heart and soul against the measure which a few people desire that the Legislature shall cram down the throats of the citizens. The State has no more moral right to pass a Sunday law than it has to pass a Saturday law; for Saturday is the Sabbath of the Jews and of the Seventh-day Adventists. To the law-giving power, all religions should be equally sacred, and all should be kept beneath, and not allowed to flaunt above, the Constitution.

The Bee believes in one day's rest out of seven, but it does not believe that the churches should be permitted to crack their whips over the shoulders of the people. Those who do not go to church, and they are fully two-thirds of the population, certainly have equally as much right as the one-third who do attend. Laws which aim to enforce a proper, respectful and orderly treatment of the usually accepted Sabbath day are well enough, and to those we could have no objection. But we certainly do protect against any such measure as is now before the Legislature—a measure redolent of slavery and of the crushing out of individual liberty.
