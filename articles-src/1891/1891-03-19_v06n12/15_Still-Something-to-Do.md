THE Bosque County, Texas, Farmers' Alliance, at its January meeting, adopted the following preamble and resolution:—

WHEREAS, The National Farmers' Alliance at its recent session at Ocala, Florida, adopted a resolution requesting the closing of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or as it was termed the "American Sabbath"; and

WHEREAS, Governmental interference in the interests of any particular creed or religion is an abridgment of the untrammeled exercises of religious preferences and religious liberty guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, and therefore an infringement of a cardinal feature; and

WHEREAS, Our order being strictly non-sectarian, should take no stand discriminating either for or against any particular religious tenet; and

WHEREAS, If the request were granted thousands of toilers living in or near Chicago would be denied admission on the only day of the week in which they would have time to visit this ennobling institution;

Resolved, That we deprecate this hasty and ill-considered step toward the restriction of individual freedom of conscience, and earnestly request our Supreme Council to reconsider its action.

We are glad to record the fact of the adoption of this resolution, as it shows that so-called National Reform has something to do before it can dominate the whole Farmers' Alliance.
