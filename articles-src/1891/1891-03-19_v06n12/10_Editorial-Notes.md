# Editorial Notes

On the so-called "civil" Sabbath men are forbidden to work. Nobody, except those who are planning for a "civil Sabbath," would object to a law making Sunday a legal holiday in the same sense as the Fourth of July, and the Thirty-second of February. But that is not what they are asking for, and not what they mean to ask for.

The *Western Herald*, an Iowa paper, says: "The movement for Sunday observance is contrary to the spirit of the Governor, and opposed to the teachings of the Saviour."

---

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, is the name of the official organ of the American Sabbath Union. It is to be published under the direction of the Board, by the S. D. A. Pub. Rev. New York, in March, June, September, and December.

The attempt to reduce the age of consent, in this State, from sixteen years to twelve years should disturb primarily every member of the Legislature who favors it. That any member would be found to introduce such a measure is in itself to be a deplorable step toward crime, in the interest of brutal keepers and little waifs we turn to God. Every true citizen should cry out against this proposed legislation.

---

The Ordinance that the Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodist Churches, of Alexandria, should give the right to use of their church buildings to the Women's Christian Temperance. This piece, upon demand that it was simply a political organization of the churches, and expresses the opinion that the use of a church by the Union for political purposes could be justified only by sentimental reasons.

At a recent Sunday-law meeting in Tacoma, Wash., Rev. B. S. McBurly is reported by the *Ledger* to have said:—

We do not ask legislation for the religious Sabbath. We ask for a civil rest day.

But a "civil rest day" is not the same as a "civil Sabbath," nor is each want for more religious legislation, but any one holiday can continue to exist as a "rest day" without this. Without a civil rest in the manner of the freedom of one individual. It is impossible to nominate the civil Sabbath, like a holiday for laborers, and made. Take off the barriers and how long would it, be before some of our American citizens, who would begin each seven days in the week, would gross in his customs at an end to that of? Others would follow, and little by little the laboring man would lose his holiday. The inner door then to other—this nation, can not afford.

Such talk only first prove the above the dignity of twaddle. Secular work is not forbidden on civil holidays. On a holiday every

man can work or not, just as he chooses. On the so-called "civil" Sabbath men are forbidden to work. Nobody, except those who are planning for a "civil Sabbath," would object to a law making Sunday a legal holiday in the same sense as the Fourth of July, and the Thirty-second of February. But that is not what they are asking for, and not what they mean to ask.

A COMMENTARY of the Sacramento *Record-Union's* indignation declare the charge of the Sunday-law advocates that California is the most immoral State in the Union. And not only does he deny the charge, but he replies in it with moral from the mouths of the very ones who made it:—

While the Sunday-law movement, it is not a matter of surprise that its promoters think it legitimate to do evil which good may come. The whole thing is Jesuitical. and why should its methods be of the same nature?

A CALIFORNIA paper says, by a correspondent, according to the liberal system of the Senate Chamber, on the 11th instant, Dr. Thompson, "I want to know something about the bill. We are collecting, or something of that sort. I'm in favor of cutting and sewing, in all of both at the same time, if you will allow me; law, er, I want to know which was the most immoral before the law gave to a Sunday law for a homely boy?" The Doctor had to admit that he could not.

The fact is that the demand for Sunday laws came from the churches and from church people, and it is made solely in the interest of religion and the church. This fact should be kept before the people.

The American Secular Union announces that the $1,000 prize offered by them, about a year since, has been awarded to Nicholas Paine Gilman, A. M., Editor of the Literary World, Boston, and Edward Payson Jackson, A. M., Professor of Physics, for the celebrated condition of Faith at Boston.

For the best essay, or course, or reasoned program, to be used and meet teachers in our free public schools, in a high school to meet the needs of these schools and public and charitable institutions professing to be non-religious, or non-sectarian . . . to instruct the youth in the great principles of morality, without inculcating religious dogmas or tenets, at the same time the legal right, under our Federal Constitution, of all our citizens, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and

Protestants, Liberals and Apostles, and all other classes, whether believers or disbelievers, to have their consciences fully and equally respected, without favoring sectionalism, or any particular form of secular education, or any political party or partisan against any secular party."

The executor of the Union says the award of the prize says that the committee decided that no one manuscript perhaps fully met the conditions of the offer, that two of them together did closely showing, that morality can be taught without teaching theology, that the committee believes a subject to be equally divided between two gentlemen. The prize was therefore divided between those two in equal value.

It is further stated that the book will appear about September 1, 1891. We still feel, as we have stated more than once, considerable interest in this matter. Our interest is, however, principally of the moral variety. We do want to know how they propose to give the required instruction according to the stipulations of that prize.

The Topographical Cabinet, having outgrown its present locality, at the upper town of San Francisco, have proposed across the bay to San Francisco, where they are also now associated seven times a week; a *The Daily Prophet*, and the *Weekly* to be a mass of prosperity, and the *Sunday Monthly* may has been before in evidence for prosperity. We repudiate in no way the known titles the "Platform" of the new daily . . . to publish statements of persons and institutions which we must respect or "balance." We look at it as the stand for certain reform as do the old publications. We will continue to enforce religions by law are contrary to the Declaration of Independence of the Constitution of the United States.

---

We believe that most people do not realize the extremes to which the Sunday legislative has already gone in this country. We shall show in another issue how completely some of our States have legislated upon the subject, and demand that we be held to be great officers . . . to be guilty of one grade criminal offense or more or all whom public offense. So and said articles we urge our readers to take extra copies and circulate them. The shortcomings of citizens should not be counted as nothing. The "civil Sunday" is simply the religious institution enforced with the material to expend. Such matters are in the power of secular courts and magistrates; therefore we are not any particular religious minds.

---

We are glad to record the fact of the growing conviction in all quarters, that the so-called National Reform is something to believe it can dominate the American press.

DOSANXXX says, "the love of liberty is implanted by nature in the breasts of all men." Patrick Henry gave vent to that nature when he said, "Give me liberty or give me death!"—*Independent Patriot.*
