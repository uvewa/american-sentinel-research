A CIRCULAR reaches us from a far Eastern State, with this heading, "Shall Church Property be Taxed?" We answer emphatically, Yes! It should be taxed equally with all other property. Either all property should be taxed or none should be. The Church has no rightful claim to special favors from the State, but is an institution that can and should bear an equitable share of the burden of taxation. It is not the business of the State to look after the Church, further than to give it the same protection extended to all other institutions—no more, no less. If the Church cannot exist without the aid of the State, that is entirely its own affair, and no concern of the State's. The Church is, or ought to be, purely a religious institution, voluntarily supported by those who accept its tenets or beliefs, or not at all. The State is, or ought to be, purely a secular institution, existing solely to preserve civil and national rights, liberty, equity, and justice, and extending equal protection to all, but favors to none.

In so far as a portion of the property in a community is exempted from taxation, by just that much is the taxation of the remainder increased, and this is neither right nor just.

All over this country there are wealthy religious associations whose vast property is safe from the touch of the tax-gatherer. All over this country are humble homes ready to be sold for taxes. The bronze doors of Trinity Church in New York City, presented to it by William Waldorf Astor, are alone worth $100,000, yet it pays no taxes. Another church edifice has one window worth $50,000. These associations are able to pay their preachers from $5,000 to $25,000 a year, yet their property bears no share of the tax burden. Not far away are the homes of hundreds of workingmen and poor people, whose humble property is taxed to the full limit, and whose share of the public expense is proportionately greater because the magnificent possessions of favored institutions go free. Surely there are few who cannot see the injustice of this.
