It is well known that Joseph Cook is delivering another series of his famous Monday-noon lectures, in Tremont Temple, Boston. The following is one of his characteristic utterances on that platform:—

We hear of protection for tin, coal, wool, salt, etc., but where is protection for Christianity? The duty on things should wait for the duty on men.

This is a fair sample of the stuff that the elite of Boston accept from their idol, and not only accept, but greet with cheer on cheer. Does it seem possible that so much knowledge as Mr. Cook displays, can exist in the same head, concomitantly with so little wisdom, and such inbecility of reasoning?

"Where is protection for Christianity?" Where, indeed, should it be but in the Almighty Author and upholder of Christianity? When he ceases to be almighty, and when he ceases to verify his promise that we, through him, may be "strengthened with all might according to his glorious power," then, indeed, it will be time for the believers in Christianity, if such there still be, to class their heaven-born religion with tin, coal, wool, salt, etc., as a fit subject for State protection. Such an utterance as the above falls but little short of what "the fool hath said in his heart," namely, that "there is no God." At least it is a confession that in the mind and heart capable of fathering such a sentiment, God, as a source of moral and spiritual power and protection, is either dead or absent, and that, therefore, his religion, in that person's conception, has degenerated like the paganism of old, into a mere piece of statecraft.

Why do we protect tin, coal, wool, salt, etc.? The answer is: because we can not compete with the cheaper labor of other countries, in their production. When, therefore, men ask for protection for Christianity, it is a confession that in their judgment Christianity can not compete with agnosticism and the false religions of the world. All truth is from God; all error, from the father of lies. When, therefore, men say that the true can not compete with the false, they simply say that God can not compete with Satan, or that Satan is stronger than God. What is that but to dethrone God, and make the devil god of the universe in God's stead? This is simply what paganism, and all false religions, have, in different ways, always accomplished. When Mr. Cook asks for State protection for religion he is either, as before shown, logically dethroning God, and defying Satan, or else he is publicly admitting that the religion he wants protected, is a false religion, which really needs protection in order to compete with the true. Which horn of the dilemma he would choose, I know not, but either is bad enough.

It were well for all such to remember the prayer of Jesus for his Church, when he was about to leave the earth and ascend to the Father: "I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them are lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil. Neither pray I for those alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word. Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth; that they all may be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me." John 17:9-21.

Christ did not ask for the protection of the world, i. e., the State, but for the protection of his Father. It is evident from these solemn words of Christ's prayer, that the Church was not to be the world, nor the world the Church, but the Church was to be the faithful few who would leave the world to walk the highway of holiness with God. These were to be protected in the way by the power of God, and thus be a living illustration of that power which could lift them above the State, and all their environment, and in spite of the error of the world, and the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, sanctify them through the truth. The world seeing this evidence of divine power and protection, was to be led to believe in Christ, and in the Father who sent him. So long as Christians have faith in that prayer of Christ and in the power of the Father, who promised to answer that prayer, they will ask no other protection. When they do ask and receive State protection, that kind of Christianity is no longer an illustration of a power above the world, to lift mankind to God, but it is an illustration of a power of the world to hold all mankind down on a level. And, therefore, when Christianity is thus protected, the Church, as in the fourth century, soon becomes the State, and the State the Church. Such protection is simply destruction. The Church really ceases to exist, for it is lost in the State, and its officers are officers of the State who use Christianity but for political ends.

Christianity then either ceases to exist, or lingers only in the hearts of a faithful and persecuted few who are compelled thereby to resist both the Church and the State.

There is one other reason why the Government protects "tin, coal, wool, salt, etc." It is to secure a revenue with which to maintain or enhance its power. May not this be a hint of the true reason why so many ministers are now clamoring for State protection? Having lost in a large degree the power of God, and the revenue which freely flows from the honest hearts and converted pockets of true Christians, they want to make up the lack by the power of the State, and the revenue of the State, by which they hope in the future millennial Utopia to be supported.
