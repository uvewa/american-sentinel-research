Our Government is equally tolerant of all religions. It no more fosters the Christian Church than any other temple of worship of other religious worshipers. It tolerates and protects the Church as against annoyances, but it is no more based upon Christianity than Mohammedanism. So our highest tribunals have often decided. There is not an instance in history where any civil government has attempted or assumed to foster and support the Church, but what thereby both the Church and civil government have been corrupted and demoralized. Christianity being of a kingdom not of this world, can not be united with that of this world. This is too plain a proposition to be denied, and when the Church descends to asking civil power to aid in its support there is something dangerously carnal in the purpose.

Religion addresses itself entirely to the heart and the conscience, and no man should be forced in any direction of his conscience, in favor or against any religious doctrine or faith. That all are to be protected in the free right of worship can not be denied, whether Christian, Buddhistic, or Confucian. And that a day of rest or Sabbath day should be recognized and observed is not to be denied. But this should be done in a way equally protective to the conscientious views of all.

No honest religionist or worshiper can ask anything more in this respect, than peaceable protection in his observance and worship on any day. He has no right to demand of any other person a sacrifice of any right of conscience. An honest man will make no such demand. If any one does so there is something rotten in his moral nature. The observers of the first day of the week as the Sabbath can ask no more for their religious convictions than can those who observe the seventh day. If the seventh-day worshipers were to demand of Government a forced observance of their day, those of the first day would look upon it as intolerance and presumption, and rightfully so, too, and so is the demand of the observers of the first day toward those of the seventh day; and a free Government must so consider it.
