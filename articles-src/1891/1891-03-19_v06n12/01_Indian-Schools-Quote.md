IN the House, February 14, Hon. Joseph D. Taylor, speaking of Indian schools, said: "Mr. Chairman, the schools ought to be non-partisan and non-sectarian. They ought to be exclusively Government schools. I have no criticism to make of any church; on the contrary, I honor every church which has labored to educate and Christianize the Indians. . . . But it was never the aim of the Federal Government to support or encourage sectarian schools. The Constitution itself is not silent on this subject, and at least, thirty of the States of the Union have incorporated into their Constitutions provisions against supporting sectarian schools at public expense, including the six new States recently admitted."
