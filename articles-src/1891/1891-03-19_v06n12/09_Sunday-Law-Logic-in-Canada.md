BRITISH COLUMBIA, like several of the States of our own country, is wrestling with the Sunday-law problem, or rather the friends of religious liberty there are battling to maintain their rights against the assaults of those who would destroy them in the supposed interests of religion. In a recent discussion of a Sunday bill in the Legislature of that province, reported in the Victoria Times, Hon. Mr. Davie said that he did not intend to pass a silent vote on this question, nor yet did he intend to support the second reading of the bill before the House. He was entitled to give his individual opinion for so doing, and he must say he was not in favor of the bill. For his part he believed in freedom of action, and so long as a man does not trespass on the rights of his neighbor he has a right to do as he pleases, whether on Sunday or any other day. The mere question of morals is one entirely for himself and his Maker. As for trying to legislate for morality, it is a mistake altogether. Mr. Davie was perfectly prepared to admit the sanctity of the Sabbath, but thought that law should not interfere with private rights. If one has a billiard room and asks a friend to come and have a game of billiards on Sunday or any other day, he has a perfect right to do so. This act has the very same fault that the old Elizabethan act had, to which Mr. Davie made reference the other day. The persons mentioned in clause 2, with the general term "or any other persons," simply meant those people. Therefore this is a law in favor of what are called in the old statute, "gentlemen." It will restrict the workingman, or any one who has to work for a living, from everything almost, on Sunday, and will give the rich man or the idle loafer tho utmost freedom. As to tipping (whatever that might be), why should that be forbidden on Sunday any more than on other days in the week, if it is wrong? And then gambling with dice, why is the act, he asked, restricted to this, while any one who is inclined can go into the back parlor and play faro and poker, which are worse? Then why should the man who had been working hard all the week be prevented from taking his gun and doing a little potting on Sunday? Did it do any one any harm? That clause is too ridiculous to be entertained.

Altogether Mr. Davie considered the act an undesirable measure, as being entirely unnecessary, and as endeavoring to infringe upon private rights. It would be a retrogressive movement to pass it.

Colonel Baker, although he would not vote against the second reading of this bill was inclined to agree with the Attorney-General that it is not desirable to restrain individual rights.

Another view of the matter was presented by Mr. Robson, who, according to the report, urged the passage of the bill on religious grounds.

Honorable members must recollect that they are legislating for a British country, and they must remember that the very basis, so to speak, of the British throne is the Bible. He believed that Great Britain is great because she is a Christian nation. This being a branch of that nation, an important question like that before the House should be discussed in a spirit of sobriety and earnestness, desiring to place this province in at least as good a position in regard to legislation of this kind as the other provinces of the Dominion. He was sorry he could not agree with the remarks of the Attorney-General. It was a very broad view to take that a man should be allowed to do as he liked, so long as he did not interfere with the rights of his neighbor.

The Sabbath imposes a great obligation upon us—we must observe it not only as a day of rest, but of worship. Mr. Robson hoped he was right in saying that this House represents, at all events, a nominally Christian community. Now if a man is allowed to do as he pleases, the Sabbath disappears altogether in the light of a Christian obligation. Mr. Robson thought it would be most unfortunate if we were to attempt to copy the customs of some of those continental countries which have disposed of the Sabbath altogether.

Hon. Mr. Pooley referred to the statement of the leader of the Government that it would be a standing disgrace to British Columbia not to have a Sunday law. Mr. Pooley took exactly the opposite view of the matter.

He considered it a great credit to British Columbia that there has never been any necessity to pass a law of that kind. British Columbia has always been a most orderly, well-conducted province. Why a law of this kind is needed, he did not understand; the country is as well conducted to-day as when he first came into it twenty-eight years ago. The honorable member for New Westminster had stated that football, cricket, and other games are an annoyance to certain members of the community. Mr. Pooley had never seen any of these games played on Sunday, but if they did take place, he would not seek them if they were an annoyance to him. Why should people who do not like these matters, go for a walk on Sunday after church? They are taking their enjoyment in their own way; why should not others, who also engage in innocent amusement, take their recreation? Mr. Pooley could not see why this should be, and while saying this, he was a church man, but would not say to his neighbor, "You must do as I do." He thought it a bad class of legislation to bring into the House. Mr. Pooley personally believed in staying at home and enjoying the rest which the Sunday gives, but he did not think it his duty to legislate that a man may not do as he wishes. He would vote against the bill.

From all of which it appears that about the only difference between the Sunday-law contest in the Dominion and in the United States, is that in the former they are more bold to demand enforced Sunday observance upon the only real ground that there is for it, namely, the religious character of the day.
