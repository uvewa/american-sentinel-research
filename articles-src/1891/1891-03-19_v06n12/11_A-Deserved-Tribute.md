THE Mail and Express pays the following deserved tribute to the Constitution of the United States:—

The founders of our Government knew how liable power is to wax into tyranny, and there is, therefore, nothing in our national Constitution in which we see such wisdom and consummate statesmanship as in the numerous checks provided for this dangerous tendency in human government.

The Constitution of the United States is the most wonderful work of human wisdom and prudence extant. It was framed by the master minds of the country. In it we see the patriotism of Washington, the comprehensiveness of Hamilton, the sagacity of Franklin, and the loyalty and love of liberty of all those splendid heroes who fought and struggled and suffered for our national independence. In it we see a free representation and mutual checks. We see the legislative authority lodged in three distinct branches and properly balanced. The executive authority is divided between two branches, and the judicial authority is reserved for an independent body, who hold their office during good behavior. In it we have secured to us those sacred rights handed down with Magna Charta, and the due and salutary conservation of the mutual rights between the governed and the governing.

In it the clashing interests of the States are so exquisitely adjusted and nicely balanced that the rights of all are recognized. The Constitution is a compromise into which all the States have entered, and involves mutual sacrifices and forbearance. The peace and prosperity, the very existence of the Nation depend upon the fidelity of the States to the Federal Constitution.

This is remarkable, coming, as it does, from a paper of decided National Reform tendencies.
