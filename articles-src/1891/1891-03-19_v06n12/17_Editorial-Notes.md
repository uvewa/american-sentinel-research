The Western Herald, an Iowa paper, says: "The movement for Sunday observance is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and opposed to the teachings of the Saviour."

The American Sabbath, is the name of the new official organ of the American Sabbath Union. It is to be published under the direction of the Union, at No. 23 Park Row, New York, in March, June, September, and December.

The attempt to reduce the age of consent, in this State, from sixteen years to twelve years, should damn politically every member of the Legislature who favors it. That any member could be found to introduce such a measure is a disgrace to our civilization. The bill is in the interest of brothel keepers and libertines. Every honest man and woman should cry out against this proposed change in the law.

The Caledonia Advertiser is authority for the statement that the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist Churches, of Albion, this State, recently refused the use of their church buildings to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, upon the ground that it was simply a political organization. The Advertiser defends the action of the churches, and expresses the opinion that the use of a church by the Union for political purposes could be justified only by sentimental reasons.

At a recent Sunday-law meeting in Tacoma, Wash., Rev. B. S. McLafferty is reported by the Ledger to have said:—

We do not ask legislation for the religious Sabbath. We don't want to make men religious by legislation. But no holiday can continue in existence without law. Without it, every man would keep his own holiday, and no holiday would result. It is impossible to maintain the civil Sabbath, like any other holiday, without laws. Take down the barriers and how long would it be before some employer, finding it profitable to have his men work seven days in the week, would press in his employees to work on that day? Others would follow, and little by little the laboring man would lose his Sabbath. This the laborer, more than any other class, can not afford.

Such talk does not rise above the dignity of twaddle. Secular work is not forbidden on civil holidays. On a holiday every man can work or not, just as he chooses. On the so-called "civil" Sabbath men are forbidden to work. Nobody, except those who are pleading for a "civil Sabbath," would object to a law making Sunday a legal holiday in the same sense as the Fourth of July, and the Twenty-second of February. But that is not what they are asking for, and not what they mean to have.

A CORRESPONDENT of the Sacramento Record-Union indignantly denies the charge of the Sunday-law advocates that California is the most immoral State in the Union. And not only does he deny the charge but he refutes it with words from the mouths of the very ones who make it. But considering the nature of the whole Sunday-law movement, it is not a matter of surprise that its promoters think it legitimate to do evil that good may come. The whole thing is Jesuitical, and why should its methods not be so too?

Mr. CRAFTS, who has patted himself upon the back not a little for his liberality in conceding the expediency of exempting from the operations of Sunday laws common labor by those who observe a day other than Sunday, appeared recently before a committee of the Pennsylvania Legislature to plead for the preservation intact of the old Sunday law of that State, under which Seventh-day Baptists have repeatedly suffered persecution for conscience' sake. He is in favor of mild Sunday laws only when he thinks it impossible to get the ironclad sort.

A CALIFORNIA paper says:—

During the public hearing on the Sunday-law question in the Senate Chamber, on the 11th ult., Senator Carpenter, of Los Angeles, put this pointed question to Rev. Dr. Thompson. "You have been representing all along that this bill is in behalf of the laboring men; now, sir, I want to know which one of the many labor organizations have petitioned for a Sunday law?" The Doctor had to admit that he knew of none.

The fact is that the demand for Sunday laws comes from the churches and from church people, and it is made solely because Sunday is a religious institution. This fact should be kept before the people.
