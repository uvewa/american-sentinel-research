WRITING of the restrictions which Sunday laws put upon the poor, a correspondent of the Denver News says:

We may have wise and good and just laws, but not even a Solon can give us laws to meet the wants and needs of the individual soul, and the rich should be very careful how they curtail the few pleasures of the poor. Those who have never known what it is like to have their time, their strength, and their skill belong to others, are not proper judges in a case of this sort. It is easy for the rich to legislate for the poor, but they should take heed, lest, restricted here and forbidden there, the latter some day cry out, like Icilius of old:

O, spare us in your cruel hate,
Your yet more cruel love.

We think it was Abraham Lincoln who said that, "you can fool all the people part of the time, and part of the people all the time, but you can not fool all the people all the time." It is true in the matter of Sunday legislation; thousands are beginning to see that the liberty promised them, by the Sunday-law agitators, would prove to be only slavery.
