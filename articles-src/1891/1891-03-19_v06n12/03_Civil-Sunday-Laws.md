# Civil Sunday Laws.

AS noticed briefly a week or two ago, the founder of the American Sabbath Union, to us an article in *Our Day*, for January.

It is significant that the American Secular Union, the founder of commercial the Sabbath was asking only for the "repeal and prevention of all laws conflicting with the sacredness of the Lord's day, and the prevention and suppression of all gambling and other secular wrongs." As these are his plea, it is plain "rated on the log," a wise thinker indeed.

Let us examine this matter a little and not just how much truth there is in the statement made in *Our Day*. What are in fact the civil features of the Sunday of the several States? and upon what grounds does the American Sabbath Union demand additional laws for the enforcement of Sunday rest? In answering these questions we observe first, that the basis of the organization is, positively, the furtherance of the purposes of the Decalogue. Therethere can therefore be no doubt that the American Sabbath Union is a religious organization. That the observance which it advocates, in oration to enforce in this case is that of a religious character is plainly shown by utterances of representative of members of the organization. The President of the Founder of the Union says:—

> This religion set and you the other at a time that this same to this same artillery is to erect.

[page 91]

The civil Sabbath is what the civil law creates. And an American state under First, foremost is the right of all to be allowed one day of rest, of rest, second, because moral order. Hence civil Sunday laws may embrace: 1. If the Sabbath, therefore it be abolished, the civil rest. 2. All moral order provisions on our civil and religious institutions will be in place.

And to the same import are the following resolutions adopted, a few days since, by the Sabbath Union, of Massachusetts:—

Resolved, 1. That we believe that when Christ said that the Sabbath was made for man, it announced a principle of perpetual vitality, and we deprecate the modern habit of Sabbath desecration which does so disregard the events to-day and the principles of rest, and in evils sown in recognized in Revelation.

Resolved, 2. That we believe that the substitution of the law for the day of the Sabbath as a day associated with indefensible moral obligation, was intended to "the Lord of the Sabbath" as a purpose of control of his reservations, and that it was associated in the more purely and continued.

3. That it will resist all attempts to disrupt, the legal protection of the Lord's day of rest, the surveillance and a day of service.

It will be noticed first in all of these quotations the religious idea is predominant; true, like a chip of physical pain it is also there; but in every case it is secondary, and it is all through the utterances of the Sunday-law advocates. And no wonder, for the Sunday, whether you call it the Christian Sabbath, "the Lord's day," that is, not English; it is as a "Christian Nation," and because of "national obligation to obey the law of God," that we are exhorted to keep Sunday as a Sabbath. The quoted expressions are stock phrases with those who are engaged in the advocacy of Sunday laws. The "civil Sabbath," the "rest day," and the "labor day" are only the afterthought, and is in fact a mere figurant excuse to break the force of the arguments against this religious legislation.

The State of New Jersey affords just now a most excellent illustration of the true attitude of Sunday law advocates. The liquor dealers of that State are making an effort to secure some modification of the law which forbids the sale of liquors upon the first day of the week. In a feverish appeal for the retention of the law, the Christian

*Advocate* of this city urges the liquor dealers to tone down the Christian Sabbath in New York has year, and attacks the Christian Sabbath in New Jersey. This is an attack on the Christian religion of America and its religious day.

The attempt made by the liquor dealers to relax the strictness of the law that refers to the refit of Sunday liquor selling because of the cumulate rile upon that day, and then the editor refuse to the change in this manner:

More than this, the Christian church owes a duty to itself, out to the State of New Jersey, which it cannot discharge if this law shall be repealed, that this proposed legislative action ought to be called what it really is. It is an attack on Christianity without reference to divisions, or a sect a set in going to the attack of a rest day.

There is no mistaking this language; it is the "Christian Sabbath" that is to be preserved in New Jersey in the interests of the "Christian church." The sanctity of the day is the goal of the Church at the great consideration urged. It makes not and where as by whom this subject of discussion, the fact crops out that the real fact of the Sunday observance lies in the fact of the religious character of its day. In a sermon preached, not long since, in Pendleton, Oregon, Rev. W. A. C. Bowen, pastor of the Baptist Church, at that place, made the following appeal for the "civil Sabbath," said:—

There can be no religion without worship and no worship without Sunday. It is not too much to say that a Christianity which permits no day so visible society can not rest on the earth . . . and there are those who are willing to corrupt the name and institute the Sabbath in its workings and others to satisfy their own selfish ends.

And right in with this is this following utterance, closely rehearsed to the rebs, in a recent "civil" Sunday-law meeting in Tacoma, Wash.:—

What makes the Anglo-Saxon people what they are, but Christianity? What had the Almighty done? And he made the Sabbath at Sinai Mount that cross, as pronounced on one. "Remembered this children of God." The nation that has most of the religion of Christianity, the source of all our good. We must not part with the Sabbath. Let us gather up our goods and chattels, at our nearest church, and go hence. The thing is settled, for this year, regarding the Sabbath, and I say to every young man: Take care that you do not let your last post of Christianity be broken down with your hand; and I will say come to you, or in time it will be what it is to be on the right side. Break down the barriers, oppose the side, and the things that come thereof. And let those who are ready, upon the steps, set an example, and come up to the right standard and upward until you enforce the right on all until we have a law to protect the right.

Where in this language is there a hint of any motive but a religious one? To repeat the Sunday law would in effect be a destruction of "our eternal souls," it would be to command us "to trample of Christianity." And to maintain the Sabbath is to "enforce Christianity." Yet we are assured by another speaker at the same meeting that—

> We do not ask legislation for the religious Sabbath. We ask for a civil rest day.

Certainly not; the object simply is that by enforcing this "civil rest day," they may "enforce the right hand of Majesty, and be folded to his bosom." That this is deniable is true, but that it enables have with reference to it is any part of the duty of human government does not follow. In the first place it is beyond the power of government to secure such results; and in the second place to attempt of the kind is to lay to the very profane regardless of God himself; and such attempts carried to their logical end will never result as they ever have resulted, namely, in persecution for conscience' sake.

But we are told that courts have sustained Sunday laws, declaring that they rest, not on religious but on civil grounds. It is true that such decisions have been made, but other courts have boldly declared that such laws are religious, and that they rest upon divine law.

In the case of *Hennell vs. Van Caspren*, 3 Miss., in Blakeney, gave the opinion—that this court considered the law as based on the doctrine that the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments. In the Court of South Carolina, the defendant held that "the object of the Legislature was to enforce a sanctification of the Sabbath as enjoined in the act. The disregard of the Sabbath was punished on the grounds of this court." It says two purposes constitute the offense. "Dissent from this view, Mr. Trumbull, 38 Iowa Reports. In California, 4 Cal." We do not think the design of the Legislature was more of these suggestions of the law to all persons in order to enforce church attendance or ultimately to promote morality and advance the interests of religion, but simply to protect those engaging in their common and ordinary calling from the interferences of those who do not labor.

Similar cases are reported from several other States. Among these from New Hampshire, (See Wright vs. Greer. I, Bos., 1; Fox vs. Abn. Concurrent 3d Pre., 4; Blisters, (42) George, 4 N.J., New Gazette Adviser, Reports., 48 Halletts) relatively, stating substantially the same conclusions of force or less plainly in the laws have been passed for religious purposes.

We discover that the preachers of the gospel who advocate Sunday laws, talk from their pulpits, four times a year, an act regarding the observance of the civil statute was framed by the Colonial of Authority to 1703, section 19 reading as follows: "That every person being of the age of 14 shall be read yearly, and every town, and in April from the hour of ten in the of said day, until five of the clock in the afternoon, before sermons begins; and every minister and every minister shall . . . repair to their respective place of divine worship; . . . and they shall carefully apply themselves to the duties personally, and not for "hanging July."

Our Day's law commonly called Sunday. The consideration is unavoidable that it that is a religious institution, and it is to comply with the religious regard in which it is held that laws are made requiring its observance. The "civil Sunday" is simply the religious institution enforced with the authority of the civil power. Then is not the having degrees of strictness by civil law.
