# A Deserved Tribute.

THE *Mail and Express* pays the following deserved tribute to the Constitution of the United States:—

The founders of our Government knew how to be wise; it was no easy matter to be wise, and they, therefore, nothing in our national Constitution is there we see no such stubborn and circumstantial terms as in the numerous checks provided for the dangerous tendency to human government.

The Constitution of the United States is the most wonderful work of human wisdom and prudence that the world has seen in the history of any country. In it was as the patriotisms of Washington, and Benjamin Franklin, and the loyalty and love of liberty of all those splendid heroes by which our rough and struggled and tried for our national independence. It is now a free representative and rational check. We want the legislative authority lodged in those who balance them and properly balanced. The sovereign authority is divided between two branches, and the judicial authority is reserved for an independent body, who hold their office during good behavior. It is our hope not to tires on these sweet rights that have been guaranteed by this grand, voluntary conservative of the mutual rights between free citizens of the Nation.

In the clashing interests of the States no act of their citizens appears and strictly balanced that the rights of all are recognized. The Constitution is a compromise also which is the States be centered, and involves overture and forbearance, For safety, and for prosperity, the very provisions of the States depend upon the fidelity of the States to that compact.

This is remarkable, coming, as it does, from a paper of strict National Reform sentiments.
