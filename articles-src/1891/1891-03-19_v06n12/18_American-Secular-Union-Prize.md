The American Secular Union announces that the $1,000 prize offered by them, about a year since, has been awarded to Nicholas Paine Gilman, A. M., Editor of the Literary World, Boston, and Edward Payson Jackson, A. M., Professor of Physical Science in the celebrated Latin School of Boston. The prize was offered for the best essay, treatise, or manual adapted to aid and assist teachers in our free public schools, and in the Girard College for orphans, and other public and charitable institutions professing to be unsectarian, to thoroughly instruct children and youth in the purest principles of morality, without inculcating religious doctrines; thus recognizing the legal right, under our Federal Constitution, of all our citizens, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants, Liberals and Agnostics, and all other classes, whether believers or disbelievers, to have their children instructed in all the branches of a common secular education, in our State schools, without having their tender minds biased for or against any sect or party whatever.

The circular of the Union announcing the award of the prize says that the committee decided that no one manuscript presented, fully met the conditions of the offer, but that two of them together did, clearly showing that morality can be taught without teaching theology, and how to do it. The $1,000 prize was ordered to be equally divided between two gentlemen. They have accepted the award, and the essays will be published in one volume.

It is further stated that the book will appear about September 1, 1891. We still feel, as we stated more than a year ago, considerable interest in this matter; our interest is, however, principally one of curiosity. We want to know how they propose to give the required instruction according to the stipulated conditions.
