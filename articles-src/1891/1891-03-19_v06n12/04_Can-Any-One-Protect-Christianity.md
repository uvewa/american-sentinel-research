# Can Any One Protect Christianity?

OUR Government is equally tolerant of religion. It no more favors the Christian Church than any other temple of religion or other religious worships. It tolerates no persecution of those charged with unsupported, but it is no more based upon Christianity than Mohammedanism. So several tribunals have decided. There is not an instance in history where a civil government has hazarded or assumed to foster and support the Church, that thereby both the Church and civil government have been corrupted and debauched. Christianity being of a kingdom not of this world, can not be wielded of that in this world. This is too plain a proposition to be denied, and when the Church descends to seeking civil force to aid in its reports there is something dangerously carnal in the purpose.

Religious adherence itself belongs to the heart and the conscience, and no man should be forced in any direction of his conscience in favor or against any religious doctrine or faith. That all are to be protected in

[page 92]

the free right of worship was not to be and, whether Christian, Buddhist, or Confucist. And that a day of rest on Sabbath day should be recognized and observed is not to be denied. But this should be done in a way equally protecting to the conscience of one of us.

No honest religionist or worshiper can ask anything more in this respect, than peaceable protection in his conscience of worship on any day. He has no right to demand of any other person a sacrifice of any right of conscience. An honest man makes no such demand. If any man does or those in something rotten in his moral nature. The observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath can and does no more for their religious convictions than can those who observe the seventh day.

For a first-day Government to demand of a Government a forced observance of their day, those of the first day would impose upon all infidels undue presumption, and rightfully so, too; and so is the demand of the observance of the first day toward those of the seventh day, and a free Government must accord a full toleration.—*Judge Judson, in Rome (N. Y.) Daily Sentinel.*

It is well known that Joseph Cook following another series of his famous Monday courses, lectures, in Tremont Temple, Boston. The following is one of his characteristic utterances:—

This is a fair outside of the staff the rife of Boston accept from their side, and not only, but greet with cheer on cheer. Does it seem possible that such freeness lodges at Mr. Cook display, can exist in the same head, concomitantly with little wisdom, and such inherent of reasoning?

"Where is protection for Christianity? Where, indeed, should it be but in the density of opinion and of substance in Christianity? When he comes to be almighty and when he comes to verify his promise that we, through him, may be 'strengthened with all might according to his glorious power,' 'then,' indeed, it will be time for the believers in Christianity, if not there until be, to, to chair their houses assiduously with tin, coil, wool, salt, ore, as, as is subject by the State protection. Such an utterance as the above falls but little short of what 'this faith said in his heart,' namely, that 'there is no God.' At least it is a confession that in the mind the one nature capable of harboring such a sentiment, God, as a source of moral and spiritual power and protection, is either dead or absent, and that, therefore, his religion, in that person's conception, has degenerated like the paganism of old, into a mere piece of statecraft."

Why do we protect, in coil, wool, and ore? The reason of the State is not to compete with the cheaper labor of other countries, in their production. When, therefore, men ask for protection for Christianity, it is a confession that in their judgment Christianity can not compete with aspirations and the false worship of the world. All truth is from God; all error, from the father of lies. When a man who has the truth, can not compete with the false, they simply say that God can not compete with sin or that Satan is stronger than God. What is that but to dethrone God, the maker, and the devil god of this universe God's stead? This is simply what paganism, and all false religions, have, in diverse forms, ways, always accomplished. When a man has Christianity, all the protection his religion needs is to be other, as before, strongly, legitimately defending God, and defying Satan, or else he is publicly testifying that the religion he wants protected, is not worth protecting himself from, then in order to compete with the true. Where have of the defenses we would not protect. I know, not, but either is bad enough.

It were well for all such to remember the prayer that the Lord Jesus himself taught, ere he was taken to leave the earth and ascend to the Father: "I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. . . . While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; those that thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them are lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from evil. . . . For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. . . . *for them also which shall believe on me through their word.*" John 17:9-20.

be protected in the way by the power of God, and thine to be a living illustration of a power which would lift them above the State, and all their environment, and in spite of the error of the world, and the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, sanctify them through his truth.

The world noting this evidence of divine power and protection, was to be led to believe in Christ, and in the Father who sent him. So long as Christians have this real power of Christ and in the Father, who promised to sanctify them, they need no other protection. When they do ask and receive State protection, that kind of Christianity is no longer an illustration of a power above the world, to lift mankind to God, but it is an illustration of a power of the world to hold all mankind down on a level. And, therefore, when Christianity is thus protected, the Church, and in the State, the Church displaces the Church, and the State the Church. Such protection is simply the Church displacing causally comes to exist, for it is the last in the State, and its officers are officers of the State; the State uses Christianity but for its purpose.

Christianity then either comes to exist, or lingers only in the hearts of a faithful and persuaded few who are compelled thereby to resist both the Church and the State.

There is one other reason why the Government should never protect Christianity—its sin, "coil, wool, welt," to maintain or enhance its power. Why is it that in the United States just now so many ministers are now clamoring for State protection? Having lost in a large degree the power of God, and the revenue which flows from heart into hearts and converted pockets of true Christians, they want to make up the lack by the power of the State, and the revenue of the State, by which hope in the future growth. G. I. F.
