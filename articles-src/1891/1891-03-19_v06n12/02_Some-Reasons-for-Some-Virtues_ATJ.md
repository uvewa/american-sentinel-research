# Some "Reasons" for Some Virtues.

THE subject of the public schools, is one of deep concern to every American citizen, and the question, What shall be taught therein is of the greatest interest.

The churches are demanding that religion shall be taught in the public schools; and although the indifference of those making this demand are great, the majority of the people are as yet opposed to it; because nobody who has taken the time to think of the matter to any extent, knows that to adopt a system of teaching would destroy the public schools. There is another defect in a system of instruction in the public schools which is no less dangerous in itself, and much more dangerous on account of the more general support that it has, and that is the teaching of what is called morality, without religion. Such a system might not destroy the public schools as quickly as religion, but it would more quickly destroy the State. This point has been discussed considerably through all the history of THE SENTINEL, but it has been necessary to notice it pretty fully again. We now propose to treat of it in a way in which we have not discussed it before.

Although there is so much demand, that moral instruction in morals, without religion, shall be given in the public schools, very few of those who have so demanded it have ever attempted to define what shall be taught as Morals, and why it shall be taught; and fewer still have attempted to formulate a system or manual of morality which should be a part of the public school curriculum. About a year ago the American Secular Union offered a prize for such a manual; but it has not yet been published. There is, however, a book already in existence, issued in 1886, which was entitled "A system of ethics and school." It has been highly recommended. It is entitled, "The Virtues and Their Reasons." It was written by Austin Bierbower, and is issued by George Sherwood & Co., Chicago. The preface states the object of the book, and, in view of what the book contains, is worthy to be quoted in full. Here it is:—

> The design of this book is to discuss the general matter and emphasizing those virtues which have a particular bearing on good citizenship and higher moral training in the public schools and higher institutions of learning. Moral instruction is often excluded from public schools on account of the different religious explanations given for it, and the exclusion has led to secular studies as the only work schools were themselves in existence. In presenting 'systematic morality,' that the morality which is consistent with all creeds of religious difference, Catholic, Protestant, Jew and Infidel.

As a subject to one of much interest, just now we shall notice it quite fully. In ethics, we shall notice the reasons which are given for the virtues which are discussed.

The virtues which are discussed are: civility (in its several forms and manifestations), and its arrangement, truth, honesty, bravery, family duties, public duties, self-denial, temperance, self-control, temperance, self-respect.

Now the "reason" for the virtue of civility, are these:—

> To one who suspects such courtesy is dishonest as man, for, get more respect than those who do not practice it. . . . One who can make such a man

[page 90]

men virtuous, because, on the other hand, it might be said with equal reason that he who can make men worse by reducing them by giving up, is foolish not to retain. The reason for the virtue of politeness is this:—

> To want a smile is to have a great power in society, raising often all the difference between the popular and unpopular person. . . . The polite person is considered a gentleman. . . . To be pleasant in politeness, in order to have great power in society, by sagacity, by hospitality, to be considered a gentleman, and to appear elegant and dignified.

Now the query is, if a person practices politeness, in order to have great power in society, by sagacity, by hospitality, to be considered a gentleman, and to appear elegant and dignified in this, this is the same case to demonstrate a virtue?

> The cheerful man has a great power in society, as a rule he gets more to eat, to lick his lips at, and he generally finds more to be pleasant about; . . . more like to trade with him, and soon, more of everything.

Now, we ask, If a person is "cheerful" for such reasons as are here stated, is that such cheerfulness a virtue? Is it not rather a vice?

> Now, virtue discusses the vices which are antagonistic to the virtue. The reason why hate "is not the proper feeling to have for anything . . . is, that the cheerful man has no utility. . . . Give no pleasure." . . . It has been shown that a gloomy man has no utility, but that of one has insight into one's happiness is true. He should call that an impediment to virtue that there is any corrupting action for hate that is in all a state.—*Page 85.*

This is to argue if Hate had utility, or if it was pleasant, or if it could serve a man a useful need, then it would be perfectly proper to cherish it. But Hate does serve a need; it militarizes with a vengeance. As for hatred, we should not start our children to be taught that kind of morality in the public schools or anywhere else. His reason for not indicting more is from the same standpoint. Merely is it a "ration" and "gentle little respect; nay, more than of frost, for—"*Page 86.*

That of the chief reasons for the virtue of veracity is this—

> No trick has more commercial value than veracity. When one is known to be unflinching true, no that man can add to his influence. Trustworthiness, especially in the great transaction, he becomes a man who has a reputation for truth is then a large capital for the exchange; whilst the man who has never received a reputation for truth, will find he has had to have one to sell the truth unfairly, and is the end less concerned. The disadvantages of not being veracious, are clearly apparent, very often times when the advantages of lying is the most obvious thing in the world. Does anybody suppose that to all the milleniums in this country, the disadvantages of lying have always been obvious? But whether anybody supposes this or not, the question still over, is that a sufficient reason for the virtue of

veracity? and such reason as this sufficient proof that veracity is a virtue? In older words, if lying had more commercial value than telling the truth, and was a larger capital to the average man, and if the advantage of it were obvious, then according to this system of morality, would not lying be a virtue?

The reason for honesty, is the same precisely as that for veracity; and, as logically, it ought to be. Here it is:—

> Honesty the constitution has much commercial value.—*Page 079.*

And again, we may merely inquire, if it should be found that dishonesty has greater commercial value than honesty, if, then, a man can make more by being dishonest than by being honest, then is dishonesty the virtue? The Bierbower improvement, it will be seen, are a large improvement upon that which we have so often heard that "honesty is the best policy." By this system of morality, honesty is not the best policy if you can get more by dishonesty.

It is evident that if all these virtues should be exercised, for the reasons that are given in this book, the result in every case would be nothing else than a self-contained utilitarian. Called in a perfect self-satisfaction. This is not only the nature of the subject; it is the teaching of the book.

The reasons for the "virtue" of pride, are these:—

> Self-satisfaction in heaping within its grasp, and not merely within the fanciers, a worthy gratification, as also to take a lively interest in past editions, and so we must not.—*Page 91.*

Thus said. Its We Westminster read somewhere, in an old book, a description of an individual who would be the product of just this kind of gratification, because of that kind of virtue. The description reads thus: "That Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess." Luke 18:11, 12. It is easy to see from this description of the character that would be the necessary and logically consistent analogue of the book now under consideration. Every reason that is there given for every virtue that is there described, is expressed in his own word, *selfishness.* To such an extent is this so, that by the teaching of the book, unselfishness itself is turned into a selfish virtue. Thus:—

> Selfishness is not necessarily self-sacrifice, but, as one enjoys his own life more than the selfness.

Thus the logic of this system of morality is supreme selfishness. And that is proposed as a system of ethics for society and schools. There is enough selfishness in society already, without making it the chief element in the instruction of all the children in the country in the public schools. This is also the logic of every system that ever proposed to teach morals without religion; but we shall have more of the same in subsequent articles. A. T. J.
