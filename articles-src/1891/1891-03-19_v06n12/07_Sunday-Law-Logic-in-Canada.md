# Sunday-Law Logic in Canada.

BRITISH COLUMBIA, like several of the States of our own country, is wrestling with the Sunday-law problem, or rather the friends of religious liberty there are unable to maintain their rights against the assaults of those who would destroy liberty in the supposed interests of religion. In a recent discussion of a Sunday bill in the Legislature of that province, reported in the Victoria Times, Hon. Mr. Beaven—

did not intend to pass a silent vote on the question, but must say that there were many objections to the bill before the House. He was unable to give his individual opinion for so doing, and he noticed that he was not in favour of the bill. For his part he was glad to be a friend of freedom, and as long as he does not trespass on the rights of his neighbor he has a right to work or not, on Sunday or Monday, or any other day. The mere question of custom is one entirely for himself and his Maker. As to trying to legislate for morality, it is a mistake altogether. Mr. Davies was purposefully protected in practice by his brethren, who would not stand for him. It does not interfere with private rights. If one person chooses to do work at any time, whether a game of billiards on Sunday or any other day, it is that person's right to do so. The act is the very same fault that the old Elizabethan act had in which, by fire, the church was compelled to stand up before the people on the day. The persons mentioned in clause 4, with the almost power to grant licenses must be removed as many of the forces within them people. Therefore this is a law in favour of those are called to the old statutes, "gentlemen who wish to go to church rather than to have to work for a living; from everything almost, on the first day of the week, and keep them at idle leisure the annual freedom. As to tipping: certain ever that because he, why should he not be criticized on Sunday are more than on other days of the week, if at worship? And then as to diversions, why, is the act, be asked, restricted to this, while any one who so chooses can go into the back yard and play faro and baser game, which are worse. Then why should those who had been working hard during the week be prohibited from going and doing a little getting on Sunday? This is a matter that should be limited to each individual conscience. . . .

Altogether Mr. Davis considered the act an insatiable measure, as being entirely unnecessary, and of

no advantage to the community. It would be a strange act, he considered, to pass. . . .

It would be a stringent act unworthy to pass. . . .

Another view of the matter was presented by Mr. Robson, who, according to the report, urged the passage of the bill on religious grounds.

> He advanced the argument that they were not legislating for a British county, and they must remember that they were legislating for a people who . . . took their British throne in the Bible. He believed that Great Britain rose above the nations on account of this. This being a branch of that nation, an impartation, certainly one that takes her rise in a spirit of quietry and remonstrance so far respecting its regard in regulation of this day of rest. He placed emphasis on the prominence where the true principles of the Decalogue. The law was there not to lie. Mr. Trumbull has found in this land, Mr. Holmes, 38 Iowa Reports. In California, it was a very broad view to take that an act requiring a cessation in work one day in seven did not interfere with the rights of his neighbor and fellow-man. Surely a man might rest one day in seven without in any way being restricted. It was not a mere chance; it took a rest on a day of rest. He knew of a number of instances within the last four or five years where the Sunday had not been attended and he took strong grounds in maintaining that these few repressive, at all events, a measure of this kind should be passed. No one should be allowed to do as he pleases, the Sabbath-despoiler must not be allowed to do as he pleases. There would be no fear of its leading to any persecution, and it was to be an attempt to curb or comprehend the inclinations and the liberty of the people as that the desecration of the Sabbath altogether.

Hon. Mr. Pooley referred to the statement of the leader of the Government that it would be a standing disgrace to British Columbia to have a Sunday act. . . . Mr. Pooley took entirely the opposite view.

He considered it a great credit to British Columbia that a Sunday bill was enacted, the same as it was in other parts of the Dominion, a law of that kind. British Columbia had enough reason for passing one. He also has of laws. A law of this kind is needed. He did not know that he could not find any man in this colony, when he first came into it twenty eight years ago, in the habit of going either to church or breaking the law—that football, cricket, and other games were going on every Sunday. In Victoria, such things were unknown. But now it had come that the profanity. God never seen any of those games played on Sunday, but he did see a great deal of Sunday desecration, and he thought it time that something was done to stop it.

Why should people who do not like Sunday observance be permitted to live in a community where others are taking their enjoyment in their own way. Let them go where they can find a congenial atmosphere, take their chances, and where they can do as they like. He did not say this, he was a church man, but he would not say that a man should be compelled to go to church, but of a class of legislation to bring the State into a course from its license for the purpose of reform.

Mr. Pooley believed in tolerance and he believed in protection of honest labor, but he believed also in protecting in the sanctity of Sunday, and he did not think it his duty to legislate that a man should not employ his fellow-man on that day.

The only difference in between Canada and the United States the Canadian Dominion and the United States is that in the former the foreign idea has been to demand enforced Sunday observance: where the only real ground that is for it, namely, the religious ground.

"A good thing to perpetuate"—freedom.
