# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 19, 1891 (v06n12)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR challenges throughout. The scan quality is poor across all 8 pages, with many passages of small-print text being very difficult to read. Block-quoted material from books and external sources was particularly challenging due to smaller font sizes. Many passages required best-guess readings. A higher-resolution scan would be needed to verify numerous readings throughout this issue.

## Structural Uncertainties

### Article Boundaries on Pages 91-92
- The flow of articles across the page break between pages 91 and 92 is complex, with multiple articles running in parallel across columns. The exact boundaries between "Civil Sunday Laws," "The Religious Oath," and "Can Any One Protect Christianity?" may not be correctly determined. Some text may be assigned to the wrong article.

### Column Flow
- Several instances where text flows across column and page breaks made it difficult to determine which article certain paragraphs belong to. The assignments made represent the best interpretation of the layout but may contain errors.
