THE "civil Sabbath" plea is a fraud, and of it may be said, as President Lincoln once said of another matter, "You may fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all the time." I venture to say that if the American Sabbath Union directed its efforts toward securing an absolute enforcement of the Sunday laws now on the statute books of the States, instead of trying to obtain more laws, the American people would rise in their might, repeal the Sunday laws as they did in California in 1883, and down this organization with its civil Sabbath nonsense, its sophistries and its pretensions for the good of the workingmen. These so-called Sabbath reformers, with awakened sympathies for the laboring classes, should turn their attention to the poor seamstresses, who, sixteen hours a day, for six, if not seven days a week, are, for a pittance, pricking the blood out of their bony fingers and driving hope out of their hearts. Let them attempt reforms that will mitigate the oppression of the industrial classes six days in the week, before they blame us for generally believing, as we now do, that it is power to coerce the observance of a traditional holiday, rather than the good of the workingman, that they desire.
