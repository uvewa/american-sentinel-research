A CIRCULAR reaches us from a far Eastern State, with this heading, "Shall Church Property be Taxed?" We answer emphatically, Yes! It should be taxed equally with all other property. Either the Church has no rightful claim to special favors from the State, but "is an institution like unto and should bear an equitable share of the burden of taxation. It is not the business of the State to look after the Church, further than to see that it has protection precisely to all alike—institutions—not more, no less. If the Church cannot stand without aid of the State, that is entirely its own affair, and not concerns of the State's. The Church, is, or ought to be, purely a religious institution, voluntarily supported by those who accept its tenets or beliefs, or not at all. The State is, or ought to be, purely a secular institution, existing solely to preserve civil and national rights, liberty, safety and happiness, and extending equal protection to all, but favors to none.

To mention a portion of the property free is clearly an exemption of it from taxation, by just that much is the taxation of the remainder increased, and this is neither right nor just.

All over this country there are wealthy religious associations whose vast property is safe from the touch of the tax-gatherer. All over this country there are humble homes

ready to be sold for taxes. The bronze doors of Trinity Church in New York City, presented to it by William Waldorf Astor, are alone worth $100,000, yet it pays no taxes. Another church edifice lost one window worth $40,000. These associations are able to pay their producers $5,000 to $15,000 a year, yet their property bears no share of the tax burden. Not far away are the homes of hundreds of workingmen and poor people, whose humble property is taxed to the full limit, and whose share of the public expense is increased by the magnificent proportion of favoritism in institutions go free. Surely there are few who cannot see the injustice of this.—*Butler County Herald, Bertrand, Neb.*

The "civil Sabbath" plea is a fraud, and a transparent one. Arguing it is of no cold one said of another matter, "You may fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all the time." I venture to say that the American Sabbath Union directed its efforts toward securing an absolute civil enforcement of the Sunday laws now on the statute books of the several States, failing to obtain more laws, the American people would rise in their might, repeal the Sunday laws as they did in California in 1883, and down this organization with its so-called Sabbath nonsense, its agitation and its pretensions for the good of the workingman. These so-called Sabbath reformers, with avouched sympathies for the laboring classes, should turn their attention to the poor seamstresses, who, sixteen hours a day, are sewing their lives away. "Oh, no, for a pittance, plucking the blood of their busy fingers and driving hope out of their labor. Let there arrange reforms that will mitigate the oppression of the industrial classes in a day's in the world, before they blame us for generally believing, as we do in fact, that if they can cover the observance of a traditional holiday, rather than the good of the workingman, that they desire.—*Rev. H. H. MEYERS.*

A *CALIFORNIA* paper has the following upon proper Sunday observance:—

The other is involved: The residential home versus the Sunday one. Do you know a home as which, surrounded by books, pictures, emblems of religion, ample rooms of quiet and leisure, it is at once useful and delightful to spend Sunday, coming on Saturday and has yet to wonder by most absurd idea can be conceived. Every great American city produces occasions to cry out for one of death gazer, said at the rest of that wailing in plays or ways of living that are modified by moral social occasions. In all great American cities there is enough of misery, of poverty, without amusement; without homes; whose ways of spending

[page 94]

Sunday are made inevitable by the conditions that surround their individual relation to society. For those, unloose on top. In some—but bring them out of these, support churches which they will not enter . . . the American people, to educate those from all galleries and the redking rooms of leisure, from the streets, and give them places of recreation, let us offer them these better aims more dignified and uplifting.

## Of the World's Fair Prize Review

So far as he relates in the Fair to be in Chicago are referred, it must be remembered that still much remains to be said in the direction of Sunday observance and reflections. . . . Repeatedly THE AMERICAN SENTINEL has asked for more light on the subject part of Sunday in each question of us to be given. For the question of Sunday observance is raised with the the question of Sunday observantly reasonably. Will not the editors to the opposition to produce better advances.

We receive these paragraphs merely to show that even among Christians in the Chicago region, the question of Sunday closing of the Fair is not at all decided. Probably a majority of Catholics agree on that tend to that to be closed on Sunday. Probably a majority of Catholics agree with the views expressed by the Catholic Review, while the great mass of the true substance of Christianity is that of favor of Sunday opening. It follows that the insatiable demand for Sunday closing is nothing less than a demand the the religious minority shall control the Protestant island, and in the interests of established Protestant Christianity.

The *Christian Advocate*, of this city, a paper thoroughly in sympathy with the movement for the closing of the Fair on Sunday by legislation, remarks:—

> The Advocate believes that the Sunday should be preserved as a religious day if it is to be preserved at a day of physical rest. Right in harmony with these utterances are the following words from a Presbyterian pastor, in San Francisco, California:—

We are glad to record the fact of the growing conviction in all quarters, that the so-called National Reform is now something to be believe it can dominate the American press.

DOSANXXX says, "the love of liberty is implanted by nature in the breasts of all men." Patrick Henry gave vent to that nature when he said, "Give me liberty or give me death!"—*Independent Patriot.*
