THE Catholic Review has the following upon proper Sunday observance:—

There are two ways of keeping Sunday. One is rational. The other is irrational. The irrational one assumes that every man, woman, and child has a home in which, surrounded by books, pictures, emblems of religion, ample comfort of mind and body, it is at once dutiful and delightful to spend Sunday, crossing its threshold only to go to church. No more absurd idea can be conceived. Every great American city population contains say ten per cent. of church goers; and all the rest of the people have ways of living that are modified by moral standards, educational advantages, social needs and actual necessities. In all great American cities there is a vast element every year growing more numerous, without homes; whose ways of spending Sunday are made inevitable by the conditions that surround their individual relation to society. For these, saloons are open. In some cities nothing else is open, except churches which they will not enter. Is it humane, is it sagacious, is it in the interest of true American progress, to exclude these from art galleries and the reading rooms of libraries, from museums and lectures, from music, and conversation with their fellow-men under dignified and uplifting surroundings?

Of the World's Fair the Review says:—

So far as the visitors to the Fair in Chicago are concerned, it must be remembered that it will afford to wage workers an unparalleled opportunity for comparison and reflection. . . . Will they be worse morally, intellectually, socially, for having spent part of Sunday in such precincts instead of all of it or most of it in saloons? It is possible to settle the question of Sunday opening reasonably. Why shall not the educational exhibitions be open Sunday afternoons?

We quote these paragraphs merely to show that even among Christians there is a very wide difference of opinion upon the question of Sunday closing of the Fair. The majority of Protestant Christians demand that it shall be closed on Sunday. Probably a majority of Catholics agree with the view expressed by the Catholic Review, while the great mass of non-professors of Christianity are decidedly in favor of Sunday opening. It follows that the unqualified demand for Sunday closing is nothing less than a demand that the Fair shall be run according to distinctively Protestant ideas, and in the interests of popular Protestant Christianity.
