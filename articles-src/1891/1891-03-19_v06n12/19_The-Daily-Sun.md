The Paragraph and the Dial, two weekly papers, of Oakland, California, having outgrown that city, have removed across the bay to San Francisco, where they are now issued seven times a week, as The Daily Sun. We are glad to note this evidence of prosperity, and The Daily Sun company has our best wishes for continued prosperity. We reproduce the following from the "Platform" of the new daily:—

The Daily Sun is the open enemy of all forms of fanaticism which seek to enact Sunday or "Sabbath rest" laws. We hold that all such attempts to enforce religion by law are contrary to the Declaration of Independence and to the Constitution of the United States.

We believe that most people do not realize the dangerous extent to which the Sunday-law movement has already gone in this country. We shall discuss the subject fully as new movements arise.

Blackmail and libel we hold to be grave offenses. No newspaper has any right to malign private citizens or abuse public officers. No end should be sought in any other direction than along the line of truth. The shortcomings of citizens should not be held up to ridicule, or made public, except, for the general welfare, in rare cases.

Hypocrisy in public or semi-public places is a dangerous vice, which every good citizen and good newspaper ought to expose. Such exposures may be made without violating the rights of citizens, for hypocrites have no rights which decent people are bound to respect.

If the Sun adheres to these principles it will certainly fill a long-felt want in California, and we believe that it will redeem its promise.
