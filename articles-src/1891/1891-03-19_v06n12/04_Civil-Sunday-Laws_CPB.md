As noticed briefly a week or two since, the founder of the American Sabbath Union, in an article in Our Day, for January, says:—

It is significant that the American Secular Union, instead of condemning all Sabbath laws, asks only for the "repeal and prevention of all laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as a religious institution, rather than an economic one justified by physiological and other secular reasons." As there are no Sunday laws that enforce its religious observance, this "plank" "tailed on the fog," is waste timber.

Let us examine this matter a little and see just how much truth there is in the statement made in Our Day. What are the grounds of the Sunday laws of the several States? and upon what grounds does the American Sabbath Union demand additional laws for the enforcement of Sunday rest? In answering these questions we observe first, that the basis of the organization in question, is the fourth commandment of the Decalogue. There can therefore be no doubt that the American Sabbath Union itself is a religious organization. That the observance which it wishes to enforce by civil law is also of a religious character is plainly shown by many utterances of representative members of the organization. The President of the association has himself declared:—

We do not rest this work on mere human reasoning: we rest it wholly and directly on the divine commandment.

And of the so-called "civil Sabbath," the founder of the Union says:—

Take the religion out and you take the rest out.

And again the same authority is credited, by the Denver News of January 17, with the following utterance:—

The chief reason, however, why civil law forbids Sunday amusements is not the injury that comes to individuals from Sunday work and noise, but the fact that to allow them would be to destroy the rest day itself.

The Christian Advocate, of this city, a paper thoroughly in sympathy with the Union, referring to Europe, says that workingmen, who were told that a secular Sabbath would be advantageous to them because it would afford them opportunity for recreation and pleasure which was impossible on the other days, find that they have been deceived; the secularization of Sunday really means additional burdens for laborers.

This is simply putting in another form, the statement made by Mr. Crafts, and means that Sunday must be preserved as a religious day if it is to be preserved as a day of physical rest. Right in harmony with these utterances are the following words from a Presbyterian pastor, in San Francisco, California:—

Christianity does not teach that men can be made religious by law; but it does enjoin that men should abstain from all unnecessary avocations on the Lord's day. This civil Sabbath is what the civil Government in America is called upon to enforce. First, because it is the right of all to be allowed one day of rest out of seven: second, because such rest is the command of God. Morality without religion is impossible. If the Sabbath, therefore, be abolished, the fountain of life for the people will be sealed, and all our civil and religious institutions will be jeopardized.

And to the same import are the following resolutions adopted, a few days since, by the Sabbath Union, of Massachusetts:

Resolved, 1. That we believe that when Christ said "The Sabbath was made for man," he uttered a principle of perpetual validity, and we deprecate the theological instruction which severs all connection between the Lord's day and the principle of one day's rest in seven as recognized in Revelation, at the creation, and in the fourth commandment.

2. That we believe that the substitution of the first day of the week for the seventh day as a Sabbath, with undiminished moral obligation, was intended by "the Lord of the Sabbath" as a perpetual memorial of his resurrection, and that it was confirmed by apostolic precept and example.

3. That we will resist all attempts to divest the Christian Sabbath, as a day of rest and worship, of the sacredness of a divine law.

It will be noticed that in all of these quotations the religious idea is prominent; true, the idea of a day of physical rest is also there, but in every case it is secondary; and so it is all through the utterances of the Sunday-law advocates. And no wonder, for it is the preservation of the "Christian Sabbath," the "Lord's day," that is sought; it is as a "Christian Nation," and because of "national obligation to obey the law of God," that we are exhorted to preserve "the Sabbath." The quoted expressions are stock phrases with those who are foremost in the advocacy of Sunday laws. The "civil Sabbath," the "rest day," is a secondary thing with them, an afterthought, and is in fact a mere figment used to break the force of the arguments against religious legislation.

The State of New Jersey affords just now an excellent illustration of the true attitude of the Sunday-law advocates. The liquor dealers of that State are making an effort to secure some modification of the law which forbids the sale of liquors upon the first day of the week. In a fervid appeal for the retention of the law, the Christian Union says:

The attempts made by the liquor dealers to break down the Christian Sabbath in New York last year, is being repeated this year by the liquor dealers in New Jersey. "This is an attack on the Christian Sabbath." "No honest traffic ventures to break in upon the Sabbath quiet."

Scant reference is then made to the evils of Sunday liquor selling because of the number idle upon that day, and then the editor returns to the charge in this manner:

More than this, the Christian church owes a duty to itself, and to the State of New Jersey, which it ought not to be slow to perform. Some sort of organized expression of public sentiment against this proposed legislative action ought to be called forth from every part of the State. Let the Church, without reference to divisions, act as a unit in giving leadership and direction to the public opinion in this matter.

There is no mistaking this language; it is the "Christian Sabbath" that is to be preserved in New Jersey in the interests of the "Christian church." The sanctity of the day and the good of the Church are the great considerations urged. It matters not where or by whom this subject is discussed, the fact crops out that the real spring of the Sunday movement lies in the fact of the religious character of the day. In a sermon preached, not long since, in Pendleton, Oregon, Rev. W. A. C. Rowse, pastor of the Baptist Church, at that place, right in the midst of an impassioned appeal for the "civil Sabbath," said:

There can be no religion without worship and no worship without Sunday. It is not too much to say that without Sunday the Church of Christ as visible socially can not exist on the earth. Those who desire to do away with a day of rest are those who are willing to corrupt the morals and endure the bodies of the workingmen in order to satisfy their own selfish ends.

And right in line with this is the following utterance, cheered to the echo, in a recent "civil" Sunday-law meeting in Tacoma, Wash.:

What makes the Anglo-Saxon people what they are, but Christianity? What but the Almighty God? And he made the Sabbath at Mount Sinai when he pronounced the words, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." The Sabbath is part of the system of Christianity, the source of all our good. We may as well pass a law that will cause the destruction of our goods and chattels, as our eternal souls. I have lived in cities where I saw the effects of disregarding the Sabbath, and I say to every young man here, "Take care that you don't let any outpost of Christianity be broken down with your consent, and I call upon you, young men, to note what it is to be on the right side. Break down the barriers, espouse the wrong, and when you come to the grave you will be a lost soul, sinking ever lower and lower in the bottomless pit. On the other hand, if you embrace Christianity you will tend ever upward and upward until you embrace the right hand of Majesty, and are folded to his bosom.

Where in this language is there a hint of any motive but a religious one? To repeal the Sunday law would "cause the destruction" of "our eternal souls," it would be to surrender an "outpost of Christianity." And to maintain the Sunday law is to "embrace Christianity." Yet we are assured by another speaker at the same meeting, that they do not ask legislation for the religious Sabbath. We do not want to make men religious by legislation.

Certainly not; the object simply is to get men to accept Christianity that they may "embrace the right hand of Majesty, and be folded to his bosom." That this is desirable is true, but that to make laws with reference to it is any part of the duty of human governments does not follow. In the first place it is beyond the power of government to secure such results; and in the second place to attempt anything of the kind is to usurp the prerogatives of God himself; and such attempts carried to their logical end will ever result as they ever have resulted, namely, in persecution for conscience' sake.

But we are told that courts have sustained Sunday laws, declaring that they rest, not on religious but on civil grounds. It is true that such decisions have been made, but other courts have decided that such laws are religious, and that they rest upon the divine law.

In the case of Bramhall vs. Van Campen, (8 Minnesota Reports, 12), Judge Flandrau, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, gave the opinion that "the Sabbath laws of the State can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments." In the Supreme Court of Texas, Judge Caldwell held that "the object of the Legislature was to forbid all secular employment on the Sabbath, not excepted in the act. The disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes constitutes the offense." (Essex vs. the State, 30 Texas Reports, 524.) In deciding one of these Sunday cases the Supreme Court of Alabama also said: "We do not think the design of the Legislature in the passage of the act can be doubted. It was evidently to promote morality and advance the interest of religion, by prohibiting all persons from engaging in their common and ordinary vocations." (O'Donnel vs. Sweeney, 5 Alabama Reports, 467.)

Similar cases are reported from several other States notably Connecticut and New Hampshire. (See Wright vs. Geer, 1 Root, 474; Fox vs. Able, 2 Connecticut Reports, 548; George vs. George, 47 New Hampshire Reports, 27.) But such decisions are simply statements of the fact revealed more or less plainly in the laws themselves. Only recently a Georgia lawyer has discovered that the preachers of that State are required by law to read from their pulpits, four times a year, an act regarding the observance of Sunday. The statute was framed by the Colonial Assembly in 1763, section 10 reading as follows: "And be it further enacted, that this act shall be read yearly, and every year, and at least four times in each year before sermon begins; and every minister is hereby required to read the same in his respective place of divine worship." The act provides penalties for vice, profanity, immorality, and for not "keeping holy the Lord's day commonly called Sunday."

The conclusion is unavoidable that Sunday is a religious institution, and it is because of the religious regard in which it is held that laws are made requiring its observance. The "civil Sabbath" is simply the religious institution enforced with varying degrees of strictness by civil law.
