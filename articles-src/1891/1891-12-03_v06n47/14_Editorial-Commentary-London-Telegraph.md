THE DAILY Telegraph, of London, England, is opening its columns to a discussion of the Sunday question. The Secretary of the "Workingmen's Lord's Day Rest Association" of England, has been contributing articles. The Church of England papers in their comments deprecate the discussion as something upon which there can not properly be two opinions. And the inference from their utterance is, that, in their opinion, any expression of views adverse to those held by the Church on this question should not be tolerated. Such a feeling is naturally to be expected from an established church; yet how does it differ from the Simon Pure National Reform sentiment of this country?
