RELIGIOUS needs no support from the State. It is stronger and much purer without it. The connection of Church and State corrupts religion and makes the State despotic.—*Naiton Quo.*

No man must accept or reject the Bible for himself, and the consequences of his decision he must abide. It is a matter between his own soul and his God, and the civil power has no right to interfere or to turn him either this way or that.

There is no part of the law of God that can be enforced as such, by civil government. For instance, it is within the physical power, though not within the proper sphere of government, to compel its citizens to refrain from ordinary labor and business transactions during the week that it may see fit, but it is not within the power of any government to compel its citizens to obey the fourth commandment. That commandment says, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" and simply resting from labor is by no means all that is required in that commandment. According to Isa. 58: 13, true Sabbath keeping is not only to refrain from labor on the Sabbath, but to "call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord." And this, civil government can not compel; therefore, it is impossible for civil government to enforce the fourth commandment; neither can civil government enforce any other commandment as the law of God. Take, for example the sixth. The Sentinel has said that he that hateth his brother is a murderer. A man may manifest all the hatred of which he is capable, and may even express that hatred, and yet the civil law cannot lay hold on him as a murderer. True, if he makes threats, that is, if he declares his intentions to use violence, the law can place him under bonds to keep the peace. It may be demonstrated as fully as human testimony can demonstrate anything, that his heart is full of hatred, and yet no one would say that the civil law ought to touch him. Still, in the sight of God the man is a murderer. The seventh commandment furnishes another illustration, which need not be dwelt upon, as all are familiar with the teachings of the Saviour on that point. And this is sufficient to show that civil government cannot enforce the law of God.
