THE Signs at the Times has returned to its former sixteen-page size, and marks the event by appearing with an improved head, and upon a lighter tinted paper; also with an increased length of column, which adds to the symmetry of the paper. Altogether, the changes made, while retaining all the distinctive features of the Signs, have beautified and brightened the face of an old friend most acceptably. Still, its superior attractiveness to the eye becomes secondary to the satisfaction of finding a double portion of matter equal in value and importance to that which the Signs has always furnished its readers.

As a missionary journal which presents the unalloyed truth of the Bible, with vigor, earnestness, and fidelity, it is unrivalled; in its accuracy of perception as to the application of these truths to the living principles which must govern humanity, in its social, legal, and moral relations, it has not even a competitor among the religious publications of the day.
