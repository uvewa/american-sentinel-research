THE Readers' Union Journal of Lansing, Michigan, in commenting on Judge Hammond's decision in the King case says:—

Thus a precedent is established and it has gone on record in this boasted free country of ours, that a man must read and understand his Bible as the majority read and understand it; that he must worship his God as his neighbors worship. But supposing the Adventists had been in the majority in Tennessee, and they had arrested some Christian of another denomination for working on Saturday, what a howl there would be from all the rest of the Christian world! A notable and disappointing fact is that the religious press have generally sanctioned this persecution by remaining silent. This attempt to govern a man's thoughts by law, and regulate his mode of worship by legislation is certainly a long stride toward slavery, and is sure to bring about rebellion from all lovers of liberty.

This case of King, although the most prominent, is not by any means the only instance of similar religious persecution in the United States during the last few years. Such cases can now be counted by the score. Why is it that the religious press is silent as regards them? Why is it that the speakers of the party of religious legislation have so belittled them, in the very slight mention which they have made? It is because they are not yet ready to accept openly, and assume, the mantle of John Cotton, Cotton Mather and their coadjutors in the enforcement of religious belief by law. Soon the time will come when they will not blush to wear the garb of American inquisitors, and then they will speak, but to favor and uphold, not condemn, the most strenuous attempts to govern men's thoughts by law and regulate their mode of worship by legislation.
