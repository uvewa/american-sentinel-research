"God in Government" was the subject of a discourse by Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt, Honorary Life President of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in Tremont Temple, Boston, Sunday evening, Nov. 15. Mrs. Leavitt's text was Isa. 9:6, 7:—

For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

It is not the purpose of this article to follow the speaker in all her remarks on this text, but only to state the conclusion, and then examine briefly the text itself in the light of other scriptures, to ascertain whether it will bear the interpretation which Mrs. Leavitt put upon it.

As briefly stated last week, Mrs. Leavitt's position was that since the fall of man theocracy is the only proper form of government; and that like Israel until the time of Saul, the Commonwealth under Cromwell and the Colony of Massachusetts under the Puritans were governed by God. The words of her text already quoted, the speaker interpreted to be a prophecy of the rule of Christ over this world in its present physical condition, and in this dispensation; that is that Christ is to rule this world through men, much as God is supposed to have ruled the Commonwealth through the stern and ambitious Cromwell, and the Colony of Massachusetts through the bigoted and intolerant Puritans.

But how to bring this about Mrs. Leavitt did not seem to know. True, she thought that it must be done through political action, but at this point she appeared dazed at the magnitude of the undertaking, and pathetically asked: "How are we going to put the government upon Christ's shoulder?" That "we" have it to do was taken for granted, for the speaker said: "If God chose to do it he could do it at once; but that is not his plan." But in this statement Mrs. Leavitt was unfortunate, for her text says: "The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this"—not the zeal of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, nor even of the whole Christian world—the work is the Lord's, and he will perform it in his own time and in his own way.

That Christ is to be this world's King, is clearly taught in the Scriptures: but that he is not now its king, and that he never will reign over it in its present condition, in the sense contemplated in Mrs. Leavitt's remarks, is just as plainly revealed. By comparing the promise to Abraham (Gen. 12:7, and parallel texts) with Romans 4:13, we learn that this world was promised to Abraham and to his seed: and in Gal. 3:16 it is plainly declared that Christ is that seed to whom the promise was made, and through whom it will be fulfilled. That the promise was not fulfilled to Abraham we are told by both Stephen and Paul. The former declares (Act 7:5) that "he [God] gave him [Abraham] none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on;" and in Hebrews 11:13, 39, it is plainly stated that Abraham "died in faith, not having received the promise."

But this is all in the plan of God. His promise has not failed. The time for its fulfillment has not yet come. The Saviour himself when on earth—not as a king but as a sacrifice for sin—likened himself to a nobleman going "into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return." Luke 19:12–27. And he plainly declared that "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." Matt. 25:31. It is then, the Father having given him, as promised in the second psalm, the heathen for an inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession, that he breaks them with a rod of iron, and dashes them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Then shall the government be upon his shoulder, and "of the increase of his government there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever;" and "THE ZEAL OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PERFORM THIS."

The plan of redemption as revealed in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is wonderfully comprehensive; it includes not only man but that which was in the beginning given to man for a possession, namely, the earth as it was when God saw that it was "very good." Of Christ the prophet has said: "And thou, O tower of the flock, stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah. 4:8. The first dominion was of course the uncursed earth; for it was the dominion given to the first Adam when God said to him: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Gen. 7:28. This dominion Adam surrendered to Satan when he himself by yielding to Satan, became his servant. Says the apostle, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?" But God has made it possible for every man to escape from the service of Satan and become not merely a servant but a son of God, for it is written of Christ: "He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But unto as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." John 1:11, 12.

But this action must be voluntary on the part of those who thus become sons. God leaves each man free to choose his service, or to refuse it and to continue in the service of Satan; for God wants, and will have, only willing and truly loyal subjects. The time is coming, however, when the kingdom will be given to Christ, who, by wearing the crown of thorns, redeemed the earth from the curse, just as by tasting death for every man he purchased for every man a resurrection from the dead. And as he is coming to ransom man from the power of the grave, and to clothe with immortality those who have given him their hearts, so he is coming to purify the earth and to restore it to its Eden beauty; and so it is written: "We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Peter 3:13. The promise of the new earth is the Lord's, and it is for him to fulfill it in his own time. As Mrs. Leavitt says, he could do it at once if he chose, but that is not his plan. Neither is it his plan to place the government upon the shoulder of Christ through human instrumentality. "The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this." All that any one can do in the matter is to submit to God and so become a subject of that glorious kingdom prepared for man from the foundation of the world, but for a time usurped by Satan, and finally to be wrested from him by the Lord Jesus Christ, who will reign over it forever, even for ever and ever."
