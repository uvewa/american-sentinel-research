### A Sound Legal Opinion.

The Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Washington, sometime since submitted the following in reference to the reading of the Bible in the public schools to the Attorney of the State, for his official opinion:—

Whether any man or government of this State, without violating any law of the State, can permit the Bible to be read, or conduct devotional or religious exercises at the opening of school day, or during any part of the school day as prescribed by law, by the singing of hymns or other sacred music, or by reading pages from the Bible, without comment, or by reciting or committing to memory anything contained therein, what is actually known as the Lord's Prayer?

The question here raised is the people of the State of Washington, determine nature unfoldment as to the present and future want of our common country. It demands all the more attention, not because of its intrinsic difficulty, but because of its involved and careful investigation of the subject.

The opinion quotes Section 11, Article 1 of the Constitution, which provides that "absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiments, belief and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property, on account of religion, but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State." Also that no public money or property shall be appropriated for, or applied to, any religious worship, exercise, or instruction.

The opinion then discusses whether or not such additional qualifications shall be required for any civil purpose. It further examines what bearing the constitutional guarantees of religious liberty have upon this opinion on matters of religion, for no case is here presented for determination.

Section 4, of Article 9, and Sections, "Section 4,— All schools maintained or supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence."

The opinion also cites provisions of the United States, found in Article 50, as follows: "Religious freedom.—No person shall be disturbed in his civil rights or in his private affairs or be in any wise discriminated against, or his free admission be be declined in person on account of and compact, as to all the citizens of said State."

From an examination of the foregoing subject of religion found in the Constitution of the United States, and in the Constitution of the several States of the Union, it will be noticed that in all the object is to protect of the people of the declared right with the Government.

It was to be regretted, with a full consolidation of the common law and historical proofs at our hand, and the memory of the persecutions of their ancestors fresh in their mind, were not more explicit constitutional safeguards against religious injustice, make all but two or all so implied that specific provisions were not deemed necessary by the Government.

A comparison of all the State Constitutions will show a marked and earnest progress of the people to make the divorce between Church and State, between state control and jurisdiction of politics and religion, more complete and assured, the laws of a countries and intervening governed upon this question, some of them even comprehensive to it therefore. Grant and denominational liberty, incorporated into themselves provisions against its abuse and against the enforcement of its maintenance, the more further and elaborate provisions are than their predecessors.

This marked and constant growth indicates strongly an endeavor to reach the maximum of safety, with the form and indefinite provision of the early Constitution, from the growing aggressiveness of religious sectarianism through the avenues of jurisprudence that had been left open. Such has been the experience, not in one but many States, until the adoption of our own Constitution, the endeavors to protect religious liberty have become still broader and more positive and more comprehensive of all phases of the question.

This growth does not, however, indicate a development of hostility to the Bible, or to any religion or church, but is a development of regard for the friends of religion. It is not that these constitutional experiments were wanting in reverence for the Bible, or that their successors are marked by any decreased degree of respect, but because they were unwilling that any error should be used for a purpose by any religious denomination, because they are unwilling that any man should through the agency of government be compelled to countenance the promulgating of any religion, or aid in its maintenance or further dissemination.

It was with this view in their view that the provisions of Section 11 of Article 1 of our Constitution, as used in that section, apply to all forms of religion, and as to include the right to entertain none; it is a part of qualification for public office, or as a prerequisite to teaching in the public schools, the disciple of Abraham or of Mohammed, of Confucius or of Zoroaster, of Christ or of Buddha, are alike shielded, for each is entitled to the constitutional guarantee, and, in this great act of denomination.

It is held that the great majority of the people of this country are Christians, and that on this question, for if there were only one Christian citizen in it is enough, for every citizen is entitled to the constitutional guarantee as he is to the security of the law against robbery and violence. Not to protect the rights of the minority, him simply because he was in the minority, and thus subject him to the superior force, such and instruction, lead to the further confusion and ultimate destruction of the principles themselves that otherwise would obtain.

The Attorney General continues at length, and gives his official opinion that the holding of religious exercises in the public schools of the State of Washington is unconstitutional. Upon this point he says in the language of the Constitution of the State it is remarkably clear.

We are glad to be able to assure the reader that the recent courteous from the Knights of Columbus received the reply acknowledges our fellowship, Ohio. The Union transacted in its action as a matter of constitution in which it was adopted. One of these was in regard to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. The position was restored to the contrary and declared in favor of closing.
