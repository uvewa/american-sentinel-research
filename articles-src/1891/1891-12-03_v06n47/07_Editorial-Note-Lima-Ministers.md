THE ministers of Lima, Ohio, have organized a "Sabbath Association" and a crusade against Sunday papers. They make the Sunday paper the head and front of all irreligious offense because, as they say; "the Sunday barber shop, Sunday baseball, the Sunday saloon etc., all point to the Sunday newspaper by which to justify themselves."
