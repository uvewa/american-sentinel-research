The Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Washington, sometime since submitted the following in reference to the reading of the Bible in the public schools, to the Attorney General of the State, for his official opinion:—

"Can a teacher employed in the common schools of this State, without violating any law of the State, or any provisions of the State Constitution, conduct devotional or religious exercises at the opening of the school day, or during any part of the school day as prescribed by law, by the singing of hymns or other sacred music, or by reading passages from the Bible, without comment, or by repeating or causing to be repeated (without comment), what is usually known as the Lord's Prayer?"

In his reply Attorney General Jones says:—

The question which you have submitted to me is one of so much interest to the people of the State at large, and is fraught with so much consequence to the present and future weal of our common school system, that I have felt justified in taking considerable length of time to make a rather extended and careful investigation of the subject.

The provisions of our own State Constitution which have a bearing on this question are:—

Section 11, Article 1, of the Constitution which is as follows: "Section 11. Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief and worship shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property, on account of religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State. No public money or property shall be appropriated for, or applied to, any religious worship, exercise or instruction, or the support of any religious establishment. No religious qualification shall be required for any public office or employment, nor shall any person be incompetent as a witness or juror, in consequence of his opinion on matters of religion, nor be questioned in any court of justice touching his religious belief to affect the weight of his testimony."

Section 4, of Article 9, as follows: "Section 4.—All schools maintained or supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence."

The first subdivision of the compact with the United States, found in article 26, as follows:

"First—That perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured and that no inhabitant of this State shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or her mode of religious worship."

And the fourth subdivision of said compact, as follows:

"Fourth—Provision shall be made for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools free from sectarian control, which shall be open to all the children of said State."

From an examination of the provisions on the subject of religion found in the Constitution of the United States, and in the Constitutions of the several States of the Union, it will be noticed that at the very outset the people of this country declared with singular unanimity against the union of religion with the Government.

It was, no doubt, with a full consideration of the heterogeneous elements composing our Nation, and the memory of the persecutions of their ancestors, that the people of all the States adopted constitutional safeguards against religious intolerance, and all but two of the original thirteen States declared a complete divorce between the Government and creed.

An examination of all the State Constitutions will disclose the further fact that the sentiment of the people to make the divorce between Church and State, between government and creed, between politics and religion, more complete and absolute, has been one of constant and unvarying growth. While the early Constitutions were not very radical upon this question, some of them even countenancing a limited union between Church and State, the later Constitutions have, in almost every instance, incorporated into themselves provisions and declarations more radical, sweeping, and comprehensive than their predecessors.

This marked and constant growth indicates with great emphasis that the people were not satisfied with the loose and indefinite provisions of the early Constitutions, and were unwilling to leave open a way for the insidious invasion of public affairs by religious sectarianism through the avenue of judicial construction and interpretation.

This growth of public sentiment has continued until the adoption of our own Constitution, the provisions of which on this subject are as broad, if not broader and more positive and more comprehensive, than similar provisions in any of the other State Constitutions.

This growth does not, however, indicate a decrease in religious sentiment among the people; these provisions have not been the work of the enemies, but of the friends of religion. It is not that the men who framed and the people who adopted these constitutional enactments were wanting in reverence for the Bible, and respect and veneration for the sublime and pure morality taught therein, but because they were unwilling that any avenue should be left open for the invasion of the right of absolute freedom of conscience in religious affairs; because they were unwilling that any man should be required directly or indirectly, to contribute toward the promulgation of any religious creed, doctrine or sentiment to which the conscience did not lend full assent.

It was with this idea in view that the provisions of Section 11 (supra) were framed. There can be no doubt that the word "religion" and "religious," as used in that section, apply to all forms of religion and religious worship and belief, and that as a test of qualification for public office, or to affect the weight of his testimony as a witness in judicial proceedings, its provisions equally protect the disciple of Abraham, of Mohammed, of Confucius, and of Jesus; and that within the meaning of that section each is a member of a distinct religious sect or denomination.

The fact that the great majority of the people of this State are Christians can not in any way affect this question; for if there were only one Christian in the State, that one Christian would be equally entitled to the constitutional guaranty as he is under existing circumstances, and it would be a cowardly court that would refuse to extend it to him simply because he was in the minority.

But does the conclusion, that the stated reading of the Bible in the public school is religious worship and instruction, lead to the further conclusion that it is in violation of any part of the constitutional provisions above cited?

The Attorney General continues at length, and gives his official opinion that the holding of religious exercises in the public schools of the State of Washington is unconstitutional. Upon this point he says the language of the Constitution of the State is remarkably clear.
