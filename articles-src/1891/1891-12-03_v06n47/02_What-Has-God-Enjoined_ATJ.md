LAST we showed how a court of the United States, as represented in the dictum of Judge E. S. Hammond, has presumed to assert jurisdiction over the religious feelings, and the belief and wishes of citizens of the United States and asserted the prerogative of deciding for them what they really believe and feel, and of condemning them accordingly.

Nor is the instance there cited the only one in the now famous dictum. At another place he touches the same point in the following words:—

It is not necessary to maintain that to violate or to directly contravene the will of God; it is itself instinct to make it criminal at the eye of the law. It may be harmless in itself, but, as defendants believe, God has not set apart that day for rest and for recreation in a sense in which they desire to set it apart; and yet *the civil law has set it apart in the form, by his law.* And *it is just as evil to violate as such a law of rest as it is any other moral law, when the obligation to express it obtains; there is in one sense a service immediately in refusing obedience to the laws of one's country, subjection to which God himself has enjoined upon us.*

As we are not yet convinced that the Judge has yet rightly assumed the prerogative of officially deciding what the will of God is, we desire to know how he knows that God has enjoined subjection to the laws of one's country, in the sense conveyed in this statement and in this dictum throughout?—And is that we must be in unqualified subjection to whatever laws men may at any time and in any wise enact, even though they be such laws as may be demanded by "a sort of factitious advantages" of a set of religionists who insist upon it "in spite of the clamor for religious freedom, and the progress that has been made in the absolute separation of Church and State."

Everybody who ever read the Bible knows that God has never enjoined subjection to the laws or government of men in any such sense as that. It is true that the powers which be are ordained of God, but it is also true that these powers are not ordained to act in the place of God. He who has ordained those powers, and set over them the basest of men (Dan. 4:17), has also set a limit to their jurisdiction.

Only the things that are Cæsar's are to be rendered to Cæsar. With anything that pertains to God, government can have nothing to do. The limit of government jurisdiction is only in man's relation to his fellow-citizens, or to the State. This jurisdiction is to be exercised in maintaining rights in all respects. So long as a man conducts himself peaceably and pays his honest debts, with him the State can have nothing to do. No State therefore ever of right punished anything which is harmless in itself. To pretend to do so, is the first step toward tyranny.

The principles of the limits of State interference as regards the religious, however, have been so fully discussed in THE SENTINEL, that it is not necessary to do so again in this connection. God has furnished practical examples, which do fairly and positively contradict the theory propounded by Judge Hammond. It will be in order to note some of them in this connection.

As since a court of the United States has positively decided and officially declared to the United States, just what God has enjoined in this respect, it is perfectly in order for us to read for ourselves what, in practice as well as in principle, God has really enjoined.

As related in the third chapter of Daniel, the King of Babylon once set up a great image and called a general assembly of the people to celebrate the dedication of it. On the day all were commanded to bow down and worship the golden image. There were some Jews who stoutly refused. By "a sort of factitious advantages" the worshipers of the image had "the aid of the civil law," and adhered to that advantage with great tenacity in spite of the clamor for religious freedom. The image-worshipers therefore insisted that those "non-conformists" should be conformists, as they were "required, every one of them to comply" with this certain ceremony.

The dissenters refused to comply. By the image-worshipers this refusal was held to be a defiant setting up of the dissenters' "non-observance by an ostentatious display of their disrespect for the feelings or prejudices of others." And as the dissenters refused to be "tolerant," actually refusing "for purposes of emphasizing their distaste for or their disbelief in the substance" of image-worship, they were "made to offer their defiance by performing," if you call them so, "the sin of the great majority" of image-worshipers who would comply "in the form" when they worshiped.

The penalty of the law was that those who should refuse to worship the image, should be cast into a fiery burning furnace. As the image-worshipers were very tenacious of their "sort of factitious advantages" they prosecuted the three dissenters.

When presented, the non-conformists, in open court, refused to conform and asserted their right to refuse. The judge declared to them distinctly the alternative that "if ye fall down and worship the image . . . well, but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?"

The three non-conformists replied to the judge, "We are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand. But if not, be it known unto thee that we will not serve thy god, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."

The judge was naturally inclined to favor the image-worshipers, and as public opinion was clearly on their side too, he was not willing to admit that the prisoners could shelter themselves just yet behind the doctrine of religious freedom. In defying the existence of a law and in opposition to those who claimed that it was "their" own "religious feeling or fanaticism" that it was their right to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience; he held that as the law had commanded in the form the observance of this rite, it must be obeyed as man's law, if not, as God's; but "as it is no one thing which the dissenters were doing was 'harmless in itself,'" but that could not be allowed as such, because the law commanded it, and therefore there was a certain immorality in refusing obedience to the laws of one's country, subjection to which God himself had enjoined. Therefore, "full of fury" and with "the form of his visage changed," the judge commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than usual, and that the prisoners should be remanded to the fiery sentence.

The judge was the king himself, and so soon was his judgment executed, and the men were cast into the flames, that he was more astonished than ever before in his life. He "rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O King. He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God." Then the king called to the non-conformists, "Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither."

The king had learned something, for he spake and said: "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."

The king had learned something. God had not enjoined subjection to the laws of the country in any thing that pertained to the rights of the individual to worship. He had learned that when the laws of the country prohibit that which is harmless in itself, and thus interfere with the right of the individual to enjoy his God-given rights, then it is the law that is wrong, and not the action of the person who disregards the law; and that therefore the proper thing to do is to change the law, not to punish the harmless individual. Yes, King Nebuchadnezzar, heathen though he was, learned that much twenty-four hundred and ninety-nine years ago. And when the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitutions of the United States and of the several States have embodied for this whole Nation this same doctrine, in the words, "All men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," and, "No human authority shall in any case control or interfere with the rights of conscience," it is scarcely to the credit of a court of the United States that he should be farther behind the times than was the heathen Nebuchadnezzar nearly twenty-five hundred years ago.

But this was not the only example in illustration of the principle; another is found in Dan. 6. About 550 years later, in the reign of Darius the Mede, some strongest religionists again by "a sort of factitious advantages" secured "the aid of the civil law" and consequently got a law making it in itself "evil" to worship God; that is, making Daniel's praying, which was "harmless in itself," forbidden by the law, and men's law presumed to dictate in what is and what is not the law of God.

Therefore, while a single non-conformist was spoken of as "undoubtedly displaying his disregard for the feelings or prejudices of others," and was "made to suffer for his defiance by performing" the act of praying; and the rest of the people demanded that he be punished, God did not say that the non-conformist was wrong. He answered and delivered the non-conformist from all the penalty of the law that contradicted the law of God. He did so then, and He will do so again and also before. O King, *Nunc, Nunc, dimittis.*

Again God declares the man innocent who disregards any law which takes away his exercises, or prohibits in such as those. And again God demonstrates that He has not enjoined subjection to the laws of men of any sort which take away his rights, or forbid even such as those.

About five hundred and sixty years afterward occurred another example which sets the matter forever at rest. This was the teaching of the Saviour Himself, in the distinction that He made between the things that are Cæsar's and the things that are God's—Matt. 22:21—and in the positive command "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

But then again it is shown not only that God never enjoined any such thing as Judge Hammond says he has, in the sense there asserted, but that he has positively enjoined the opposite. In short, by many evidences, and witnesses more that might be produced, it is demonstrated beyond the Judge's assumption, of the prerogative of officially declaring what God has enjoined, is about as wide of the mark as is his like attempt authoritatively to declare what the "religious feelings," "beliefs and wishes," of the Seventh-day Adventists "really" are.

But the strangest and most incongruous thing about the whole procedure is that it should presume to do it all.
