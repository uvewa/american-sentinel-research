THE Sunday evening concerts of the Germania Singing Society of Newark, New Jersey, has aroused the bitter opposition of the Law and Order League of that city. The League has been persistent in its efforts to obtain police interference to close the concerts. Newark correspondence of Sunday, November 15, says:—

The Germania Singing Society is celebrating its twenty-sixth anniversary with a concert. The Law and Order League denounce its music as sacrilege, and is further excited because the theatre where the entertainment is in progress is in the heart of the city, and within earshot of several churches.

Here is an expression which marks the character of this pseudo-legal organization. What has a Law and Order League to do with sacrilege? The maintenance of law and order is purely a civil affair, while sacrilege is the sin of profaning sacred things. Is the Law and Order League of Newark a civil or an ecclesiastical organization? If civil why does it attempt jurisdiction over the sin of sacrilege? If ecclesiastical why does it appeal to the police and the civil courts?
