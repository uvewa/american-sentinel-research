When the *Patriot* assumed the position it has occupied with reference to compulsory Sunday laws, and a number of other cognate questions, it did so with a view to the logical outcome of the opinions and positions opposite to its own. It happened in this case, as in nearly all similar ones, that almost every imaginable reason for its position was assigned and discussed except the determining and controlling one just mentioned.

But now conjecture as to what the defenders of compulsory Sunday laws would do, must yield to the certainty of what they are doing, and what they declare they desire and propose to do. Speaking of a constitutional amendment recognizing what these agitators call Christianity, Rev. W. J. Coleman says:—

The classes who would object to the amendment are,—Jews, infidels, atheists, et al. These classes are perfectly satisfied with the Constitution as it is. How would they stand toward it if it recognized the Lord Jesus Christ? . . . To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel.

District Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster says, when discussing the duties of nations according to the National Reformers' views:—

By providing her (the Church) funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field.

National Reformers declare that they expect the time to come when they will "draw their salaries from the treasury, the same as Government officials."

Rev. J. M. Foster declares that the reigning Mediator requires of the nations "A constitutional provision of moral and religious qualifications for their offices."

The sum of the matter then, is this: National reform and the union of Church and State are synonymous terms. National Reformers demand that the Government shall not be based as Thomas Jefferson vigorously put it, "upon the consent of the governed;" but upon religion; and they demand to be made the exponents of that religion; and to be paid out of the public treasury for their services; and that all who do not accept their exposition as true, shall be disfranchised, practically enslaved, robbed of the rights and citizenship which they now possess.

All there is in such a movement to commend it is its name, and that is an assumption. National reform!—disfranchising over half the Nation's citizens, and enthroning as absolute teachers and rulers, a set of men who assume to act in the name of God, but deny having received any authority from him to so act. A class of men who claim to be laboring to get men into heaven, but manifest more desire to get them out of earth and to possess and rule it themselves. These men who denominate their own uplifting and the corresponding debasement of all who differ from them, reformation, arrogate to themselves the following privileges: The sole and unquestionable power of determining what is true religion; the sole authority to present that religion; the sole power to bind the heavens by such determination and presentation; the right to exclude all men who differ from them both from the highest privileges, honors, and blessings, of earth, and from all the blessings of heaven; the right to demand pay from the public treasury for having the unconscionable effrontery to make all these assumptions.

The logical outcome of this movement is the union of Church and State, which must bring with it disfranchisement, loss of liberty, persecution, all the long train of evils which naturally follow in the wake of an attempt to do for God what he has never attempted to do for himself and never authorized to be done.

With this logical outcome in view we have protested, and shall continue to protest, against that which threatens to destroy our liberties and desecrate our land.
