# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, December 3, 1891, Volume 6, Number 47

## General Note

This issue presented significant difficulty in transcription due to very small, dense print throughout all 8 pages. The scan quality, while legible for general reading, made precise word-by-word transcription challenging, especially for the longer articles. A second-pass review was performed on 2026-02-08, correcting many errors from the initial transcription. However, significant uncertainty remains in several articles. A thorough review against higher-resolution scans is recommended.

## 01_Religious-Needs-and-Civil-Power.md

### Page 369, Column 1, First editorial paragraph attribution
- **Obstruction:** Very small italic text
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Naiton Quo."
- **Confidence:** LOW - The attribution after the em-dash is very hard to read. "Naiton Quo" does not correspond to any known publication or author. It might be "*Nation* (Quo.)" or a different name entirely.
- **Reason:** The italic text is too small to read with certainty

## 02_What-Has-God-Enjoined_ATJ.md

### Page 369, Column 2, Opening Paragraph
- **Obstruction:** Very small, dense print
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (multiple passes, revised 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** "the religious feelings, and the belief and wishes of citizens of the United States"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Revised from "widest citizens" to "belief and wishes of citizens" on second review. The phrase now makes better grammatical sense in context.

### Page 369, Column 2, Quoted passage from Hammond's dictum
- **Obstruction:** Very small print, complex legal language
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (revised 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** "It is not necessary to maintain that to violate or to directly contravene the will of God; it is itself instinct to make it criminal at the eye of the law..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Revised to "violate or to directly contravene" from previous garbled reading. The Hammond dictum language is complex and some phrases remain uncertain.

### Page 370, Column 1, Paragraph about the judge/king
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (revised 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** "it must be obeyed as man's law"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Corrected from "much's law" to "man's law" on second review. Context supports this reading.

### Page 370, Column 1, Sentence about punishment
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (revised 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** "the prisoners should be remanded to the fiery sentence"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Corrected from "three-to-five sentence" which made no sense in the Nebuchadnezzar narrative context.

### Page 370-371, Darius the Mede section
- **Transcribed as:** Various passages about Daniel and Darius
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM - The editorial commentary weaving Hammond's language into the Daniel narrative remains difficult to parse. Several phrases in this section are uncertain.
- **Specific concern:** "Nunc, Nunc, dimittis" near end of Daniel section - this was previously transcribed as "Nave, Nave, dove." Both readings are uncertain. This may be an Aramaic phrase, a Latin phrase, or something else entirely.

### Page 371, Column 1, Daniel section editorial commentary
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (revised 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** Various passages applying Hammond's language to Daniel narrative
- **Confidence:** LOW - The paragraphs weaving the legal language of the dictum into the Daniel 6 narrative are heavily paraphrased and very difficult to read at this scan resolution.

## 03_The-Logical-Outcome.md

### Page 371, Column 1, Entire article
- **Obstruction:** Very small, dense print in narrow column
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (multiple passes)
- **Confidence:** LOW - This entire article was extremely difficult to read accurately. Nearly every sentence contains uncertain words. The general argument is clear (National Reformers seek union of Church and State, demand control over public treasury, want to disfranchise non-conformists), but precise wording throughout is uncertain.
- **Specific concerns:**
  - Opening paragraph about accepting contributions is uncertain
  - Rev. W. J. Coleman quote is uncertain
  - Rev. J. M. Foster quote is uncertain
  - Final paragraph about privileges is uncertain
  - Attribution to "Independent Patriot, Lamson, Iowa" is fairly clear

## 04_Should-Sabbath-Observance-Be-Enforced-by-Civil-Law.md

### Pages 371-373, Throughout
- **Obstruction:** Dense text across three pages
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM - This very long article contains numerous uncertain passages. The legal quotations (Judge Finlayson, Judge Calwell, Judge Ball) are particularly difficult to read precisely. The scriptural arguments are more readable due to familiar biblical text.
- **Specific concerns:**
  - Multiple judge citations have uncertain exact wording
  - The case citations (Bramhall vs. Van Campan, Elsner vs. Suss) are uncertain in exact spelling
  - The article's six numbered propositions are clearer but some wording is uncertain
  - Paragraphs about French civil Sabbath and English law are uncertain
  - The latter portion of the article (pages 4-5) contains theological arguments that may overlap or be conflated with the beginning of the Mrs. Leavitt article (05). The boundary between these two articles needs verification.

## 05_Mrs-Mary-Clement-Leavitt-on-God-and-Caesar_CPB.md

### Page 373, Column 1, Introductory bracket
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (corrected 2026-02-08)
- **Transcribed as:** "Honorary Life President"

### Page 373, Columns 1-2, Throughout
- **Obstruction:** Dense theological argument
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM - Multiple passages contain uncertain readings, particularly:
  - The paragraph about Mrs. Leavitt's question ("How are we going to give the government upon Christ's shoulders?")
  - The theological argument about Abraham's promise
  - The conclusion about the plan of redemption
  - Several phrases appear garbled due to reading difficulty
  - The article discusses Christ's kingdom, Abraham's promise, the first dominion, and redemption, ending with C. P. B. attribution

## Overall Assessment

After second-pass review (2026-02-08), the transcription accuracy has been improved significantly for articles 02, 07, and 08. However, articles 03 (The Logical Outcome), 04 (Should Sabbath Observance), and 05 (Mrs. Leavitt) remain at LOW confidence for many passages due to the very small print in the scans.

**Priority for re-verification against higher-resolution scans:**

1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Article 04 (Should Sabbath Observance...) - Legal citations, judge quotations, article boundary with 05
2. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Article 03 (Logical Outcome) - Nearly entire article uncertain
3. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Article 05 (Mrs. Leavitt) - Theological argument, article boundary with 04
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Article 02 (What Has God Enjoined?) - Hammond dictum quotes, Daniel narrative
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Articles 06-08 - Various passages
