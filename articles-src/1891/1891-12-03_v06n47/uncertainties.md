# Uncertainties Log: v06n47 (1891-12-03)

## General OCR Quality
- Overall: GOOD - Most text was clear and readable in the Mistral OCR output
- Some ALL CAPS sections had minor quality issues (editorial notes on page 6)

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Opening Quote Box
- **Transcribed as:** "RELIGION needs no support from the State. It is stronger and much purer without it. . . . The connection of Church and State corrupts religion and makes the State despotic.—Justice Orton."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - Text was clear

### Page 1, Second Quote Box
- **Transcribed as:** "Each man must accept or reject the Bible for himself, and the consequences of his decision he must abide. It is a matter between his own soul and his God, and the State has no right to exert its influence to turn him either this way or that."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - Text was clear

### Page 1, Long Paragraph (no title, no attribution)
- **Decision:** NOT included as separate article - appears to be editorial filler/introductory matter
- **Reason:** No clear article structure, no title, no byline, discusses general principles

### Page 6, Editorial Notes
- **Issue:** Several all-caps notes had minor OCR artifacts
- **Example:** "HEAVIRE" (likely "HEAVILY"), unclear reference in Grand Jury note
- **Resolution:** Transcribed as-is where meaning was clear; corrected obvious OCR errors where context was certain
- **Note on article 10:** Incomplete sentence fragment in original OCR - transcribed exactly as OCR provided

### Page 7
- **Content:** Full page of advertisements
- **Decision:** Skipped entirely per instructions

### Page 8, Subscription Info
- **Decision:** Skipped as boilerplate per instructions
