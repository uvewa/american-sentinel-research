[A negative argument, delivered at the annual contest of the Philosoph and Adelphia Literary Societies of Westminster College, New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, June 24, 1891. by A. L. Russell (Philo.), Bulger, Pa.]

"RELIGION is essential to man." It is an inborn principle, universally co-existent with the faculty of conscience and the presence of the soul. Most potent of all civilizing and refining powers, it has ever been a mighty agent in opposition to vice and sin. Its value as an aid to government cannot be overestimated.

For these reasons ancient Rome enforced the profession of religion and the observance of its institutions. Horrified at the rising of Christianity, her emperors sought to perpetuate her religion by the help of civil law, believing that without religion Rome would soon be lost in vice and wickedness. Coercive religion failed, as it always will, to accomplish the desired end. Religion and liberty move onward together only when religion and the State are separate. In America their status scarcely needs to be defined: religion guards our freedom. A stranger to the law, it is enthroned in the hearts of the people. It forms and sways public opinion, the only source of power in our system of government.

With religion go its institutions. One of the most important is the Sabbath. In it are involved sacred principles upon which turn eternal destinies. Peace and godliness mark its sacred influence. Blessings many and great follow its proper observance. God is ruler; Christ is sovereign; and the Bible is the supreme law. To all this we freely and heartily assent. But we do deny that any of these blessings, or a proper observance of the Sabbath, can be secured through its enforced observance. And we further deny that God, Christ, or the Bible, ever gave any government the right to enact into civil law that mandate which God has declared holy, and of which he is sole Judge and Master. That when men wish to observe the Sabbath they should be protected by law we admit. That, willing or unwilling, such observance should be forced upon them, we deny.

Sabbath observance can mean nothing else than the strict keeping of the Sabbath, in accordance with both letter and spirit of that law by which the Sabbath is governed. It can no more be observed in a civil manner, *i.e.,* by animal cessation from toil, than the Lord's supper can be observed by a gluttonous feast.

It has been claimed that the law can and does enforce the observance of the Sabbath as a civil institution. In opposition to this claim I will prove that—

1. The Sabbath is a purely religious institution, recognized and enforced as such.

2. It is not the prerogative of civil government to enforce the observance of religious institutions.

3. Such enforcement fails to secure true observance, or an observance acceptable to God.

4. Christianity repudiates the use of force in the observance of religious institutions.

5. Such enforcement is religious persecution.

Hence, upon the proof of these propositions, it inevitably follows that the public observance of the Sabbath should not be enforced by civil law.

## THE SABBATH IS PURELY A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION, RECOGNIZED AND ENFORCED AS SUCH.

The authority for the Sabbath is divine and religious alone, and its observance is worship; for our duty to the Sabbath is our duty to God. Its institution in the garden of Eden, before the foundation of civil society, refutes the idea of its being a civil institution, and sustains the claim that it is purely religious.

Before the command, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," God "blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work." Gen. 2:3. Not because man was tired; he had done no work. Hence the Sabbath is no civil-labor ordinance. Not because God was tired; he is a spirit, and tires not. Hence his rest was spiritual and not bodily rest; and this is the rest he commanded man to commemorate, not *physical* but *spiritual* and holy rest. From quaking Sinai came the renewed command, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it *holy*," and the entire Bible indorses the sacred claim. Christians have disagreed as to which day of the week is to be kept holy—some keep the seventh day, others the first—but regarding the Lord's day as the Sabbath transferred, or a new institution, it is still purely religious; a sacred day of rest and worship.

Legislation in regard to the Sabbath sprang from the Roman conception that religion was a department of the State, and the emperor head of that department. In the fourth century Constantine adopted Christianity as the State religion, and ordained a Sabbath rest. The Lord's day was to be consecrated to prayer according to forms of worship designated. Thus in the first Sabbath legislation the day was enforced as a purely religious institution. England has always religiously enforced the Sabbath, Alfred basing his law on the divine appointment of the day. Blackstone says: "The profanation of the Lord's day is immediately injurious to God and his holy religion, and therefore punishable by the laws of England."

Chitty notes in his criminal law that "non-attendance at church is indictable under fine." The Commonwealth enforced the law with vigor, and when Puritanism was overthrown and came to America, it brought its characteristics; and the Church and State were not only united in New England, but the State was inside the Church. The "blue laws," the resulting theory, are too notorious to need quoting. Now universally condemned, they were the legitimate offspring of such an unholy alliance. Penn's great law of 1682 recognized the Christian religion, and commanded the observance of the Lord's day in praise and adoration, either at home or in public meetings.

All Sabbath legislation, therefore, from Constantine to Penn, was based on the fact that the Lord's day is the divinely-appointed Sabbath, and the object was to preserve the holy day from desecration. Pennsylvania's act of 1794 is claimed to be an ordinance for the enforcement of the Sabbath as a civil institution. Whence came the change? Under the colonial laws the observance was confessedly enforced to aid religion, and there is no act of the State to refute that declaration. Instead, the language of the bill proves the civil claim false. It says, "If any person shall do or perform any worldly employment whatsoever on the Lord's day;" and it further speaks of the punishment of those who "shall profane the Lord's day." Why enact penalties for the profanation of a civil day? Only a sacred thing can be profaned. And with unconscious significance the term "Lord's day" is used, and this again belies the civil claim.

Judge Thompson says: "Although Christians of all denominations look upon the Sabbath as of divine origin, yet it requires statutes to protect its observance, and the act of 1794 was undoubtedly passed for that purpose." For what purpose?—To protect the Sabbath as of divine origin. Idleness always produces vice, and did the framers of that bill think enforced idleness would prevent it? France, under the reign of revolution, tried it. They enforced a civil Sabbath, a rest day, every tenth day, and the affirmative would place our law-makers in the position assumed by France—enforcing a rest day devoid of religion. Was vice prevented?—History thunders, No! Never before or since have license and wickedness attained such glaring proportions. And these civil sabbaths augmented the evil. A logical result; for pure idleness was never productive of good. Religious sentiment among the people is the only guard against vice; and to inculcate such our fathers passed this bill, to protect the sacred and religious character of the day.

But what say our judges? All but three, speaking authoritatively from the bench, declare their allegiance to the divinely-appointed institution. Judge Flandreau, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in the Bramhall vs. Van Campen case, says: "The Sabbath laws of the State can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments." Judge Caldwell, of the Supreme Court of Texas, in Elsner vs. the State, says: "The object of the Legislature was to forbid all secular employment on the Sabbath not excepted in the statute. The disregard of the Sabbath, and the refusal to recognize it as a day sanctified to holy purposes, constitute the offense." The Supreme Court of Alabama says (O'Donnell vs. Sweeney): "We do not think the design of the Legislature in the passage of the act can be doubted. It was evidently to promote morality and advance the interests of religion." Judge Strong says: "Christianity without a Sabbath would be no Christianity. The very purpose of Sabbath laws, as declared in our Eastern States, and as shown by our authorities, was that the people may devote the day to rest and the worship of God." New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and other Supreme Courts, have given similar decisions.

Judge Bell dissents, saying: "The Sabbath is to become a mere rest day. Its sole mission is to inculcate a temporary weekly cessation from toil, but it adds not to this any religious obligation." By what authority is its profanation deemed a penal offense? Why may not the poor man take the railroad or street car to the country, and enjoy a few hours' communion with nature and with nature's God? If physical health be the great consideration, why compel him to remain in an atmosphere saturated with germs of pestilence and disease? If his intellectual development be sought, why close library, garden, and museum? Too often his enforced idleness leads him to crime, and his *vaunted rest* becomes a *damning curse*. The statistics of crime in New York City show more cases for Saturday night and Sabbath than for all the rest of the week. London, with its Sabbath laws, is one of the wickedest cities in the world. The famous Doctor Guthrie says Paris is more orderly and quiet on Sabbath than rest-enforcing Edinburgh.

What does this say for enforced idleness on the irreligious? Surely it cannot be claimed that it is conducive to health, religion, or morality. Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts says, "A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation;" and again, "If you take religion out of the day you take the rest out." In Boston Monday lectures for 1887, Joseph Cook says: "Unless Sabbath observance be founded on religious reasons, you will not long maintain it on the basis of economic, physiological, and political considerations only." Says Supreme Justice Field: "Laws setting aside Sunday as a day of rest are upheld, not from any right of government to legislate for the promotion of religious observances, but from the right to protect all men from the physical and moral debasement which comes from uninterrupted labor. (This is but a transcript of a decision given by him while justice of the State court of California, hence has no more argumentative weight than one of the half dozen contradictory opinions of other State courts.)

Now to protect from moral debasement cannot be other than to enforce moral elevation, and to enforce moral elevation is to enforce morality, and morality is defined as "the relation of conformity or non-conformity of an act to the divine law." But conformity to the divine law is religion. Therefore, when, according to the decision cited, Justice Field enforced morality, he enforced religion; for they are inseparable. And in enforcing religion he enforced its institutions. Then the undeniable fact remains that Justice Field, giving moral and religious reasons in support of a civil claim, has recognized the *religious claim* and enforced it.

God has declared the Sabbath holy. If not observed in a holy manner, it is not observed at all. Then it must follow that it cannot be observed in a civil manner. The command to keep it holy, God has never yet withdrawn, nor permitted man to alter, nullify, or abrogate in any manner. It is holy still. The highest court on earth could never repeal it. As Webster says, "You might as well put out the sun and think to light the world with tapers, destroy the action of gravitation and think to wield the universe by human power, as to extinguish the moral illumination of the Sabbath, and break the glorious mainspring of the moral government of God," and yet try to maintain religion or morality on the earth.

True, Christ has said, "The Sabbath was made for man." So were baptism and the Lord's supper. The object of the Founder of the Sabbath was man's spiritual and religious welfare. Himself hath declared it. The Jews thwarted this object by the excessive strictness of their observance, making the Sabbath a burden; Christ's words were to correct that abuse, and they cannot be twisted into any other meaning. The Sabbath is for man, not for himself, for he has six days, but that he might use it to the glory of God; for that is the chief end of man.

The combined voices of history, law, and Holy Writ present one mass of proof without a flaw, that the Sabbath is the holy day of God, and is purely religious in its origin, law, and observance, and cannot be anything else. Our Congress has declared it so; our courts avowedly enforce it as such. In statute language, "That the people may devote the day to rest, and to the worship of Almighty God." It is, then, beyond doubt or dispute, a purely religious institution, recognized and enforced as such.
