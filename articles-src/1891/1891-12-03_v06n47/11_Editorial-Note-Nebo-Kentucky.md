A CORRESPONDENT FROM NEBO, KENTUCKY, writes that the people in that locality quite generally consider that the decision of Judge Hammond in the case of R. M. King is just. He says, further, that the ministers of all denominations, both white and colored, are preaching that everybody, regardless of their observance of another day, or whether they believe that any day should be kept or not, should be compelled to obey the laws of the land by keeping Sunday.

This is another instance showing that the only possible use that can be made of Sunday laws is for zealots to take advantage of them to annoy their inoffensive friends and neighbors, who would like the privilege of disposing of their own time, while other people are doing the same.
