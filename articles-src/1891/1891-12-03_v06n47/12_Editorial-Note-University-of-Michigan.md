THE DETROIT FREE PRESS PRINTS, IN ITS NOTES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, AN ITEM WHICH SHOWS THE EXISTENCE OF A SOCIETY AMONG THE STUDENTS OF THAT INSTITUTION, THE MEMBERS OF WHICH ARE GIVING THEIR ATTENTION TO QUESTIONS OF LIVING MOMENT. Students who are now investigating along the lines of thought denoted by these subjects will find themselves fitted to cope with the problems of the deepest import—social, legal, legislative, religious—that will present themselves for final decision in the coming years. The item says:—

The meeting of the Athenaeum on Monday evening was noticeable for the discussions on "The Bible in the U. of M." "Sunday and the World's Fair."
