THE Northwestern Christian Advocate argues, in an editorial on "Methodism and the Fair," that because the Methodist membership of the world is some six and a half millions, and the Methodist following nearly twenty-six and a half millions more, therefore the voice of the Methodist Church in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair should be heard, and, by inference, of course, its dictum in that regard followed. From the beginning of this contest for legal Sunday closing, and all its natural resultant of religious laws, the boast of numbers has been the loudest campaign cry of its religio-political henchmen, and of its leaders as well. It might be supposed from the assurance with which this plea of numbers is made that the "Church of the United States" had incorporated in its creed the ancient error that the voice of the people is the voice of God, but evidently with the Jesuitical mental reservation—the voice of myself and my people is the voice of God, but the words of all others are in the language of Satan.

It seems to be the fate of all these Sunday reformers to look upon the shield of truth from the reverse side, and so the Northwestern after pleading its census of eight figures as a reasonable argument for the enforcement of the views of that religious army upon the rest of the world, expresses its conviction that, "The decision to be made within the next year will live in human history forever, and those who may cast the votes which will turn human progress backward must answer during generations to come." If the intended significance of these words be reversed, they are truth; for those who cast their votes in favor of enforcing religious observance at the World's Fair, or elsewhere, will turn the wheels of human progress far backward; and the decision as to the casting of their votes on this question must soon be made by all, both individually and collectively. In it is involved the principle of allegiance to man or to God, and it is true that the future history of each human being depends on his decision as to which master he will choose to serve.
