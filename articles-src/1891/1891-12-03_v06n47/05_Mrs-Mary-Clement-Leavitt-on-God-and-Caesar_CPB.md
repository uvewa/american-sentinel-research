[In the continuation of the review of a discourse by Mrs. Mary Clement Leavitt, Honorary Life President of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in Tremont Temple, Boston, Sunday, Nov. 8.]

It is not the purpose of this article to follow the speaker in all her remarks on this text, but only to show the conclusions, and then examine briefly the text itself in the light of other scriptures; to ascertain what it will bear the interpretation which Mrs. Leavitt put upon it.

As briefly stated last week, Mrs. Leavitt's position was that since the theocracy failed to realize its the only proper form of government; and that God first installed this kind of State of God, the Commonwealth under Cromwell and the Colony of Massachusetts under the Puritan theocracy were governed by God.

The words of her text already quoted, the speaker interpreted to be a prophecy of the rule of Christ over this world in its present physical condition, and in this dispensation; that is that Christ is to rule this world through men, much as God is supposed to have ruled the Commonwealth through the street and substation, Cromwell, and the Colony of Massachusetts through the bigoted and intolerant Puritans.

But how to bring this illustration Mrs. Leavitt did not seem to know. True, she thought that it must be done through political means, but at this point she appeared dazed at the magnitude of the undertaking, and pathetically asked: "How are we going to give the government upon Christ's shoulders? That," says "we haven't for do was taken, for granted, for the speaker said: "If God chose to do it he could do it of his own self, but that is not his plan." But in this statement Mrs. Leavitt was unfortunate, for her text says "The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform it,"—not "the zeal of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, nor even of the whole Christian world—the work of the Lord's; the Lord he will perform it in his own time and in his own way."

That is that Christ in his Lord's Kingdom is clearly taught in the Scriptures; but that he is not our the king, and that the never bring reign over in its greater construction, in the sense contemplated in Abraham's rewards, is just as plainly declared. By comparing the promise to Abraham (Gen. 17), and parallel texts with Romans 4:13, we learn that this was promised as Abraham or for an everlasting God. 2:21 it is plainly declared that Christ is that seed to whom the promise was made, and through whom it will be fulfilled. That the promise was not fulfilled in Abraham we are told by both Stephen and Paul. The former clauses (Acts 7:5) that "the Lord gave him [Abraham] none inheritance in it, not so much as to set his foot on;" and Hebrews 11:13, 39, it is plainly stated that Abraham "died in faith, not *having received the promises.*"

But this is all in the plan of God. The promise has not failed. The time for its realization has not yet come. The Saviour himself saw it while his pilgrimage and preparing a sacrifice for sin—likened himself to a nobleman going "into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return." Luke 19:12-27. And he plainly declared that "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." Matt. 25:31. In Isaiah, the Father Saviour gave him, he promised in the second palm, the heathen for the earth for a possession, that he would smash them with a rod of iron, and dashes them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Then shall the government be upon his shoulders; and "of the increase of his government there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever," and "THE ZEAL

OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PERFORM THIS."

The plan of redemption as revealed in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is wonderfully comprehensive; it includes not only man but that which was a beginning in the cross for a permanence, namely, the earth as it was when God declared that it was "'very' good." Of Christ the Apostle has said: "All things, and those of the flock, strengthened of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah 4:8.

1. The first dominion was that of course increased turned, for it is the dominion given to the first Adam whom God said to him: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." Gen. 1:28. This dominion Adam administered to Satan when he himself yielded to temptation, and so Satan became the ruler of this earth, and claims it. Says the apostle, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to be, whom ye obey?" But God has made it possible for every man to escape from the grasp of Satan and become not merely a servant of God, but of lordship inheritance of Christ. "He came into his own, and his own received him not. But unto as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." John 1:11, 12.

But this article must be voluntary on the part of those who are become of that. God leaves each man free to choose his master, to do to what to do to continue in the servitude of Satan; for God wants, and will have, *only willing and truly loyal subjects.* The time is coming, however, when the kingdom will be given to Christ, by the Father, and the same hand that redeemed the earth from the curse, just as by lasting death for every man so righteous at the finding of every estate to be retrieved from the power of the grave, shall also redeem those men from the power of the grave, from those with the right to enter their risen bodies, now their risen bodies, as he is in them. Edenic beauty, and so it is in Malachi the Saviour is to become to him, you find new heavens and a new earth. Peter says, "Wherefore establishing righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13. The promise of the new earth to the Lord's, they are to be for them to fulfill it in his law as plain. Neither is it his plan to be violated. As Mrs. Leavitt says, he could do what he chose. As there it is to in his plan. Neither is it his plan to be broken upon it in the old by the same set that the Lord of hosts will perform all this; he will establish his kingdom and its matter to in which to do God as well as all of that is in that divine appointment prepared for man from the foundation of the world, but for a time usurped by Satan, and finally to be wrested from him by the Lord Jesus Christ, whose right it is, forever, ever for ever and ever.
