THE ministers of Lima, Ohio, have organized a "Sabbath Association" and a crusade against Sunday papers. They make the Sunday paper the chief front of all religious offense because, as they say:— the Sunday barber shop, Sunday butchering, the Sunday saloon—all point to the Sunday newspaper by which to justify themselves.

THE Grand Jury of Rome, Georgia, has found a number of indictments against violators of the Law and Order League of that city. In November, unfortunately the course taken by this legal instrument will be enforced the authorities and the passing will be before the authorities and the people to realize the mighty federation of leagues, associations, and societies which exists for the purpose of Sunday enforcement.

A PETITION, demanding the continuance of the State Sunday laws in Portland, Oregon, and signed by 9,000 voters of the city has been presented to the council of the city of Portland. The petitioners for the enforcement of the Sunday laws of the State included Archbishop Gross of the Roman Catholic Church and his priests. The petition embraced two-fifths or more of Protestant denominations of the city. This is another evidence of the co-operation of Protestants and Roman Catholics for the enforcement of Sunday observance.

THE tinsmiths of the Twelve Brother Journeymen Tinsmiths' Society have taken action against the American park by resolving that the Chicago log cabin be kept shut; must be compelled to close its gates on Sunday. This action, although in itself of no import, has been followed by the American Federation of Labor, Brooklyn Central Labor Union and others. Baseball is the strong meat of all true Sunday-law reformers, however, and was not touched.

The Buffalo *News* reminds of these "Sabbatarians" that "the next thing we know it will be suggested as a good thing to have religious exercises for the ball clubs."

A CORRESPONDENT from Nebs., Kentucky, says that the people in that locality quite generally consider that the punishment of the Adventists as described in the case of R. King is just. He says, further, that the Methodist preachers and some others, who are colored, are preaching that everybody, regardless of religious belief, is a Sabbath-breaker if he believes that any day should be kept or not, should be compelled to obey the laws of the State strictly.

This is another instance showing that the last thing the average man thinks of is for a religious majority to take advantage of them to annoy their neighbors. So long as the matter is left alone, the privilege of disposing of their own time, while not disturbing others, is conceded.

The *Detroit Free Press* of November 22, in its notes from the University of Michigan, at items from that institution, a society among the law students at the institution, the members of which are studying the question of the rights of minorities. Among the students who are now investigating along the lines of the relation of civil government to the rights of religion; that will present themselves for final discussion.
