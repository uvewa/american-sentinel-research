[In a cogent argument, delivered at the annual convention of the National Religious Liberty Association, at Battle Creek, Michigan.]

"RELIGION is essential to man." It is an axiom principle, universally consistent with the faculty of conscience and the presence of the soul. Most potent of all civilizing and refining powers, it has ever been a mighty agent in opposition to vice and sin. Its value as an aid to government cannot be overestimated.

For these reasons ancient Rome enforced the profession of religion and the observance of its institutions. Horrified at the rising of Christianity, her emperors sought to perpetuate her religion by the force of law, believing that that which our religion Rome would most be lost in vice and wickedness. Coercive religion failed, as it always will, to accomplish the desired end. Religion and liberty move onward together only when religion and the Bible are separate. In America their station nearly needs to be re-established, religion graces our freedoms. A stranger to the law, is enthroned in the hearts of the people. It forms and stays public opinion, the only source of power in our system of government.

With religion go its institutions. One of the most important is the Sabbath. Its day involved sacred principles upon which turn eternal destinies. Peace and quietness are connected with its observance; many and great follow its proper observance. God is ruler; Christ is our creator; and the Bible is the supreme law. To all the we freely and heartily assent. But we do deny that any of these things, true or proper observance of the Sabbath, can be secured through its enforced observance. And we further deny that God, Christ, or the Bible, ever gave any government, civil or whatever it may be, the right to the soul to enact civil law that mandates what God has declared holy, and of which he is sole Judge and Master. That when men win to observe the Sabbath "it should" be protected in its observance, is what we also believe and insist upon, them, we abide.

Therefore, while a single non-conformist was spoken "undetachedly displaced his faith," for religion or morality. Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts says: "A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured to any but except as the basis of religious worship," and again, "If you take religion out of the day you take the rest out." In Burton Monday lectures for 1887, Joseph Cook says: "Unless Sabbath observance is founded on religious reasons, you will not long maintain it on the basis of economics, physiological, and political considerations only." Says Supreme Justice Field: "Laws setting apart a day of rest are upheld, not from any right of government to legislate upon it or what its value is on the basis of economics, but from the right to protect men from the physical and moral debasement which comes from uninterrupted labor."

Again God declares the man innocent who disregards any law which takes away exercises, or prohibiting in such as these. The Saviour of mankind has seen this very case, and found therefore every man so righteous at the finding a double portion of matter and in value and importance to that which the state has always furnished its members. As a missionary journal which presents the analytical truth of the Bible, with vigor, earnestness, and fidelity, it is unrivaled; in its accuracy of perception as to the application of these truths to the living principles which must govern humanity, in the social, legal, moral its relations, it has not even a competitor across the religious publications of the day.

1. The Sabbath is a purely religious institution, recognized and enforced as such.

2. It is not the prerogative of civil government to enforce observance of religious institutions.

3. Such enforcement fails to secure observance; but an observance acceptable to God.

4. Christianity repudiates the use of force in the observance of religious institutions.

5. Such enforcement is religious persecution.

6. Such enforcement in religious persecution, upon the proof of these propositions, it inevitably follows that the civil observance of the Sabbath should not be enforced by civil law.

**SCRIPTURAL, HISTORICAL, RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL.**

The authority for the Sabbath is the Sabbath and religious and divine only, and the observance worship; for our duty to the Sabbath is without our duty to God. Its institution in the creation of Eden, before the founding of civil society, refutes the idea of the being of a civil institution, and its authority is purely religious, and its aim of all are purely religious.

Before the commandment, "In it the reward of," says this fact that man and "each," God "blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work." Gen. 2:3. Not because rest was time; he had done no work. Hence the Sabbath is no civil-labor ordinance, a spirit, and time not. Hence his rest was a spiritual and not bodily rest, and this is the rest the commandment is to commensurate, not physical but spiritual and holy rest. From quoting final cause the reverend continued, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy;" and the French Bible indicates the sacred claim, matters that have changed as to which day of the week it is to be kept holy—some keep the seventh day, others the first— whether the Lord's day or the Sabbath, bath transferred, or a new institution, it is still purely religious; a sacred day of rest and worship.

Legislation in regard to the Sabbath sprung from the Roman conception that religion was a department of the State, and the emperor the head of that department. In the fourth century Constantine adopted Christianity as the State religion, and ordained a Sabbath rest. The Lord's day was to be consecrated to prayer according to forms of worship designated. For the first Sabbath legislation the day was enforced as a purely religious institution. England has always religiously enforced the Sabbath. Afford basing it on his law as the divine appointment of the day. Blackstone says: "The profanation of the Lord's day is immediately injurious to God and his holy religion, and therefore punishable by the laws of England." Blackstone notes in his criminal law that "non-attendance at church is indictable." The Commonwealth entire. The civil system adopted when our Constitution was overthrown, and came to America, it brought its characteristics, and the Church and State were not only united in New England, but the State was inside the Church. The Pilgrim Fathers, however, with their persecuted theory, are too notorious to need quoting. Now universally condemned, they were the legitimate offspring of an unholy religion. Post-1776 the great seal of 1783 recognized the Christian religion, and commanded the observance of the Lord's day in praise and prayer, either at home or in public meetings.

All Sabbath legislation, therefore, from Constantine to Penn, was based on the claim that the Lord's day is the divinely appointed Sabbath, and the object was to preserve the holy day from desecration. In the history of the colonies, we find for an ordinance or the enforcement of the Sabbath as a civil institution. Whence came the change? Under the colonial laws the observance was ordinarily enforced as it is religious; and there is not in all of the State to refute that declarations, instead, the language of the bill proves the civil claim false. It says, "no person or persons shall any worldly employment whatsoever on the Lord's day;" and it further speaks of "a due observance of those who 'shall profane the Lord's day.'" Why exact penalties for the profanation of a day? Only a religious one for the purpose of morals. Again, suggesting the term "Lord's day" is used, and this again belies the civil claim.

Judge Thompson Stevens says: "Although Christianity of its purveyors took upon the Sabbath of divine origin, yet it requires statutes to protect its observance, and the act of 1794 was undoubtedly passed for that purpose." For what purpose?—To protect the Sabbath as of divine origin. Idleness always produces vice, and did the framers of that law think enforced idleness would prevent it? If France, under the reign of revolution, tried it. They enforced a civil Sabbath, a rest day, every tenth day, and the alternation would place our our makers in the position assumed by France—enforcing a rest day devoid of religion. Was ever presented?—History teaches, and yet we should as a community of old and wickedness obtained such glaring proportions. And those civil Sabbaths agreements all are well. All legal results for pure idleness was never productive of good. Religious sentiment among the people is the only guard against vice; and we industriously our fathers passed that bill, to protect the sacred and religious character of the day.

But what say our judges? All but three, speaking authoritatively for the bench, declare their allegiance to the divinely appointed institution. Judge Finlayson, of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in the Bramhall *vs.* Van Campan: "The Sabbath, laws of the the States can have no other object than the enforcement of the fourth of God's commandments." Judge Calwell, of the Supreme Court of Texas, in Elsner *vs.* Suss, says: "The object of the Sabbath law islaws was to forbid or secular employment on the Sabbath not exempted in the statute. The disregard of the Sabbath, the refusal to regard it as a religious day, is a refusal to recognize it as a day exalted to holy purposes, constitute the offense." The Supreme Court of Alabama says (Richmond *vs.* Seaman *v.* "We certainly do not think the design of the legislation in the passage of the act can be in doubt. It was evidently to promote morality and advance the interests of religion." Judge Stroop says: "Christianity is a religion; its Sabbath, would be a civil institution. The very purpose of Sabbath laws, as declared by our Eastern courts, and as shown by our authorities, was that the people may devote the day to rest, and the worship of God." New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and other Supreme Courts, gave similar decisions.

Judge Ball illustrates: "The Sabbath is to become a mere rest day. Its sole mission is to inculcate a temporary weekly cessation from toil, but it adds not to that any religious obligation." By what authority is the profanation deemed a penal offense? Why may not the poor man take the railway or street car to the country, and enjoy a few hours' communion with nature and with nature's God? If physical health to the great consideration, why compel him to remain in an immune sanctuary in with a greater of punishment and dishonor? If his intellectual development be sought, why close library, garden, and museum? Too often his enforced idleness leads him to crime, and of his removal rest becomes a distortion. The statistics of crime in New York City show more crime for Saturday night and Sabbath than for all the rest of the week. London, which is Sabbath laws, is one of the wickedest cities in the world. The famous Doctor Guthrie says to have in their country quiet and sober a Sabbath than rest-enforcing Edinburgh.

What does this say for enforced idleness on the irreligious? Surely it cannot be claimed that its intellectual, its economic religion, or morality.

Sabbath observance can mean nothing but the strict keeping of the Sabbath, in accordance with both letter and spirit of that by which the Sabbath is kept. It can no more be observed by civil manner, i. e., by natural constraint from toil, than the Lord's supper can be observed by a glutinous feast.

It has been claimed that the law can and does enforce the observance of the Sabbath as a civil institution. Its application is this to this claim I will prove that:—

1. The Sabbath is a purely religious institution, recognized and enforced as such.

2. It is not the prerogative of civil government to enforce observance of religious institutions.

3. Such enforcement fails to secure observance; but an observance acceptable to God.

4. Christianity repudiates the use of force in the observance of religious institutions.

5. Such enforcement is religious persecution.

6. Such enforcement in religious persecution, upon the proof of these propositions, it inevitably follows that the civil observance of the Sabbath should not be enforced by civil law.

and think to yield the universe by human power, as to catalogue the annual illustration of the Sabbath, and break the glorious outbursting of the moral government of God, and yet try to institute religious or morality on the seventh.

True, Christ has said, "The Sabbath was made for man." So were baptism and the Lord's supper. The object of the Founder of the Sabbath was man's spiritual and religious welfare. Himself hath declared it. He favored through his object by the observing strictness of their observance, making the Sabbath a harbinger; Christ's words were to correct that abuse, and make the twisted be twisted into any other meaning. The Sabbath is for man, and for himself, for he has an extra, but that he might sin for the glory of God; for that is the chief end of man.

The combined voices of history, law, and Holy Writ present this same of proof without a flaw, that the Sabbath is the holy day of God, and is purely religious in its origin, law, and observance, and it cannot be anything else. Our Congress has declared it: *as our courts assuredly affirm as a solemn.* Its statute authority is clearly taught in the Scriptures; but that he is not our the king, and that the never bring reign over in its greater construction, in the sense contemplated in Abraham's rewards, is just as plainly declared. By comparing the promise to Abraham (Gen. 17), and parallel texts with Romans 4:13, we learn that this will soon be presented as it is. Abraham or for ever and to God. 2:21 it is plainly declared that Christ is that need to whom the promise was made, and through whom it will be fulfilled. That the promise was not fulfilled in Abraham we are told by both Stinglear and Paul. The former clauses (Acts 7:2) that "the Lord gave him [Abraham] none inheritance in it, not so much as to set his foot on;" and Hebrews 11:13,39, it is plainly stated that Abraham "died in faith, not *having received the promises.*"

But this is all in the plan of God. The promise has not failed. The time for its realization has not yet come. The Saviour Himself saw it while looking and prepared a sacrifice for sin—likened himself to a nobleman going "into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return." Luke 19:12-27. And he plainly declared that "When the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." Matt. 25:31. In Isaiah, the Father Saviour gave him the promise that by the second coming, and by the coming of the earth for a possession, that he would establish them with a rod of iron, and dashes them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Then shall the governments be upon his shoulders; and "of the increase of his government there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever," and "THE ZEAL

OF THE LORD OF HOSTS WILL PERFORM THIS."

The plan of redemption as revealed in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is wonderfully comprehensive; it includes not only man but that which was a beginning in the cross for a permanence, namely, the earth as it was when God declared that it was "'very' good." Of Christ the Apostle has said: "All things, and those of the flock, strengthened of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah 4:8.

1. The first dominion was that of course to increase turned, for it is the dominion given to the first Adam whom God said to him: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moved upon the earth." Gen. 1:28. This dominion Adam administered to Satan when he himself. Yielded to temptation, and so Satan became the ruler of this earth, and claims it. Says the apostle, "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to be, whom ye obey?" But God has made it possible for every man to escape from the grasp of Satan and become not merely a servant of God, but of lordship inheritance of Christ. "He came into his own, and his own received him not. But unto as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." John 1:11, 12.

But this article must be voluntary as the part of those who are become of that. God leaves each man free to choose his master, to do to what to do to continue in the servitude of Satan; for God wants, and will have, *only willing and truly loyal subjects.* The time is coming, however, when the kingdom will be given to Christ, by the Father, and the same hand that redeemed the earth from the curse, just as by lasting death for every man so righteous at the finding of every estate to be retrieved from the power of the grave, shall also redeem the earth and deliver those men from the power of the grave, from those with the right to enter their risen bodies, now with their risen bodies, as he is in them. Edenic beauty, and so it is in Malachi the Saviour is to become to him, you find new heavens and a new earth. Peter says, "Wherefore establishing righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13. The promise of the new earth to the Lord's, they are to be for them to fulfill it in his law as plain. Neither is it his plan to be violated. As Mrs. Leavitt says, he could do what he chose. As there it is to in his his plan. Neither is it his plan to be broken upon it in the old by the same set that the Lord of hosts will perform all this; he will establish his kingdom and its matter to in which to do God as well as all of that is in that divine appointment prepared for man from the foundation of the world, but for a time usurped by Satan, and finally to be wrested from him by the Lord Jesus Christ, whose right it is, forever, ever for ever and ever.
