A PETITION, demanding the enforcement of the State Sunday laws in Portland, Oregon, and signed by 2,000 voters of the city has been presented to the common council of Portland. The spokesman for the committee of citizens and clergymen of all denominations was Archbishop Gross of the Roman Catholic Church. Three Catholic Fathers were present and five clergymen of Protestant denominations.

Such incidents as this mark the beginning of the fusion of Protestants and Roman Catholics for the acceptance and enforcement of a political Christianity.
