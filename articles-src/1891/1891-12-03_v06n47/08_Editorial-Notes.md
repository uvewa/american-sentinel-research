No human government has a right to legislate on religious questions.

At the Congress of the Protestant Episcopal Church, just held in Washington, D. C., Ex-Senator Edmunds said, "The Church, in its true interest, and in the interest and for its proper function as its independence of the State, as the State is in its true interest and for its proper function as its independence from, and independent of, any church."

It seems to be the fate of all those Sunday reformers to look upon the shield of truth from the reverse side, and so the *Northwestern* after planting its consent for the right figures on a reasonable argument for the enforcement of the views of that religion upon the rest of the world, even compels the conviction. "The decision to be made within the next year will encourage many an honest friend of reform, who may cast the voice which will turn human progress backward must answer during generations to come." If the intended significance of these words be reversed, they are truth; for those who cast their voices in favor of enforcing religious observances at the World's Fair, or elsewhere, will turn the wheels of human progress far backward; and the decision as to the casting of their voice on this question must soon be made by all, both individually and collectively. It is indeed the principle of allegiance to man or to God, and it is true that the future history of each human being depends on his decision as to which master he will choose to serve.

*The Daily Telegraph*, of London, England, is opposing the closing to a discussion of the Sunday question. The Secretary of the "Worshippers' Lord's Day Rest Association" of England, has been contributing articles. The Church of England papers in their reports disapprove the discussion as something upon which the churches dare not properly have two positions. And the churches feel that otherwise it is, that, in their opinion, any expression of views adverse to those held by the Church on this question should not be tolerated. Such a feeling is naturally to be expected from an established church, yet how does it differ from the Burns Pure National Reform sentiments of this country?

This case of King, although the most prominent, is not by any means the only instance of similar religious persecution in the United States during the last few years. Such cases can now be counted by the score. Why is it that the religious given is silent as regards them? Why is it that the speakers of the party of religious legislation have so belittled them, in the very slight months which they have make? It is because they are not yet ready to accept quietly, and ascertain, the mantle of John Cotton, Cotton Mather and their comforts in the enforcement of religion belief by law. Soon the time will come when they will discover that they are no longer humble and inquisitive, and then they will speak, but to favor and uphold, not condemn, the most strenuous attempts to govern men's thoughts by law and regulate their mode of worship by legislation.

The *Northwestern Christian Advocate* argues, in an editorial on "Methodism and the Fair," that because the Methodist membership of the world is some as not a half millions, and the Methodist-four hundred million nearly twenty-six and a half million more, therefore the voice of the Methodist Church the World's Fair should be heard, and by inference, of course, the decree in that regard followed.

The Sunday evening concerts of the Germania Singing Society of Newark, New Jersey, has aroused the bitter opposition of the Law and Order League of that city. The League has been persistent and in its efforts to obtain police interference to close the concerts. Newark correspondence of Sunday, November 15, says:—

The Germania Singing Society is celebrating its anniversary this week, and the activity of the Law and Order League devotees to more active efforts of a failure to enforce the decision to remain in the movement is in progress in the heart of the city, and within sound of their operations.

Here is an expression which marks the present position of the religious legislation. What a Law and Order League has to do with sacrifice? The maintenance of law and order is purely a civil affair, while worship is the sin of its nature and thereof things. Is the Law and Order League of Newark civil and constitutional institution? If civil why does it attempt jurisdiction on the aim of sacrifice of the civil government, in which law is the police and the civil court and nothing more?

The *Signs of the Times* has returned to its former sixteen-page size, and marks the advent by appearing with an enlarged head, and upon a lighter tinted paper; also with an increased length of column, which adds to the symmetry of the paper. Altogether, the changes made, while retaining the distinctive features of the *Signs*, have beautified and brightened the face of an old friend more than ever. Still, its superior attractiveness will not hinder those who have become accustomed to the satisfaction of finding a double portion of matter equal in value and importance to that which the *Signs* has always furnished its readers. As a missionary journal which presents the analytical truth of the Bible, with vigor, earnestness, and fidelity, it is unrivaled; in its accuracy of perception as to the application of these truths to the living principles which must govern humanity, in the social, legal, moral its relations, it has not even a competitor among the religious publications of the day.

TRUTH is often disagreeable because it causes its hearers to reform. Yet science demands the test and the truth itself stands second to none.
