We have accepted with pleasure the contributions to compulsory Sunday laws, and a number of other correspondents' discussions with whatever a fair logical outcome of the opinions and positions expressed by it. The *Independent* this cause is in nearly all similar cases, has almost every imaginable reason for its position, was in supporting and determining and controlling one course alone.

But now confessory as to what the denominational or compulsory Sunday laws would yield, is but to yield the certainty of what they are doing, and what they declare they desire and propose to do. Speaking of a constitutional amendment call the result, Rev. W. J. Coleman says:—

"That the churches would agree to the combination this man was naturally satisfied with the constitution as in the course they would steer toward it as it recognized the Lord Jesus Christ. . . . To be perfectly sure, I believe the existence of a Christian world would deliberate would fairly approach."

District Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster says, when discussing the duties of institutions according to the National Reformers:—

"by providing here the Church funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work, and of providing compulsory religious education."

National Reformers declare that they expect the time to come when they will "draw their salaries from the treasury," the same as Government officials.

Rev. J. M. Foster declares that the National Reform requires of the national "a constitutional provision of moral and religious qualifications for their offices."

The sum of the matter then, is that National reform and the union of Church and State are synonymous terms. National Reformers demand that the Government shall not be based as Thomas Jefferson vigorously put it, "upon the consent of the governed," but upon religion; and they demand to be made the exponents of that religion; and to be paid out of the public treasury for their services; and that all who do not accept their expositions or true, shall be defrocked, denied, practically enslaved, robbed of the rights and citizenship which they now possess.

All this is in such a movement because it is its nature, and that it is an assumption. National reform—disfranchising over half the Nation's citizens, and enthroning as absolute teachers and rulers, a set of men, who set up to be called the name of God, but deny having received any authority from him to use it. A class of men who claim to be laboring to get men into heaven, but manifested more desire to get them out of earth and to possess and to rule it themselves. Those men who denominate themselves their own uplifting and the corresponding debasement of all who differ from them, information, arrogate to themselves the following privileges. The sole and unquestionable power of determining what is true religion; the sole authority to prescribe that religion; the sole power to bind the heavens by with denomination and persecution; the right to exclaim all men who differ from both from the highest privileges, honors, and blessings, of the land and also from the blessedness of heaven; the right to demand pay from the public treasury for having the immanent effrontery to make and all these assumptions.

The logical outcome of this movement is the union of Church and State, which must bring with it disfranchisement, loss of liberty, persecution, all the long train of evils which naturally follow in the wake of an attempt to do for God what he has never attempted to do for himself and never authorized to be done.

With this logical outcome in view we have protested, and shall continue to protest, against that which threatens to destroy our liberties and dishearten and—
