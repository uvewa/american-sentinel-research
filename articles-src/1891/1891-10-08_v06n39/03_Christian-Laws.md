# "Christian Laws."

Those who are laboring for the compulsory observance of Sunday in this country have a great deal to say about "Christian laws." Now for a law to be Christian it must be made *and enforced* in accordance with the example and teaching of our Saviour. But notwithstanding all the talk so much about "Christian laws," "Christian institutions," and "Christian usages," there is the greatest reluctance to measure the laws by their own National Reform proponents that govern the people of this Nation and the government they administer. There is not the slightest desire to practice Christianity in the way they are to be enforced.

Why did not our Saviour when he began his earthly ministry put himself in law-making authorities of his time and thus compel those exact certain religious laws that would place Christianity upon an "unassailable basis" that is the fundamental law of the land? Why did he not spend his time in circulating petitions and going to a petition for the better observance of God's holy day of rest? Why did he not appeal to the leading men of the Nation's positions in his work that his might have the influence of their charters in forwarding his cause in the earth? Why did he not appeal for improved facilities for Sabbath teaching, or some other act of immorality, by some old, forgotten law he found?

There can be but one answer to these questions. He was not of our Godless way of working. He came to do the will of God; and sent him, and that was a work of love, mercy, and long suffering. The voluntary willing heart and tongue of the civil law help to establish his kingdom, he plainly declares "My kingdom is not of this world." He also tells us that the Prince of this world and nothing in him. Instead of petitioning earthly courts for aid, his petition ascended to the King of Kings. In the long and silent hours of night he poured out his soul before his Father and was taught he only help of a meek and humble life to their only sources of imitation.

[page 308] Instead of trying to attach to his work "Christian names," "in any way that went not with them the name of Christ. Call them barbarians, un-Christian, unholy, devilish. Strip from the ravenous band of religious intolerance the cloking of the show he has devised, and let him appear in his true character, and a sensible liberty loving people will quickly consign him to his merited oblivion.

"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Matt. 7:18.
