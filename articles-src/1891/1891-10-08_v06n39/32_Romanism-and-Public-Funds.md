COMMENTING upon the growth of Romanism in the United States, the *Christian at Work* says:—

We have the present; but the future must also be assured. This can only be done by exercising a sleepless guardianship over the Nation's liberties, and especially by seeing to it that the institutions of the country are preserved in all their integrity against assaults from any and every quarter. This has not always been done; it is not done to-day. For, are not the people taxed to support sectarian schools? and during the present year will not four hundred thousand dollars be raised by taxation to be expended in the propagation of Romanism among the Indians? This monstrous iniquity must cease, and so must that other form of abuse which devotes a lesser sum to the support of schools for the diffusion of sectarian religion among the Indians.

"That other form of abuse" is not really another, but the same form. Money is paid by the Government to some Protestant schools precisely as it is paid to the Catholic schools; and it is just as much of an abuse in the one case as in the other. It should all stop.
