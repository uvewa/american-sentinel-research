## Specific Uncertainties

### Article #6 (An Injustice)
- **Author attribution:** Article is signed "SANFORD O. LANE" - this is a new author initial pattern (SOL) not in the known authors list
- **Confidence:** HIGH - full name is given explicitly
- **Note:** Attribution is "reprint" from "Sabbath Recorder, Seventh-day Baptist" but the byline suggests Lane wrote the commentary, not just the quoted material

### Article #9 (National Reform and Christianity)
- **Author attribution:** Signed "FRANK HOPE" (initials: FH)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - matches known author Francis Hope/Frank Hope from memory
- **Note:** Previously seen variant spellings noted in memory

### Page 7-8 (Advertisements)
- **Decision:** All advertisements skipped per instructions
- Items skipped include: Good Health magazine ad, "Is the Papacy in Prophecy" book ad, Views of National Reform tract package, The Christian's Secret book ad, Safety Pencil Pocket ad, Romanism and Civil Liberty ad, Pacific Health Journal ad, Siberia and the Nihilists ad, Arguments on the Breckinridge Sunday Bill ad, Evening Line steamers ad, Pensions ad, Illustrated Curiosity List ad

### Page 8 (Editorial Notes)
- All short editorial notes on page 8 were separated into individual article files per instructions
- Each received its own YAML frontmatter and categorization

## Second Pass Review
- Completed focused review of all article boundaries
- Verified author attributions against article endings
- Confirmed reprints by checking for "—*Source*" patterns
- All uncertainties resolved to HIGH or MEDIUM confidence
