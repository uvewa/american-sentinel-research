# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, October 8, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 39)

## General Note

This issue presented extreme OCR difficulty. The scan images are of moderate quality, but the text is very small and dense across 3-column pages. Many passages, especially block quotes and long paragraphs in the lead article, proved very challenging to read accurately. A significant number of passages below have LOW confidence and will require verification against the original document.

## Summary

This issue presented the most significant OCR challenges encountered so far. The combination of small text, dense 3-column layout, and moderate scan quality resulted in many passages with LOW confidence. **It is strongly recommended that every article in this issue be verified against the original printed document.** The lead article ("What Is Public Opinion in Tennessee?") and the block quotes throughout are especially in need of verification.
