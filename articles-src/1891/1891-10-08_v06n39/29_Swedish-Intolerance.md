THE *Daily Report*, of San Francisco, has the following, which it characterizes as "religious intolerance":—

Stockholm, July 30—The authorities have given notice to the Roman Catholic clergy that the law against making converts will be strictly enforced. The law is said to have the general approval of the people, especially in the interior of Sweden, where religious prejudice is very strong.

"This," says another California paper, "is religious intolerance, but Roman Catholics ought not to complain. The action is just such a one as they would have taken toward any other church if in their power to do so, judging from their past." This is all true, but it furnishes no excuse whatever for the intolerance of the Swedish Government.
