# Baptists Persecuted in Russia.

It seems very strange to think that men are living in the days of persecution, but it is nevertheless true. Not only are the Jews hated in Germany, persecuted and driven out of Russia, turned back on account of poverty from America, refused a shelter in the Holy Land, but Christians are being persecuted, very bitterly too.

A short time since, the Orthodox Greek Church authorities held a meeting in which the disposition of Baptist and others not conforming to the Greek Church was considered. The matter was warmly debated. One hundred and fifty delegates from forty-six epiquaries were assembled in this conference, "to consider the lessening growth of Protestant sects among the orthodox, and to devise measures for suppressing them." Baptists were especially [page 309] singled out for censure in the debate; there have been doing a colporteur work which has resulted in the winning of a great many to a true faith in Christ.

The Protestant Christians of Russia are a simple-hearted folk, industrious, thrifty and unimpeachable. The Holy Spirit came upon the marsh has demonstrated to get rid of the Protestants by making them as much too unpleasant for them. All are to be hunted over by the leader scone of the police. Their properties are to be suspiciously marked, so that they shall be everywhere known as heretics. They will not be permitted to rent land, nor to work with orthodox workmen, nor to hold land at all. They will be thus impoverished and all their places, their lands and places, and be sent out penalties to find them, if they can, in some other land. The plan is already in operation, and our brethren are suffering from prison and police. And this is the nineteenth century, and this is done in the name of Christ! But the Lord standeth high. His eye is the apple of his eye. If Russia would but listen to the voice of history she might now be more often, under the providence of God, the premiums have paid dearly for their whipping God holds responsible.
