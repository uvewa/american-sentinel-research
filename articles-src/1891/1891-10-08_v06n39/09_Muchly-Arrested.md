# "Muchly Arrested."

Under the above the Alliance *Constitution* of September 4, contained the following:—

Mr. M. A. Bropiles and W. J. A. Lompe, the latter of whom is Superintendents of the Marine and Fisheries Commission, were arrested together on the charge of maintenance, yesterday. Both of these gentlemen are Seventh-day Adventists, and both keep Saturday, and have a sufficient religious reason to believe that Trammen read in the capacity of master at "arms" running freight trains through Goshen county for years.

Both of these men declare they were ready to stand their trial, when they were arrested by the committee who had similar charges against them. But further, they have a sufficient reason for saying that they can see no reason why they may see fit to observe these occasions. Their arrests are made the sooner honest and sensible people of the whole community will realize that back of this whole question of Sunday observance lies something more than a desire for rest.

The arrests were postponed, and yesterday both were arrested and released on their own recognizance, and a postponement for a full week was asked for and allowed.
