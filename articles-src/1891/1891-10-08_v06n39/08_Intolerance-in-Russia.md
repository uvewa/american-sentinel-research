The outside world can scarcely have any idea of the extent to which religious intolerance is carried in the Russian code of laws. There is scarcely any more heinous crime than openly disagreeing with the Greek Church, and it does not matter whether the dissenter be a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, Mohammedan, or atheist. All are alike hateful. For example, the criminal code, Article 196, expressly provides that any one found guilty of propagating the views of heretical or dissenting bodies, or of circulating the doctrines of any new sect dangerous to orthodoxy, will be punished with the forfeiture of all rights, and banished from European Russia to Transcaucasia, from the Stavropol Government or from Transcaucasia to Siberia, and from Siberia to the most remote regions of that country. The same punishments will be meted out to dissenters who, under the influence of their fanaticism, use insulting terms about the Orthodox Church or orthodox clergy.

A dissenter who publicly makes known his false doctrines to the orthodox, with a view to their joining his sect, even though his actions should not result in any accession from the Orthodox Church, will be punished most severely.

Suppose a dissenter in Russia persuades, directly or indirectly, some one to abandon the Greek Church. The code, Article 184, provides that for the "crime" of perverting any one, either by means of temptations or otherwise, from the Christian faith to Islamism, Judaism, or other non-Christian faith, the guilty person will be sentenced to loss of all civil and personal rights, and to penal servitude from eight to ten years. For inducing any one to leave the Orthodox faith for another Christian denomination, the punishment is the loss of all personal rights and privileges, and banishment to Siberia. To such penalty Protestant or Catholic is liable if ever he ventures to speak of his religious faith. If it can be proven that he has thus spoken, it will be easy to find some one to declare that some one else has been by this means persuaded to forsake the Orthodox faith.—Truth Seeker.
