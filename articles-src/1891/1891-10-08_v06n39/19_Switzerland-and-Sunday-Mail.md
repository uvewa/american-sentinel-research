"SWITZERLAND," says the Christian at Work, "has not yet reached the ideal Sunday observance so far as the administration of the Post-office is concerned. Just now she is at work experimentally, and in this way. The authorities have determined to test the desire of the citizens for Sunday mail delivery, and they do this by preparing 'Sunday' stamps for the use of those who do not desire the mail delivered on Sunday. All letters bearing the other stamps will be delivered Sunday, delivery on that day being general in Geneva, Basle, and other cities."
