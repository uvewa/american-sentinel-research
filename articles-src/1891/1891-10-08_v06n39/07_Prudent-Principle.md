# Prudent Principle.

THERE are two methods of pleading in pleading from principles. There is the plead from principles before legal courts and courts of justice; courts who chose their principals first give from the standpoint of right and justice. They give all attention to the justice or injustice of an act, as to right, and, because it may have been looked at thus by others, but interest is set in the nature of things. This kind of pleading is much the better, because the statutes before which the trial is now before likely to be uniform; while the former often reasons without reasons, and in a muddled manner of reasoning.

Decisions of courts may be wrong, and courts often themselves find their positions upon the same different, different positions upon the same standing, and from each courts reversing the decision of another. But right is right and justice is justice; and these two, right and justice are the same in all ages and in all courts.

There is the same difference between these two methods of pleading that there is between the spirit of the crusades and the teaching of the articles. The spirit which appealed to, in reason of Christ, is Christianity; they plead for the motions and with constrained reason.

A great deal of the latter kind of pleading is indulged in by those who seek to support Sunday laws and other religious features, in our Government. We are told that those things are recognized and practiced by other nations, and that they have been in vogue in our own land since the early days of colonial times. They seem to forget, as Dr. Adam Clarke says, "There are many ungodly opinions which [page 309] are more than a thousand years old."

"That other form of abuse" is not really another, but the same form. Money is paid by the Government to some Presbyterian schools precisely as it is paid to Catholic schools precisely as, it is just as much of an abuse in the one case as in the other. It should all stop.

This the same things are so certain and very unreasonable for some years it will be acted upon as every thing is being made subservient to Sunday and Sunday interest.

The most ardent believers in the importance of Sunday should rise up against this and oppose the passage of Sunday laws, and depend upon the influence of the Church to conserve the interest of Sunday. We would think, however, that the Quakers would recollect some of their early experience and that they would be more liberal in allowing their fellow citizens to have the same rights of conscience for which they suffered in the early history of our country.
