MR. CRAFTS, who engineered the fourteen-million-two-hundred-thousand-petition scheme some two years ago, now says that in his judgment "promiscuous petitions are as unreliable as the new census." He has probably been studying some of the evidence that THE SENTINEL has given of the utterly fraudulent character of many of the Sunday-law petitions. There is hope in his confession. "Open confession is good for the soul."
