# What Is Public Opinion in Tennessee?

Reference has been made in these columns to the decision of United States District Judge Hammond, in the case of King, appealed from the State of Tennessee. The leading papers of the country have also mentioned it, and have commented more or less upon it. Yet, both in these columns and by the papers referred to, that which has been said has been but little more than to mention the decision, with one or two points touched in it. From the nature of the case, however, and the principles involved, the decision is worthy of more extended notice than has been given it anywhere; and for these reasons, we propose a review of the decision. The first thing will be—

The Constitution of Tennessee, Article 1, Section 3, says:—

> That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience; that no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any minister against his consent; that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship.

R. M. King reads his Bible for himself, and believes it as he reads, as he has the unalienable, and the constitutional right to do. Accordingly, he believes, as the Word of God the commandment declares, that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. Holding this as an obligation which is owed to the Lord, he renders it to the Lord. Then, having rendered to God that which is God's, he exercises his God-given right to work the other six days of the week.

But there are some people in Tennessee [page 305] who choose to keep Sunday, as they have the right to do. Yet not content with the exercise of their own right to do this, they go about to compel everybody else to do it, whether he believes in it or not. Therefore, for working on his own premises on Sunday—hoeing corn, harrowing, etc.—King was prosecuted for constituting a nuisance at common law. He was convicted and fined and seventy-five dollars in costs.

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, and there the judgment was confirmed by a decision declaring Christianity to be the common law of Tennessee, and holding Sunday observance to be properly indictable and punishable as common law offenses. Such a decision is clearly a violation of that clause of the Constitution, which declares that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." For the Supreme Court has positively given preference by law to that religion, and to its mooted worship. By a writ of *habeas corpus,* the case was carried to the Circuit Court of the United States upon the plea that the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution was violated in that King was deprived of his liberty without due process of law; and also denied the equal protection of the laws.

In fact, the Judge plainly says, that if it were within his province to discuss that question, he would have no difficulty in thinking that King was wrongfully convicted, and that there is not found in the ruling of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that is a common-law warrant to make it one's folly on Sunday to mass in one's folds on Sunday. But, although he distinctly says that King was wrongfully convicted, and the State Court wrongly decided, where it concerned his conviction, yet, as it rests concurrently with the State Court to decide what is common law in the State, and as the State court has decided that under its common law, it does not belong to the United States Court to overrule the State decisions, and therefore he must decide that though the thing was wrongfully done, yet it is due process of law.

As the case is to be reviewed by a higher court, it is not necessary for us to spend any time now discussing the point of Judge Hammond's decision, nor of the State Court's decision either.

And even though we should take sides on the issue, we should still be disposed to differ from the conclusion reached by Judge Hammond.

Not so, however, with the other part of the decision. After having examined the point of law, he turns to a discussion of the principles which were involved in the arguments of counsel. And it is with the Judge's dictum, then set forth, that we have to do. And it is necessary to do this, quite largely too, because the position taken, and the propositions set forth, by the Judge, are so sweeping, and are so directly opposed to Christian and American principles, that it becomes the duty of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL to review the dictum in detail.

The Judge proposes to give his views as to what is the true measure of freedom of religious liberty, which is contemplated and guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee. He says that in the State of Tennessee certain religious belief is guaranteed by the [page 306] citizens, not in the sense argued here, that King, as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some man as a Jew, or yet another, as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the provisions of the law as to a matter which is essentially the matter of Sunday observance; but only in the practice of his own creed, which is quite a different thing from what this case is in its legal text. The assurance was even carried so far that he was given to understand that if complaints should be made, they would not issue in a warrant for his arrest.

That is to say, a man may belong to a sect; that sect may have a creed; they may practice their creed in their churches; that may not be disturbed in that practice. But at the same time, they must conform to the law as made in aid of the religion of other sects, who have control of legislation.

For instance, a man may be a Baptist. He may practice the precepts of the Baptist creed, but if the Methodists should have control of legislation, they could oblige the Baptists by law to conform to the process of the Methodist creed. One company of people might be Methodists, another Baptists, another Quakers, and so on; but if the Roman Catholics only had control of legislation, and should enact laws enforcing Roman Catholic doctrines and precepts, then the Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, etc., would all be obliged to conform to the Roman Catholic precepts, as by law required. And all these dissenting Protestants in the individual practice of their own creeds, none of those dissenting sects would be in any wise at liberty to disregard the laws made in aid of the religion of the Roman Catholic sect.

And such, according to Judge Hammond's views, is the freedom of religious belief guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee. That we have not misrepresented the Judge's meaning, is made clear by a further extract, as follows:—

> If a non-conformist of any kind about the church of unseen sect, and those assembled themselves required, every one in, simply in a certain community, he could not contravene to receive but such ecclesiastic ordinances as if he did not believe in the divine mysteries of that ceremony, and only into the divine mysteries of its process to the extent summoned.

This is precisely the measure of freedom of religious belief that was "guaranteed" or allowed under the Puritan theocracy of New England. The Congregational Church and Council of Legislators, in a blended Congregational-political dictation to the law, and required every one to conform to them. And every one was required to go to church. The Baptists and Quakers did not believe in the divine sanction of that ceremony. They therefore refused to comply. Their refusal, of course, was counted "dissonance." This dissonance was made criminal, because it was indeed a violation of the law. They were first fined, but they refused either to pay the fines, or to comply with the required conformities. They were then whipped, still they refused. They were then banished, and yet they refused, and the Quakers even returned to be banished. Then they were hanged, and yet when the others still lived held out firmly with the expelled communities. And they had no constitutional guaranty to protect them in their refusal.

And now says Judge Hammond, in Tennessee, "If a non-conformist of any kind refuses to comply with a certain ceremony required of every one by another sect which has control of legislation, there is no constitutional guaranty to protect him in his refusal." That is to say, according to this view, in Tennessee to-day, there is no constitutional guaranty of any freedom of religious belief beyond that which was allowed in New England two hundred and fifty years ago.

And thus would Judge Hammond throw open the field of legislation to whatever religious denomination may secure control, and justify such denominational control in the use of the power thus gained to [page 307] compel every one to conform to the religious ceremonies in which that sect believes, and which it practices. In fact, this very expression used contradicts what he calls established religion. The Judge uses the phrase, "if a non-conformist of any kind"—etc. The term "non-conformist" implies an established religion, which creates conformists, and whoever refuses conformity thereby becomes a "non-conformist." And in the view of his dictum, such non-conformist has no constitutional guaranty of freedom of religion.

The logical deduction from the two extracts which we have here presented is that not allowed conformity to religious denominations is just. These two extracts taken logically justify positively for any sect that can secure control of legislation.

Nor are we left to make this logical deduction ourselves only. The Judge himself plainly declares it is, as follows:—

> If the human impulse is to see as many days as one can have for rest from toil is not adequate, so let him consider well the experience of mankind. Sunday, one man, and many thousands, in work that will, without compliance with the commands of religion, or the results that to him was emphasizing his distaste for, or he disliked in, the practice of a class, distinctly the practice of his own creed.

And these views are set forth as the legislative expression of public opinion in Tennessee. That is to say, that public opinion in Tennessee upon the question of religious belief stands just where it stood in New England two hundred and fifty years ago. We are free to say, however, that we do not believe that such is public opinion in Tennessee. We are not ready, just yet, to confess that in Tennessee there has been no progress in this respect within the last two hundred and fifty years. That on the part of certain individuals there has been no such progress we freely admit; but that such is the state of public opinion in that State today, we do decidedly doubt. It is in order for the press of Tennessee to speak on more fully upon this subject for it is still in doubt. Whether it has it any does, as to whether Judge Hammond has correctly gauged public opinion, or whether he has mistaken his own views for the public opinion in that State, on the question of the constitutional freedom of religious belief.

Our readers may for themselves form an estimate of the correctness of Judge Hammond's views, so far as the Constitution of Tennessee itself is concerned, by comparing these extracts from that discussion, opened under the beginning of this article.

Now, from these extracts, which are a correct outline of the theory of the whole dictum, it is seen that in the whole range of the document, there is no recognition of any such thing as the individual freedom of religious belief, the individual right of conscience, but of "uniformism of freedom" only. The discussion of this point is reserved for our next issue.
