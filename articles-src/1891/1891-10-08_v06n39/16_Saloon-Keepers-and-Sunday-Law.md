The saloon keepers of Denison, Texas, have asked the City Council to pass an ordinance forbidding the sale of liquor between the hours of 9 A. M. and 4 P. M. on Sunday. The proposition is thus discussed by the Sunday Gazetteer:—

None of the councilmen discussed the saloon Sunday ordinance Thursday night from the right standpoint. The fact is, the city has no Sunday law. Now certain saloon men step up and ask for a special law that shall restrain them from keeping open between the hours of 9 A. M. and 4 P. M. This is ridiculous on its face, because they now keep open all day, without danger of interference on the part of the city officials. No one believes that these saloon men are asking in good faith for the enforcement of Sunday restrictions on their business. The real object of this movement is apparent. It is to do away with the enforcement of the State law between the hours of 9 and 4. That is, instead of wanting to be closed they went to be protected in keeping open. The Gazetteer does not believe such an ordinance would accomplish this result, but if it would there is no sense in making the law applicable only to saloons. If saloons are to be allowed to keep open, all business houses should have the same privilege. But the only consistent position for those opposed to special Sunday legislation to take, is to oppose the enactment of any Sunday laws whatever.
