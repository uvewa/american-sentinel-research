# Intoleranism in Russia.

This outside world can scarcely have any idea of the extent to which religious intolerance is carried in the Russian modes of laws. It scarcely any one imagines the extreme cruelty that comes of openly disagreeing with the Greek Church, and it does not matter whether the dissenter be a Catholic or a Methodist, a Baptist, a Mohammedan or a Jew.

All are alike hateful. For example, the criminal code, Article 196, expressly provides that any one found guilty of propagating the views of heretical or body holding bodies, or of circulating the doctrines of any new sect dangerous to orthodoxy, will be punished with the denial of all rights, and banished from the Stavoropol or some point of trans-European Russia to Transaucasia, from the Stavoropol or government of from Transcaucasia to Siberia, and from Siberia to that remote regions of that country.

The main punishments will be meted out to dissenters who, under the influence of their fanaticism, are insulting terms about the Orthodox Church and its regulations. A dissenter who publicly makes known his doctrines to the orthodox, with a view to their joining his sect, even though his actions should not result in any accession from the Orthodox Church, will be punished most severely.

Suppose a dissenter in Russia persuades, directly or indirectly, some one to abandon the Greek Church. The code, Article 196, provides that for the "crime" of perverting any one, either by means of temptation or otherwise, from the Christian faith to Islamism, Judaism, or other non-Christian faith, the guilty person will be sentenced to loss of all civil and personal rights, and to penal servitude from eight to ten years. For inducing any one to leave the Orthodox faith for another Christian denomination, the punishment is the loss of all personal rights and privileges, and banishment to Siberia. To such penalty [page 309]
