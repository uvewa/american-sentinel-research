# National Reform and Christianity.

National Reformers talk of enforcing their religious beliefs upon all of those among them. But how does that comport with Christianity? If they form a man to practice religious duties against his will, they so far destroy his liberty; but if they destroy liberty in an intellectual respect, they do injure human beings' moral responsibility, that is, they destroy his free moral agency. Consequently they would destroy the doctrines of grace, which is the infusion of divine aid to help man do that which he is convinced is right. But the doctrine of grace is the very foundation of Christianity, and if they destroy that, every other doctrine will go with it. Thus National Reform is destructive of Christianity.

God knows man perfectly at liberty to serve him or not. Says he, "Choose you this day whom you will serve," and even when a man chose not to serve him, but to make his whole life a sin of sin and iniquity, God does not take from him the power necessary to do that. But these same Reformers would compel a man to serve God in spite of God's will against man's it. Love is the link that binds God to man. Our love he forced? No. Can man be brought to Christ by threatening them with the rack or the stake? Compulsion would make man hate God even worse, and only those who were impelled by fear or by penalty could obey, and all such obedience is an abomination to God. The spirit of Christ is, "Come unto Me." The spirit of the National Reformers is, "if you don't we'll make you." The contrast is rather striking.
