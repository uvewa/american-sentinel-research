THE German Socialists seem to have borrowed an idea from the Sunday-law preachers of this country, namely, that Sunday laws will enable them the better to get the ear of the workingman. The *Christian Union* says:—

They [the Socialists] are well pleased to have labor forbidden on Sunday, in order that they may be the more free to make that day one of propaganda at workingmen's picnics, etc.

The Sunday-law preachers carry the plan a step further and propose to forbid both work and amusement, in order that the workingmen may be forced into the churches on Sunday.
