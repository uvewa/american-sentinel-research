# The Development of American Freedom.

Our secular form of government is an outgrowth of the great religious reformation of three centuries ago—the great Reformation. It was the independence of thought that was there stimulated and the religious tolerance that resulted that generated the religious tolerance that resulted in the free political system of the United States of America. Following Luther and the other Reformers, English philosophers and reformers developed social and political theories until the ultimate conception was the absolute freedom incorporated in our national Constitution. Notwithstanding this fact, there are those who speak of our system as the outgrowth of Gallican customs, etc. To recall the evidence that American history and American writers afford, John Adams wrote the following in his "Essay on the Principles of the Constitution" of Government of the United States of America:—

> The English nation, for its improvements in the theory of government, has, at least, more merit with the human race than any other among the moderns. The late most beautiful and liberal speculations of many writers, in various parts of Europe are manifestly derived from English [page 307] sources. Americans, too, could forever so acknowledge their obligations to English writers, or rather have as good a right to indulge a pride in the recollection of some to the inhabitants of the three kingdoms. The original plansmen of our country we re-examine; her continental press had been preceded, and her greatest theories have been established, or their intentions declared.

There have been three periods in the history of England, in which the principles of government have been anxiously discussed, which have produced publications, which at this day, if they are not wholly unknown, are most certainly little studied and frequently read almost as lost.

These three periods he refers to are (1) the time of the Reformation, producing writers whose works set men everywhere to thinking; (2) the Interregnum (Cromwellian period—the Commonwealth), producing Harrington, Milton, the *Vindiciae contra Tyrannos,* and a multitude of others;" and (3) the English Revolution, producing Sidney, Locke, Hoadley, Trenchard, Gordon, and many others.

In all these movements, the leading religious thoughts of the times played the leading part, and, in general, developed the governmental philosophy. Especially should we look to England, and, as Roger Williams in America. In fact, "secularism" is sometimes called "the Millenium right of schism," as by Professor Goerres, indicating its Christian origin. Madison also referred it to the teachings of Christ, through the Reformation, saying, "the rights of man and the entrance of Luther" opened up the agitation on the question of civil government and religion, making the world realize their duty to render unto Cæsar that which is Cæsar's, and unto God that which is God's.

The greatest statesmen of the times also made the claim that American ideas were the direct outgrowth of the grand ideas of the Reformation, as is seen in the lives and died. Burke, in his famous speech on "Conciliation with America," attributed the American spirit to the fact that the colonists were of English descent, and "whatever not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and on English principles." . . . Some in Parliament even went so far as to call Washington's forces, "our army," and his soldiers "the soldiers of the colonies," "our principals."

Francis Lieber, in his work, "On Civil Liberty and Self-Government," (London, 1853, page 314), says:—

> Genuine Anglien liberty is the great dividend Anglien liberty [constitutionalism] of true Christian liberty. It is founded upon the church guarantees, and self government of the Anglien church; the common law; self taxation; the fair treatment of the law; the publicity, the estimates to carry to the Legislature, and whatever of the less momentous, form part and parcel of that which, in its totality, constitutes the Anglican principles, which are peculiar to ourselves and which, therefore, are not may our American institutions, however they may be misjusted up, perhaps, under super basis. Republican federalism, stricter separation of the State from the Church, greater equality and democratization of American right to the citizen, and a more popular or democratic cast of the government.

These last features, however, are but the logical application of the principles of the English theory.

Mr. Eben Greenough Scott, after examining up the obscure steps of the liberty and enlightenment following the great Reformation, declares in his work, "The Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America," says:—

> The United States of America, then, are one of that mighty force, which, bounding into existence through the closet of the new philosophy of the new state in its progress of time.

Hence, the present agitators for established religion are simply the men who are carrying on the work of the Reformation.
