SEPTEMBER 20, an effort was made to compel the Chinese of this city to keep Sunday. The attempt was only partially successful, however. The front doors of business and gambling houses were, it is said, closed in most cases, but side doors were open and a good deal of business done. According to the *Morning Journal*, of the 21st ult., the Chinese merchants say that they are threatened with bankruptcy if they are compelled to close on Sunday. "They say that if they are compelled to observe a Sabbath, they will observe three days of the month other than Sunday, for as they are worshipers of Buddha they will keep the days sacred to him. They claim that under the laws they have as much right to keep the Buddhistic sacred days and do business on Sunday, as other people have to keep Sunday and work on Buddhistic holy days."
