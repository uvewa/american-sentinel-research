There are two methods of pleading in courts,—pleading from precedent and pleading from principle. Lawyers who plead from precedent refer to decisions of judges and of courts; those who plead from principle plead from the standpoint of right and justice. They call attention to the justice or injustice of an act, and call it such, not because it may have been looked at thus by others, but because it is so in the nature of things. The latter style of pleading is much the better, because it has reason behind it, and is more likely to be uniform; while the former often proceeds without reason, and is a capricious guide.

Decisions of courts may be wrong, and often are, as is evident from their rendering different decisions upon the same question, and from one court's reversing the decision of another. But right is right the world over. The principles of truth and justice are the same in all ages and in all climes.

There is the same difference between these two methods of pleading that there was between the teaching of Christ and the teaching of the scribes. He spoke that which appealed to reason, and with authority; they plead for the customs and traditions of the fathers, however much they contradicted reason.

A great deal of the latter kind of pleading is indulged in by those who seek to support Sunday laws and other religious features, in our Government. We are told that these things are recognized and practiced by other nations, and that they have been in vogue in our own land since the early days of colonial times. They seem to forget, as Dr. Adam Clarke says, "There are many ungodly opinions which are more than a thousand years old."

They reason like the Spanish muleteers, who, when some one suggested that it would be as well for them to fill both sides of their panniers with fruit instead of loading one with stones, and thus save a trip up and down the mountains, read that there was no telling what might happen should they depart from the customs of their forefathers.

But such reasoning cannot commend itself to sensible, thinking people. If Sunday laws, Government chaplains, and religious teaching in the public schools, are right, they are right because in the nature of things it is so, and not because they have been in existence and carried on for hundreds of years. But the fact that precedent rather than principle, is appealed to in pleading for their continued existence, is presumptive proof at least that there is nothing better in their favor. For my part, I say, Let us stand on principle.—W. A. C., in Home Missionary.
