It is often stated as a reproach that "California is the only State in the Union without a Sunday law." That is one way of looking at it; another way is that "California is the only State in the Union that maintains the original idea of civil and religious liberty guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. It is the only State in the Union whose laws acknowledge that one man has as good a right not to rest on Sunday as another has to rest. It is, therefore, the only State in the Union where all citizens are on an equality before the law. It is the only State in the Union where no one class can dictate what other classes shall not do on a certain day of the week. It is the only State in the Union where the law does not encourage the making of hypocrites on Sunday, by making them seem to have reverence for something which they do not reverence." However, as a matter of fact, California has not this proud distinction; Wyoming and Idaho are also without Sunday laws.
