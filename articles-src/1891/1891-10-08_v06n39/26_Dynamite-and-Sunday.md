THE power of the State has long been invoked in behalf of Sunday-keeping, but for various reasons it has been impotent to secure the results desired by some; and so, out in Indiana, resort has been had to more powerful means, as related in the following dispatch, which we take from the *Daily News*, of Chicago:—

MUNCIE, Indiana, Sept. 17—Eaton park is the name of a summer resort on the Missinewa River at Eaton, in the northern part of this county, and it is much frequented by excursionists on Sunday. The church people in that vicinity objected to this Sabbath desecration, and on several occasions the park property has been damaged. The boating surface is made by a large dam across the river, and a small steamer plies thereon, besides a number of row-boats. Unsuccessful efforts have been made to destroy the dam by fire and quicksilver.

Yesterday two large charges of dynamite were exploded in rapid succession, completely demolishing the dam and hurling large stones and timbers long distances away. Neighboring windows were shattered and hundreds of people were badly frightened. One piece of timber fell upon the roof of John Snyder's residence crushing it in.

This incident serves to illustrate the spirit of the Sunday-law movement: it stops at nothing to compass its ends.
