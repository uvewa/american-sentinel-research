"To get the Nation right as to the Sabbath," says Mr. Crafts, in Sabbath Reform, "we must first get the Church right, and to get the Church right, involves getting the individual Christian to amend his own course in this matter." Why then does not Mr. Crafts begin with the individual Christian instead of asking the State to pass and enforce laws compelling all to keep Sunday? He is condemned out of his own mouth.
