Those who are laboring for the compulsory observance of Sunday in this country have a great deal to say about "Christian laws." Now laws to be Christian must be made and enforced in accordance with the example and teaching of our Saviour. But notwithstanding so much is said about "Christian laws," "Christian institutions," and "Christian usages," there is the greatest difference between the laws which these National Reformers propose shall govern the people of this Nation and the precepts of Jesus Christ. There is not the slightest similarity in either the laws or in the way they are to be enforced.

Why did not our Saviour when he began his earthly ministry appeal to the law-making authorities of Rome to have them enact certain religious laws that would place Christianity upon an "undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land"? Why did he not spend several years of his life in securing signers to a petition for the better observance of God's holy day of rest? Why did he not appoint the leading men of the Nation to positions in his work that he might have the influence of their names in forwarding his cause in the earth? Why did he not have men imprisoned for Sabbath-breaking, or some other act of immorality, by some old, forgotten law which he found still on the statute books?

There can be but one answer to these questions; it was not our Saviour's way of working. He came to do the will of him who sent him, and that was a work of love, mercy, and long suffering. The Saviour instead of appealing to the civil law for help to establish his kingdom, plainly declares: "My kingdom is not of this world." He also tells us that the Prince of this world had nothing in him. Instead of petitioning earthly courts for aid, his petition ascended to the King of kings. In the long and silent hours of night he poured out his soul before his Father that men might be led by his meek and humble life to their only source of salvation.

Instead of trying to attach to his work men of rank and influence who gave no signs of true repentance, he ever chose those from the humbler, lowlier walks of life. Instead of seeking to load men with "burdens grievous to be borne" he sought to break every yoke and "let the oppressed go free." He condemned the useless and unjust traditions that then existed in regard to Sabbath-keeping, and declared it was lawful to do good on the Sabbath day. "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." It was intended as a day of rest and liberty, not a day of servitude and bondage.

The eternal character of God does not change. He is the same yesterday, today, and forevermore. His work is just the same now as it was when the divine Teacher walked our earth in human form. His faithful followers will now work just as he labored then. "The disciple is not above his Lord."

Then why call laws compelling men to perform any religious act, "Christian laws?" Christ never made such laws. His followers never advocated them. They are contrary to the nature of the kingdom of God, and not in accord with the life and motives of Jesus Christ. Said the Saviour to the young lawyer: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first great commandment, and the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." So on these two principles the kingdom of Christ is established. Now upon which of the two could a law be hung that would cast a man into prison or fine him because he chose to work on the first day of the week?

If a man loves God with all his heart, he will respect his fellow-man, the workmanship and image of God. He will let God judge the creatures he has made, with his own righteous judgments, and in his own good time. If a man loves his neighbor as he loves himself he will respect his neighbor's person, his goods, and his God-given rights, and above all, he will respect his neighbor's conscientious convictions of duty.

Religious legislation is not the result of the working of the spirit of the meek and lowly Saviour. It is the work of the powers of darkness; and a nation that enforces religious laws takes a backward step towards heathenism and idolatry, for when a man obeys a human-made religious law, he is made to worship the creature more than the Creator.

"By their fruit ye shall know them." And what has ever been the fruit of religious legislation? History's pages have been made crimson with the bloody stains of the fruit of religious intolerance. Never has the enforcement of religious laws brought one soul to Christ. They have not made one man better nor in any way turned the sinner from the error of his way.

Then call them not, "Christian laws," "Christian usages," nor in any way connect with them the name of Christ. Call them heathenish, un-Christian, unholy, devilish. Strip from the ravenous beast of religious intolerance the clothing of the sheep he has devoured, and let him appear in his true character, and a sensible liberty-loving people will quickly consign him to his merited doom.

"Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves." Matt. 7:15.
