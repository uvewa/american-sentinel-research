THE Chicago *Journal*, referring to the recent meeting of the World's Fair Commission, says:—

There are a number of things the Commission has not done at this meeting. It has not settled the Sunday-opening question, and it is understood that that matter will not be decided until the very last thing. The report of the local Board on the question is being purposely delayed because of that.

The impression seems to be growing that the result of the controversy will be a compromise, which however will be far from satisfactory to the American Sabbath Union, and the National Reformers generally.
