One article of Mr. Crafts's Rest-day Leagues which he is organizing everywhere, reads thus:—

ARTICLE V. Committees shall be appointed as follows: The Secretary shall appoint an investigating committee of four, known only to himself, the first of whom shall on the first week of each month, the second on the second, and so following, ascertain personally what violations—first, of the civil law; second, of higher laws of God—are in progress, and report fully in writing to the Secretary, who shall in turn inform the public authorities, so far as he can wisely do so, as to the violations of the State law, and the public as to these and all other wrongs related to the work of this organization. The Board shall appoint committees: 1—On prevention of the Sunday sales of liquors and tobacco. 2—On closing the post-office on the Sabbath by persuasion and petition. 3—On voluntary closing, by agreement or otherwise, of other places of labor and business. 4—On furnishing matter to the press and circulation of literature. 5—On public meetings. 6—On legislation. Also such other committees as may be necessary.

This secret inquisitorial committee of professional spies has been referred to before in these columns. We mention it again that none may forget the methods in vogue in carrying on the Sunday crusade.
