It seems very strange to think that we are living in the days of persecutions, but it is nevertheless true. Not only are the Jews hated in Germany, persecuted and driven out of Russia, turned back on account of poverty from America, refused a shelter in the Holy Land, but Christians are being persecuted, very bitterly too.

A short time since, the Orthodox Greek Church authorities held a meeting in which the disposition of Baptists and others not conforming to the Greek Church was considered. The matter was warmly debated. One hundred and fifty delegates from forty-one episcopates were assembled in this conference, "to consider the alarming growth of Protestant sects among the orthodox, and to devise measures for suppressing them." Baptists were especially singled out for censure in the debate; these have been doing a colporteur work which has resulted in the winning of a great many to a true faith in Christ.

The Protestant Christians of Russia are a simple-hearted folk, industrious, thrifty and enterprising. The Holy Synod (save the mark!) has determined to get rid of the Protestants by making life in Russia too unpleasant for them. All are to be handed over to the tender care of the police. Their passports are to be especially marked, so that they shall be everywhere known as heretics. They will not be permitted to rent land, nor to work with orthodox workmen, nor to find work at all. They will be thus impoverished and driven from place to place, and then be sent out penniless to find homes, if they can, in some other land. The plan is already in operation, and our brethren are suffering from priests and police. And this is the nineteenth century, and this is done in the name of Christ! But the Lord reigneth. His people are as the apple of his eye. If Russia would but listen to the voice of history she might see how often, under the providence of God, the persecutors have paid dearly for their whipping God's humble people.—Rev. Frank S. Dobbins, in the Examiner.
