# Quaker Intolerance.

Some months ago, a man by the name of F. A. Lasher moved from a point near Newburg, Oregon. Mr. Lasher was a believer in the seventh-day Sabbath. He knew that formerly the observance of Sunday was observed with any particular strictness in Oregon, and thought it was perfectly and perfectly proper for him to keep his store open on Sunday, if he wished, since that was no sacred day of the week. The town is composed largely of Quakers, and they have a sufficient religious equity that they can elect any seats that they may see fit to state of the villages. There are always some complaints in regard to pleasure and in a settlement to have this done to them. He went to the Mayor of the city and to the prosecuting attorney, to know what it was that they really meant, and to assure them that it was perfectly right for him to have his store open on that day since he had rested on the day before, which he regarded as the true Sabbath. The assurance was even carried so far that he was given to understand that if complaints should be made, they would not issue in a warrant for his arrest. He went on with his business, and in a little while, the threats became so strong that he went in the city, and his friends informed them that the sentiment was quite materially changed from what it was at first. The authorities were fearful that they would have to allow him to keep on Sunday, and told him if he wanted work he must go to some place. As Mr. Lasher has quite a real estate interest here, he cannot afford to leave, and the arrested street is not so much a zeal for the enforcement of Sunday as to some reason that is this giving to Lasher. And this is one of the difficulties that is always apparent in connection with Sunday laws. If all were agreed that Sunday is the Sabbath that Christians should [page 310] observe, these Sunday laws would not increase the religious observance of that day, and Sunday laws only serve as a pretext for those who are so inclined to prosecute their neighbors.

The most ardent believers in the importance of Sunday observance should rise up against this and oppose the passage of Sunday laws, and depend upon the influence of the Church to conserve the interest of Sunday. We would think, however, that the Quakers would recollect some of their early experience and that they would be more liberal in allowing their fellow citizens to have the same rights of conscience for which they suffered in the early history of our country.
