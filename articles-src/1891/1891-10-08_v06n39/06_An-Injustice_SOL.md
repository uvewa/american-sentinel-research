Under this head the Christian Patriot, published at Morristown, Tennessee, makes the following comments on the King case in that State:—

The Sunday laws are not at all religious. They have two objects: first, to secure every one his right to a weekly day of rest; and, secondly, to prevent the disturbance by worldly noise and business of those who rest on Sunday. Even infidels must admit that a weekly rest day is promotive of health and intelligence, and that it is just that those who wish to worship should be protected from annoyance.

Mr. Robert M. King, of West Tennessee, is a Seventh-day Adventist. We regret his errors. But if reason can not convince him of them, prosecution will not. He is a farmer. He rested on Saturday and plowed on Sunday. He was arrested and fined under the statute. He paid his fine and plowed again. He is now prosecuted under the common law. The Seventh-day Adventists took his case up. It has gone through the State Courts and has just been decided against him by the United States Circuit Court. It is to be appealed to the Supreme Court. We hope Mr. King will gain his case. For, first, he has complied substantially with the objects of the Sunday laws. He and his household rest one day every week. And his plowing at a distance from any church is not an annoyance to worship. It is a shame that he should be punished while railroad companies and daily papers rob thousands of a rest day, and disturb the Sabbaths of large sections and great cities.

The case calls attention to the importance of carefully amending the Sunday laws. They should forbid the employing of men to work on Sunday. No one except an idiot will work on Sunday unless compelled to do so. The penalty should rest wholly upon the employer. And, secondly, those who conscientiously and really observe any other day as a Sabbath should be exempted from the law, provided they do their Sunday work in such a way and at such a place as not to disturb the Sabbath quiet of the first day of the week. The exemption would apply only to those who do rest on Saturday, and it would permit them to employ on Sunday only those who have rested on Saturday. Such a law should have the support of Seventh-day Adventists, Jews, and infidels.

As Sabbath-keepers, we are neither for laws protecting the quiet of our Sabbath, nor for exemption from the operation of Sunday laws, but that Sabbath observance being, as it is, a purely religious act, be left to Christian conscience under the light of God's word, without aid or hindrance from the civil law. Seventh-day people are able to keep holy the Sabbath day in the midst of the hum and hurry of business, in its multiplied forms, as it is carried on all about them, by those who disregard the day, without any appeal to the civil authority. First-day people could do the same, if they had the authority of the word of God for their observance. It is the conscious lack of this authority which sends men so frantically to the civil law for "protection." The practical working of this scheme for protection is shown in the King case, by our exchange quoted above. Professed Sunday-keeping corporations, pleasure-seekers, and the like, make all the noise and clatter they wish on Sunday; but a single man who has conscientiously kept the Sabbath, and goes quietly into his field away from the public highways, and far removed from any place of public or private worship, is arrested, dragged before the courts, condemned, fined, and imprisoned. This is civil Sunday law. The responsibility for the individual wrong is not in the particular law, in this case, it is fundamentally in the effort to regulate religious matters by civil laws.—Sabbath Recorder, Seventh-day Baptist.
