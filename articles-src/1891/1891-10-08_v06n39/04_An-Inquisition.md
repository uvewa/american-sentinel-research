# An Inquisition.

Under this head the *Christian Patriot,* published at Morristown, Tennessee, makes the following comments on the King case in that State:—

The Sunday laws are not as all religious. They have two objects; first, to secure every one the right to a weekly day of rest; and, secondly, to secure the public and good order against the noises of those who rest on Monday. From infidels and atheists that a weekly day to prevent against all bodies and intelligences; and that it is just that the man who is working should be protected from their annoyance.

But Robert M. King, of West Tennessee, is a Seventh-day Adventist, and keeps Saturday. If it rests of reason can not convince him of the error, preach to him. He was arrested, convicted and punished on Sunday. He was arrested and fined no more than $5. He remained in jail, and was then released. After this he was again arrested and fined and sent to the chain gang and he was then released. After this he plowed again. He is now prosecuted under the common law. He formerly by Adventists and his case up. It has gone through the State Courts and has just been decided before the United States Circuit Court. It is to be appealed to the Supreme Court. We hope Mr. King will lose. For, first, he has complied distinctly the object or the purpose of the Sunday laws. He asks no favors of the Adventist persuasion on his keeping at a distance from any church is not an annoyance. He is a farmer, and his corn hoeing and his plow are not nuisances to be prohibited, while railroad companies and daily newspapers published with railroad companies and daily Sabbath of newspapers and great and small.

The open and calm attention to the importance of carefully ascertaining the Sunday laws. The thing is a plain fact that the employer of men is now not for Sunday. No one except an idiot will work on Sunday when he can take a holiday. . . . The penalty should rest wholly upon the employer. And, secondly, those few communities will really dare carry quite close to a Sabbath should be exempted from the law, provided they do their Sunday work in such a manner as to not unreasonably interfere with quiet spirit of the first day of the week. The exemption would prevent them from engaging in any noisy or public labor or business on Saturday, and it would permit them to resign on Sunday as they see fit. No harm could ensue; such a law should have the support of all friends of American, Jews and Infidels.

As Sabbath-keepers, we are neither for laws protecting the quiet of our Sabbath, nor are we for exemption from the operation of Sunday laws, but that Sabbath observance being, as it is, a purely religious act, be left to Christian conscience under the light of God's word, without aid or hindrance from the civil law. Seventh-day people wish to be kept holy, not Sabbathday in the midst of the hum and hurry of business, in its multiplied forms, as it is carried on all about them, by those who [page 308] disregard the day, without any appeal to the civil authority. First-day people should do the same, if they had the authority of the Word of God for that observance. It is the cumulous lack of this authority which sends men so fruitfully to the civil law for "protection." The intricate working of this scheme for protection is clearly seen in the King case, by an quotation quoted above. Professed Sunday-keeping corporations, pleasure-seekers, and the like, make all the noise and clatter they wish on Sunday; but a single man who has conscientiously kept the Sabbath, and goes quietly into his field away from any traveled highway, and far removed from any place of public or private worship, is dragged, in irons before the courts, demanded, fined, and imprisoned. This is civil Sunday law. The responsibility for the individual wrongs is not in the particular law, in this case, it is fundamentally in the effort to require religious observance by law.—*Sabbath Recorder.*
