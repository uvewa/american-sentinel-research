Under the above title the Atlanta Constitution of September 5, contained the following:—

Mr. R. A. Broyles and Mr. J. A. Droege, the latter of whom is Superintendent of the Macon and Northern road, were summoned to appear before Judge Maddox, at Calhoun, Georgia, to answer to the charge of misdemeanor, yesterday. Both of these gentlemen were formerly connected with the East Tennessee road in the capacity of master of trains, and the misdemeanor with which they are charged consists of "unlawfully and by force of arms" running freight trains through Gordon County on the Sabbath.

They arrived at Calhoun in fine trim, and were ready to stand their trial, when lo! they were pounced upon by the sheriffs from all the surrounding counties who had similar charges against them. They were given a warm reception, and were busily engaged in being arrested for a quarter of an hour after their arrival.

The Calhoun case was postponed, and yesterday the gentlemen arrived in Atlanta smiling, but with a pocketful of charges.

Let the good work go on. The more that such arrests are made the sooner honest and sensible people will get their eyes open to the Satanic intolerance that is back of this whole question of securing civil law to enforce "Sabbath" observance.
