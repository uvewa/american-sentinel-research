Some months ago, a man by the name of F. A. Lashier moved from Minnesota to Newberg, Oregon, and opened a grocery and notion store. As Mr. Lashier was a believer in the seventh-day Sabbath, and as he did not see any marked evidence that Sunday was observed with any particular sanctity there, he thought it was his privilege, and and perfectly proper for him to keep his store open on Sunday, since he had it closed on the seventh day of the week. The town is composed largely of Quakers, and they have a sufficient majority there that they can elect any man that they may see fit to any of the village offices. They soon began to make complaints in regard to Lashier having his store open on Sunday, and threatened to have him arrested. He went to the Mayor of the city and also to the prosecuting attorney, to know what could be done in the matter; and they assured him that it was perfectly right for him to have his store open on Sunday and that he would not be molested in the least. The assurance was even carried so far that he was given to understand that if complaints should be made, they would not issue a warrant for his arrest. He went on with his business, and in a little while, the threats became so strong that he went to the city authorities again. He found then that the sentiment was quite materially changed from what it was at first. The authorities were fearful that they would have to close up his business on Sunday, and said that it would certainly be their duty to do so if any complaints should be made. As Mr. Lashier has quite a good trade on Sunday, the cause evidently of his threatened arrest is not so much a zeal for the sacredness of Sunday as it is to secure the trade that is thus going to Lashier. And this is one of the difficulties that is everywhere apparent in connection with Sunday laws. If all were agreed that Sunday is the Sabbath that Christians should observe, these Sunday laws would not increase the religious observance of that day, and Sunday laws only serve as a pretext for those who are so disposed, to harass and annoy their fellow-citizens. The most ardent believers in the importance of Sunday observance should certainly see this point and oppose the passage of Sunday laws, and depend upon the influence of the Church to conserve the interest of Sunday. We would think, however, that the Quakers would remember some of their early experiences and that they would be more liberal in allowing their fellow-citizens to have the same rights of conscience for which they suffered in the early history of our country.
