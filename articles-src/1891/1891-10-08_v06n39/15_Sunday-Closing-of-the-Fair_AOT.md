The Evening Journal, of Chicago, in its issue of the 1st inst., makes some very sensible observations concerning the Sunday closing of the Fair. It says:—

It is the belief of the Journal that on civil, sanitary and humanitarian grounds, all vice and disorder should be suppressed, and labor minimized, on Sunday, during the Exposition and at all other times. But it believes just as firmly that the Government has no right to prohibit orderly recreation on Sunday, because abstinence from recreation on Sunday can only be enforced on religious grounds. It is not to be thought of, therefore, that people should be prohibited by law from visiting and looking at the display in Jackson Park on Sundays. The only question for civilians is whether the employees of the Exposition shall be allowed to work on Sunday. As to the railroads and street-cars, they will have no more to do than if the people went somewhere else.

It is claimed that 50,000 people will be at work at the Exposition on every day that it is open. But if the 300,000 people who would visit the place on Sunday should be turned loose in the city to seek recreation in some other way, there is no doubt that just as many people would have to work in some other way. Moreover, it strikes one very unpleasantly that such a world-wide sympathy should have been excited for these 50,000 people, when just as many have been hard at work, in Chicago, every Sunday for the last ten years. It is this that gives a flavor of insincerity and fanaticism to this movement. The only answer is that the Sabbath is an American institution, and that therefore one of our exhibits should be a well-kept Sabbath. But the only Sabbath-keeping country on the globe is Great Britain.

It is easy to see what will come of this agitation. The non-church going people of this country are in an overwhelming majority, and, while they will concede something to religious sentiment, they will not allow the church going element to govern them entirely. The Commission will temporize with the Sabbatarians and bow them out of their meeting. The decision of the question will be postponed on one pretext and another, for eighteen months in come, and then some regulations will be adopted which will show a spirit of concession and respect to the religious sentiment of the country. But we believe that it will be useless for the Sabbatarians to hope that the Commission will abstain from what the Sabbatarians regard as an awful sin.
