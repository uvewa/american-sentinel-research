THE following from the Christian Advocate, of this city, is significant:—

A plan to change the weekly school holiday from Saturday to Sunday was discussed at the meeting of the National Association of Seminary Principals at Round Lake. Professor Bishop, of Montpelier, proposed it, and was supported by two other seminary principals, one in Vermont and the other in Illinois, who have tried and strongly approved it. The points they make in its favor are that Sunday was more generally observed because it came not at the close of a holiday, but of a day of exercises. Tuesday's lessons were better learned, and because the frequently bad influences of Saturday night were not a feature of the Monday holiday. Most of the people liked the change, or at least had no objection to it. We believe this proposition to be worthy of serious consideration and experimentation, and we will doubtless receive it, as most of the principals present determined to submit the question to the faculties of their schools.

The same suggestion has been made before, and it seems not unlikely that very soon it will be acted upon as everything is being made subservient to Sunday observance. Such a change would, however, work great hardship upon observers of the seventh day.
