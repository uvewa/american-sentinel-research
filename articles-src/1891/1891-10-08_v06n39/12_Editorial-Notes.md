# Editorial Notes.

[page 305]

One of the greatest problems of politics is to determine the proper relation between Church and State, between civil and religious rights so that they may not encroach upon one another nor become burdens of our social life, encumbering it with greater difficulties than attach to it naturally.—*Medievalism.*

The theory of the gospel of Christ is, not the taking away of temptation for fear that men will do evil, but the implanting in man of an enmity to evil, the implication of a supreme love of right, and a power to do the right which they love. The theory of the gospel is to so keep a man in perpetual felicity by taking away from him every form of difficulty, or trial, or burden, or toil, to make him, in a word, by the divine power which it brings to bear, *the man.* Consequently Scriptures make no pretense to take away temptation from man, but, instead, exhort all men to overcome, to resist temptation, "as good soldiers of Jesus Christ."

It is often stated as a reproach that "California is the only State in the Union without a Sunday law." That is one way of looking at it; and there is a "that" in it. "California is the only State in the Union that maintains the original idea of civil and religious liberty guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. It is the only State in the Union whose laws acknowledge that one man has as good a right not to rest on Sunday as another has to rest. It is, therefore, the only State in the Union where all citizens are on an equality before the law. It is the only State in the Union where no one can dictate what other classes shall not do on a certain day of the week. It is the only State in the Union where the law does not encourage the making of hypocrites on Sunday, by making them seem to have reverence for something which they do not reverence." However, as a matter of fact, California has not this proud distinction. Wyoming and Idaho are also without Sunday laws.

Mrs. Bateham, who engineered the four-teen-million-two-hundred thousand-petition drive when two years ago found it so hard that in her judgment "pronunciamentos" such as are unreliable as the new census.

He has probably been studying some of the evidence that THE SENTINEL has given of the utterly fraudulent character of many of the "Sunday-rest petitions." There is but little to it. "Open-air communion is good for the soul."

The power of the State law being long invoked in behalf of Sunday-keeping, but for various reasons it has been impossible to secure the results desired by some; and so, not in Indiana, resort has been had to no extreme powerful force, as shown in the following dispatch, which we take from the *Daily Citizen,* of Chicago.

Stover, Indiana, Sept. 17.—Father park is the founder of a sort of a Roman Catholic settlement at Falcon, in the northern part of this county, and he is in daily peril of his life on account of the church people in that vicinity objected to this bulldozing despotically and are several individuals whose properties has been damaged. The beating surface is made by a large dam across the river, and a small cement pile thereon, broken a dam hat of raw bone. Unsuccessful efforts have been made to destroy the dam by fire and quicklime. Yesterday two large charges of dynamite were exploded in rapid succession, completely demolishing the dam and hurling large stones and timbers [page 312] long distances away. Neighboring windows were shattered and hundreds of people were badly frightened—One piece of timber fell upon the roof of John Byrd's residence crashing in it.

This incident serves to illustrate the spirit of the Sunday-law movement; it stops at nothing to compass its ends.

The *Chicago Journal,* referring to the recent meeting of the World's Fair Commission, says:—

There are a number of things the Commission has not done at this meeting. It has not settled the Sunday opening question, and it is understood that that matter will not be decided until the very last thing. The report of the local board on the question is being purposely delayed because of that.

The impermanent seems to be growing that the result of the controversy will be a compromise, which however will be far from satisfactory to the American Sabbath Union, and the National Reformers generally.

The German Colonists seem to have observed an idea from the Sunday-law preachers of this country, namely, that Sunday laws will enable them the better to get the fur of the workingmen. The *Trades Unions* says:—

They (the Colonists) are well pleased to have labor factions to shorten, to instruct and they say he is the more free to make that day one of propaganda to a workingmen else, etc.

---

The Sunday-law preachers carry the plan a step further and propose to forbid both work and amusement, in order that the workingmen may be forced into the churches on Sunday.

The *Daily Report,* of San Francisco, has the following, which it characterizes as "a religious intolerance":—

> JACKSONVILLE, July 31.—The authorities have given notice to the Roman Catholic clergy that the last mandate making converts will be strictly enforced. The law is said to the general approval of the people, especially in the interior of Russia, where the people are much more religious.

"This," says another California paper, "is religious intolerance, just Russian intolerance; right here ought to be. Coming action is just such a one as they would like to have taken toward any other classes of in their power to do so, judging from their past." This is all true, but it furnishes no excuse whatever for the intolerance of the Swedish Government.

The *State,* a weekly journal published at St. Paul, Minnesota, and "devoted to the emancipation of the united individuals," has this:—

The *Minneapolis Journal* says there are twenty-two million people in this country who believe in Sunday as a day of rest and worship, and that, therefore, "there ought to be no question about" keeping the World's Fair closed on that day. If that statement is true, then there are at least forty million people in this country who claim the right to do what they please on Sunday, without any interference from the one half. There is a great [page 312] law in which all dissent. Liberty-loving folk are interested; it is this: Cancel the one-third stay away from the Fair on Sunday, without deporting citizens of the opportunity to go if they want to it.

That is the question in a nutshell. Shall the Fair be so manipulated as to strengthen in any degree the assumption that it is part of the business of the State to conserve religious and not religious institutions?

September 30, an effort was made to close the Citizens of the oil in city to keep Sunday. The attempt was only in part successful, however. The front doors of business and gambling houses, it is the said, closed in most cases, but side doors were open and a good deal of business done. According to the *Morning Journal,* of that still, the Chinese merchants say that they are threatened with bankruptcy if they are compelled to close on Sunday. "They say that if they are compelled to close up Sunday, as barely with difficulty it serves two days of the month other than Sunday, for as they are worshippers of Buddha they will keep the days sacred to him. They claim that under the laws the Buddhists can declare the right to pay Buddhist sacred days and do business on Sunday, or offer people to have to buy their Sabbath on work on Sunday and to keep to every day their holy days.

ONE article of Mr. Crafts's *Rest Day League* purposes says:—

Article V. Committees shall be appointed as follows, on the part of each county, state, etc.; the committees of four; known only to himself, the total to be announced at the annual meeting. He reserves the right, however, to appoint one or more to certain personally whatever violations—first, of the spirit, and second, of the letter—of the foregoing, who shall be turn inform the public authorities of all violations. It shall also be the "duty" of these "committees" to inform "the spirit of the State law," and the public as to fears regarding the danger of infractions. The list of Mr. Crafts' purposes includes something of: (1.) "The prevention of the (Sunday) mass of liquor crimes in saloons and elsewhere on a local basis for this; (2.) "prevention of involuntary toil, including voluntary closing by agreement or otherwise, of places of business on Sunday; and also embracing matter to the press and circulation of literature among tradesmen, touching the advantages of the weekly rest day."

This secret inquisitorial committee of professional spies has been referred to in these columns before. The Sentinel will soon publish, we hope, an article upon this point, presenting Mr. Crafts's methods in vogue in carrying out the Sunday cause.

"OUWTERSWAARD," says the *Christian at Work,* "has not yet reached the ideal Sunday observance of America." Well, neither has this country reached it. Just now she is at work experimenting in the matter of Sunday closing. She has been frustrated to test the ideas of the citizens for the mail delivery, and the duty of this in proposing the making of Sunday quiet. That the country shall insure the mail delivered on Sunday. All letters and papers still lay bad paying being unclaimed in America itself, Chapter I.

In the United States of America; with the national conscience of that country, a man, without even Jewish faith as a Christian and a citizen, is fined and imprisoned because, after having proved that he was ready in his faith the commandments of God, his God-given right to work the other six days, (the let seventh day at the Sabbath of God,) he plowed in his own field, on Sunday, the first day of the week. . . . Is it possible to imagine a more complete display of ignorance, brutality, tyranny, arrogance and bigotry?—*Christian Press.*

---

The Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, dispatch, to something in the recent decision of Judge Hammond in the King case, says that : "The State law seems to be decidedly against the Adventist who keeps Saturday day man and religiously keeps Saturday as his Sabbath."

---

"To get the Nation right on the Sabbath," says Mr. Crafts, in *Sabbath-day Observance,* "we must first get the Church right. Not till we get the Church right, involving getting the individual Christian to himself his own course in this matter." Why then does not Mr. Crafts begin with the individual Christian instead of asking the State to pass and enforce laws compelling all to keep Sunday? He is inconsistent.
