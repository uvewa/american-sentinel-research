THE *State*, a weekly journal published in St. Paul, Minnesota, and "devoted to the emancipation of the united industrialists," has this:—

The Minneapolis *Journal* says there are twenty-two million people in this country who believe in Sunday as a day of rest and worship, and that, therefore, "there ought to be no question" about keeping the World's Fair closed on that day. If that statement is true, then there are at least forty million people in this country who claim the right to do what they please on Sunday, without any interference from the one-third. There is a question in which all decent, liberty-loving folk are interested; it is this: Cannot the one-third stay away from the Fair on Sunday, without depriving others of the opportunity to go, if they want to?

That is the question in a nutshell. Shall the Fair be so manipulated as to strengthen in any degree the assumption that it is part of the business of the State to conserve religion and religious institutions?
