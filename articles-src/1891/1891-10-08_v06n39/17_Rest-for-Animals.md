The National Reform people of Chicago, in their effort to advance the interests of the movement in which they are engaged, are carrying their Sunday rest theory to its logical conclusion. That is, God made the Sabbath for man because man needed to rest one day in seven, and now they have discovered that the beast also needs rest, or the Lord would not have included it in the commandment.

A minister of the Presbyterian Church said recently, at one of the Sabbath Union meetings:—

We should organize immediately into a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and if men will continue to disregard the claims of God upon them, we will see that they do not wear out their animals contrary to law by driving them continuously seven days in the week.

We do not read anywhere that the Lord gave his people a command that extended beyond themselves. "Thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, thy cattle and thy stranger that is within thy gates." But those people propose to go outside their own gates, and compel the Gentiles to let their beasts rest if they will not do so themselves.
