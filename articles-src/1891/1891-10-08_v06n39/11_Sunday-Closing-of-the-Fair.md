# Sunday Closing of the Fair.

The *Firemen's Journal,* of Chicago, in its issue of the last inst., makes some very sensible observations concerning the Sunday closing of the Fair. It says:—

> In a large city like Chicago, where all factories and industries and wholesale houses are closed on Sunday, the stores and small shops are also closed on Sunday, during the Exposition and at all other times, a large proportion of working people have no other time than Sunday to attend the Exposition. Close it on Sunday; because abstinence from recreation on that day will afford no rest to men who are doing nothing. Moreover the closing of the Fair on Sunday should be prohibited by law from visiting and looking at exhibitions, monuments, and works of art. The only question for civilians is whether the citizen who wants to go to church shall have the legal right to prevent others from visiting and seeing. But they will have no more to do than if the people themselves could use such influence. To close the Exposition on every day that it is open. But the question of opening or closing the Fair on Sunday should be turned loose in the city to seek amusement or instruction on the one day in the week when they had leisure, or to keep them in some other way. Moreover, it strikes one very oddly to consider that these Sunday laws may be more than just as many have been hard at work, in Chicago, preparing for the Fair for several years, and this that gives a flavor of insincerity and falsity to the whole movement. As Chicago is likely to be pretty well filled up with visitors next year, therefore one of our exhibits should be a well-kept Sabbath day—such a Sunday as would be an example to visitors from all parts of the world.

It is easy to see what will come of this agitation. Business men of the city will be found to have an overwhelming majority, and, while they will oppose all schemes to close any business, they will be glad to see this good feeling from outside authority. The Commission will temporize with the question, perhaps close the Fair on one Sunday for one pretext and another, for eighteen months or eight years, and finally the Exhibition will be open which will show a spirit of commerce and respect with helpfulness of the rules of the country. The disposition of people who keep Sunday is well and we hope to hope that the Commission will abstain from any legislation upon this subject.

This seldom happens of Denison, Texas, have asked the City Council to pass an ordinance forbidding all sales of liquor between the hours of 6 o'clock P. M. on Saturday. The proposition is thus of Sunday closing in the city.

Some of the connections discussed the salesmen of Chicago, and the results were reported late last week.

Now either saloon men step up and ask for the closing of their houses on Sunday under the law. Now saloon men step up and ask for the closing of their houses on Sunday under the law. This is ridiculous on its face; because they now close on Sunday in compliance with it. They are the part of the city officials. As one believes the objection the taking their rights is civil for business. The real object of this movement is apparent. It is to be rid of the competition of those who now sell in violation of the law. The latter, instead of wanting to be closed they want to be left alone. This also shows that however much enforcement of Sunday it will lead to some who cite this result, but it if would dare to on some of the prohibitionists might as well be applied.

If all saloon are to be allowed to keep open, all business men are to be allowed to keep open, all business establishments are to be allowed to keep open, all through Sunday legislation, to take, is to oppose the enactment of the Sunday legislation.
