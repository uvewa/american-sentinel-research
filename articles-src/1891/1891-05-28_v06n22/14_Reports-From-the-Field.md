H. F. PHELPS, of Brainerd, Minnesota, a worker in the National Religious Liberty Association, sends in the following from letters recently received in response to circulars and literature sent out:—

The following is from a lawyer: "Any legislalation, either State or national, tending to secure or favor any religious sect or creed, either in church or school, ought to be opposed, and given no rest, by every lover of constitutional liberty, whatever his political or religious faith may be. Make life for it impossible."

Another, a minister, writes: "I will hasten to reply, and it will take but few words either; I can do it all in two; viz., 'I Agree,' or, to use your own words, keep Church and State forever separate."

Another writes: I agree with the principles of the Association. It will be a sad day for the country when the State shall dictate our religion for us.

A County Commissioner writes: "I will do all I can to set this matter before the people in its true light. Anything I can do, be assured, I am willing to do."

Another says: "I am in sympathy with all the principles of the Association."

A postmaster writes: "We should consider that the rights of conscience are a great thing. I received your letter and leaflets. The neighbors took quite an interest in the matter, and wanted me to get petitioningmed. All of your papers are grand."

Another County Commissioner says: "I received your letter of a late date, and I thank you very much for the reading matter. It is excellent; just to the point. I am very much interested in this question, and think the Constitution is all right as concerns religion."
