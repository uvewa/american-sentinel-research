THE Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Bradford, Pennsylvania, have recently circulated a petition in that place asking the City Council to close all places of business on Sunday. It has caused considerable discussion of the subject in that city, but the City Council has not yet taken action.

The *Mail and Express* finds fault with Professor Briggs because he declared that the church tribunals declined against him he would appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Editor Shepard says:—

"This is a disgrace; it is the Union Theological Seminary that thus elevated Professor Briggs claims that his views about the Presbytery and others that on all things civil government has power that he appeals to the civil power of the State."

The Briggs wishes or makes his attempt to settle Church and State by showing that he can use the appeal against his doctrine of the Presbytery.

And yet the *Mail and Express* insists that Sunday laws have, the exemption of church property from taxation, religious services in the police courts and the prisons, laws in the interest of a union of Church and State! *Marvelous are the distinctions made by National Reformers!*

On the 18th inst., the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, of Art, in this city, decided by a vote of twelve to four to open the Museum on Sunday from 1 o'clock p. m. until half an hour before sunset.

The petition for Sunday opening had 80,000 signatures. Among the signers were the following ministers: Rev. W. S. Rainsford, Rev. David H. Greer, Rev. Lyman Abbott, Rev. Theodore of Williams, Rev. R. Heler Nelson, Rev. H. Martin Reed, Rev. Edward B. Coe, Rev. A. R. Hart, Rev. Anthony Lament, Rev. William C. French, Rev. S. W. Young. The counter-petition, that against Sunday opening, bore the names of thirty-eight ministers.

One of the reasons urged against opening the Museum on Sunday was, that to open the museums on Sunday seems to be a preliminary step toward opening the whole trade in Sunday theaters and open in the Sunday liquor traffic, and, as the opening of museums opens a door which, as it is known as a sort of complimentary opening, that would be followed, then compelling a large class to work on that day for the pleasure of others, breaking down the principle of the equal right of all to the Sunday rest and imposing that [page 176] popular reverence for the Lord's day, which we possess in Europe and the Western older countries proves to be the one effective defense of Sunday as a rest day.

The petition for Sunday opening was accompanied by a communication from the Central Labor Union declaring that it was approved by all the labor unions. There was also a petition of the Working People's Committee, Charles B. Stover, Secretary. This petition says that: "while certain 'ladies' and 'gentlemen' have been circulating a petition for Sunday opening, workingmen and working women, we know what they are asking for, have done the same thing independently and have obtained the indorsement of organized labor. The petitions says that the statement that workingmen don't want the Metropolitan Museum open on Sunday, is false. To the argument that Sunday opening will tend to make Sunday another day of labor, the New York workingman replies that he is prepared to prevent any such intrusion, his rights.

As he is now able to determine the number of hours he shall labor per day, so can he also determine the number of days he shall labor in the week."

As Sunday opening, the Museum will for a few small hours of each month secure the citizens that it should not be open the first day of the fair.

ANNOUNCEMENT upon the President's failure to keep Sunday at Glenwood Springs according to the National Reform order, and the reason for that failure, the *Christian Statesmen* says:—

> The highest respect which the people of Colorado could have shown the President would have been to refrain from an ostentatious reception on Sunday. They must have then put this, over at the extreme of Christ who died that they might live, and the President must not forget the opportunity to press upon him at least from other active influences. This is the private tour on with delegations as soon as he had fallen in the morning. They presented him with their attentions all day long, far he felt compelled to be his man and they permit he under-so he accepted, as is always what a duty power is bound to accept, and so as doing he set a snack to be to exerted example—to the masterful discomfort, who witnessed the performance. And we can not refrain from adding, this is a confession. That a President, who has both been to the Sabbath, and crossed on Sabbath also and had the Glenwood, he would have with a little patience, been avoided, and the crowd were waiting to rob him of his day of rest. The first thing in the morning Mr. Harrison devoted to his right to the boon of the Sabbath was never to invite guests elsewhere. The very principle that observes the President's remarks in favor of the Sabbath were expanding all day long as an honor to the day, and on the rights of all who that day were commissioned to serve their pleasure on the Sabbath.

We may misunderstand the *Statesman,* but it would seem that our contemporary thinks there should be a law forbidding people to call upon the President on Sunday, and possibly a clause forbidding the President to receive visitors upon that day. If Mr. Harrison had been exceedingly anxious to enjoy a quiet Sunday he [page 176] might, as the *Statesman* suggests, have had his car side-tracked east of Glenwood Springs instead of spending four hours of Sunday at the resort in that place. But Mr. Harrison did not see fit to do it that way, and we can not agree that the world ought to undertake to answer the petition, "Lead us not into temptation." The President spent the first four hours of Sunday in getting into the way of temptation, and he did it of his own free choice. His coming close to Glenwood Springs of his own volition was to that place. No course of civil law would have altered the cause the end in either case.

Or does the *Statesman* wish to be understood as intimating that the President would have had more respect for a civil rest day than he has for that he is claimed to be a divine law? If the *Statesman* does not mean this, we fail to see the clearness of its logic.

THE *Independent* has the following concerning the World's Fair:—

It is rumored that Mr. Ellsworth, the commissioner of patents, who is also the one to influence with the Directors of the World's Fair in favor of Sunday opening. At the same time we hear it said that a more Government official, who was largely instrumental in having prayer offered daily in the office of the Commissioners, agrees that its gates will be opened on Sunday. We say this is something to be remembered. Again we state: Mr. Edison and the cabinet officers hold to the same view. It shows that the friend of the Sabbath is to know that they must not rely on the Government to rest on their behalf, but on the character of the citizens themselves. The weight of influence is strong in the administration. A all who are engaged in Sunday rest are glad of the opportunity to express themselves against such delinquencies, and they are told the directors themselves want the gate open each Sunday morning to be opened in resting up periods, accessible to the creation falling all in for the summer, open on the road, and yet all the moral and Christian worth could not possibly be lost, and the public should be so plead with them to close up, and they should maintain their claims to hold Sunday opening with nothing else on the Lord's Day but the Christian character and the rewards.

It would be interesting to know to which of the two causes, mentioned by the *Independent,* Mr. Ellsworth and the cabinet officers alluded to belong. The *Independent* does not, however, speak advisedly on who it says that "the national government, hitherto has proved the Sunday, is at any rate going to make money out of it and the example." What the Fair pays on Sunday, if closed Fair would insure a Sunday harvest. The Exposition itself, if open on Sunday, would furnish other attractions for visitors. The rest of the Sunday advocates was not in keeping with their utterances.
