If any evidence is still required to show that that which the American Sabbath Union demands, at the hands of the Directors of the World's Fair, is a recognition of the day as a religious institution it is supplied by the following editorial from the *Mail and Express* of May 4:—

## OBEY GOD.

For once, we call attention to the text* at the head of this page, and we seriously commend the study of it to the National Commission and to the Board of Directors of the Chicago Columbian Exposition.

They are put to the test by the proposition submitted to them by the American Sabbath Union, that the gates of the Fair shall be closed on the Sabbath, and that they shall immediately announce that decision.

They hold the fate of the Nation in their hands. If they shall decide to trample upon the law of God, by breaking the fourth commandment, which requires all mankind to keep God's day holy, and not to do any work therein, nor to allow their servants, nor their cattle, nor visiting strangers to do any work therein, they may expect a continuance of the querulous and paralyzing counsels that have afflicted their body and the pestilences that have afflicted the city of Chicago.

They may also expect that the Christian people of these United States will both refrain from sending exhibits to the Exposition and also from attending the Exposition themselves; which will inflict a very severe loss upon them financially and greatly detract from the beauty, variety, and completeness of the Exposition.

The Christians of the United States are determined in this matter. Either the Sabbath is to be kept within the precincts of the Fair, or they will in no way lend it their aid and countenance. They have already been sufficiently insulted by the adroit procrastination visited upon the Sabbath, and the pigeon-holing of their respectful petitions, which have rained upon the Commission almost without limit, and the sly promises given by various of the commissioners and directors to the run-sellers, the restaurateurs, the vendors of tobacco, the keepers of candy stands, the sellers of soda water, the drawers of lager beer, and those engaged in public transportation, that no notice shall be taken of these petitions, and that, when the proper time comes, the gates will be open the seven days of the week.

There is the highest legal duty imposed upon all those in control of the proposed Fair, both to prevent their own employees from performing the work necessary to keeping the Fair open on the Sabbath, and also to prevent strangers and visitors from performing the work of promenading its galleries, halls, buildings, and grounds, examining and studying and understanding the exhibits, which is a fatiguing work, and which can legitimately be performed in six days of the week.

The theory that workingmen can not attend the Fair on any day but Sunday is utter bosh. The theory that a visit to the Exposition will be one purely of listless amusement and innocent recreation is still more utterly bosh. And the theory that God has nothing to do with the affairs of this world, that he has repealed his Decalogue, and that he will not punish those who break it in any of its parts, is the most consummate untruth of all.

On the other hand God has affixed illimitable blessings to the keeping of the fourth commandment, and if the commissioners and directors will immediately resolve, and so announce to the world, that the gates of the Fair shall be closed upon Sunday, and themselves keep that law individually, they may expect to see a cessation of the pestilences with which so many of them and the city of Chicago have been visited; and that the sentiment of the people will be harmonized and greatly strengthened till it shall pervade all classes of the people, throughout the whole United States, in favor of making that Fair far surpass anything of the kind ever before known to the world.

God constantly repeats to nations the test which he put to the Hebrews by the Prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel, and he now calls aloud in thunder tones by his providence in every sky which limits the human vision in all parts of these United States: Which is God? Is your idol Baal, God? Or, is God the Lord Almighty, Glorious and Blessed for ever?

The Baalites were slain.

History repeats itself.

This shows that there is absolutely nothing in all that has been said about the preservation of the "American Sabbath" and the "civil Sabbath." The American Sabbath Union now demands, through its President, who is editor and proprietor of the Mail and Express, not only that Sunday shall be recognized as a religious institution, but that it shall be recognized as a divine institution.
