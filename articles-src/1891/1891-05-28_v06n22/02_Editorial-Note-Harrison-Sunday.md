THE Christian Statesman finds fault with the manner in which President Harrison and party spent the last Sunday of their recent return trip from the Pacific Coast. The train bearing the party did not reach Glenwood Springs, Colorado, until 4 o'clock Sunday morning. At 8 o'clock a committee escorted the President to breakfast at a hotel. At 11 o'clock the President and some of his party attended service at the Presbyterian Church. During the afternoon Mr. Harrison received several delegations from surrounding towns, and addressed two meetings held in his honor. On both occasions his remarks were mildly religious, appropriate to the day as it is generally regarded. At 6 o'clock P. M., the train, in harmony with orders from the President, left Glenwood Springs, and the party spent the night in their car on a side track twenty-four miles from the scene of Mr. Harrison's wrecked resolution to observe Sunday according to the most approved Presbyterian fashion. Our opinion, however, is that it is none of the Christian Statesman's business how the President spent Sunday.
