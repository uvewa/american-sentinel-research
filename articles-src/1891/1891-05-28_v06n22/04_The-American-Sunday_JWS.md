At a Sunday-law meeting recently held in New York City, under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, the Rev. R. S. MacArthur, D. D., expressed himself after the following fashion:—

>The man who lifts his hand against the American Sunday is an enemy of the Republic. He is an enemy of the race. He is an enemy of God.

By the term "American Sunday," we presume the reverend gentleman referred to just the same Sunday that we have all been used to, namely, the first day of the week. Of course, if this is an American institution, to oppose it would be to oppose the Republic that gave it birth. But how is it the American Sunday any more than the German Sunday? Nowhere in the Declaration of Independence do we find that our forefathers were proposing to inaugurate this day as an American institution, and its establishment was evidently just as far from their thoughts in the adoption of our national Constitution. How then can it be said to be the "American" Sunday? We can nowhere find any commandment which says: "Remember the American Sunday to keep it civilly; six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy incivility, but the first day is the American Sunday: in it thou shalt do nothing un-American or uncivil, for in six days the American people established this Government, and all that in it is, and became civil upon the first day. Wherefore this Nation blessed the American Sunday and civilized it."

We have heard of the American flag, of American liberty, and of a host of other American things, but never before knew that Sunday was one of them! In fact, it has been generally supposed that anything essentially American naturally pertained to America. This being the case, what right have other nations with our property? Isn't it about time the Government was sending armed cruisers to the different ports of the world, with the demand that these nations immediately relinquish their claims to our "American" Sunday? Patriotism must not be allowed to degenerate in this country, and it is clearly the height of disloyalty to allow our "American" institutions to be boldly appropriated in this way.

But, according to Dr. MacArthur, it is a crime against the whole human race to oppose this "American" Sunday. How is this? If it is not distinctively American, then it has no business to be so termed, either by Dr. MacArthur or by any one else. If it is American property, then it is clearly unpatriotic in us to allow it to be used as anything else than an American institution by other nations. And yet, whoever opposes it is "an enemy of the race." Does this mean that the sceptre of universal government is to be wielded over all the world by this country? or does it mean that the advocates of Sunday laws blow hot and cold so often on the same question that they can not see the contradictions in their own arguments?

An institution can of right be effective only within the limits of the power which has created or ordained it. This being the case, Dr. MacArthur gets things sadly mixed when he declares that the individual who opposes the American Sunday is "an enemy of God." Why should this be, if Sunday is an "American" institution and simply a "civil matter"? Does Dr. MacArthur believe that God has surrendered his authority into the hands of this Government, that it may thus assume jurisdiction over the rest of the world and enforce its institutions (the "American" Sunday especially) upon all men? This conclusion is so preposterous as to be scarcely worthy of a moment's notice; yet it is, nevertheless, a fair inference drawn from the Doctor's own words. If this be denied, however, then only one other opinion can be held, and that is, that it is the religious observance of the day which is causing him so much concern, after all.

Inasmuch as these words were spoken at a meeting held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, which is itself a powerful auxiliary of the National Reform party, and engaged in the same work, we can safely adopt them as outlining the policy of all National Reform work, so called. It is, when stripped of all disguise, simply an effort to pass laws to enable human authority to assume divine prerogatives; to clothe itself with civil power to enforce its own interpretation of the divine will. It is the carrying out of the same principles which gave rise to the tyrannical rule of Romanism in the early centuries of the Christian era, and is a shameful backward step to take by those who share in the enjoyment of the civil and religious rights of the present century. So surely as these principles are ever allowed to prevail again, and especially in our own Government, so surely may we expect a re-enactment of the scenes which have caused the memory of the Dark Ages to come down to us stained with the blood of martyrs and lurid with the light of the fires which were kindled to coerce the consciences of honest men.
