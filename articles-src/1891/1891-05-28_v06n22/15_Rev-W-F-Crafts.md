## Rev. W. F. Crafts.

[page 174]

REV. W. F. CRAFTS, in his lecture is now making his way through Iowa. A short time since he spoke in the lovely little city of Washington, on the favorite hobby of closing all the stores, saloons, etc., on Sunday. The editor of the *Washington Press* made quite an extended comment on his work from which we select the following:—

If this one man can make in so that 100 men in this city quit their regular employment to sit down, get a letter or paper on Sunday; that is if he can regulate their conduct in their own homes, he would on precisely the same grounds and methods of procedure on that the stamp the further and regulate all our doings on that day—pen so up in our houses for example, or made us do whatever, or not make us do anything. We say he has no business to meddle with us at any time and we will not put fools; we are not little children unable to take care of ourselves. We say to the Mr. Crafts or any preacher, a dictator, a censor for the people of Washington, keep your hands off!

It makes us tired to see these men who have no more consideration for the rights of others.

Are we not capable of self government if regulations of our own enterprises, of our own duty and of repairing the feelings of others. Let's find such, own our own business and go home, teach, and be men and women.

The *Sigourney, Iowa, Review,* under the caption of "Too Much Brother Crafts" says concerning the same man on the article in the *Press.* The following is some of the statements of the *Review:*—

This question is prominent in the issue as one is the politics of this country whether before Christ shall be displayed, his kingdom is set up in the world, and again and again warned these zealots and attempts to advance the kingdom of God through the medium of civil law enactments. They have seemed to prefer the clerical, voluntary methods of the Christian religion. Of the open volumes of evidence shown. All that the Christian can, and the slow process of the leaven of virtue among men, to the Government of written votes of faulty man, for the civil enforcement of the principles of the heart, sanctified by Christ, are becoming obsolete, and efforts are being made of rushing mankind through the gates on a Sunday, by legal enactment, into nearly almost compelled the system of free grace.

It seems, in this age of progressive ideas, that every man that is; ought to be his brother's keeper that he shall trouble to trapse right to the Lord. It requires an act of legislature to repent, and no man can repent of whatsoever of his sins out there, nor trouble, nor visiting strangers of any work, there are large numbers in every corner of the questions and pressing about the grounds and their only role; the politicians that have afflicted the city of Chicago.

This class of reformers is becoming quite so numerous in the late years of the century that we have to give them the power to exile frenchon or whatever to accomplish. In the mean and certain men like Mr. King of Chicago, we have must add Bible by the rules of means, and induce men as a class to do right, because it was right, on their own individual preference, and not because a set of misguided, mossback religious fanatics, masking as church-making zealots have bulldozed the body politic into compelling obedience on Sundays.

Sunday, May 3, Mr. Crafts spoke at Marshalltown, and propounded his small fry of Sunday laws. The friends of religious liberty were on hand and also a goodly lot of literature so that the people might see both sides of the question. He promises to spend some more time in Iowa.
