The Executive Committee of the National Reform Association lately met in the Young Men's Christian Association parlors, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and its Secretary reported, among other things, that a letter "had been manifolded by the typewriter and mimeograph and sent to more than ten hundred and fifty pastors," asking them for "a sermon in behalf of the cause and a collection for its treasury."

There has also been undertaken "a registration or enrollment of the friends of the cause, by States and counties, preserving thus for reference and constant use the names and addresses of those who are reported by workers in the field or are ascertained by correspondence to be devoted to these principles and willing to co-operate in the work. Blanks have been printed and ruled for this purpose capable of enrolling twenty thousand names showing addresses, and church connection of every one," etc.

A letter is also about to be sent to judges of the State and Federal courts, "with reference to the propriety of prayer in courts of justice," and "asking co-operation to make this observance general."

It was also reported that the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union had joined with the National Reform Association in a letter to the Evangelical Alliance, at its world's conference, in Florence, Italy, asking that the Alliance unite with them in petitioning for the closing of the World's Fair, in Chicago, on Sunday. Of the movement started by the Christian Statesman to establish another powerful and important branch of the National Reform Association in an Association of the Editors of Religious Newspapers, the report says:—

>It is believed that such an organization, with an annual conference for the discussion of matters pertaining to our common Christianity, would afford a noble opportunity for the advocacy of important truth. . . . Several of the editors of religious newspapers in Philadelphia united in an invitation to all of their associates to meet in the office of the Christian Statesman and consider the proposal. At this meeting nine religious papers were represented, and a committee was appointed to confer with the editors of religious newspapers throughout the United States, and, if the response should be favorable, to call a general preliminary conference to make arrangements for the first general meeting.

Anent this Association the Christian of Work remarks:—

>A movement having its genesis in Philadelphia, has been started for the formation of an association of editors of religious journals and periodicals. That such a movement contains possibilities for enlarged usefulness is undoubted. During the last score of years religious and social problems have come to the front as never before. . . . With nearly five hundred distinctively religious publications in the country, and with so much influence certainly in the religious press, the suggestion for an association of the editors of these publications seems to be timely and auspicious. It is certainly to be desired that editors should be in closer touch with each other, and be enabled to confer as to the best methods of securing greater efficiency for their work. The organization, we may add, should be practical and not merely ornamental, and should seek to accomplish definite results. . . . We hope to hear from this committee at an early date, and trust we shall soon see the projected association in a fair way to become an accomplished fact.
