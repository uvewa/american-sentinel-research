## Principle and Expediency.

[page 173]

Principle may either be safely ruled or a man's action otherwise by prudency, but there are persons whom on these great questions, it is. What is right? If they know what is right, they know what to do. "Right wrongs no man." Right will stand. The right road is the road well, and when these men have settled what is the right course, they have no further counsel to seek.

There are other persons who are controlled mainly what is expedient, what will please those whom they desire to please; what course will attract others; what will be likely to make trouble; what will ultimately tend to further their personal aims; and secure their personal advantage. The leaders of the greatest wrongs that have ever been done have been done under rules of expediency. The high-priest said "that it was expedient that one man [Christ] should die," and that the whole nation perish not. The *Man* died, but the nation did perish, as a consequence of disregarding righteousness and shedding the innocent blood of that one Man. So, wrong will always have perpetuated itself, on the ground of expediency, until honest men have warned against them and driven them away. Expediency is the plea of all multitudes; principle is the strength of the few.

If matters are to be settled by vote, the majority will not carry it; if they are to be settled on grounds of right, then one in right is stronger than a thousand who are wrong. Great bodies are naturally compelled on the principles of expediency. They must carry with them a majority. Those with vested rights, and ancient privileges, and heavy abuses, and things which would make it inexpedient for them to take the correct course, which sometimes declares that which might alienate their friends. They are strong because their strength is numerical. With them the questions of majorities and minorities are the great questions. If men, or nations however far previously, can be persuaded to inform a certain course, then they say so more, for they have a majority behind them. They do nothing without instructions, and as they do whatever the public will, the man of principle has one question to ask concerning every matter, that is, "Is it right? Is this thing the right thing to do? If it is, do it; if it is not, let it alone."

The man of principles may be mistaken, or may sometimes be wrong about secondary judgment. The man of policy may sometimes be right, when it seems politic and profitable. The man of principle will correct his wrong when he sees it, but the man of policy is likely to turn from the right if he can make or gain anything by turning.

It is of the utmost importance that men, who are in important measures, hold fast to the principle of right, and abandon all who are under their influence to steadfast adherence to right principle. This is their only security. If they descend to the lower ground of policy and self-interest, they are gone. They can not compete with others on these grounds. Others have more friends, more money, and more inducements, and unless their friends and supporters are trained to stand for the right, they will not stand at all.

It is a glorious thing to be on the right side, to know that one's ways please God, to be a pattern of faith, of courage, and of constancy, upheld by the faith of Christ and the power of God. The Lord stands by the man who are content to stand with him, though they stand alone. He who has said, "there shall not follow a multitude to do evil," gives justice to those men who through the blessings and the sufferings, the disabilities and the sufferings, that comes through steadfast adherence to the principles of truth and righteousness. Under the head of expediency great sacrifices may be assembled, great armies may be organized, and great battles may be done, but very done for God single-handed and alone, remains when the work of majorities and of crowds has passed away with the men who did it, and the things with the things that were.—*The Christian.*
