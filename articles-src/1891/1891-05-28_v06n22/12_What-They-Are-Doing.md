## What They Are Doing.

[page 174]

The Executive Committee of the National Reform Association lately met in the Young Men's Christian Association quarters, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and its proceedings reported, among other things, that a letter "had been manifolded by the typewriter and mimeograph and sent to more than one hundred and fifty pastors," asking them for "a sermon in behalf of the cause and a collection for its treasury."

It has also been incidentally "a canvass of enrollments of the friends of the cause, by States and counties, presenting them or performing the labor and using the names and addresses of those who are reported by workers in the held or associations to those principles and willing to co-operate in the work. Blanks have been prepared and ruled for this purpose capable of enrolling twenty thousand names above the names of congregations, and church connection of each.

A letter is also about to be sent to judges of the State and Federal Courts, "with reference to the propriety of prayer in courts of justice," and "asking cooperation."

It was also reported that the Sabbath question had been brought up in a recently Christian Temperance Union had joined with the National Reform Association in a letter to the Evangelistic Alliance, at its world's conference, in Florence, Italy, asking that the Alliance unite with the American Association for the closing of the World's Fair, in Chicago, on Sunday, of the movement started by the Christian Statesmen to establish one national reformed party branch of the National Reform Association in an Association of the Educators, and the reform of the general movement.)

It is believed that such an organization, with an annual conference for the discussion of matters pertaining to our common Christianity, would afford a noble opportunity for the advocacy of the truths. . . . . Several of the editors of religious newspapers in Philadelphia united in an invitation of that of their numbers to meet in the office of the *Christian Statesman* and consider the proposal. At this meeting nine religious papers were represented, and a committee was appointed to confer with the editors of religious newspapers throughout the United States, and ascertain whether the formation of such a religious press conference should be favorable; to call a general preliminary conference in June next.
