## The Abuse of Civil Government.

[page 169]

In our article on the "Use of Civil Government" we see that the only legitimate use was to protect the people in the exercise of their inherent rights, never to dictate to or direct them in the exercise of said rights. On this point, Mr. Bryce, in his "History of Civilization," says:—

> To maintain order, to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak, and to adopt certain precautions respecting the public health, are the only services which any government can render to the interests of civilization.

He also adds:—

> But the assumption which the historian is bound to combat is the notion that it was by governments this effect was produced. So far has this been the case, the exact reverse has been the truth; inasmuch as the most despotic governments have always been the most injurious, and as the progress of every European country has been in an inverse ratio to the authority which the civil power has exercised.

In this article on the abuse of civil government, it is not proposed to speak of those open and flagrant abuses of power, which, lying on the very surface of history, are recognized by all; but rather of those more subtle abuses of authority into which the possessor of power is often led even to the desire to benefit humanity. These are the abuses which are in danger of being repeated, and on these rests the whole religio-political movement of to-day, against which THE SENTINEL sharpens its shafts of logic and satire. The idea seems to everywhere exist, that the government is the proper means of reforming [page 170] the people, whereas the fact is, that the people are the only means of reforming the government. The National Reformers and all other religio-political organizations, seem to think that if a reformatory law can by any means be lobbied into the statute book, that reform is already far on its way toward completion; whereas I shall show that any attempt of government to reform the people or reform them morally, religiously or intellectually, must inevitably and invariably tend diametrically opposite to the desired result.

In any form of government, unless it be an absolute despotism, a law to be enforced must have a strong public opinion back of it. This opinion must represent, at least, the major influence if not the majority. In monarchies whatever the law is a dead letter. Our statute books are crowded with laws which are never enforced simply because the majority of the people have outgrown them. They ought to be repealed, for the open violation of so many dead laws, especially if they be only enacted statutes, tends to cultivate in the people a general feeling of disregard for all law whatsoever. But it is evident that no public opinion can be ever rightly created simultaneously on any theme of advanced thought. The history of the world has demonstrated that every advanced thought in science, in art, in literature, or in religion, has always come to come one man first. First there was one, then five, then three score who believed it, and the conflict was steadily maintained until the majority or the multitude accepted it.

Now, as law without public opinion back of it means nothing, tending directly upward first, and dissemination of all public opinion is always upward, it must be manifest that Government is always far behind the advanced opinion of the community on all subjects of progressive thought; it follows that government must always represent the conservative party and never the really progressive party, or party of reform. Therefore, whatever government goes beyond its legitimate sphere of simply protecting people in the exercise of their rights, and [page 170] seeks to dictate in the exercise of rights, and to direct the activities of the mind in any department of human thought, it must always tend toward reforms instead of reform; for real advance, and therefore all real reform, must come from the people, and if the government legislate on these things at all, by the very law of human nature, it must oppose and not advance them. This is proven not only by the laws of human progress, but by an appeal to the historical facts of civilization as well.

Every new truth has had its apostle, its Jesus, its Luther, its Bruno or its Galileo, persecuted and put to death for its sake, and all this because governments have not recognized the proper limits of their power.

Whenever the government has sought to hasten the advance of any department of human effort or thought, it has rarely matched it. Louis XIV. of France sought, honestly enough, it may be, to stimulate literary activity and taste, and to immortalize himself by printing his name down to posterity as the imperial patron of letters. For this purpose he made laws controlling great book fairs and vast trade in books. What was the result? Literalism, the patron of tariffs, of which, be it observed in passing, became chained to the soil of formalism, the representative of established tradition, the representative of existing fashion, of everything, in other words, that is stationary. Says Buckle:—

> In no age have literary men been erected into so privileged a body as in the reign of Louis XIV., and in no age has the spirit of literature been so servile, so utterly unfit to fulfil the great vocation of instructing the world, and of disseminating the truth.

Every tyranny believes in religion; but the tyranny of France is so religious only in the nature of a great many more pious published works in almost every department of his thought and inquiry, have come down to our own times, and are familiar as those who have looked at the sum of human knowledge. By this method of State patronage of literature, although much that was artistic and ornamental was at its period, all advanced thinking was stopped; and gradually the literary men of France, from being bold and free in their investigations, and in the search for truth, were transformed into a mere crowd of fawning courtiers who wrote but to flatter the vices of their sovereign. Without this France was at the head of all literary Europe, in literature more especially, had been raised clear and bright, was suddenly stayed in its sublime and upward course, and instead of leading the thought, the most resolute, and in the end, having the world in its shadow. In England, Newton was at this very time rising step by step to his sublimest generalizations; but in France even these wonderful discoveries were not accepted by the teachers of science till forty years after they were demonstrated by Newton. By literalism, which should be representative of the people, being thus servilely chained to the court, all its ingenuity and [page 170] influence were used to flatter the king, and blind his eyes to the pressing needs of the people, thus circumscribing him to consider and inquire and arbitrary system of legislation which resulted in the terrible French Revolution. Says Buckle:—

> There comes in the history of the world no lesson more instructive than this. In the days of Augustus, of Leo X, and of Louis XIV, the same methods were adopted, and the same result ensued. In each of those three cases there was much apparent success, and a display of genius which has excited the admiration of those ordinary minds which are content to be amused with the play and sparkle of an artificial literature; but when the enthusiasm has subsided, when the first surprise is over, we look around, and see how hollow and poor those stately fabrics were—how utterly unequal to resist the encroachments of time—how exclusively based on the precarious alliance of government and literature.

Surely it is the inevitable course of events that the government of every country must remodel the position the just authority, and instead of patronizing the people, must yield to increasingly recognize them. As much might be said of the attempts of government to encourage trade and commerce.

Says Buckle:—

> It is in consequence of this attempt to say that the commercial legislation of Europe presents every possible form of folly.

All this, mark you, was done by purely secular governments not in the interests of the Church or religion of any kind, but by the paternal care of government, seeking with best intentions, no doubt, to direct the citizens in the exercise of their rights. It was done to build up commerce, but so thoroughly did it break it down, that a man who will read the history of commerce, charges that if it had not been for smuggling, trade must have ceased entirely. The whole history of religious legislation is a history of the same thing. The opinion expressed by law is more often the opinion that should succeed, and if the legislation in some particular instance happens to be in favor of truth, it is still a curse to that very truth by corrupting its professors, and bringing it into disrepute before the world. On this point Buckle says:—

> We have seen that the laws in favor of industry have injured industry; that other laws in favor of religion have increased hypocrisy; and that those enacted to secure truth have encouraged an intolerance so frightful that one shudders at the thought. We would be easy to push the inquiry still further and show how legislation, in every attempt they have made to protect some particular interest, and uphold the principles of some particular profession, have failed, but have brought results diametrically opposed to those they proposed.

It will be seen by all this that the paternalistic interference of government has ever been a millstone hung around the neck of human progress. All this because "government having recognized its proper function than guardianship of the existing, the result is that every government dealing with its subjects great and small, and done this nearly always with the best intentions." "No great political improvement," even, "for any civilization, moral or religious reform," was ever originated, in any country by its rulers. The first suggestions of such steps have been, invariably, bold and able thinkers, who discern the abuse, denounce it, and point out how it is to be remedied. But long after this is done, the mass of the most enlightened governments continue to uphold the abuse, and repost the remedy. At length, [page 170] if circumstances are favorable, the progressive steps without becomes so strong that the government is obliged to give way; and the reform being accomplished, then the people are expected to admire the wisdom of their rulers, by whom all this has been done!

From the very laws of human progress, which are as unchangeable as the law of gravitation, this must ever be. The tendency to reform, and indeed the true line of development, is always from below upward. Any government should recognize its proper limit of authority; confine itself to the mere protecting of individuals in the exercise of their rights; and then the people will always find their own moral, intellectual, and religious progress and reform to the people's satisfaction.

If the National Reformers, the Prohibition party, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, would for one moment stop in their headlong rush into the untried and unacknowledgable use of power, their religio-political advance would not be made such an issue in the politics of this country.
