## Needs No State to Cite.

[page 173]

Christianity will prosper and do her work for good works and virtue, without the aid of human laws. She carries her way into families, schools, counties, and States not through legislation, but by the prayers and heavenly character of her professors. When she can at the best, her aide is not of legislation or of human efforts, when her royal lead in the legs of a worldly kingdom is no more a crown of gold, but the cross of her true king, it is the scepter of her strength. Christianity is of God, and she lives by laying hold of him; and grows all of real faith and good-will in acts of grace and not distrust her, nor profess her for her, for Christianity gains no more than she gives most, and she gives most when she gives that which is most her own. He said, "My kingdom is not of this world." If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight. I am a king, but my servants fight.

To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness into the truth."

Pilate was convinced by the sufferings and conduct of the Son of man, that he was no common criminal. Whether real or imaginary, it had reference to religion, and to the *State,* it rested in dangers to the secular and the religious. Pilate was tempted to make an case against the accused, and then to set him free. And this testimony of Pilate was in perfect harmony with all the whole host of life and beatitude, and later as the Christian Church grew and took so steep to connect his cause with the State, did her worst and her way dissolve into divisions.

It needed the support of the civil power. He provided for no statesmen or soldiers, or supreme judges to carry on his work as such, but only provided for preachers and teachers.

"The kingdom of Christ is independent of the State. It relies on truth, goodness, and with a view to higher interests, having laws and forces of its own that agree in character and work in harmony to the same great end, and that any attempt to mix the two will be attended with danger to the higher, if not to the lower."—*Rev.*
