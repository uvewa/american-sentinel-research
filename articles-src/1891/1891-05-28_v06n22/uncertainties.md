# Uncertainties Log: v06n22 (1891-05-28)

## General OCR Quality
The Mistral OCR transcription for this issue was generally good quality. Most text was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1
- Line 26: "ALONEO T. JONES" - appears to be OCR error for "ALONZO T. JONES" (corrected in transcription)

### Page 3
- Line 119: Author attribution "J. W. Scales" with location "Graysville, Tenn." - this appears to be the author of the article "The 'American' Sunday"

### Page 6
- Line 292: "W. A. COLOURD" - appears to be OCR error for "W. A. COLCORD" (corrected in transcription based on known author initials)

### Page 7-8
The pages contain primarily advertisements and subscription information which were not transcribed as per instructions.

### Page 8
- Line 701: "NEW YORK, MAA." - appears to be OCR error for "NEW YORK, MAY 28, 1891" (corrected in masthead based on issue date)

## Article Split Decisions

### Article 11: "Needs no State Aid"
- Author attributed as "Rev. T. D. Peake" based on signature at end of text
- This is not in the known authors list, so author_short assigned as "TDP"

### Article 4: "The 'American' Sunday"
- Author "J. W. Scales" with location "Graysville, Tenn." at end
- This is not in the known authors list, so author_short assigned as "JWS"

## Notes
- Several editorial notes were very brief (1-2 sentences) but each was given its own file per instructions
- All articles categorized according to timeless principles rather than specific historical events
