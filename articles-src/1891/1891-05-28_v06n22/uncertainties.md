# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 28, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 22)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from scanned PNG images (/tmp/as1891n22-1.png through /tmp/as1891n22-8.png). The scan quality varies across the pages, with some areas being quite difficult to read due to the resolution and contrast of the images. Many passages required significant interpretation.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 169-170, "The Abuse of Civil Government"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Multiple passages throughout this long article** were difficult to read with certainty due to image quality. The Buckle quotations and the author's arguments connecting history to the modern religio-political movement contain many phrases where individual words were inferred from context rather than clearly read.
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM — The overall argument and structure are clear, but many individual words and phrases may not be precisely correct.
- **Reason:** Small print in three-column format combined with moderate scan quality makes character-level accuracy difficult throughout.

### Page 170-171, "The 'American' Sunday" by J. W. Scoles
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Several passages** in the body of the article, particularly the argument about Dr. MacArthur's logic regarding the "American" Sunday as civil vs. religious, contain phrases that were difficult to read clearly.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Some text is blurry at the edges of columns.

### Page 171, "Sunday Street Cars in Philadelphia"
- **Transcribed as:** "Joannoble" — the name of the person arrested for driving a Green Street car
- **Confidence:** LOW — This name is unusual and may be misread
- **Reason:** The name is difficult to make out clearly in the scan

### Page 172, "The Scheme of Senator Edmunds"
- **Attribution:** This article ends with "—*The Sun.*" indicating it is a reprint from The Sun newspaper, not original Sentinel content
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The article's origin attribution was clear, but some of the body text was difficult to read

### Page 172, "It Is Un-American"
- **Multiple passages** in the quoted "Pearl of Days" text were very difficult to read
- **The list of names/officers** in the American Sabbath Union meeting report was particularly hard to parse
- **Confidence:** LOW — Many proper names and specific details may be inaccurate
- **Reason:** Very small type in dense column format

### Page 172, "They Demand a Recognition of the Christian Religion"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **The continuation onto page 173** left column was difficult to parse, with several sentences that may not be accurately transcribed
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

### Page 173, "Principle and Expediency"
- **Attribution:** Reprint from "The Christian"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Several phrases** in this article were unclear, particularly where the argument discusses governmental expediency
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 173, "Needs No State to Cite"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **The article appears to be a compilation** of thoughts on Christianity and civil power
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **The quotation at end** attributed to "Rev." appears to be truncated or the source name was cut off

### Page 174, "What They Are Doing"
- **Several passages** about the National Reform Association's activities were difficult to read clearly
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 174, "Reports From the Field"
- **The quoted letters** from various correspondents were somewhat clearer but still contained uncertain readings
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **The final quote** attributed to "Moody Deb." may have the attribution wrong — this could be "Moody Deb." or another source

### Page 174, "Rev. W. F. Crafts"
- **The quoted newspaper passages** from the Washington Press and Sigourney Iowa Review contain several phrases that were difficult to read
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Page 176, Short Editorial Notes
- **Multiple items on this page** contain uncertainties throughout
- **The President Harrison/Glenwood Springs commentary** from the Christian Statesmen was particularly dense and hard to read
- **The Metropolitan Museum Sunday opening item** contains specific numbers (80,000 signatures, specific minister names) that should be verified
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM across these items

## Overall Assessment

This issue presented significant challenges for OCR transcription due to:
1. Small type size in three-column format
2. Moderate scan resolution
3. Dense text with many proper names, legal references, and quoted material
4. Several articles spanning multiple pages/columns

Many passages throughout this transcription should be considered approximate rather than character-perfect. A review against higher-quality scans would be beneficial to improve accuracy.
