THE Independent has the following note concerning the World's Fair:—

>It is stated that Mr. Thomas A. Edison has used his influence with the Directors of the World's Fair in favor of Sunday opening. At the same time we hear it said that an ex-Postmaster General, who was largely instrumental in having the Fair given to Chicago, regards it as a foregone conclusion that its gates will be opened on Sunday. We believe that the Directors are disposed to decide the matter as Mr. Edison and the ex-Cabinet officer have indicated. It is well for the friends of the Sabbath to know that they must use the most strenuous efforts if they would prevent this intended desecration. The weight of influence on the wrong side is heavy. All who are engaged in Sunday traffic are glad of the opportunity to express their views against Sabbatarianism, as they call it, and the Directors themselves want the gate money which Sunday opening would be sure to bring them. Resistance to Sunday opening must become more resolute, or the enemies will be victorious. The arguments seem to us to be all on one side, and the public should be so plied with them that it will make its opinion felt. The only two classes likely to hail Sunday opening with satisfaction are those who expect to make money out of it and the runsellers.

It would be interesting to know to which of the two classes, mentioned by the Independent, Mr. Edison and the ex-Cabinet officer alluded to belong. The Independent does not, however, speak advisedly when it says that only "those who expect to make money out of it and the runsellers" want the Fair open on Sunday. A closed Fair would insure a Sunday harvest for Chicago saloons, but an open Fair will furnish other attractions for visitors. The zeal of the Sunday-law advocates often runs away with their discretion.
