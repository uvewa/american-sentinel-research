Christianity will prosper and do her work for good morals and virtue, without the aid of the State. She will find her way into families, schools, counties, and scatter her blessings through her agencies, and all the better for being left to herself. When she leans on the sword, her side is in danger of being pierced; when she rests her royal head in the lap of a worldly State, she is plundered of the golden locks of her strength. Christianity is of God, and she lives by laying hold of him; and grows by self-denial and self-sacrifice. The State need not distrust her, nor provide for her, for Christianity gains most when she gives most, and she gives most when she feels most the need of giving. Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight. . . . I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth."

Pilate was convinced by the divine bearing and candor of the Son of man, that whatever might be his authority, whether real or imaginary, it had reference to religion, and not to the State; it rested in to degree upon the secular arm, and contemplated in no case an appeal to the secular power. And this testimony of Jesus was in perfect harmony with the whole tenor of his life and teaching. He took no step to connect his cause with the State as such. He threw out no hint that it needed the support of the civil power. He provided for no statesmen or soldiers, or supreme judges to carry on his work as such, but only provided for preachers and teachers.

The kingdom of Christ is independent of the State, ruling in a higher sphere and with a view to higher interests, having laws and forces of its own that agree in character and work in harmony to the same great end, and that any attempt to unite the two will be attended with danger to the higher, if not to the lower.
