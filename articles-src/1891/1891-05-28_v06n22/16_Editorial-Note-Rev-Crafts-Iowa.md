Rev. W. F. CRAFTS, in his lecture tour is now making his way through Iowa. A short time since he spoke in the lively little city of Washington, on his favorite hobby of closing all the stores, saloons, etc., on Sunday. The editor of the Washington Press made quite an extended comment on his work from which we select the following paragraphs:—

>If this one man can make it so that 500 men in this orderly city, representing 3,000 people, can't get a letter or paper on Sunday; that is if he can regulate their conduct in these two respects, he could on precisely the same grounds and methods of procedure go a few steps further and regulate all our doings on that day—pen us up in our grounds, for example, or make us go to church, or make us do anything. We say he has no business to meddle with us in any respect. We are not poor fools; we are not little children unable to prescribe our conduct. Who made this New Yorker a pope, a dictator, a critic, a censor for the people of Washington, Iowa? Nobody, except those among us who fall into his trap. . . .

>It makes us tired to see these folks who have such an insatiable passion to regulate somebody. . . . Are we not capable of self-government? of regulating our own conduct? Of doing our duty and of respecting the feelings of others?—Let's stand, each on our own feet, use our own heads, and be men and women.

The Sigourney, Iowa, Review, under the caption of "Too Much Brother's Keeper," offered some excellent comments on the article in the Press. The following are some of the statements of the Review:

>This question promises to become a prominent one in the politics of this country before long. Christ told his disciples that his kingdom is not of this world, and again and again warned them against any attempts to advance His spiritual government by force and the strong arm of the law. Christ seemed to prefer the cheerful, voluntary service of free men rather than the blind and servile obedience of slaves. But the Christian world has made rapid strides since the dawn of the Christian era, and the slow process of the elevation of fallen man by the cultivation of the nobler promptings of the heart, as taught by Christ, are becoming obsolete, and the rapid process of running mankind through the pearly gates in job lots, by legal enactment, has almost entirely suspended the system of free grace.

>It seems, in this generation, that when a man experiences religion, . . . he gets it into his head that he ought to be his brother's keeper, and regulate the life and habits of his fellow man, and make them conform to his own. There is a principle in human nature that makes us delight in having everybody else do as we do, and we are very indignant when they decline our suggestions, and propose to follow the dictates of their own judgment.

>This class of reformers is becoming quite numerous just now. They are clamoring for a national law to give them the power to stifle freedom of conscience in spiritual matters, to fine and imprison men like Mr. King, of Tennessee, who have read their Bible by the light of reason, and arrived at a different reckoning, and prefer to be governed by their own individual judgment in such matters, rather than whims that more accomplished wire-working zealots have bulldozed the body politic into engrafting into law.

Sunday, May 3, Mr. Crafts was in Des Moines and presented his usual plea for Sunday laws. The friends of religious liberty were on hand with a good supply of literature so that the people might see both sides of the question. He promises to spend several weeks yet in Iowa.
