The Law and Order Society, of Philadelphia, has inaugurated a new movement against Sunday street cars in that city. The following facts we condense from the New York Sun:—

The running of street cars in Philadelphia on Sunday has been rendered possible only through a legal loophole. As far back as April 15, 1839, a local offender named Jeandelle was arrested for driving a Green Street car on a Sunday afternoon. Arraigned for his offense before a police magistrate, the aid of the Supreme Court was invoked under authority of a writ of habeus corpus. Jeandelle had been charged with disorderly conduct in having violated the act of 1794. The lawyer contended that Jeandelle violated the law of 1794 in an orderly, and not in a disorderly fashion. The Judge finally discharged the prisoner.

Nothing further was done about the matter for eight years, when a citizen named Sparhawk took the popular agitation in hand, and demanded of the Supreme Court an injunction against the Union Passenger Railway Company, which he alleged was putting the law of 1794 at defiance, by running cars on Sunday, at long and irregular intervals, through the otherwise quiet streets of Philadelphia. Judge Strong granted a temporary injunction, but an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, and the full bench of Judges heard the interesting argument. Judge Thompson delivered the opinion of the Court, which was, it appears, elaborate in its treatment of the subject. "I fully concede," declared Judge Thompson, "that the opinion of my brother Strong, and the law and authorities referred to by him, establish very clearly that the business of running cars on the Lord's day commonly called Sunday, is a violation of the act of 1794. Driving a public conveyance for hire on Sunday, is a violation of the act inflicting the penalty of $4 for performing worldly employment on the Lord's day commonly called Sunday. Rest and quiet on the Sabbath day with the right and privilege of public and private worship, undisturbed by any mere worldly employment, are what the statute was passed to protect." "Unfortunately, however," says the Sun, "for the cause of tranquility, soberness, and sleep, the inevitable Philadelphia lawyer, the paid emissary of darkness, the subsidized champion of corporate recklessness and greed, and the ready apologist for offending drivers and conductors, was on hand with his familiar scheme of legal cunning. He averred that an injunction was an equitable relief in a case where no remedy existed at law; and as, in this instance, there was a remedy at law ($4 fine) no injunction should be granted. The Court took this view of the case and threw Mr. Sparhawk's suit, so to speak, into the Susquehanna."

Baffled at this point the opponents of street car running on Sunday did nothing for the next fourteen years; but recently Mr. Vail of the Law and Order Society appeared upon the scene and arranged the preliminaries for another tussle with these corporations. His attitude is defined by our learned contemporary, the Philadelphia Times, in these words:—

>Mr. Vail resolutely contends that there is no necessity for Sunday cars, not even for people who attend divine worship. They should all live near the church they attend or attend the church that is near them. It should never be necessary for a pastor to take a car to deliver a sermon. He should reside near his church.

It is not to be supposed that, concerning a matter of such importance, all minds should be of one accord in Philadelphia, and it is therefore not easy to ascertain how popular sentiment in that town, now fully aroused, against the running of cars on Sundays, will manifest itself, whether in the destruction of the cars themselves, the tearing up the tracks, the social ostracism of the offending drivers and conductors, the devastation of the homes of the stockholders, or by recourse to more pacific though less promising measures of a more commonplace character. "I do not know," so Mr. Vail is reported, "that any proceedings are, for the present, to be taken against the running of street cars on Sunday." The Rev. Dr. Fernley, however, has called a meeting of the Law and Order Society, and it is stated that he is "determined to push the Sunday movement for all there is in it."
