THE Mail and Express finds fault with Professor Briggs because he declared that if the church tribunals decided against him he would appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Editor Shepard says:—

>What a disgrace it is to the Union Theological Seminary that their whimsical Professor Briggs should throw his arms about the Presbytery and shout out that he appeals to the civil power! . . . Dr. Briggs wishes now to make his attempt to unite Church and State by showing that he can use the sword against his brethren of the Presbytery.

And yet the Mail and Express insists that Sunday laws, the exemption of church property from taxation, religious services in the public schools, etc., have in them no elements of a union of Church and State! Marvelous are the distinctions made by National Reformers!
