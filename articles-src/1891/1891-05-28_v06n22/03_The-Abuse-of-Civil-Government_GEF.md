IN our article on the "Use of Civil Government" we saw that its only legitimate use was to protect the people in the exercise of their inherent rights, never to dictate to or direct them in the exercise of said rights. On this point, Mr. Buckle, in his "History of Civilization," says:

>To maintain order, to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak, and to adopt certain precautions respecting the public health, are the only services which any government can render to the interests of civilization.

He also adds:

>But the accusation which the historian is bound to bring against every government which has hitherto existed is, that it has overstepped its proper functions, and, at each step, has done incalculable harm.

In this article on the abuse of civil government, I do not propose to speak of those open and flagrant abuses of power, which, lying on the surface of history, are recognized by all; but rather of those more subtle abuses of authority into which the possessor of power is often led even by the desire to benefit humanity. These are the abuses which are in danger of being repeated, and on these rests the whole religio-political movement of to-day, against which THE SENTINEL sharpens its shafts of logic and sarcasm. The idea seems to everywhere exist, that the government is the proper means of reforming the people, whereas the fact is, that the people are the only means of reforming the government. The National Reformers and all other religio-political organizations, seem to think that if a reformatory law can by any means be lobbied into the statute book, that reform is already far on its way toward completion, whereas I shall show that any attempt of government to reform the people or advance them morally, religiously or intellectually, must inevitably tend diametrically opposite to the desired result.

In any form of government, unless it be an absolute despotism, a law to be enforced must have a strong public opinion back of it. This opinion must represent, at least, the major influence if not the majority in numbers, otherwise the law is a dead letter. Our statute books are crowded with laws which are never enforced simply because the majority of the people have outgrown them. They ought to be repealed, for the open violation of such dead laws, especially if they be newly enacted statutes, tends to create a disregard for all law and a contempt for all government. But it is evident that no such public opinion can ever originate simultaneously on any theme of advanced thought. The history of the world has demonstrated that every advanced thought in science, in art, in literature, or in religion, has always come to some one man first. First there was one, then two, then three who believed it, and the conflict was long and perilous before the majority or the multitude accepted it.

Now, as law without public opinion is worse than useless, tending directly toward disrespect for, and disobedience of, all law; and as public opinion is always necessarily far behind the advanced opinion of the minority on all subjects of progressive thought, it follows that government must always represent the conservative party and never the really progressive party, or party of reform. Therefore, whenever government goes beyond its legitimate sphere of simply protecting people in the exercise of their rights, and seeks to dictate in the exercise of rights, and to direct the activities of the mind in any department of human thought, it must always tend toward deform instead of reform; for real advance, and therefore all real reform, must come from the people, and if the government legislates on these things at all, by the very law of human progress, it must oppose them, and hinder them. This is proven not only by the laws of human progress, but by an appeal to the historical facts of civilization as well.

Every new truth has had its apostle,—its Jesus, its Luther, its Bruno or its Gallileo, persecuted or put to death for its sake, and all this because governments have not recognized the proper limits of their power.

Whenever the government has sought to hasten the advance of any department of human effort or thought, it has really retarded it. Louis XIV. of France sought, honestly enough, it may be, to stimulate literary activity in France, and to immortalize himself by sending his name down to posterity as the imperial patron of letters. For this purpose he made laws conferring great honors and vast sums of money upon the successful literary man. What was the result? Literature, the representative of intellect, which is progressive, became chained to the wheels of government, the representative of order, which is stationary. Says Buckle:—

>In no age have literary men been rewarded with such profuseness as in the reign of Louis XIV., and in no age have they been so mean-spirited, so servile, so utterly unfit to fill their great vocation as the apostles of knowledge and the missionaries of truth.

Immediately before his reign, the history of France is scintillant with the names of great men whose published works in almost every department of human thought and inquiry, have come down to our own time, and are famous as those who have added to the sum of human knowledge. By this system of State patronage of literature, although much that was artistic and ornamental was at first produced, all advanced thinking was stayed; and gradually the literary men of France, from being bold and free in their thinking, and in the search for truth, were transformed into a mere crowd of fawning courtiers who wrote but to flatter the vices of the king and the court. In France it was as though the sun of knowledge, which had risen clear and bright, was suddenly stayed in its sublime ascent toward the zenith, and receding, set in the east, leaving the world in the shadow.

In England, Newton was at this very time rising step by step to his sublime generalizations; but in France even these wonderful discoveries were not accepted by the teachers of science till forty years after they were demonstrated by Newton. By literature, which should be representative of the people, being thus servilely chained to the court, all its ingenuity and its influence were used to flatter the king, and blind his eyes to the pressing needs of the people, thus encouraging him to continue that unjust and arbitrary system of legislation which resulted in the terrible French Revolution. Says Buckle:—

>Three times in the history of the world has this experiment been tried. In the ages of Augustus, of Leo X., and of Louis XIV., the same method was adopted, and the same result ensued. In each of these ages there was much apparent splendor, immediately succeeded by sudden ruin. In each instance the brilliancy survived the independence; and in each instance the national spirit sank under the pernicious alliance of government and literature.

Such is the inevitable result of government exceeding its just authority, and seeking to encourage literature. As much might be said of the attempt of governments to encourage trade and commerce. Says Buckle:—

>It is no exaggeration to say that the commercial legislation of Europe presents every possible contrivance for hampering the energies of commerce.

All this, mark, was done by the paternal care of government, seeking with best of intention, no doubt, to direct the citizens in the exercise of their rights. It was done to build up commerce, but so thoroughly did it break it down, that a very high authority on the subject declares, that if it had not been for smuggling, trade must have ceased entirely.

The whole history of religious legislation is a history of the same thing. The opinion opposed by law is more often the opinion that should succeed, and if the legislation in some particular instance happens to be in favor of truth it is still a curse to that very truth by corrupting its professors, and bringing it into disrepute before the world. On this point Buckle says:—

>We have seen that their laws in favor of industry have injured industry; that their laws in favor of religion have increased hypocrisy; and that their laws to secure truth have encouraged perjury; it would be easy to push the inquiry still further and show how legislators, in every attempt they have made to protect some particular interest, and uphold some particular principle, have not only failed, but have brought about results diametrically opposite to those they proposed.

It will be seen by all this that the paternal interference of government has ever been a millstone hung around the neck of human progress. All this because "no government having recognized its proper limits (the mere maintenance of rights), the result is that every government has inflicted on its subjects great injuries; and has done this nearly always with the best intentions." "No great political improvement" even, far less any intellectual, moral or religious reform, "was ever originated in any country by its rulers. The first suggesters of such steps have been, invariably, bold and able thinkers, who discern the abuse, denounce it, and point out how it is to be remedied. But long after this is done, even the most enlightened governments continue to uphold the abuse, and reject the remedy. At length, if circumstances are favorable, the pressure from without becomes so strong that the government is obliged to give way; and the reform being accomplished, the people are expected to admire the wisdom of their rulers, by whom all this has been done."

From the very laws of human progress, which are as unchangeable as the law of gravitation, this must ever be so. The conclusion is evident, and unavoidable; civil government should recognize its proper limit of authority, which is the mere protecting of individuals in the exercise of their rights, and should ever and always leave all moral, intellectual, and religious progress and reform to the people.

If the National Reformers, the Prohibition party, the Woman's Christian Temerance Union, and the American Sabbath Union, would for one moment grasp in their beclouded minds this one evident and unchangeable law of progress, their religio-political schemes would at once and forever vanish into thin air.
