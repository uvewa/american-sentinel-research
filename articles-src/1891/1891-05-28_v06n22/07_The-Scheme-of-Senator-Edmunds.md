The resignation of Senator Edmunds does not take effect until next November, and meanwhile, he says, he will exert his most strenuous efforts and use all his influence to bring about the establishment of a great National University at Washington.

It is an old hobby of his, and a select committee to report on the scheme was appointed through his efforts in the Senate. His main purpose, his controlling motive, according to his own words, is to set up, at the expense of the Federal Government, "a great non-sectarian university, an institution which should make plain the liberality of Protestant as compared with the narrowness of Papal power."

It may be very desirable and very important to make this manifestation; but it is not the business of the United States Government to undertake the job. This Government is not a religious power, either Roman Catholic or Protestant, and it has nothing to do with religious competitions. The sovereignty here rests in the people, and they are made up of Catholics and Protestants, Jews and pagans, and people of no religion at all. Every citizen is free to think as he pleases about religious matters, and the Constitution protects him in that freedom. Any Church can set up a university or as many universities as it likes, and teach whatever religious dogmas it prefers; and the question which are liberal and which narrow, must be left to the people themselves. They can support those they like and reject those whose instruction is offensive to them. It is a free field in which everybody has a chance. The Roman Catholics have as much right in it as the Protestants, the Jews as much as the Christians.

Accordingly, the Government can not enter into the competition by throwing its power in favor of any religious party, without outraging the fundamental principles of our political system. It is not its function to teach any religion or to oppose any religion, to show Protestant "liberality" or to expose Papal "narrowness." Each of those religious families must do its own showing, opposing, and exposing for itself.

Outside of all questions of religion, too, the scheme for a National University at Washington, founded and maintained by the Government, is impracticable and absurd. What principles of political economy, for instance, would it teach? Should it change them with the changes of political control of the Government? If Congress sets up the university, it must regulate its curriculum and its policy and theory of education. As the political complexion of Congress varies, those would have to vary also.

Moreover, there is no occasion, no need for such a university. What is desirable rather, is the development of the universities which we already have. Non-sectarian education is already provided by most of them, and they carry liberality to its extreme.

If the Pope is to be converted, the conversion must be effected by some other power than the United States. Senator Edmunds will be at liberty next November to take hold of the job on his own account.
