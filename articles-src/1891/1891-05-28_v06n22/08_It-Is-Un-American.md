The "Pearl of Days," of May 2, has the following relative to the work of the so-called American Sabbath Union:—

>The second quarterly meeting of the Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union was held at No. 23 Park Row, New York, April 27. The following members of the Board were present: Rev. Drs. J. M. King, J. Elmendorf, G. S. Mott, L. Williams, J. H. Knowles, and W. J. R. Taylor, and Messrs. R. N. Perlee, W. R. Worrall, A. S. Bacon and W. Irwin. The Corresponding Secretary, Rev. Dr. W. J. R. Taylor, gave a full and interesting account of Sabbath observance in Washington, D. C., and of his labors in that city during the past quarter. The General Secretary reported in respect to the publications of the Union, the official correspondence, the work of organizing the States and recent efforts to prevent obnoxious Sunday legislation. The Board unanimously commended the *American Sabbath*, the new official organ of the Union, and readjusted certain parts of the work in distant States, with a view to increased efficiency. The reports indicated hopeful progress, organizing new societies and establishing those already existing.

The officers of the Union are manifesting a zeal worthy of a better cause, and notwithstanding the bad blood that showed itself at Philadelphia, last December, the organization is making its influence felt.

In discussing the work of the Union the "Pearl of Days" says:—

>The most urgent need of this hour is a deeper conviction respecting the holy Sabbath—its divine purpose, its unchanging perpetuity, its necessity to man's highest intellectual and moral development. How may this conviction become universal? The evangelical pulpit of our country is charged with this responsibility. The home and the school may co-operate with the pulpit. Societies organized with this in view may assist in molding public sentiment. In addition to these agencies the public press may be enlisted. Throughout the whole land these and kindred forces should unite in the all-important work of impressing the conscience. In this way a holier type of Sabbath observance will follow, and God's blessing will abundantly enrich all souls.

>The American Sabbath Union seeks this end. It proposes no partisan alliance, no special religious forms, no substitute for the Church. It will inculcate Scriptural sentiments and enforce Christian obligations. It will exalt the Sabbath—God's bright, cheerful day. It will show how the weekly rest is a necessity to our nature, and the security of our civil commonwealth. It will encourage the enforcement of the Sunday laws—earnestly, judiciously. It will especially aim to strengthen the friends of the Lord's day in united effort. We ask for our American Sabbath Union a hearty recognition.

By "the school" we presume the "Pearl" means the public schools; but by what right it would use the public school to create "a deeper conviction respecting the holy Sabbath—its divine purpose, its unchanging perpetuity," does not appear. Certain it is that this is something that the public school has no right to teach. The suggestion shows the dangerous and utterly un-American character of this so-called American Sabbath Union—a Union that would manipulate the public schools in the interest of its dogmas.
