## The "American" Sunday.

[page 170]

At a Sunday-law meeting recently held in New York City, under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, the Rev. R. S. MacArthur, D. D., expressed himself after the following fashion:—

> The man who lifts his hand against the American Sunday, lifts his hand against the American Republic. Do not tell me that you want, or that you have any right to the German Sunday or the French Sunday, or any Continental Sunday. We are in America; and as this is the first day of the new week, it is the first day of a new era.

That is, he wants the American Sunday. But what is the "American" Sunday? Let us ask the American Sabbath Union and the *Mail and Express* of May 4:—

> For once, we will attempt to define what that is. In 1789 Washington was solemnly consecrated to the service of God; he took his oath on the Bible with his hand; and the officers of the Government were with him. The ceremonies were entirely of a Christian character. It was the first act of the Nation. From the very first the laws of the Colonies and States against Sabbath-breaking have been vigorously enforced; and this, added to the profound and universal religious sentiment of the people, has given to our national rest-day its peculiar character. It is not a day of mere abstinence from labor. It is a day of worship. It is the Lord's day. It is a Christian institution.

This is essentially the "American" Sunday. This being the case, what right have other nations with our property? Isn't it about time the Government was making armed cruisers to the different ports of the world, with the demand that those nations immediately relinquish their claims to our "American" Sunday? Perhaps one nation must not be allowed to do something in this country, and it is clearly the height of absurdity to allow our "American" Sunday to be boldly appropriated in this manner.

[page 171]

But, according to Dr. MacArthur, it is a crime against the whole human race to oppose the "American" Sunday. However, this is not at all satisfactory to the *American Sentinel.* It has no business to be so misused, either by Dr. MacArthur or by any one else. If it is American property, it is clearly in quiet opposition to its history to be so used as anything else in the American Constitution for other nations. And yet, whoever opposes it is "an enemy of God." Why should this be the case? Does it mean that the usefulness of universal government is to be a mere window out of which the world by looking through, or does it mean that the advocates of Sunday law have but one card to play, and one which in the main supposition that they can not see the contradiction in their own arguments?

It is an institution or a right to be effective only within the limits of the power which is behind the law. In Dr. MacArthur's case, Dr. MacArthur gets things really mixed when he declares that the individual who opposes the American Sunday is "an enemy of God." Why should this be, if Sunday is an "American" institution and simply a "civil matter?" How can Dr. MacArthur believe that the civil law carries its authority into the hands of this Government, that it may thus assume jurisdiction over the rest of the world and legislate the institution this "American" Sunday especially upon all men? This is so preposterously prepositerous as to be scarcely worthy of a moment's notice; yet it is, nevertheless, a fair inference drawn from Dr. MacArthur's logic. The demand, however, then only one conclusion can be held, and that is, that it is the religious enforcement of the day which is causing him so much concern, after all.

Inasmuch as these views were spoken at a meeting held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, which is itself a powerful auxiliary of the National Reform party, and engaged in the same work, we can safely adopt them as outlining the policy of all National Reformers, so-called. It is, then, stripped of all disguise, simply an effort to pass laws to enable human authority to assume its vice prerogatives; to clothe itself with civil power to enforce its own usurpation of the divine will. It is the carrying out of the same principles which gave rise to the tyrannical rule of Romanism in the early centuries of the Christian era, and is a masterful backward step to link [page 171] those who also in the supposed of the civil and religious rights of the present century. So surely as these principles are ever allowed to prevail again, and especially in our own Government, so surely may we expect a re-enactment of the scenes which cause except the memory of the Dark Ages to come down to us stained with the blood of martyrs and lurid with the light of the fires which were kindled to coerce the consciences of honest men.
