## They Demand a Recognition of the Christian Religion.

[page 172]

In any evidence is still required to show that that which the American Sabbath Union demands of the Directors of the World's Fair, is a recognition of the day as a religious institution. It is supplied by the following editorial from the *Mail and Express* of May 4:—

> For once, we will attempt to define what that is. In 1789 Washington was solemnly consecrated to the service of God; he took his oath on the Bible; and the officers of the Government were with him. The ceremonies were entirely of a Christian character. It was the first act of the Nation. From the very first the laws of the Colonies and States against Sabbath-breaking have been vigorously enforced; and this, added to the profound and universal religious sentiment of the people, has given to our national rest-day its peculiar character. It is not a day of mere abstinence from labor. It is a day of worship. It is the Lord's day. It is a Christian institution.

It follows that if the demand is sustained in its real character, the result is that the United States Government recognizes that Congress has no right to make any law respecting an establishment of religion.

They say that and expect the Christian nation of the United States will both refuse from sending exhibits to the Exposition and also from attending the Exposition themselves. No doubt, until a very score upon them financially that the Directors will yield, and grant the wishes of the pious plotters of the Exposition.

The leaders of the United States are determined in this matter: Either the Sabbath is to be observed, or the World's Fair must be closed. In no way lend it their aid and countenance. They are in dead earnest. And yet, in the face of the absurd pronunciamento voiced upon the Sabbath, the plotters hiding all their cherished political plans, which have raised upon the Commission about
