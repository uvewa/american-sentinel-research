## Another Sunday Association.

[page 171]

In addition to the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, the Chicago Sunday Rest League, and a number of other in the shape of the Sabbath Day Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the Sunday plank in the prohibition platform, the "Columbian Sunday Association," another church organization for the creation of public sentiment in favor of Sunday legislation, has recently sprung into being.

Rev. James P. Mills is advertised as Financial Secretary of this Association, with office at 185 Dearborn Street Floor 5, Chicago, Ill. This same gentleman in 1890-93 acted as District Secretary of [page 172] the North Ohio Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in their annual session appointed him State Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and in 1890 the same Conference appointed him as general and field Secretary of their "sixth district," which embraces the States of Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. It will thus be seen that the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Columbian Sunday Association are, in essence, all one. The success of one will be the success of the others, and a greater calamity will never befall this country, nor a greater apostasy occur in Protestantism, than when the cherished and hallowed and all the teaching of religion by law—shall be molded.
