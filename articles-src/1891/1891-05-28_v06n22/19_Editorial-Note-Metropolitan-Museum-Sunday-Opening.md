ON the 18th inst., the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in this city, decided by a vote of twelve to four to open the Museum on Sunday from 1 o'clock P. M. until half an hour before sunset.

The petition for Sunday opening had 30,000 signatures. Among the signers were the following ministers: Rev. W. S. Rainsford, Rev. David H. Greer, Rev. Lyman Abbott, Rev. Theodore C. Williams, Rev. R. Heber Newton, Rev. H. Morton Reed, Rev. Edward B. Brady, Rev. A. B. Hart, Rev. Anthony Lammel, Rev. William C. French, Rev. S. W. Young. The counter petition, that against Sunday opening, bore the names of thirty-eight ministers.

One of the reasons urged against opening the Museum on Sunday, was, that to open the museums on Sunday seems to them to be a perilous experiment opening the way to Sunday theaters and operas, beer gardens, music and dance halls, and the other features of what is called a continental Sunday, thus compelling a large class to work on that day for the pleasure of others, breaking down the principle of the equal right of all to the Sunday rest and impairing that popular reverence for the Lord's day, which ex-sacrifice in Europe and our Western cities clearly proves to be the one effective defense of Sunday as a rest day.

The petition for Sunday opening was accompanied by a communication from the Central Labor Union declaring that it was approved by all the labor unions. There was also a petition of the Working People's Committee, Charles B. Storer, Secretary. This petition says that "while certain 'ladies' and 'gentlemen'" have been circulating a petition for Sunday opening, workingmen and working women, who know what they are asking for, have done the same thing independently and have obtained the indorsement of organized labor. The petition says that "the statement that workingmen don't want the Metropolitan Museum open on Sunday is false. To the argument that Sunday opening will tend to make Sunday another day of labor, the New York workingman replies that he is prepared to prevent any such intrusion on his rights. As he is now able to determine the number of hours he shall labor a day, so can he also determine the number of days he shall labor in the week."

By Sunday opening, the Museum will lose a few small bequests made upon condition that it should not be open the first day of the week.
