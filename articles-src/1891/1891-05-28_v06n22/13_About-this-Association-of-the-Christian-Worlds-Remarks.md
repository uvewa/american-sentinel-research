## About this Association of the Christian World's Remarks.

[page 174]

A movement having its genesis in Philadelphia, has been started for the formation of an Association of editors of religious journals and periodicals. That such a movement contains possibilities for great usefulness is undoubted. During the last of some of years religious and social problems have pressed constantly for solution. There are certainly five hundred distinctly religious publications in the United States, and their influence, favorably to the religious press, the suggestion for the establishment of some such organization seems to be timely and auspicious. It is certainly to be desired that editors should be in closer touch with each other, and be enabled to confer as to the best methods of attending to and disseminating their work. The organizations, we may add, should be practical and not merely ornamental, and should seek to accomplish definite results. We hope to hear from the convention at no early date, and trust we what cost we the projected association in its way to become an accomplished fact.
