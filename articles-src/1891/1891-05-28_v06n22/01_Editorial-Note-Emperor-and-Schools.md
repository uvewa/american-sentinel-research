It is said that at an educational conference, held in Germany not long since, the Emperor declared that he would make it his sacred duty, as the head of the nation, to promote the inculcation of a moral and Christian spirit in the public schools. However indefinite the expression which the Emperor may have used, it is yet quite sufficient for those who desire to see governmental authority assert itself for the promulgation of religious doctrine and the enforcement of observances accepted by the majority as Christian, to find in this imperial voice much food for gratulation as to the rapid and widespread advance of their crusade for the establishment of a world wide political religion.
