ANIMADVERTING upon the President's failure to keep Sunday at Glenwood Springs according to the National Reform order, and the reasons for that failure, the Christian Statesman says:—

>The highest respect which the people of Colorado could have shown the President would have been by respecting his well known convictions and wishes concerning the Sabbath rest. But they must have their gala day, even at the expense of the man whom they professed to honor. They could not forego the opportunity to press upon his mind their free silver coinage ideas. They invaded his private car with delegations as soon as he had risen in the morning. They pursued him with their attentions all day long, until he felt compelled to make a start on his journey in order to escape them. In so doing he set a much-to-be-regretted example to the assembled thousands who witnessed his departure. And we can not refrain from adding that if the President had halted his train at midnight Saturday, and passed the Sabbath quietly on a siding west of Glenwood Springs, he would have administered a deserved reproof to the crowd who were waiting to rob him of his day of rest. The necessity of law for the protection of every citizen in his right to the boon of the Sabbath was never more clearly illustrated. The very people who cheered the President's remarks in favor of the Sabbath were trampling all day long on his right to the day, and on the rights of all who that day were constrained to serve their pleasure or their convenience.

We may misunderstand the Statesman, but it would seem that our contemporary thinks there should be a law forbidding people to call upon the President on Sunday, and possibly a clause forbidding the President to receive visitors upon that day. If Mr. Harrison had been exceedingly anxious to enjoy a quiet Sunday he might, as the Statesman suggests, have had his car side-tracked west of Glenwood Springs instead of spending four hours of Sunday traveling to reach that place. But Mr. Harrison did not see fit to do that way, and we can not agree that the civil law ought to undertake to answer the petition, "Lead us not into temptation." The President spent the first four hours of Sunday in getting into the way of temptation, and we doubt if any amount of civil law would have altered the case in the least.

Or does the Statesman wish to be understood as intimating that the President would have had more respect for a civil law than he has for what he understands to be a divine law? If the Statesman does not mean this, we fail to see the clearness of the illustration.
