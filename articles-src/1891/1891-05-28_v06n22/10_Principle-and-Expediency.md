Human action may be either ruled by principle or swayed by expediency. There are persons whose one great question is, What is right? If they know what is right, they know what to do. "Right wrongs no man." Right will stand. The right road is the safe road, and when once these men have settled what is the right course, they have no further concern in the matter.

There are other persons who consider mainly what is expedient, what will please those whom they desire to please; what course will avoid offense; what will be likely to make trouble; what will naturally tend to further their personal aims and secure their personal advantage.

Some of the greatest wrongs that have ever been done have been done under plea of expediency. The high-priest said "that it was expedient that one man [Christ] should die," "and that the whole nation perish not." The one Man died, but the nation did perish, as a consequence of disregarding righteousness and shedding the innocent blood of that one Man. So, many wrongs have been perpetrated, simply on the ground of expediency, until honest men have warred against them and driven them away. Expediency is the plea of the multitude; principle is the strength of the few.

If matters are to be settled by vote, the majority will carry the day; if they are to be settled on grounds of right, then one who is right is stronger than a thousand who are wrong. Great bodies often proceed on the principles of expediency. They must carry with them a majority; there are vested rights, and ancient privileges, and hoary abuses, and things which render it inexpedient for them to take the course which conscience dictates and which might alienate their friends. They are strong because their strength is numerical. With them the question of majorities and finances are the great questions. If men, no matter how ignorant or incompetent, can be persuaded to indorse a certain course, then they are secure, for they have a majority with them. They can do nothing without majorities, and so they do whatever majorities will approve. The man of principle has one question to ask concerning every matter, that is, "Is it right? Is this thing the right thing to do? If it is, do it; if not, let it alone."

The man of principle may be mistaken, he may sometimes be wrong through error of judgment. The man of policy may sometimes be right, when it seems politic and profitable. The man of principle will correct his wrong when he sees it, but the man of policy is likely to turn from the right if he can make or gain anything by so doing.

It is of the utmost importance that men, who are in unpopular minorities, hold fast to the principles of right, and educate all who are under their influence to steadfast adherence to right principles. This is their only security. If they descend to the lower grounds of policy and self-interest, they are gone. They can not compete with others on those grounds. Others have more friends, more money, and more inducements, and unless their friends and supporters are trained to stand for the right, they will not stand at all.

It is a glorious thing to be on the right side, to know that one's ways please God, and to walk in paths of righteousness, upheld by the faith of Christ and the power of God. The Lord stands by the men who are content to stand with him, though they stand alone. He who has said, "thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil," gives honor to those men who are content to accept the losses and crosses, the disabilities and the sufferings, that come through steadfast adherence to the principles of truth and righteousness. Under the lead of expediency great majorities may be assembled, great masses may be organized, and great things may be done; but work done for God single-handed and alone, remains when the work of majorities and of crowds has passed away with the men who did it, and perished with the things that were.
