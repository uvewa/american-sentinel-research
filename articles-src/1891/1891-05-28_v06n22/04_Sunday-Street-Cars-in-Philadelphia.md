## Sunday Street Cars in Philadelphia.

[page 171]

The Law and Order Society, of Philadelphia, has undertaken to abolish the customary Sunday street cars in that city. The following facts we condense from the *New York Sun:*—

The running of street cars in Philadelphia on Sunday has been rendered possible only through a legal loophole. As far back as April 1, 1863, a local ordinance named Joannoble was arrested for driving a Green Street car on a Sunday afternoon. Arraigned for his offense before a police magistrate, the old of the Supreme Court was invoked under authority of a writ of *habeas corpus.* Joannoble had been charged with disorderly conduct in having violated the act of 1794. The layer contended that the running of the street cars was orderly, and not in a disorderly fashion. Judge Finlay finally discharged the prisoner. Nothing further was done about the matter for eight years, when a citizen named Sparhawk took the question in hand, again in hand, and demanded of the Supreme Court an injunction against the Union Passenger Railway Company, which he alleged was putting the law at defiance by, running cars on Sunday, at huge and irregular intervals, through the citizens quiet streets of Philadelphia. Judge Strong granted a temporary injunction, but on appeal to the Law and Order Society, and the full Court, Justice Thompson delivered the opinion of the Court, which was, it appears, elaborate in the treatment of the subject. "I fully concede," declared Judge Thompson, "that the opinion of my brother Strong, and the law and authorities referred to by him, establish very clearly that the business of running cars on the Lord's day commonly called Sunday, is a violation of the act of 1794. Driving a public conveyance for hire on Sunday, is a violation of the act forbidding the employment of worldly employment on the Lord's day commonly called Sunday. Rest and quiet on the Sabbath day with the right and privilege of public and private worship, undisturbed by any more worldly employment, are what the statutes were meant to protect." "Unfortunately," however, says the *Sun,* "for the cause of tranquillity, otherwise, the astute Philadelphia lawyer, the paid emissary of darkness, the scheduled objection of corporate recklessness and greed, and the man really applauded for selfishness and incivility, conducive, was on hand with his familiar schemes of legal cunning. He claimed that an injunction was equitable only on a showing that an injury existed in fact; and not, as in this instance, there was a remedy at law (84 feet) an injunction should be granted. The Court took this view of the case and threw Mr. Sparhawk's suit, so to speak, into the Susquehanna." Baffled at this point, the opponents of street car running on Sunday did nothing for the next fourteen years; but recently Mr. Vail of the Law and Order Society again opened up the course and attracted the preliminaries of an outline with the same corporation. His attitude is defined by our learned contemporary, the *Philadelphia Times,* in these words:—

> Mr. Vail concedes that there is not any great necessity for Sunday cars, nor are the people in any way dependent upon them. They are not all who go to the church they attend or attend the church that they go to, and the idea of asking Mr. Vail or any other person to take a car to deliver a letter that should be posted on a week-day is ridiculous.

It is not to be supposed that, conceding the weakness of such a proposition, it should still be of one accord in Philadelphia, and it is therefore not easy to ascertain how popular sentiment in that town, now lies on the question. It is evident that the friends of the Lord's day in order of want. On Sunday, will manifestly itself, whether in the distraction of the cars from the streets, the sequeling of the tracks, the social ostracism of the offending directors or conductors, the demoralisation of the homes of the stockholders, or by recourse to merely moral though more permanent measures of more commonplace reform.

"I do not know," so Mr. Vail is said to have declared, "that any proceedings are, for the present, to be taken against the running of horse cars on Sundays." The Rev. Dr. Fernley, however, has a notion called the Law and Order Society, and it is stated that he is "determined to push the matter very energetically."
