## It Is Un-American.

[page 172]

The "Pearl of Days," of May 2, has the following relation to the work of the "American Sabbath Union:" "Officers.—

The second quarterly meeting of the Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union was held at No. 33 Park Row, New York, April 17. Hon. Nos. 2, 3, King, 2, *Honorable* E. Huck, S. Mehaffy, J. H. Knowles, and W. J. R. Taylor, also the General Secretary, Rev. J. H. Knowles, and W. Irwin. The Corresponding Secretary, I. W. C. Crafts and his labors on their city during the past year. The General Secretary reported as regards to the publication of the Union, the initial correspondence, the work of organizing the States and most of our present very distinctive Sunday legislation. The Board unanimously commended the American Sabbath, now the official organ of the Union, and readopted certain parts of the plan to fasten States with a view to the nation. The reports evidenced hopeful progress, comprising new sustaining and establishing membership.

The officers of the Union are manifesting a soul worthy of a better cause, and acknowledging that had they a blood that showed itself at Philadelphia, last December, the organization is making in California the following. In illustrating the work on the Union's "Pearl of Days."

The most urgent need of this hour is a deeper patriotism, recognizing the high duty of government to shield its people. Its duty is to preserve civilization, morality, its necessity to the common welfare. The duty every man owes, how can the Convention become universal? Tips to those concerned with that duty, and with its responsibility. The home and the school may co-operate with the State. Societies organized with this in view may assist in molding public sentiment. In addition to those agencies the public press may [page 172] be utilized. Throughout this whole land those of kindred forces should unite in the all-important work of impressing the conscience. In this way a blessing is will abundantly enrich and abide.

The American Sabbath Union now asks and it proposes no partisan alliance, to open action or to establish sound advice the bench. It holds it all in dependence on Almighty God.

Its obligations it will exalt the Sabbath. State the result of its institution, and of its due observance is a necessity to our nature, and the command of Almighty God."

In other words, these men would secure the enforcement of the Sunday law—currently, judicially, and legally—through the civil power, for the friends of the Lord's day in order of want. It is safe to say that the American Sabbath Union is a force worthy of attention.

By "the school" we presume the "Pearl" means the public schools, but what right it would use the public school to create "a deeper conviction respecting the holy Sabbath—its divine purpose its molding perpetuity," does not appear. Certain it is that this is something that the public schools has no right to teach. The suggestion shows the characters and utter by un-American character of this so-called American Sabbath Union—a Union that would manipulate the public schools in the interest of its dogmas.
