It is said that at an educational conference, held in Germany not long since, the Emperor declared that he would make it his sacred duty, as the head of the nation, to promote the introduction of a moral Christian discipline in the public schools. However indefinite the expression which the Emperor may have used, it is yet quite sufficient for those who desire to use governmental authority to set itself for the promulgation of Christianity doctrine and the enforcement of Christian doctrines accepted by the majority as Christian, to find this imperial expression of great gratification as the rapid and widespread advance of their crusade for the establishment of a world-wide political Christianity.

The *Christian Statesmen* finds fault with the manner in which President Harrison and party spent the last Sunday of their recent return trip from the Pacific Coast. This train bearing the party did not reach Glenwood Springs, Colorado, until 4 o'clock Sunday morning. At 8 o'clock a committee escorted the President to breakfast at a hotel. At 11 o'clock the President and the members of his party attended services at the Presbyterian Church. During the afternoon Mr. Harrison received several delegations from surrounding towns, and addressed two meetings held in his honor. On both occasions his remarks were mildly religious, appropriate to the day as it is generally regarded. At 4 o'clock p. m., the train, in harmony with orders from the President, left Glenwood Springs, and the party spent the night in their car on a side-track twenty-four miles from the scene of Mr. Harrison's wrecked resolution to observe Sunday according to the most Puritanic Presidential fashion. Our opinion, however, is that it is none of the *Christian Statesmen's* business how the President spent Sunday.
