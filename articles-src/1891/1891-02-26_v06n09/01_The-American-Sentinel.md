DEEM many regard their subjects as their property, and assert the divine prerogative of prescribing their religion for them, but the history of the formation of new sects is a meritorious demonstration that the disposition of one man to coerce the religious homage of another, springs from an unchartered ambition, rather than from a sincere devotion to any religion. The conduct of our Government is an answer to the objection in the majority authority over the minority, except in matters which regard the conduct of one man to his fellow man.

Margaret M. Johnson.

OAKLAND, California, is somewhat agitated over questions of religious services in the public schools. The immediate occasion of this agitation is the action of Sunday newspapers in reporting that "certain churches have their heads over clasped hands and repeat the Lord's prayer and the psalms." The School Law of California, as found in the Political Code, Article 8, Section 1672, reads as follows:—

> No publication of a sectarian, partisan, or denominational character must be used or distributed in a school, or be made a part of a school library, nor must any sectarian or denominational doctrine be taught therein.

The statute law drawn in so many words does not define sectarian, religious, but it makes no provision for it, and even stands opposed to it.

The Board and Regulations of the Board of Education, of the City of Oakland, say:—

> No sectarian or denominational publications, or publications of sectarian or denominational character, shall be used or distributed in any school, or be made a part of any school library, nor shall any denominational or sectarian doctrine, or any political party politics be discussed by teachers on the premises.

Certainly as between *Jews* and *Christians* the use of the Lord's prayer would be sectarian, and as between Protestants and Catholics the use of the Scriptures would likewise be sectarian, for it is evident the Catholic or the Protestant version must be used, and offense must, therefore, be given to one party or the other. For the sake not only of justice to the taxpayers, but for the sake of the respect of the Bible, it is to be hoped that this question will be settled in California as it has been in Wisconsin.
