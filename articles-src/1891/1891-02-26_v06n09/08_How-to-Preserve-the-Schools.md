## How to Preserve the Schools.

The Roman Catholic hierarchy in this country, following the orders and adhering to the policy of Rome, have undoubtedly determined to push forward a parochial school system, and propose building, sooner or later, a parochial school by the side of every Roman Catholic Church. Their success in carrying out this design depends on Protestants. If we ignore their demand for consideration, if we make the schools Protestant schools, if we consider it a sufficient ground for the exclusion of a man from the school boards, and a teacher from the working force, that he is a Roman Catholic, and insist on disregarding Roman Catholic opinions and offending Roman Catholic sentiment in our text-books, we must expect to drive the children of Roman Catholic parents out of the public school into the parochial school. They will not send their children into schools where their faith is misreported, and where they are forbidden representation in the teaching and the government. If, on the contrary, we make and keep the schools public schools, if we make them so broad that no one is excluded by any moderate religious prejudices, and so thorough that no private school can compete with them, we may count on the parental instinct to support them in spite of the opposition of a hierarchy which objects, not to specific teaching, but to any teaching not under its own control. The No Popery agitators are the unconscious allies of the Papacy in its campaign against the public school system. The true defenders of that system are those who are resolved to maintain it with a curriculum which can secure the approbation of broad-minded men of all religious faiths.
