THE Roman Catholic hierarchy in this country, following the course advised and submitted to the policy of Rome, have undoubtedly determined to push forward a parochial school system, and propose building, sooner or later, a parochial school by the side of every Roman Catholic Church. Their success in carrying out this design depends on Protestants. If we resign their demand for consideration, if we make the achieved Protestant, all of its contents it is a sufficient ground for the exclusion of a mass from the schools heard, and a teacher from the working forces; that he is a Roman Catholic, and insist on disregarding Roman Catholic opinions and defeating Roman Catholic sentiment in our text-books, we must expect to drive the children of Roman Catholic parents out of the public school into the parochial school. They will not send their children into schools where their faith is misrepresented, and where they are theologizing restrictions in the teaching and the government. If, on the contrary, we make and keep the schools public schools, if we make them so broad that no one is excluded by any modern religious programme, and so thorough that no private school can compete with them, we may safely trust the parochial institution to support them in spite of the opposition of a hierarchy which objects, not to specific teaching, but to any teaching not under its own control. The New York *Papers* agitation was the reflections alias of the Papacy to its own monopolies the public schools every. That firm defenders of that system are those who are resolved to maintain it with intelligence and courage, liberal-minded and religious men of all religious faiths.—*The Christian Union.*

AFTER stating the facts in the case of M. R. King, the Tennessee Adventist, tried and imprisoned for Sunday labor, the *Baptist and Reflector* says:—

> On the point of the law we find ourselves in full sympathy with the Seventh-day people in expressing a decided opinion as to what the law of Tennessee ought to be; though the law has correctly, the Legislation of Tennessee should repeal it, it seems to us. Nearly every State in the Union, we believe in every States that we call the most advanced, recognize the right of those who, on of preservation, of which every enlightened Christian citizen should be enabled to observe or had as a relic of the Dark Ages, and ceased to be enforced.

Besides all this, what good the people of Tennessee can receive or expect from religious constraint in this matter. Would they not recover the Seventh-day Baptist who has observed the day who are now to bring bright vision and the former must be brought to a conclusion. To worship with the quiet and peace of Sunday before persecuting those who keep Saturday. In such case what a rebuke to all their argument for Sunday observance.

An exchange pertinently asks: "Where was the necessity of laboring to prove that this is a 'Christian Nation,' as a reason for a Sunday law, if it is only a civil rest day that is wanted? Do such an argument what is the difference whether the nation is Christian or not?"

SUNDAY laws are both un-American and anti-Christian.
