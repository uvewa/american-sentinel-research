# An Immoral Community.

CALIFORNIA is held up by the Sunday-law advocates as a terrible example of an immoral community, because it has no Sunday law; but we doubt if it is any worse, or even as bad, as some States that have Sunday laws. South Carolina has, we believe, quite a rigid Sunday law; yet, according to the public press, Rev. W. T. Tolson, a Baptist preacher of Columbia, delivered a sermon in that city not long since, in which he attacked the social organizations of the city, and painted Columbia in the blackest colors of immorality. He said the city was in league with Satan, and in his remarks gave many black and disgusting details of the immorality practiced.

"The Columbia Club, of which the elite of South Carolina are members, was denounced."

He denounced the Young Men's Christian Association as being in league with hell for allowing pictures of 'a traveling company of prostitutes' to be posted on their property. He attacked the city authorities for allowing gambling hells and disorderly houses to exist, and spoke plainly of miscegenation, which, he said, resulted from the muddling of the race problem.

"His whole discourse was in this style. He says he can produce proof of his statements, and some exciting episodes are ahead."

It seems from all this that even a Sunday law is impotent for good in the absence of wholesome private morals.
