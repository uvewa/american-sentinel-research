# Civil Laws against Blasphemy.

"Blasphemy," says the Encyclopedia Britannica, "means literally defamation or evil speaking, but is more particularly restricted to an indignity offered to the Deity by words or writing. The common law of England treats blasphemy as an indictable offense. All blasphemies against God, as denying his being, or providence, all contumelious reproaches of Jesus Christ, all profane scoffing at the Holy Scriptures, or exposing any part thereof to contempt or ridicule, are punishable by the temporal courts with fine, imprisonment, and also infamous corporal punishment." "In some Catholic countries," says Webster, "the crime of blasphemy includes speaking evil of the Virgin Mary and the saints. In the middle ages, blasphemy was used to denote simply the blaming of a person or thing. Among the Greeks, to blaspheme was to use words of ill omen, which they were careful to avoid."

"The 9 and 10 William III, c. 33," continues the Encyclopedia Britannica, "enacts that if any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, should by writing, preaching, teaching, or advised speaking, deny any one of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be God, or should assert or maintain that there are more Gods than one, or should deny the Christian religion to be true, or the Holy Scriptures to be of divine authority, he should, upon the first offense, be rendered incapable of holding any office or place of trust, and for the second, incapable of bringing any action, of being guardian or executor, or of taking a legacy or deed of gift, and should suffer three years' imprisonment without bail. . . . By the law of Scotland, as it originally stood, the punishment of blasphemy was death."

These are the laws of the liberty-loving Saxons! If a man commits the offense of denying the faithfulness of the Scriptures twice, then he is to be left to the mercy of any villain in the world; for he is to be denied all recourse in the courts. Nor is this law entirely a dead letter (though, fortunately, this class of laws are fast becoming so). John Stuart Mill, in writing on this subject in his essay "On Liberty," pertinently says:—

It will be said that we do not now put to death the introducers of new opinions; we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, we even build our teachers to them. It is true we no longer put heretics to death; and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling would probably tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not sufficient to extirpate them. But let us not flatter ourselves that we are yet free from the stain even of legal persecutions. Penalties for opinion, or at least for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is not, even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible that they may some day be revived in full force. In the year 1857, at the summer assizes of the county of Cornwall, an unfortunate man* said to be of unexceptional conduct in all relations of life, was sentenced to twenty-one months' imprisonment for uttering, and writing on a gate, some offensive words concerning Christianity. [A number of instances also might be cited in the United States, notably, People vs. Ruggles, 8 Johnson (New York), 290; State vs. Chandler, 2 Harrington (Delaware), 553; Updegraph vs. Commonwealth, 11 Sergeant and Rawle (Pennsylvania), 394; and Commonwealth vs. Kneeland, 394Pickering (Massachusetts), 206.]

Within a month of the same time, at the Old Bailey, two persons, on two separate occasions,† were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared that they had no theological belief; and a third, a foreigner,‡ for the same reason was denied justice against a thief. This refusal of redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine that no person can be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice, who does not profess belief in a God (any god is sufficient) and in a future state; which is equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excluded from the protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similar opinions, be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted with impunity, if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence.

The assumption on which this is grounded, is that the oath is worthless, of a person who does not believe in a future state. . . . The rule, is suicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. Under pretense that atheists must be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who are willing to lie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of publicly confessing a detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood.

These, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute as an example of that very frequent infirmity of English minds, which makes them take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle, when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into practice.

That similar laws should have a place on the statute books of an enlightened Government like that of the United States,—especially when it professes perfect religious freedom—entire separation of the civil Government from religion—is surprising indeed. John Adams deplored the fact greatly. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, dated at Quincy, January 23, 1825, he said:—

MY DEAR SIR: We think ourselves possessed, or at least we boast that we are as of liberty of cofscience on all subjects and of the right of free inquiry and private judgment in all cases, and yet how far are we from these exalted privileges in fact. There exists, I believe, throughout the whole Christian world, a law which makes it blasphemy to deny, or to doubt, the divine inspiration of all the books of the Old and New Testaments, from Genesis to Revelation. In most countries of Europe it is punished by fire at the stake, or the rack, or the wheel. In England itself, it is punished by boring through the tongue with a red hot poker. In America it is not much better; even in our Massachusetts, which, I believe, upon the whole, is as temperate and moderate in religious zeal as most of the States, a law was made in the latter end of the last century repealing the cruel punishments of the former laws, but substituting fine and imprisonment upon all those blasphemies upon any book of the Old Testament or the New. Now, what free inquiry, when a writer must surely encounter the risk of fine or imprisonment for adducing any arguments for investigation into the divine authority of those books? . . . It is true, few persons appear desirous to put such laws into execution, and it is also true that some few persons are hardy enough to venture to depart from them; but as long as they continue in force as laws, the human mind must make awkward and clumsy progress into its investigations. I wish they were repealed. The substance and essence of Christianity, as I understand it, is eternal and unchangeable, and will bear examination forever; but it has been mixed with extraneous ingredients, which, I think, will not bear examination, and they ought to be separated.

The truth of Adams's statement is proved by the following law, which, legally, is in force in the very capital of our Nation to-day,—although, of course, it is a dead letter. It was a Maryland law enacted October, 1793, and, with the rest of the laws of Maryland, was adopted as a law in the District of Columbia by the following act of Congress:—

"Section 93. The laws of the State of Maryland not inconsistent with this title, as the same existed on the twenty-seventh day of February, 1801, except as since modified or repealed by Congress or by authority thereof, or until so modified or repealed, continue in force within the District." "Revised Statutes, District of Columbia," page 8.

The first section of the act, entitled, "An act to punish blasphemers, swearers, drunkards, and Sabbath-breakers," etc., reads as follows:—

That if any person shall hereafter, within this province, wittingly, maliciously, and advisably, by writing or speaking, blaspheme, or curse God, or deny our Saviorer Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, and shall be thereof convict by verdict, or confession, shall, for the first offense, be bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds sterling; . . . and that for the second offense, the offender being therefore convict as aforesaid, shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B and fined forty pounds sterling; . . . and that for the third offense, the offender being convict as aforesaid, shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy." "Laws of the District of Columbia," page 136 of seq.

As incompatible as they are with religious equality, several of the States have similar laws, with the penalty somewhat modified, and now and then attempts are made to enforce them.

Blasphemy is purely a religious offense, and should be dealt with by the churches alone. The Government has no more right to deal with blasphemy than it has to deal with idolatry. The American people should never be satisfied until every one of these theocratic laws are removed from the statute books of the free States of America.

Such laws as these have ever been used as a means of persecuting individuals speaking or teaching contrary to the prevailing religious opinions. Blasphemy was the charge against Christ, and under which he was crucified. Paul suffered repeatedly from these laws. The words of the town clerk at Ephesus were: "For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess." Yet the same people who condemn these people in those unenlightened times for their injustice in persecuting Paul, and others who differed with them, keep equally unjust laws upon our statute books to-day, and rejoice whenever judges can be found who are intolerant enough to enforce them.

Never will the American people, or any other people, enjoy the full benefits of free institutions until they concede to others all the rights they claim for themselves. That was one of the principles upon which this Government was founded, and must be recognized in making and in enforcing our laws. "The Government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded upon the Christian religion," says the Tripolitan treaty, made during Washington's administration, in the very infancy of our Nation, and the attempts that are made to show special favor by law to the Christian religion, and to throw into jail any one who happens to speak against it, should receive the universal disapprobation of American citizens.

All citizens in this Nation are on an equality. The Christian has just as good a right to speak against Mohammedanism as the Mohammedan has to speak against Christianity;—but no better right. The Jew has just as much right to call Christ an impostor, as has the Christian to so call El Mahdi. So, too, the infidel and Unitarian have just as much right to deny the inspiration of the Scriptures and the Trinity, as have the believer and Trinitarian to oppose the views of Robert G. Ingersoll and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Intolerance of the views of others is always to be deplored; and especially so when powerful but illegitimate force on the part of the Government is applied to crush the expression of opinion at variance with the dominant cult. People speak of these things as trifles; but they will not prove to be trifles if the spirit of persecution revives. We should keep in mind the words of England's great philosopher, John Stuart Mill. "Unhappily there is no security," says he, "in the state of the public mind, that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which has lasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age the quiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to resuscitate past evils, as to introduce new benefits. What is boasted of at the present time as the revival of religion, is always, in narrow and uncultivated minds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and when there is the strong permanent leaven of intolerance in the feelings of a people, which at all times abides in the middle classes of this country, it needs but little to provoke them into actively persecuting those whom they have never ceased to think proper objects of persecution."

There are two principles that should be strictly adhered to, and which must be adhered to if we would have the best Government. First, the Government must let the individual alone; and, second, it must compel every one else to let him alone. The only time that the Government has a right to lay its hands on a person is when he interferes with the rights of others. "If the individual," says Mr. Mill, "refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. That mankind are not infallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half truths; that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognizing all sides of the truth,—are principles applicable to men's modes of action, not less than to their opinions.

"As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so it is that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of character short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where not the person's own character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress."
