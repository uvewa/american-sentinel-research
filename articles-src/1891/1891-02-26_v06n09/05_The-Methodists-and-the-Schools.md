THE following editorial from the *Times*, of this city, was published last April, as the time when the Methodist Conference held, to which it refers. The article was selected at the time for reprinting in THE SENTINEL, but has been crowded out. The matter, however, is not of course, but none the less is of value; and it is good to call attention to it now:—

> This action taken on Monday, at the New York Conference of the Methodist [page 68] Church, upon the subject of religion in the common schools was, perhaps, the most important step yet taken by any religious denomination on this subject. It was in the nature of a precious mistake. If every church should accept the principles laid down in the report adopted by that Conference without a dissenting voice, and the dissent of a single sceptic to the announcement of the schools, it is to be feared that there were but very little left of the denominational schools in this country.

> It is remarkable that the mature findings of the report are doubtless disownership to the common schools, and would regard the destruction of them as a great evil, they are taking precisely the course that the avowed enemies of the schools would wish them to adopt. This is one of a significant combination of the applications of a religion or quasi-religious teaching to our secular affairs.

> The Roman Catholics are not at all afraid of the Protestant position. If there are Protestant sects that demand the imposition upon the common schools a Protestant catechism, the Catholic answer is the famous Catholic case that it is complete and cogent, and a violation of the constitutional safeguard of religious liberty, for even Roman Catholic parents to admit their children to such schools or institutions to maintain them by paying taxes.

> Of course the Protestant propaganda do not describe the public instruction they wish to see administered as Protestantism. They describe it as Christianity. But the Roman Catholics fall back on the case and call themselves Christians, and everybody knows that a Methodist preacher and a Roman Catholic priest could not possibly

[page 68] agree about what religious instruction ought to be administered in the common schools. The process on our side is that we grant the schemes favored by the preacher, and his predecessor on the scheme favored by the priest, or alternately worse than the exclusively secular scheme, which they agree is deserving in denunciation of "godless."

> The Protestant platform as laid down by the Methodists would meet with the entire concurrence of the Roman Catholics and school fund and to secure the support of the public fund to secure the support of their own parochial schools by the proceeding of public taxation for it. Of course they would mean something by the words "Christian" and "Christianity" entirely different from what the Methodists would, but they would agree that "Christianity" is a part of the common law of the State," that "the period of bad habits must count," and that "education in the secular only can be overcome by the introduction of morals," and when and when the methods "become godless and therefore more constantly immoral," Christian citizens must deny the right of the State to give such an inadequate education.

> The phrases we have quoted are from the report adopted by the Methodist Conference, and we take leave to say that they are either meaningless or irrelevant. An English or any other law which says that Christianity is a part of the common law of England, and several American judges have repeated this dictum. But practically, and in the application the Methodist Conference gives to it, what does it mean? So far as it relates to rights and duties, Christianity is a part of the common law only so far as it is distinctly embodied in the common law. You cannot indict a man for not loving his neighbor and primal sentiments. Christianity may recapitulate all that he has and give to the poor, but no one church is entitled to turn the other also to the sinister, but these duties are not enforced the penal code of any Christian nation in our time. Hence,

> The truth is that the talk about "a godless and therefore necessarily immoral education" base right alongside of the real and aim of the public school scheme. It does not attempt to make Christian men and women of the pupils, though doubtless among them the Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches. It aims to make men intelligent and independent citizens, to give them such an education as will enable them to exercise their political rights for the general welfare, and so will enable them to keep out of jail and out of the poorhouse. In this it has been successful, and thus simply vindicated its right to be maintained at the public expense. Whether from the Protestant point of view, or from the Catholic point of view, or from some other religious point of view, or from the secular point of view, which is that of the State, it is of no consequence to the public education.

Reading, writing, arithmetic and geography are not taught differently by a Methodist and by a Jesuit, but in precisely the same fashion, if they be taught properly. Truly that if "godless" institutions in these branches of knowledge, or in any other that are properly with in the province of the public schools, is "necessarily immoral," is to make a perfectly meaning-less assertion. As soon as we can learn of ourselves about the "foundation of Christian morals" and undertake to determine practically what Christian morals the public schools shall inculcate, we come upon matters of controversy about which people differ whose rights as citizens, and parents and as tax-payers are precisely equal.

When religious teaching is given which is offensive to members of any sect, or of no sect, the right of those persons to demand that their children shall not be subjected to it is clear, and the claims that may be urged against their right is without foundation or is a just. If they merely complain, as do the Roman Catholics and the Methodists, that the schools do not teach religion at all, the sufficient answer is that this is not the business of the schools, which is the business of the Methodist and the Roman Catholic Churches. This is the only ground upon which the school system can be maintained in a community where different religions or irreligious beliefs; and whoever abandons this ground, is, in effect if not in intention, an enemy of the common school system.
