# The Methodists and the Schools.

THE following editorial from the Times, of this city, was published last April, at the time when the Methodist Conference was held, to which it refers. The article was selected at the time for reprinting in THE SENTINEL, but has been overlooked until now. The matter, however, has lost none of its value; it is good for all time:—

The action taken on Monday, by the New York Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, upon the subject of the common schools was, perhaps, the most important work of that body. We look upon it as a grievous mistake. If every church should accept the principles laid down in the report adopted by the Conference without a dissenting voice, and if these principles were applied to the management of the schools, it is to be feared that there would be very little left of the common school system in this country.

It is remarkable that while the framers of the report are doubtless sincerely attached to the common schools, and would regard the destruction of them as a great evil, they are taking precisely the course that the avowed enemies of the schools would wish them to adopt. This is one of the unfortunate consequences of the application of a religious or quasi-religious zealotry to secular affairs. . . . The Roman Catholics are not at all afraid of the Protestant zealots. If these latter can only impose upon the common schools a Protestant curriculum, they will make out the Roman Catholic case that it is oppressive and unjust, and a violation of the constitutional safeguard of religious liberty, to force Roman Catholic parents to send their children to such schools or to contribute to maintain them by paying taxes.

Of course the Protestant propagandists do not describe the public instruction they wish to see administered as Protestantism. They describe it as Christianity. But the Roman Catholics also profess to be and call themselves Christians, and everybody knows that a Methodist preacher and a Roman Catholic priest could not possibly agree about what religious instruction ought to be administered in the common schools. The priest on his part would regard the scheme favored by the preacher, and the preacher on his the scheme favored by the priest, as distinctly worse than the exclusively secular scheme, which they agree only in denouncing as "godless."

The Protestant platform as laid down by the Methodists would meet with the entire concurrence of the Roman Catholics who are trying to secure a division of the school fund and to secure the support of their own parochial schools by the proceeds of public taxation. Of course they would mean something by the words "Christian" and "Christianity" entirely different from what the Methodists mean, but they would agree that "Christianity is a part of the common law of the State," that "the perils of bad habit from association in the school can only be overcome by the inculcation of Christian morals," and that when the schools "become godless and therefore necessarily immoral," Christian citizens must deny the right of the State to give such an inadequate education.

The phrases we have quoted are from the report adopted by the Methodist Conference, and we take leave to say that they are either meaningless or irrelevant. An English judge did once set forth that Christianity is part of the common law of England, and several American judges have repeated this dictum. But practically, and in the application the Methodist Conference gives to it, what does it mean? So far as it relates to rights and duties, Christianity is a part of the common law only in so far as it is distinctly embodied in the common law. You cannot indict a man for not loving his neighbor as himself. Christianity may require a man to sell all that he has and give to the poor, or when one cheek is smitten to turn the other also to the smiter, but these duties are not enforced by the penal code of any Christian nation in our time.

The truth is that the talk about "a godless and therefore necessarily immoral education" loses sight altogether of the end and aim of the public school system. It does not attempt to make Christian men and women. That is left for other agencies, among them the Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches. It aims to make men intelligent and independent citizens, to give them such an education as will enable them to exercise their political rights for the general welfare, and as will enable them to keep out of jail and out of the poorhouse. In this it has been successful, and has amply vindicated its right to be maintained at the public expense. Whether men behave themselves from right motives or from wrong is a point of vital importance from the religious point of view. From the secular point of view, which is that of the State, it is of no consequence whatever.

Reading, writing, arithmetic and geography are not taught differently by a Methodist and by a Jesuit, but in precisely the same fashion, if they are taught properly. To say that a "godless" instruction in these branches of knowledge, or in any other that are properly within the province of the public schools, is "necessarily immoral," is to make a perfectly meaningless assertion. As soon as we leave generalities about the "inculcation of Christian morals" and undertake to determine specifically what Christian morals the public schools shall inculcate, we come upon matters of controversy about which people differ whose rights as citizens, as parents and as tax-payers are precisely the same.

When religious teaching is given which is offensive to members of any sect, or of no sect, the right of these persons to insist that their children shall not be subjected to it is clear, and the claim they may found upon it for a division of the school fund is just. If they merely complain, as do the Roman Catholics and the Methodists, that the schools do not teach religion at all, the sufficient answer is that this is not the business of the schools, while it is the business of the Methodist and the Roman Catholic Churches. This is the only ground upon which the school system can be maintained in a community of different religious or irreligious beliefs; and whoever abandons this ground is, in effect if not in intention, an enemy of the common school system.
