AFTER stating the facts in the case of R. M. King, the Tennessee farmer, arrested and imprisoned for Sunday labor, the Baptist Examiner says:—

On the point of law we do not profess to speak—the courts will decide that—but we have no hesitation in expressing a decided opinion as to what the law should be. If the trial Judge interpreted the law correctly, the Legislature of Tennessee should make haste to change it. Cases similar to this have occurred within recent years in Pennsylvania and other States, and in every instance they have been acts of persecution, of which every right-minded Christian man should be ashamed. Laws of this kind are a relic of the Dark Ages, and cannot too soon be expunged from the statute book.

Besides all which, the good people of Tennessee seem to be straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel in this matter. Would they not deserve more respect if they first prosecuted the officials who run needless freight trains and noisy horse cars; the men who in the cities seriously interfere with the quiet and peace of Sunday, before pouncing on peaceable farmers with all the terrors of the law? Take a fellow of your size, State of Tennessee; tackle the big corporations and the rich owners of factories, and first compel them to observe the law. It will be time then to turn your attention to the poor farmers, the milkmen and the barbers.

Nevertheless, the Examiner does not wish to be understood as opposed to all Sunday laws. However, the logic that condemns them in one case condemns them in all, and we have no hesitation in saying that they ought to be swept from our statute books as a whole.
