# Uncertainties Log - v06n09 (1891-02-26)

## General Notes
- OCR quality: Generally good, with some minor issues noted below
- This issue contained extensive substantive articles with substantial philosophical and constitutional discussion

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 3, Article "Civil Laws against Blasphemy"
- **Location:** Middle of article, John Adams quotation
- **Transcribed as:** "liberty of cofscience"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Appears to be OCR error for "conscience" but preserved as appears in OCR file; could also be period typo from original

### Page 6, Column 1
- **Location:** Reference to library
- **Transcribed as:** 'THE LIBRARY", was denounced.' 6830 Laurel St., N.W. Washington 12 D.C.'
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be a library stamp or annotation overlaying the text. Context suggests the intended text was "The Columbia Club, of which the elite of South Carolina are members, was denounced." The subsequent text about the YMCA flows logically from this.

### Page 7, Advertisement text
- **Location:** Lovell Washer Co. advertisement
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple garbled phrases including "LABEED have great success," "baryris in plain dentition," "formal grant," "relevant investigation," "251 Horse SLEEVE, PA"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Heavy OCR corruption in advertisement text; appears to be describing washing machine sales but text is severely degraded. Address likely "Erie, PA" not "Horse Sleeve, PA"

### Page 4, Article reference
- **Location:** End of "Civil Laws against Blasphemy"
- **Transcribed as:** "Commonwealth vs. Kneeland, 394Pickering (Massachusetts), 206"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Space missing between "394" and "Pickering" - likely should be "394 Pickering" but preserved as OCR rendered it

### Page 8, "IX an article"
- **Location:** Beginning of editorial note about W. F. Crafts
- **Transcribed as:** "IX an article in Our Day"
- **Confidence:** HIGH (corrected)
- **Reason:** OCR error - should be "IN an article" not "IX an article"; corrected in transcription based on context

## Notes on Corrections Made
- Changed "IX an article" to "IN an article" on page 8 (obvious OCR error)
- Removed library stamp text intrusion and reconstructed intended sentence based on context
- Did NOT alter "cofscience" in Adams quote, preserving as appears (could be historical spelling or OCR error)
