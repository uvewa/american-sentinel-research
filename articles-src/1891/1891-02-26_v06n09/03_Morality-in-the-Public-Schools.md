UPON the question as to what shall be taught in the public schools, we would suggest that it would be well for those who demand this, to ponder what morality really is, what is its comprehension, and what are its boundaries. If this matter be clearly discussed and studied, it will be found that what are so sometimes called "principles of essential life," and so read with profit by old and young and by all sorts and conditions of people, must rest on the "Geography of the Holy [page 67] Bible study, will be increased by the Introduction to Bible reading, and it is No. 4 of the 'Young People's Library.'"

The book, whose author writes from personal knowledge and observation, is, as the "publisher's note" says, "replete with interesting descriptions of oriental life," and may be read with profit by old and young. It is No. 4 of the "Young People's Library."

immediationism, was appointed for the purpose of preparing "a look of morals for the public schools." Two of that committee were Rev. Dr. Joseph T. Duryea and Edward Everett Hale. The result of the four years' study of the question by this committee was expressed by Dr. Duryea himself, in a letter to the chairman of a committee in New York, requesting to consider the same subject. The following is the material part of that letter:—

> 17 Utah Place, Boston, 1 Oct., 1886. The consensus opinion of the committee as to the matter of a look of morals for the public schools, have been individually to finish and will be our form. Difficulties have been met and not resolved. Here they are:—

> The desire was for a graded series. This would involve a text-book or guide to give the high school. This could fairly come before it to the grounds of morals and accordingly. The conscience have accordingly done so far for another. There has been a long investigation and study of the subject of morals and action before years. To show these results to an exhausted moral care, after reflecting the very country of society, ought to be handled after they are developed and delivered sufficiently to understood to have done has differences as to the text, or and a substantial agreement in presented a whole.

> I think, now, the tendency is to admit that it is better to address the moral instincts, and not to deal of theories about; also to trust moral sentiments and emotions of the young as the more effectual corrections to the school and on the play ground.

> In course of the revision of the study of the problem, all the committee were asked for a model text book, or a series of books after the pattern of the Book of Psalms books, prepared for youth in this form for the school.

> The moral affections and sentiments might be exhibited in expression, and moral principles might be exhibited in historical instances and good aphorisms. As a double rule: Are clothes calling all the forms, the various, and instances under each of them, might be selected. And such might be presented in writing or printed, as simple rules there out of the text precisely.

> This so far as we have been able to go, with the addition of meetings with general speech and securing the substance of the books or books.

> Yours truly,

This is an interesting letter, and coming as it does as the result of years of special study on the subject by such men, its statements are of more than common importance.

First, difficulties have been met and not overcome, and they are difficulties of such a nature, as from the circumstances of the thing, to seem insuperable, because instead of leading with them with a real endeavor to overcome them the committee tried to evade them. But upon such a question the evil they tried to evade, will escape it, for it still there and there it remains. This statement simply reveals in a more forcible way than is usually done, the fact that upon the question of the Bible, or religion, or morality, in the public schools, there are difficulties which cannot be overcome with justice to all. Of course we use the word morality as meaning much more than ethics.

Second, the committee could not insert a look in the far problem which stands opposed to "the grounds of moral respectability," because that is an unsettled question among those who were to compile [page 67] the book; and because the wisdom of debating before youth the question of what is the basis of moral choice and what is, an entirety to be doubted, and, further, because it might be harmful for the youth to understand the teacher the very reason why they should choose, and act, a certain way in a given case, was an unsettled question among college graduates and doctors of divinity.

These reasons certainly ought to be sufficient to put a check upon the efforts of every such committee. They might also be sufficient to put a damper upon this idea of every other who may not see as worthily in favor of forcing this question to an issue in the management of the public school. Because when men of mature and trained minds, graduates of the best colleges and the highest universities, and of theological seminaries, and who, of all men, are most intimately and constantly associated with the consideration of this very question in all its phases,—when these can not agree upon what is the ground of moral responsibility, and what is the ground and action, it certainly would not be very fully to demand that schoolmasters should decide the question. The committee did well to say it might be harmful; because it would certainly be very harmful and not only that it might be harmful, but that it could not fail to be anything else than harmful.

Third, and not exactly this phase of the question that the committee referred to when it said it might be harmful. It was well that the children would discover "that apparently good men differ concerning the very foundation of morality," and would then be led to doubt whether there is any real foundation for morality, and consequently would be handled clumsily into skepticism. Of the children themselves will be afraid, because it would be the manifesto result of every attempt by the State to teach morality—skepticism.
