## A Striking Contrast.

We read in the Bible that when Ezra was about to go up from Babylon to rebuild the house of God at Jerusalem, he was "ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help him against the enemy in the way." His reason for such a course, he says, was because he had told the king of Babylon that his God would protect all those that trusted him.

Now, Ezra and those that journeyed with him were God-fearing men, and, conscious of a mightier protection than any arm of flesh, they were ashamed to ask for human aid in such a perilous undertaking as this; and we read of them that they all reached their destination and lost none of the treasures that they were carrying with them, with which to build the house of God.

The candid mind can not but note a striking contrast in the course pursued by these holy men and that pursued by a body of men in our day who style themselves National Reformers. These men tell us that it is their object to build up the Church of Christ—the spiritual house of God. Ezra was on his journey to build the earthly temple at Jerusalem. Ezra was ashamed to require earthly aid when he could have had it by asking for it, while the National Reformers most earnestly petition the civil power to aid them in building up the spiritual house of God. There must be a cause for such a difference in purpose between Ezra and these men, who claim to be the followers of the same God.

It is useless to ask if the hand of the Lord is "shortened that it cannot save," or "his ear heavy that it cannot hear;" for in him, who is "the same yesterday, to-day, and forever," there "is no variableness neither shadow of turning," and there is no more restraint with him now to save by many or by few than there was in days of old.

It is sadly true, that for many years past, there has been a remarkable spiritual declension in the professed churches of Jesus Christ. Honest, God-fearing men of all denominations have noted this; many have written about it, and many more have lamented such a state of lukewarmness as prevails in the Church of Christ. But they should not appeal to earthly powers for help in such a time of need. Would it honor God should those who profess to love and serve him prostrate themselves before the State and beg the civil power to enforce "certain principles of Christianity, which are held by all," upon those who are careless and indifferent about their eternal interests? Would it savor of the spirit of Him who said "my kingdom is not of this world?"

The question of religious legislation should interest every Christian, but not in the way the National Reformers desire it to interest them. These men claim that it would greatly benefit the Church to "convert the State" and have the State forward the Church in its work of saving souls; but the Saviour declares that the devil is the prince of this world, and the Apostle Paul declares, that this is the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience. Now if the Church of Christ prostrates herself before the civil powers of this world, can she expect any help and support from them? It looks more like the Church becoming converted to the State than of the State being converted to the Church. In all past history of State religion, we find the Church conformed to the world, instead of the State being "transformed."

It is, indeed, high time for Christians everywhere to be aroused at the very thought of such a move being successful. If the Church seeks for secular power to support her in converting souls does she not savor of that spirit which would fast and pray for power to smite with the fist of wickedness, which God has so condemned? The fast that God has chosen is to "loose the bands of wickedness and let the oppressed go free." Already some have been cast into prison, for conscience' sake, because of religious legislation in our land, and if the Church would move in the council of God she would seek to let these oppressed ones go free instead of seeking to "lade men with burdens grievous to be borne."

The God of heaven would have his followers trust him. His eternal principles of justice, love, and truth will stand on their own merits without the aid of human support or national legislation. When a church seeks the State for support, it is because she has lost the vital principles of godliness; and the fearful words uttered by God to ancient Israel is true of her: "Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that He will not hear."

"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help."
