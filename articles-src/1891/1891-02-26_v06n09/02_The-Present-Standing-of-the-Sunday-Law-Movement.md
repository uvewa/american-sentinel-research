IN number four, of his contributions to the Sunday-law question, Mr. Crafts furnishes some more palpable points for the literature and the facts of this question. The article is an inquiry, "What about Sunday Trains, Sunday Mails, and Sunday Newspapers?" and this, in substance, is his confession:—

> Almost all we have gained in the last two years' fight with Sunday trains, Sunday mails, and Sunday newspapers, is in the way of conditions for the worse.

As direct general this confession is, he does not tell us, but whether it be limited or general, such a confession is vastly more of a gain than the Sunday-law movement credited to, not only in five years, but in all time, however long since it was begun. There is no more wrongness in Sunday trains, Sunday mails, and Sunday newspapers, than in trains, mails, and newspapers any other time, and a confession of such wrongness so, in itself is gain.

As to the value of the information in that great petition which he calls, "the greatest petition the world ever saw," he says:—

> It is not to be supposed that all those represented in the petition have *all* accepted the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, for instance,

[page 66] have not all accepted *all* the reasons for Sunday rest. We must simply show the proportion of those in each organization in favor of *some* sort of Sunday rest, and we shall show a vast majority.

As to the Sunday-law movement, which is led by the preachers, they propose to secure power by which they can whip as well as pray, and it is to be clearly understood that they do not propose to do the whipping with their tongues nor with Bibles. True Christ never sent power to whip offenders, and when it is proposed to use legislation against those who refuse to accept truth as it is in Christ Jesus, it is high time that the people themselves should see to it that such doctrine as this shall not assume the power the whip. It is certain that those preachers without the power to whip can do no greater good nor harm to any one. But when a preacher obtains the power of the civil law to whip offenders, then his prayers are accompanied wholly by the State.

It will be remembered, that a few weeks since, we published an extended quotation, adopted from Lyman Abbott, to the effect that *the* purpose or "the chief purpose, the main flag, and *raison d'être*, or one of a modern and modified Puritanism." "The ancient and unmodified Puritanism likewise has come to whip offenders into the Kingdom of God, at the following recorded shows":—

> About 1632 and Allen Junkens came to Massachusetts in 1663, looking at Dover, they began an attack on the law in which a number of people presented. Mr. Bayer, leaving the news, hastied

[page 66] to Richmond, and then went home on a Sunday train. The recent International Sabbath Convention, at Pittsburg, spoke strongly against Sunday breaking, but many of the members came on Sunday trains.

And the trains are all in this way; they are worthfully placed too. This simply shows that the indorsements, even where it is genuine, of these organizations and associations, is merely for the purpose of manufacturing popularity with those who are demanding religious legislation and offering political influence, without a particle of principle in it. It also conclusively shows that when the Sunday laws which they demand shall have been secured, they will not themselves be controlled by the laws they made them and profess to believe them; and that the only use that will ever be made of them, will be for those who have the power to visit their religious spite and bigotry upon those who choose to differ with them in regard to the observance of a day of rest. That is the only use that is now made of Sunday laws where they are in force. It is the only use that will be made of the Sunday laws that are now demanded.

And this is the answer to that statement which is so often made when this subject is spoken of, "Fiddlesticks! there is no danger in all that; even though they get a Sunday law, it will not be enforced against any one." THE SENTINEL, in all the work, has always signified that the Sunday laws which are demanded will be closed up if they are not overtly. But these laws will not pass into the hands of the religious Sundays, Sabbath their ideas are not true, and it is now used in enforcing the laws upon the few; and of course, those who are to be enforced rather than Sunday, and *refuse* to observe Sunday. We repeat, that is the only use that is made of Sunday laws now, and the only use that ever will be made of them. But that in the worst possible use, because it is simply to persecute the civil power in the grasp of a sect in the hands of the irregular passions of religious bigots. For as Bancroft has justly observed, "the animated torrent always shrinks from enforcing the
