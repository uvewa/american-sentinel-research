A Striking Contrast.

WE read in the Bible that when Ezra was about to go from Babylon to rebuild the house of God at Jerusalem, he made a requisition for forgetting the king's hand of soldiers and horsemen to help him against the enemy in the way. His reason for such a course, he was, because he had told the King of Babylon that his God would protect all those that trusted him.

Now, Ezra and those that journeyed with him were God-fearing men, and conscious of a negligent protection from any arm of flesh, they were ashamed to ask for human aid in this a public a profession or asking us this; and so the road of them that they set resolved their destination and just some of the treasures that they were carrying with them, with which to build the house of God.

The result could not and not fail to be a striking contrast in the course pursued by those holy men and that pursued by a body of them in one of our day who style themselves National Reformers. Those men told us that it is their object to build up the Church of Christ—the spiritual house of God. Ezra was his journey to rebuild the earthly temple at Jerusalem. Ezra was ashamed to require/rally ask when he could have had by asking for it, the assistance of the civil power to more usefully petition the civil power to and them in building up the spiritual house of God. There must be a cause for such a difference in purpose between Ezra and these men, who claim to be the followers of the same God.

It is useless to ask of the hand of the Lord is "shortened that it cannot save," or "our ear heavy" that it cannot hear; for in him, who "the same yesterday, to-day, and forever," there is no weakness, no slumber neither shadow of turning," and he is sure to overcome with them now as he was with Ezra; by many or by few that there was in days of old.

It is sadly true, that for many years there has been a remarkable spiritual declension in the professed churches of Jesus Christ. Honest, God-fearing men of all denominations have noted this; many have written about it, and others have lamented such a mark of lukewarm-ness or weakness as prevails in the Church of Christ. But they should not appeal to earthly powers for help such a time of need. Would it honor God should those who profess to love and serve him prostrate themselves before the State and beg the civil power to enforce "certain principles of Christianity, which are laid by" "upon those who are neither able nor in different about their eternal interests?" Would it secure of the Spirit of Him who said "my kingdom is not of this world?" The question of religious legislation should interest every Christian, but not in the way the National Reformers desire it to interest them. These men claim that it would greatly benefit the Church to "coerce" the State "into the State forward the Church in its work of saving souls; but the Saviour declares that the devil is the prince of this world, and the Apostle Paul declares, that this is the spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience. Now if the Church of Christ promulgate herself before the civil powers of this world, she can expect help and support from that? Is it looks more like the Church becoming converted to the cause of the State than the State being converted to the Church. In all past history of State religion, we find the Church constantly forward in the world, instead of the State being "transformed."

It is, indeed, high time for Christians everywhere to be aroused at the very flagrantly of such a move being made seriously. If the Church works for secular power to support her in converting souls she is not savior of that spirit which would fast and pray for power to unite with the fire of wickedness, which fail him not to demand? The fact that God has been asked to "close the hands of wickedness and in the oppressed goes free." Already some bills have got into law, for consideration of such, because of religious legislation in all that, and if the Church would enter in the counsel of God she would seek to convert these last ones, instead of seeking to "take into men with fearless gripping to go to be fasten."

The God of heaven would have his followers trust him. His eternal principles of justice, love, and right will assert their own merits without the aid of legislation or national legislation. When church seeks the State for support, it is because she has lost the vital force of godliness; and the funeral words uttered by Christ over a worldly church seem to be apropos. "It is true to us to say to you, 'Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins also have hid his face from you, that He will not hear."

"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help."
