DESPOTS may regard their subjects as their property, and usurp the divine prerogative of prescribing their religious faith, but the history of the world furnishes the melancholy demonstration that the disposition of one man to coerce the religious homage of another, springs from an unchastened ambition, rather than from a sincere devotion to any religion. The principles of our Government do not recognize in the majority any authority over the minority, except in matters which regard the conduct of one man to his fellow man.—Col. Richard M. Johnson.

OAKLAND, California, is somewhat agitated over the question of religious services in the public schools. The immediate occasion of this agitation is the action of one of the teachers in requiring pupils "to bow their heads over clasped hands and repeat the Lord's prayer and the psalms." The School Law of California, as found in the Political Code, Article X, Section 1672, reads as follows:

No publication of a sectarian, partisan, or denominational character must be used or distributed in any school, or be made a part of any school library, nor must any sectarian or denominational doctrine be taught therein.

The State law does not in so many words forbid all religious instruction, but it makes no provision for it, and is generally regarded as forbidding it.

The "Rules and Regulations of the Board of Education, of the City of Oakland," says:

No sectarian or denominational publication, of any kind whatever, shall be used in the schools, or be made a part of any school library; nor shall any denominational or sectarian doctrines be inculcated, or present party politics be discussed by teachers on the premises.

Certainly as between Jews and Christians the use of the Lord's prayer would be sectarian, and as between Protestants and Catholics the use of the Scriptures would likewise be sectarian, for it is evident the Catholic or the Protestant version must be used, and offense must, therefore, be given to one party or the other. For the sake not only of justice to the taxpayers, but for the sake of the respect due the Bible, it is to be hoped that this question will be settled in California as it has been in Wisconsin.
