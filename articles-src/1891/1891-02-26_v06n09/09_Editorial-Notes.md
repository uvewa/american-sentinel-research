THE Congressional Report reveals the fact that American Sabbath Union's petitions for the passage of a Sunday law are still being presented to Congress.

---

IT is proposed to us around the old State law of Pennsylvania to allow the sale on Sunday of cigars and soda water, and to give personal servants of the violation the privileged trial by jury. The committee is meeting better opposition, especially the provisions for trial by jury.

---

THE Supreme Court of Illinois has decided that the Salvation Army has a right to parade the streets of Chicago. This is only fair. The Salvation Army is not out of blend of a religious organization, and should not be discriminated against, ridiculed and privileged by either of them.

AND now it is seriously proposed to make voting compulsory for this State? What then will those do who have earnest hope of Congress against voting? Our Reformed Presbyterian friends who think it is sin to the politics even to their own, it should be to the out alert or they may soon find themselves and their fellow citizens violating the law and vindicating their rights.

"Ten Sunday civil bill," says the Census Report, "makes the first such apparent approximation made in years, footing up $30,000,000, who to cast for three weeks outside the matter. The time may come when there will be a 'Sunday' civil bill appearing it along money for certain purposes, but no such bill is before this Congress. The bill in question is the Sunday Civil bill.

---

The wish of the great judges who run the Census Report was evidently father to the thought that it was a Sunday bill.

The founder of the American Sabbath Union writes to the *Day* that he explained that the American Secular Union, which held its annual meeting in Ohio, instead of confusingly affiliating with us as formerly, adopted practically the same platform as itself, the denial of the observance of Sunday as a religious institution. As the American Sabbath Union's platform is a theological and other secular reasons. As there are no leading laws that relates to religious observances this "plank" nailed on the flag," is said—

---

We would like to know how the Secular Union is going to get around this? It has admitted the propriety of Sunday laws on certain grounds, and now it is told that those are the very grounds upon which all Sunday laws now in existence, and all that anybody wants, rest. We think it is about time that the Sentinel Union reviews the demands and ceases to encourage Sunday-law hypocrisy by catering to the so-called "civil Sabbath," which at best is only a religious institution masquerading a as civil garb for the sake of power that it could not otherwise obtain.

WRITTEN to the *Twentieth Century*, Jas. H. Harrison falls into the confusion, now in excusable, error of attributing the horning all of his victims to the Puritans. The stones brought, did all of and born, person accused of witchcraft. Only two of the examining at by hanging were convicted in this country, and those were not in Massachusetts but in New York City, in Colonial times. The victims were nineteen accused of a plot to burn the city.

THE august Legislature of Illinois, on a repressive exchange, "under the guidance of the Protestant clergy, proposes to make it a criminal offense to deny the divinity of Christ, or to be permanently divine." The proposed statute is of course aimed at the Jews. Schwimley, who has, for several years, claimed to be Christ, and has secured quite a following. It is, however, a matter which the State has no right to touch, and we doubt do not that should the Legislature pass any such bill the Supreme Court of the State would declare it unconstitutional!

ACCORDINGLY to the "Pearl of Days," Sunday is kept by the masses of the people of Vierling, British Columbia, with understanding the fact that saloons are in some cases open, and that railway and steamboat excursions are frequent. The churches are well attended and the Young Men's Christian Association is said to be doing a great work. All of which goes to show the moral and religious force of the people then upon the expression of civil law!

---

IN an article in *Our Day*, for January, by W. F. Crafts says also,—

> The case of a Seventh-day Adventist, arrested for working near his home in a quiet county in the State [Tennessee] in the United States Supreme Court, with Hon. Don. M. Dickinson for defense. There is little chance for acquittal on that basis, for the power is to forbid all persons to work on that day, but it would seem to be a harmless kindness to exempt private work, not trade, by those who keep Saturday.

And that is all that Mr. Crafts has to say representing a not palpable violation of natural rights. The persecutions of seventh-day Christians, with him is simply the withholding of a "harmless kindness!" Mr. Crafts and all who are of his way of thinking should remember that what was formerly thankfully accepted as religious toleration is now demanded as a religious right. A free people, not only seventh-day Christians but non-Christians, who demand aren't "harmless kindness," and demand their God-given and inalienable rights!

It seems that there is scarcely any limit to the household (?) uses to which a Sunday law can be put. In Tennessee the Sunday law is used to persecute conscientious observers of the seventh day. In New York, and elsewhere this same law has been turned to account by corrupt officers as a convenient means of levying blackmail upon saloon keepers. The following item from the *World* shows that the law has not yet been exhausted, but it is still a power yet in the hands of shrewd men still unrevealed:—

> "Policeman Dower, of the Mulberry Street station, caused Richard Walters, a tailor, of No. 131 Division street, at the Knox street police court yesterday, on a charge of keeping his store open Sunday. The tailor said in explanation that the express man trapped on the door, and on his plea of having a wife and six children dependent on Sunday, he admitted him. The policeman had picked out an eighteen dollar coat, and the tailor said that the policeman wanted to beat him down to nine dollars. Upon his refusal, the arrest followed. Justice Murray held the tailor for trial."

It is No. 4 of the "Young People's Library." Sent on the "Geography of the Holy Land" and to the value of this the book. Price, post-paid, re cloth, 30 cents, in paper, Pacific Press Publishing Company, 43 Bond Street, New York, or Oakland, Cal.

An opportunity he caused Richard Walters to be indicted on its own charge. "In fairness of the relinquishment of the law, the older and wiser order of it he could learn to think."
