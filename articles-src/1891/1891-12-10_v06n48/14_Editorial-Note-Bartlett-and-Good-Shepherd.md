REV. DR. WILLIAM A. BARTLETT, Pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, Washington, D. C., has accepted an appointment on the Board of Directors of the House of the Good Shepherd, an institution owned and controlled by the Roman Catholics under the immediate management of the Sisters of Charity. The spiritual and material prosperity of this institution is also under the especial fostering care of Cardinal Gibbons. This charity has, in common with others in the District of Columbia, shared in the largesses of the Government, and now identifies with its interests one of the most popular clergymen of his denomination in the United States — that denomination too, which has been especially prominent in the effort to secure the enactment and enforcement of religious laws, particularly for the observance of Sunday.

This is significant, and the New York Times properly comments:

The step taken in this instance is of such importance that it could not have been decided upon by any but the highest Catholic authorities in America, and it comes after due consideration of its effect. The exclusiveness of the Catholic Church in matters of this kind is universally understood. The placing of a very prominent Presbyterian minister in an important directorate is significant.

There have been other overtures toward union from Roman Catholic prelates. American Protestants have accepted them. Of what is this all significant?
