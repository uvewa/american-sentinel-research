The following editorial outburst of politico-religious rhapsody is from the Mail and Express:—

Hisses are something new
For Chauncey M. Depew.

They occurred last night, Sunday, at the Academy of Music, at a meeting called—to worship God? No; "to honor and glorify Parnell," who despised and fought God to the utmost of his puny might. Was there no other night in the week that could be taken for this sacrilege? No. Hence these deserved hisses.

The literary style of this makes it worthy of being placed in the chorus of an ode to Sunday observance, composed by the Colonel of the Sabbath Union army.
