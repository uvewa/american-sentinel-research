A CORRESPONDENT of the United Presbyterian, describing a late meeting in Kansas City, says:—

On last Sabbath, the third of a series of meetings was held in the interest of Sabbath observance, but the attendance was light, and the speaking lighter. Some of the speakers severely criticised the ministers for not giving sufficient prominence to the Sabbath question in their sermons. One man, a member of one of the largest churches, who claimed for himself prominence in all efforts for sanctity of the Sabbath, said he had never heard his pastor preach on this subject. This man however, "gave himself away" as a Sabbath reformer, when he told us of some horrible things he had seen in that morning's Sunday paper.

This is a mistake; this man was no worse than his fellows. The "Sabbath reformer" is a man who agitates for laws placing restrictions upon other people; never upon himself.
