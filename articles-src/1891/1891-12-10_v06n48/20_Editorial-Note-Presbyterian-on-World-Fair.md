THE Presbyterian sounds the call for an organized effort, to influence Congress, and intimidate those interested in the Exposition, in this manner:

Our petitions have been laid upon the shelf and our moral pleadings have been ignored, and there remains nothing further for us to do than to let those in charge of the undertaking know that it will not be patronized and sustained by the Christian public, if it is to be made an occasion for desecrating and repudiating our American Sabbath. Better far that the Exposition prove a complete failure, than that it should result in an European continental Sabbath. We regard the situation as critical, and think that all interested in the Sunday question in connection with this national institution should make their voices heard, not only through religious associations, but by personal letters to the directors of the Exposition as well as to members of Congress, so that the Fair shall not be opened under governmental sanction.

As the feeling upon this question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair increases in warmth, it will be interesting to see how close this religious boycotting will come to religious bulldozing.
