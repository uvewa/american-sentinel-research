THE American Sabbath Union chose an interesting fur its annual meeting to be held in the State of Michigan, and operate in behalf of their work, but on a recent reason, unknown to the writer, they were not allowed the usual attention on this country. As also there are many other states yet to be held in this convention in that State in accord as she would be the stronghold of the seventh-day Adventists; and possibly they deferred visiting that State because that organization was strong enough in that State to give them the amount of courage necessary in the attack of it so as to rake enemies to their work as they hold the seventh-day Sabbathists to be.

On Monday, Nov. 16, is a mass meeting was held in the principal Methodist Episcopal church of Jackson, and Rev. F. W. Ware of Grand Rapids, the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for Michigan, attempted the first county organization in the State. Previous to the organization however, he had tried to show the citizens of that city the necessity of organizing on behalf of the preservation of the "American Sabbath," which almost wholly consisted in pointing out that Seventh-day Adventists are the "organized enemies" of the American Sabbath Union in that they earnestly opposed their desire for following this, and after proceedings were very brief indeed, as little remained to be done.

The sequel showed, however, that he had mistaken the feelings of the people toward those whom he had berated, for instead of creating a sympathy by his own work, much suspicion was aroused in the community that the design of the Union was simply to oppress Seventh-day Adventists. They reasoned thus, "If it is not so, why does he make then the burden of *his* criticisms and abuse." So when the time came for the captious "mass meeting," he had less than seventy-five people present, and nearly one-half of those were the Seventh-day Adventists.

Mr. G. N. Perrine who was elected temporary chairman of the meeting, and when the nominations were reported, his name appeared in the list of nominees for the Executive Board. Mr. Perrine stated to the audience that he had listed his name read among those who were to serve the Society officially, but he found it is no possible for him to serve in that capacity as he could not have the assurance of that body that the Union had no designs against those who differed with them in the matter of the Sabbath day.

He said that is talking with quite a number of fellow citizens and that very grave suspicion had been expressed that the work of this organization would be a detriment to the community, because of its apparent designs upon that member of the community who were entered as law-abiding citizens of differing Seventh-day Adventists; and he thought that this suspicion in the minds of many had caused a lack of co-operation in the organization of this Union. He then presented the following resolution, saying that unless it could be endorsed by the body present, he should withdraw his name.

WHEREAS, Uncertainty and misapprehension are prevalent in this community in regard to the American Sabbath Union toward those who in conscience observe Saturday, or any other day other than the Lord's day, therefore, that all men cooperate with the broadest tolerance and with the outlook and aims of this organization on its cooperation with the broadest tolerance and with the principles of American civil and religious liberty,

*Resolved* That we are indeed the petition in the Sunday of Michigan which exempt from its legal penalties those who religiously observe as a day of rest, a day other than the Christian holy day.

This called out remarks from Rev. Mr. Ware, who said he considered the resolution unnecessary because he had assured the people already that the attitude of the American Sabbath Union would be favorable toward the Adventist, and he declared his objected to the resolution going into the minutes of the organization of this country. But Mr. Perrine held the chair and also the co-operation of his meeting. The resolution was put to vote and the chairman announced that it was passed unanimously. There was no enthusiastic following this, and after proceedings were very brief indeed, as little remained to be done.

Whether the American Sabbath Union has designs upon the Adventist or not, is in their zeal to organize in behalf of Sunday, one thing is very evident. The attention their workers give to the Adventists in their speeches show that this people are a source of aggravation to them; and causes those among whom the Adventist reside to be suspicious of the harm is tended to those people whom the Union gathers strength enough to itself to satisfy itself in. All this, the Sabbath Union now denies, but so they also strengthen their real animus toward the Adventists will be seen by it if they have no evil designs against them, it would be as well for them to be a little less incendiary in their public speeches when referring to their work, as such a course is sure to give other communities the same ground of suspicion against the work of the Union as was expressed at the meeting in Jackson, Michigan.

H. C. CORLISS.
