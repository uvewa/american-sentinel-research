THE Great South, Birmingham, Alabama, enumerates some of the tendencies to paternalism which mark legislation at the present time, and are to be found to a remarkable degree in the demands made upon legislatures and upon Congress, and says:

Soon we may look for organized movements having in view the assumption by the Government of the right to regulate the morals of the people. It is time the country was being awakened to its danger.

Instead of coming soon, that time is already here. Never in the history of the world has there been such a marvellous organization of associations, unions, leagues, societies, circle within circle, as is now in existence, for this very thing of regulating the moral conduct of the people of the United States. Demanding also that the moral government of the Nation be paternalized, and Congress dictate to the citizens of this country whether they shall work or worship on the first day of the week.
