YOU will find it impossible to kill a principle, although you may take the life of the man who confesses that principle.—*Godly Fisher.*

"Conscience, evasion, ambiguity, are the resort of those who cannot remain silent, and yet are afraid to speak. Great opinions and fearless are powerful living possessions in favor of the truth." These sentences express facts which are given a trifle significance in the words of the Apostle Paul, "Seeing that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech."

At no time in the history of the world has there been such an opportunity as at present, for the use of plain speech, in the fear of God, to make clear to the minds of the people the fallacy of the subtle and ambiguous reasonings, by which they are being led to accept man's law in the place of God's law; church creeds in the place of the Bible; and ecclesiastical dogma in the place of Christian truth.

LORD MACAULAY ironically says, that the doctrine of "complete" majorities is all right when I'm in the majority; but all wrong when I'm in the minority."

To illustrate, take the case of the infidel. Has he no rights? He has no convictions or scruples as to religious observance. Would it be right for the Christian, who might be in the majority, to compel the infidel to observe a Christian institution? It would be all right and proper to *urge* him to be right, to *entreat* who might be in the majority, to forbid such observance. But if one is wrong so is the other.

It must, therefore, be clear to all, that the only position for the civil government, or local authorities, is simply to protect every man in his rights. If we should try to compel a man who is not a Christian, to act as do the Christians, we should only make a hypocrite of him who otherwise would be a good citizen, and he would become a dangerous man, and hence a dangerous citizen. Let us be consistent, and look at this question from the standpoint of the Golden Rule.

"Therefore all things, whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
