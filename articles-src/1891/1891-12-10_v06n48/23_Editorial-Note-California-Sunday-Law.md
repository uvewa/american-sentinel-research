At the earliest opportunity a grand effort is to be made to secure the passage of a Sunday law in California. Even now plans are being laid for this. The civil Sabbath advocates insist that civil law is essential to the preservation of the workingman's rest day. The growth of Sunday rest in California in the absence of a Sunday law is a complete refutation of this argument in favor of "civil Sabbath"; hence the anxiety to secure as soon as possible the passage of a Sunday law in that State. The drift is now toward more general rest on Sunday. Now if they can only secure a Sunday law they can in a year or two claim that the improvement is due to the law.
