REV. DR. THOMPSON, Pacific Coast Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was in Seattle, not long since, and in an address on the Sunday question, said:—

French people are undoubtedly the most wicked in the world. The reason is they have no Sabbath. Soon we will have no Sabbath here. Even now we have seven-day newspapers, which transgress and desecrate our Sabbath with impunity. It was bad enough when we had them six days in the week, but now these seven-day issues are sacrilegious. The only way we can stop this Sunday desecration is by combining all the churches in one society.

"What in the name of sense," asks an exchange, "does Dr. Thompson mean when he says, 'it was bad enough when we had newspapers six days in the week?' Does he contemplate a suppression of all the newspapers and a return to the good old times when priests were the only repositories and disseminators of information—those times called the Dark Ages? It looks that way."
