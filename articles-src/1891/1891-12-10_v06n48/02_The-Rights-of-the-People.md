IN our study of the opinion of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Tennessee, as expressed in Judge Hammond's defense of the laws that had been against the rights of the individual with respect to religious and religious observances enforced by law. We have found that in this last defense there is nowhere any recognition of what is properly and truly the rights of the individual conscience; no right of the individual to choose for himself his religion or religious observance. Everything must be submitted to the decision of the majority; it matters not what that majority may decree or demand. In short the will of the majority is made absolute in all things. The State is made supreme and absolute, and the individual is completely swallowed up and absorbed therein. The majority alone have rights, and these are bestowed by the State.

This point was merely referred to in the question and discussions last week. The point is worthy of fuller examination, therefore we quote.

The error is in doing the thing forbidden by law, because humanity is not hurt. Therefore, and in that part of the argument that it is not harmful in itself to quietly observe Saturday as a day of rest, is beside the question. It may be that the courts would hold that repeated repetitions of violation of a law forbidding even a harmless thing could be a nuisance tending to a breach of the peace.

That is to say it is a nuisance and might be *punished* as an *offense* against the will of the majority who lawfully forbidden by law the doing of the offense.

Now in view of this statement, please read carefully the following:—

We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing its power in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

In declaring that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, there is declared not only the sovereignty of the people, but the equality of the people. And in declaring the equal and inalienable right of all men to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, there is declared the entire capability of every man to enjoy life, and liberty, and to pursue happiness as in his own heart, and that he may choose for himself, so long as do not interfere with the man's equal right to the enjoyment of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is the limit that every man rightly he set to the exercise of this right and this limit is set to every man by this declaration itself. Indeed the declaration, itself, presupposes that men are equally capable of deciding for themselves as to what is best for their happiness, and but for this declaration itself.

Therein no government, no law, can ever of right forbid the doing of anything that is harmless in itself.

Governments are not instituted to interfere with or restrict individual rights, but to *protect* them.
