Should Sabbath Observance be Enforced by Law?

BY the enactment of the Thirteenth and Sixteenth Amendments to the Constitution and Adoption of Rights it is Legally Reserved.

W. A. B. (States Rights.)—Ans.? **

We will all admit that all men are endowed with the God-given right of a choice, and that their duty consists in cheerfully obeying according to the dictates of conscience. Since that right is not expressed in virtue of governmental individual agency, government can have no control over it. It never gave, nor can it take away! The glory of civil law is not the command, but the protection of liberty; for liberty will clash exempt when each gives up part for the sake of peace, and this is law. Hence I bow to its majesty and pay homage to its genius. But its bounds is *civil*, and into that realm, the reader or power in themselves is absurd not permitted. It will best endorse the purpose of its existence when performing along its *sole intent*, that of protecting man in his obedience with the dictates of conscience in a moral and imprescriptible right of man, as long as that knowledge does not trespass upon the rights of other men.

Civil and moral government, separately required by God, belong to different realms. Civil government punishes crime against *men*, but *sin*, comes on stages of moral guilt, as a perious fact on exception. To perform the principle and then to plead for an exception, let the plea be what it may, is to deny equity and justice, and outrage against that of humanity. The rights of man must everywhere and forever remain sacred and inviolate.

The plan that the doing of a harmless thing, or even the repeated repetition of it, to an infinite extent, could ever tend to a breach of the peace is most possible, and we must for a moment call attention to this. You are going quietly on your way doing something which is harmless in itself. But I tell you. And if an set of dominion, irritable, and despotic, a silk politician, that set of those wickedness attack you. A breach of the peace has been committed, but it, instead of you, but you for the breach of the peace, is law you be convicted.

Is not this supremely absurd? Is it not open to the best Harrison's thing? And this, forsooth, because in tends to a breach of the peace. You must submit to be robbed of your inalienable right, and be compelled to surrender it a tribute to the overwhelming demands of tyrannical disposition. The trametes shall not be made a slave, and the tyrannical master punished for a theft; and punished, as this is the very essence of disposition. In such a conception there is no conception of any right things are inalienable rights that a government would be an unmitigated tyranny.

But, however, let it be forever pressed, that no law can be enstalled by law, for bidding the doing of anything that is utterly harmless. Such an enactment, and essentially tyrannical in itself. Such a law be—not simply an unfairness but—an excitement of a trespass against humanity. And it is no less is when formulated by judicial or parliamentary legislation, or by the arbitrary decree of a despot. Such ideas of law and government have no place under the Declaration of Independence or the United States Constitution.

The jurisdiction of the Government is both derivative and limited. It is limited with W. A. B. (States Rights.)—Ans.?

only means by which men can become moral, so also must the enforcement of morality pertain to God alone. While morality in its hearts of the people is the only guard against vice, it does not follow that the State can define, enforce, or in any way control it with the assertion of the law.

More than one almighty hand has traced the insensible distinction between moral and civil law. Ours, when giving to man the commandments on two tables of stone. Again, under the same dispensation, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Everybody interprets the word "Cæsar" to mean civil government. Let us apply the crucial test of the law. State not the Sabbath. Where supererogation does it base? Whence but of the Most High? No civil demand is suggested therein; reader, therefore, unto God the things which are God's, not to Cæsar, not to God under the direction of Cæsar, but to God alone.

The affirmative asserted the right of government to enforce morality or religion for the good of the people. If our Government has that right, and governments have the same right. The expressed object of the Roman law was the good of the people and their religion. Having the right to enact, they had the right to enforce the laws enacted. Such hypothesis no blame can be attached to Rome for persecuting the Christians, nor can those altogether be called persecutions; for the enforcement of right laws can never be persecution. It is an enforcement; to punish the criminal. He had set forth the penalty of violated law. Now if majorities shall rule, the religion of the majority will be the *enforced* religion; and if civil legislation in religious matters be right, they may force that religion on the minority, and such are not a persecution; for the enforcement of right laws cannot be persecution.

But it may be objected that our law punishes the violation of sense of morality commandments, as murder, robbery, etc. They sin deep. These are punished as violations of the moral law, but as crimes, and hence as violation of the civil law. Says Rev. Mr. Crafts: "The law forbids murder, stealing, adultery, not as offenses against religion, but as crimes against man." The law has to do with the relations of man to *each other*, and not with the relation of man to God." Here the learned divine admits that it is not the prerogative of civil government to enforce religious institutions, and states our position exactly. Were they enforced as God's law, the truly repentant murderer or robber, being forgiven before God, would be guiltless before the State, and must go free; and were he to repeat the crime and his repentance seem seventy and seven times, still he should go unstayed of justice. Manifestly such a basis of civil law would be the destruction of all law and all government; hence it is not sound policy for the State to attempt to *exceed its jurisdiction.* The Supreme Court of the U. S. says: "Under this government, religious never rises above the *mortal* man; astringent, united with religious government never have above the *merest* despot, and not all laws where not the more compactly they are separated the better it is for both."

The fact is evident that religion has full protection under the *law* against distinction of *moralities* of right and these American Bar Association says are not Sabbath laws, and justifiable they say that if that laws are upheld at all it must be so in human reasons, they claim that these seek the protection of the workingman.

The claim asserts that men are compelled to work on the Sabbath, and has been cast into serious mental now. But such a claim or statement states only its *slavery*. No man works in our land but of his own free will. The terms of hiring are generally the custom of the country, and the Sabbath bath laws testify, and falsify the assertion.

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts says of it, he was on long on the civil Sabbath; "he has searched the world over in vain for a civil rest day divorced to the spiritual," and yet you know as much financially their refusing or to go to fining a Sunday trader? I have found scores of instances where conscientious Sabbath-breakers are imprisoned, but none where it led to repentance.

Mr. Ways, says, in his 40,000 prize essay on the Lord's day, "Hundreds of ill-spent Sundays have been made, and no case has been found in which the enforced performance of injury nor less because he refused to work of Sunday." Thus, by their principal advocates, the claim stands convicted of being entirely without foundation.
