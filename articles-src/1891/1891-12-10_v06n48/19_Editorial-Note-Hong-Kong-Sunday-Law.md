UNDER the title "Sunday Harbour Labour," the Hong-Kong Telegraph, of October 20, has this item:

"The following dispatch respecting the Sunday Cargo-working Ordinance was laid before the legislative council, yesterday:

Downing Street.
10th Sept., 1891

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch No. 258, of the 5th ult., and to approve your action in opposing the bill introduced by Mr. Whitehead to amend the Sunday Cargo-working Ordinance, by extending the date for it to come into operation to the 1st of October.

I have the honor to be, etc.,

KNOTSFORD.

The officer administering the Government of Hong Kong."

So "Downing Street" dictates Sunday Laws to the antipodes. There is a wealth of dramatic suggestiveness in this, — religious legislation by cable, from London to Hong Kong, and at this time when China is threatened with a religious war, — which furnishes food for thought.
