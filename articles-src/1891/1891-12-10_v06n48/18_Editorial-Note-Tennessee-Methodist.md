THE Tennessee Methodist, in an editorial article makes a strenuous appeal to the people of Chicago to organize for the enforcement of the Sunday laws, and tells them that "They have excellent statutes under which to push a vigorous campaign for Sabbath observance. This would help us all outside of Chicago in our work for the closing of the great Fair on Sunday. Chicago can learn a useful lesson from her sister city of St. Paul, in the matter of municipal reform by an aroused public sentiment, and the use of long dormant statutes. There is too much involved in this matter for us to entertain a remote thought of failing. Too much is to be gained or lost in the coming final great battle for the American Sabbath, by the success or failure, in procuring the Sunday closing of the World's Fair."

It was in St. Paul that the first secret committee was appointed by the Sabbath Unionists to assist in the enforcement of the municipal regulations as to Sunday. It seems that this committee has been efficient, and the result of its efforts in reviving "long dormant statutes" is held up as a worthy example to Chicago.
