WE clip the following from a late issue of the *Times.* A committee to-day at once notified the County Attorney here to enforce the Sunday-closing and gambling laws, and a discounage every day that they are now closed to-day, for the first time in the history of El Paso, the Monte Carlo of the West. The public gambling houses, with a single exception, were closed at the usual time of closing.

AT the earliest opportunity a grand effort is to be made to secure the passage of a measure being laid in California. The civil Sabbath advocates insist that civil law is essential to the institution of the Sabbath and this the religious's rest day. The growth of Sunday rest in California in the absence of a Sunday law is a complete refutation of this claim in favor of "civil" Sabbath; hence the amenity to secure as soon as possible the passage of a Sunday law in that State. The drift is now toward the general moral rest on Sunday. Now if they can be talked out or of it to secure in a year or two claim that the improvement to the law.

THE following editorial *clipping* an *Intelligencer* *Shakespeare* is from *Mail and Express*—

FOR Chancelorey M. Dupew. "It is true that I saw at once, at the kind of Mund, at a meeting called,—to worship a special interest in the objects of the day despised and fought for.to the utmost of his bodily vigor. Yet those save into the good work that could be taken for their sufferings. No those those deserve it better."

The liberty style of this makes it worthy of being placed in the calendar, as an aide to Sunday observance, compared by the Colonel of the Sabbath Union himself.

A CORRESPONDENCE of a United Press Indianopolies, describing a late meeting in Kansas City, says:

On last Sabbath, the third of a series of meetings was held in the interest of Sabbath observance, but the attendance was light, and the speaking listless. Some of the speakers severely criticized the summer for not giving sufficient prominence to the Sabbath question in their cities. One preacher, a member of one of the largest churches, while he blamed his minister of preaching for the maturity of the Sabbath, said he had never heard his pastor preach on the subject. This same pastor, "gave himself away," as a Sabbath reformer, when he told us of an invalid Sunday thing he had seen in that morning's Sunday paper.

"This is a minimist, this man was no more than worse than his fellows. The 'Sabbath reformer' is a man who agitates for law-imposing restrictions upon other people's lives upon himself.

THE CHRISTIAN UNION, under the head "Christ on Sunday," expresses its views on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and may in reference to the legal enforcement of Sunday as a weekly rest day:—

The German Socialists are beginning to demand it, not as a day consecrated to worship, but as a day reserved for a day. A like demand is made in all the workshops in France. There is a ground on which the religious and unreligious may get together. The wonderful work of the law that law stands the position of the day that is the only to be deprived of composition of the law.

By religious fiction the merchandise of the seventh day has been transferred to the first, and the burden of preserving the antiquity and maintaining righteousness, has been laid on the shoulders of civil law, by us, an unwonted transferrence of a moral legal fiction, applicable only to human and not which in maintained is manifested. The offering of these personated fictions is the ethical unconsiousness of the age.

DR. THOMPSON, Pacific Coast Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is in the Sabbath, not long since, and in his address on the Sunday question, said:—

French people are undoubtedly not the most enthusiastic Sunday people of the world; they have seven-day newspapers, which transgress and are not yet free from Saturday evening work had enough when we had them six days in the week; but since the new era these days are now a necessary. The only way we can stop this Sunday desecration is to condemn all the freedoms to one day weekly.

"What is the nature of names," asks an old writer, "I know Dr. Thompson, mean when he says, "it was bad enough when we had newspapers six days in the week?" Has he contemplated a suppression of all the newspapers and a return to the good old times when printers were the only recipients and disseminations of information?—One Times more called the Pack of our, it looks that way."

The Baltimore correspondent of the *Examiner*, writes: at some length of the last effort made by the Grand Jury of Baltimore, to revive the Sunday laws of that city, and says:

There is a symptom of returning righteousness in the enforcement of the Sunday law. The Ministerial Union of Baltimore raised its voice and cried aloud recently, against ungliest ground in aims and a countering police force, and pledged its support to the State Sabbath, themselves strong as it may seem, the desired effect was produced; and a few more weeks the present arrest was have areason. Whether all this righteous indignation on suddenly arrives at is a symptom of an improved moral sense, or a more pressing in a suspicion of Dame trouble.

So this correspondent thinks that the enforcement of the statute of Maryland forbidding bodily labor, buying and selling, keeping open places of amusement, hunting and fishing, or dredging for oysters, on Sunday, the first day of the week, is an evidence which is heralded by the corporate soul of the city of Baltimore, to the divine law of Sabbath rest on the seventh day. Numerous arrests and informations are good positives, to the mind, of an awakening of this ancient and well-known city of Sabbath observance in Baltimore. This misapplication of the legal theory of the corporate personality, to a municipal or other corporation, in civil affairs, to spiritual and religious fitness in this characteristic of the ethical unconsciousness of the age.
