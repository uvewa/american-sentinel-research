The Christian Union, under the head "Close it on Sunday," expresses its views on the Sunday closing at the World's Fair, and says in reference to the legal enforcement of Sunday as a weekly rest day:—

The German Socialists are beginning to demand it, not as a day consecrated to worship, but as a day reserved for rest. A like demand is heard in whispers even in France. Here is a ground on which the religious and unreligious can and do meet. The worshiper wishes that law should preserve the quiet of the day that he may not be deprived of his rest-day by an employer or by a competition equally compulsory. Closing the Columbian Exposition on Sunday will be a national recognition of the double demand: opening it on Sunday will be as distinctly a repudiation of this demand.

Can God, Mammon, and Satan join in a triple partnership to secure the mutual observance of the Sabbath? There is a fatal inconsistency in such a supposition as this. Will the Christian recognize, or repudiate, a demand which purports to come from an alliance so obviously impossible?
