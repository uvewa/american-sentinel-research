THE Chicago correspondent of the United Presbyterian has heard Hon. John J. Ingalls deliver a lecture in Chicago, in which he "did not hesitate to recommend the opening of the Fair on the Lord's day." The expression of this view by Mr. Ingalls has given this correspondent such a conviction of the dangerous character of the Ex-Senator's public addresses that he feels it his duty to publish the general warning that "It is safe to stay at home, if you have no better place to go to, when he lectures in your town." This person who expects to so summarily deprive Mr. Ingalls of his audience is only equalled by that other minister who boasted, in the Observer, of having contributed to the financial failure of the New Orleans Exposition by refusing to attend with his family because of its Sunday opening, and threatened similar disaster to the Chicago Exposition on the same conditions. Such clerical assumptions of censorship as these would be amusing, were they not becoming so general.
