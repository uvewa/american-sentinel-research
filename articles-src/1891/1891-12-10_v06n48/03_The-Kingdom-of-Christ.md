"THE one undying enthusiasm of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and of the National Reformers generally, namely," that Christ shall be this world's king; "is the idea of ruling over the world, or any part of it, in the teaching of the Scriptures of truth, will appear from a consideration of the following bearings upon the subject.

Christianity was not established as a national system. Its redemption will be "of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues" (Rev. 7:9), but not in the aggregate will ever be saved. Even Israel, a nation raised directly by the Lord under inspired leaders and teachers, never developed a government of sinners into a government of saints.

In establishing the gospel, James said that God "did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name." Acts 15:14. It was necessary to have a separate people, with its priesthood and generations, both to represent in type the work of Christ, and to identify him as the seed of Abraham and the son of David, in fulfillment of the promise and the prophecies. But that necessity no longer exists, and therefore Christ "hath broken down the middle wall of partition." (Eph. 2:14), putting no difference between Jews and Gentiles (Acts 15:9), declaring that "in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him." Acts 10:35. The gospel of Christ is a gospel of faith of personal piety. And the work of faith is a work of preparation for admittance to the kingdom of Christ, as Peter says "to them that have obtained like precious faith with us," that if they add to their faith the Christian graces, they shall never fall: "for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." 2 Peter 1:11.

It is a denial of every principle of the gospel to talk of "Christ coming into his kingdom in the United States" by means of a Popular vote or a constitutional amendment.

But many seem to be entirely misled— that the present power in the church is of the Saviour, and that the authority by which it is now governed by the gift of the Father. It is a fact plainly taught in the Scriptures that the Father, at different periods, conferred out of his authority different nature upon his Son. Christ himself makes an enumeration of this sort of fact when he speaks of his *conveying* five or ten cities, *etc.*, to those who are faithful objects. We refer to Rev. 3:21, where Jesus testifies thus to John: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." The difference of these thrones, and the different periods when the Son sits on them, we will notice.

1. It is the throne of the dominion of the whole universe. "God, the Judge of all" sits on this, and having "the Father" the action of all the subjects before the actor, and from it sends forth the declarations which concern the eternal destinies of all his creatures.

2. That throne is in a heavenly place, a new, and never worn, ripe state.

3. Upon that throne Christ sits as a priest—a mediator or intercessor for the people. In this he fulfils the type of Melchisedec, who was "king of Salem, and priest of the Most High God." Heb. 7:1. It says: "We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the Heavens" Heb 8:1. Paul's ascription of chapters 5, God's, is in part after the order of Melchisedec, because his priesthood is on a throne, the throne of his Father in Heaven. In this it differs from the Aaronic priesthood. Aaron, and his office was in a tabernacle at the present time—a priest—king. All this of course was not authority in his own, or with his life and character of a mediator and advocate. It is not the authority of an executive, or of one who governs for his own pleasure and sovereign supremacy. His authority in that respect is in reserve.

4. His occupancy of that throne is limited, in regard to time, to his priestly king; soon he will deliver up; his advocacy of sinners for the present time of mediation.

5. We have in his genealogy of Melchisedec, and, accordingly, Christ has no predecessor or successor in his priesthood. Having come from a tribe which could have no priesthood in Israel, and he alone in a priest on the throne of his Father.

6. While sitting upon the throne of his Father in heaven, he is expecting and looking for the gift of power and authority of another nation. "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Ps. 110:1. "After he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool." Heb. 10:12, 13. His Father puts his enemies under his feet, but not till his time reigns, on the throne of Heaven itself. 1 Cor. 15:24-28.

Upon all these thrones we may say:—

1. It is the throne—of his Father in Heaven, but of his father David. "The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David." Luke 1:32. "The God had sworn with an oath to him [David], that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would *raise up Christ* to sit on his throne." Acts 2:30.

2. *The throne of David was in Israel.* The first dominion or rule ever raised in a nation, was from Heaven, because their government was originally a theocracy. But the throne of David was the ever expected distinct from the throne of universal power whereon Christ now reigns.

3. It is counsel Christ's own throne, because it was born heir to it, and his genealogy from David had to be preserved to claim the right, and this is right he now enjoins.

4. He *reigns* upon this throne will be eternal. "The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33.

5. Jehovah promised to establish the throne and reign of David forever. Ps. 89:3, 4. "I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth." Ps. 89:5, 6, 27. The Saviour says: "To him that overcometh the kings of the earth." Therefore it was prophesied of Christ, David's son, that, when the kingdom is given to him, "all people, nations, and languages shall serve him." Dan. 7:14.

6. David was priesthood, and his kingdom was priesthood, and his heir can have no priesthood on this throne. As has been proven, the priesthood of Christ is on the throne of his Father in Heaven. Hence his reign upon the throne of David is not a priestly reign. When he is given power over the nations, according to the promise of the Father, the fulfillment of which he has put in expectation, he will no longer be a mediator or Saviour of sinners.

The jurisdiction of the Government is both derivative and limited. It is limited with regard to the *constitution* departments; sovereignty is limited with regard to the *constitution* and merely that the material and bounds which operate each department of power be investigated and maintained; but more especially that matters of power be confined to the *executing* the *part forever* which *defend the rights* of the people. The rulers who are guilty of evil-doing are answerable to the communities from which they derive their authority and are trustees over people; and so it is *as governed by laws* made neither by themselves nor by any authority derived from any other.—*James Madison.*

The truth and the sum of this whole discussion is that the views propounded in the dictum of Judge Hammond in the King case, are all the way from constitutional law; indeed, more than a hundred years behind the times; they are as though history had never been written; they are a purely upon *progressive*, a travesty upon justice, and are subversive of every principle of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution—they would usurp, sweep away every right either civil or religious that is therein declared or recognized. They are a reproduction of the old despotism both civil and religious which cursed the world for seventeen hundred years, and against which the Declaration and the Constitution are, and were intended to be, an everlasting protest.
