We clip the following from a late issue of a Texas exchange: "Governor Hogg notified the County Attorney here to enforce the Sunday-closing and gambling laws, and as a consequence every saloon in the city was closed to-day, for the first time in the history of El Paso, the Monte Carlo of the West. The public gambling houses, however, did business, and made no pretense of closing."
