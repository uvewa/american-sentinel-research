NATIONAL

RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submit-ting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

*It is not within the legitimate province of civil government to enforce religious institutions.*

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

PRESIDENT,

A. F. BALLENGER,

SECRETARY,

R. C. PORTER.

A NATIONAL clergyman has recently declared that if Chicago opens the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday it should be pushed into the bottom of Lake Michigan. An exchange remarks of this that—

The National Religious Liberty Association is the only organization now in existence which has for its purpose the defense of both civil liberty and religious freedom, with the idea of impartial protection to both, in the knowledge that neither idea is civil that the ecclesiastical authority can impede upon the judgment of the other man, that each class of citizen, as well moral as intelligence; and how God, purely, and unselfishly; American civil government was founded on reason and conscience, as laid down in the Bible, and summarized by Jesus Christ in the "Golden Rule," that protects all men, and gave to humanity the right of self government.

THE Chicago correspondent of the *United Press* furnishes in Chicago, in which he "did not hesitate to say that there was an influence back of the proposed opening of the Fair on Sunday. We have been informed that a Chicago correspondent has given this correspondent such a conviction of its truth, that Congressman Durborow, in whose district it is, that it is safe to say that in it, if you have no better place to go to, where he has so far accepted it." These people are a force to so eminently despotic Mr. Ingalls of his audience which is generally recognized; and let our friends in the character, of having contributed to the final failure of the New Orleans Exposition by refusing to attend with his family because of its open on Sundays; and threatened similar disaster to any other, if made the instrument of asserting such clerical assumption of censorship as those clergymen are putting forward.

REV. DR. WILLIAM A. BARTLETT, Pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, Washington, D. C. has accepted an appointment as the Board of Directors of the House of the Good Shepherd, an institution owned and controlled by the Roman Catholics under the immediate management of the Sisters of Charity. This spiritual and material prosperity of this institution is solely under the especial fostering care of Cardinal Gibbons. The charity lies, in common with others in the District of Columbia, shared in the largesses of the Government and now identifies with its interests one of the most popular clergymen of his denomination in the United States—that denomination which has been especially prominent in the effort to secure the organized and enforcement of religious laws, particularly for the observance of Sunday.

This is significant, and the *New York Times* says:—

The step taken in this instance is of such importance, that the whole country should bear it, and it comes after due consideration of its bearing. The importance of the matter hardly lies in the presence of one eminent Protestant clergyman. The placing of a very prominent Presbyterian within visible range of the Cardinal's red hat.

There have been other courteous toward union from Roman Catholic partisan American Protestant have accepted them. Of what is this an indication?

The Great South. Esteemed, Alabama, narrates some of the tendencies to patriotism which such legislation to enforce our Sunday, are to be found to a remarkable degree is the following made note significant and dangerous its teaching and says—

It may look for organized movements having in view the annexation by the government of lands and the consequent withdrawal of our large population here from political and social relations,

Instead of coming soon, that time is already here. Never in the history of the world has there been such migration, and shifting from one land to another, leagues, societies, circle within circle as in a new in existence; for this very thing of regulating the moral conduct of the people of the United States. Democratic also for the civil government of the Nation to patriotism, and Congress demand the citizens of this country whether people shall work or worship on the first day of the week.

AN English paper has printed paragraph from a Singapore correspondent, giving an interesting recreation of any description. They also describing a trip made by the correspondent of a London paper from Singapore to Hong Kong, to its amazement described a worthy American to observe that it would soon be possible to travel from London to Hong Kong, at and at this time there were always opportunities as well as the venture of Boston, Stock, Plymouth Rock had landed on the Pacific.

Although this is neither a crushing sentiment yet it would as doubt have forced what is the fact that the of the visitant Brewster's when those saint established it. An English colonist who was prevented his reaching New York in time to take part in the old world's fair part of Boston. They turned him from his belongings. "Arrived in Springfield in time, but lost there in our train to New York before it started. Am detained here to spend the day. You may imagine my grief, but it is not my fault," etc. His answer was characteristic. On learning the impossibility of keeping his engagements, said asks. If it is right to try, why not try upon a fault. "If I had the right to one electricity, why not steam."

The Sunday Carbondale Association's *resolutions* on the matter were rather a curious one. They held themselves upon such an incident as this, but the resolution or morals, would ever be weakened by heaven because of it? No, because the obedience "of these people" is all to "the law" and "does not a glad doing of the will of God."

Two women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Canada, in convention, have resolved that the habits of the hands of Canadian women will "bring the no-compromise back from the politician."

This is no doubt so. It may be that it will be proved to be so. And when the sin commensurates its work but not.—"*Utah News.*"

The Reverend Melchissedec, in an editorial article narrates a strenuous report in the people of Chicago to organize for the enforcement of the Sunday laws, and tells that that "They have ascertained matters under which to push a vigorous campaign for Sabbath observance. This would help us all outside of Chicago to our work for the closing of the great World's Fair." Chicago also has a mortal loom from her sister city of St. Paul, in the minister of municipal reform to an an account public the municipal law.

There is too much involved in this matter for its presentation to be made solely on church grounds. It is to be gained or lost in the coming final great battle for a democratic Sabbath for the purpose of failure, in procuring the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

It was in St. Paul that the first secret committee was organized by the National Reform Association. It is the enforcement of the municipal regulations as to the Sunday, not the attempt to obtain new laws, is reflected, and the result of its efforts in inviting "long dormant statutes to hold up a war-like coverlet enough to Chicago."

Under the title "Sunday Harbor Labour," the statistics and shipping are presented.

The following dispatch regarding the Sunday Cargo-working Ordinance was held before the legislature:—

"SHIPPING " GAZETTE " SECTION.—I beg to direct your Regards No. 226, of the 5th alt, in our entry of the 28th August, 1889. We have again been applied to by the Working Trades Association for imposing a tax on Cargo-working ordinance, by extending the dies non clause for Sabbath observance to all cargo working.

"Writing 'Barclay' (stations Sunday Laws in Singapore.) There is a wealth of branching off to the side from the main track of discussion from London to Hong Kong, and at this time when there were always opportunities as well as the fortuitous food of discussion.

Two *Presbyterian* journals the call for an organized *resistance* to the movement some Sunday *friends* interested in the Exposition, in this manner of country.

Our position have been laid upon the shelf and so our effort to get a hearing is entirely in the same manner, nothing further can be done because of it. The question at issue in this case is upon the public, if it is to be made an occasion for loss to the public at all, the position in which it is not to take place, that it should throw its door of failure, failure, that it should throw its doors open on Sunday; for it would be better for the public that there is to be no Exposition at all. To embarrass it in any question in connection with this material matters is a question of course, and of the Church and religious associations, but by personal influence, and the Christian ballot in the great civil contest.

The *Freedoms of the Angles* Club of New York City, the Sabbath Sentinel of Chicago, as the closing of the World's Fair increases in warmth, is becoming seriously alarmed at the prospect of worship had come to religious bulldozing.

Two *Freedoms of the Angles* Club of New York City, the *New York Tribune*, the free and that a justice court for taking on Sunday, and can testify the Sabbath observance be defended. Finally the justice of the justice was sentenced, and Judge Warner said that the question could not so whether the religious feel regreted or sentiments of the community have injured; the simple question of law has been violated or failed, and spelling out for fining on this day.

That gradually, but surely, the sword of the Sabbath Union is being tempored and sharpened.
