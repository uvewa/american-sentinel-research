The American Sabbath Union has been threatening for more than a year to invade the State of Michigan, and organize it in behalf of their work, but for some reason, unknown to the writer, they have deferred their action until the present time. One thing, however, is certain; they knew that it was the stronghold of the Seventh-day Adventists, and possibly they deferred visiting that State until their organization was strong enough in other States to give them the amount of courage necessary to face such inveterate enemies to their work as they hold the Seventh-day Adventists to be.

On Monday, Nov. 16, a mass meeting was held in the principal Methodist Episcopal Church of Jackson, and Rev. F. W. Ware of Grand Rapids, the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for Michigan, attempted the first county organization in the State. Previous to this, however, he had tried to show the citizens of that city the necessity of organizing in behalf of the preservation of the "American Sabbath," which almost wholly consisted in pointing out that Seventh-day Adventists were the "organized enemies" of the American Sabbath Union in that they zealously opposed their desire for stringent Sunday laws.

The sequel showed, however, that he had mistaken the feelings of the people toward those whom he had berated, for instead of creating a sympathy in his own work, much suspicion was aroused in the community that the design of the Union was simply to oppose Seventh-day Adventists. They reasoned thus, "If it is not so, why does he make them the burden of his criticisms and abuse." So when the time came for the appointed "mass meeting," he had less than seventy-five people present, and nearly one-third of these were the Seventh-day Adventists.

Mr. C. K. Perrine was elected temporary chairman of the meeting, and when the nominations were reported, his name appeared in the list of nominees for the Executive Board. Mr. Perrine stated to the audience that he had heard his name read among those who were to serve the Society officially, but that he found it impossible for him to serve in that capacity unless he could first have the assurance of that body that the Union had no design against those who differed with them in the matter of the Sabbath day.

He said that in talking with quite a number of his fellow-citizens that day, grave suspicions had been expressed that the work of this organization would be a detriment to the community, because of its apparent designs upon members of the community who were esteemed as law-abiding citizens; namely, Seventh-day Adventists; and he thought that this suspicion in the minds of many had caused a lack of co-operation in the organization of the Union. He then presented the following resolution, saying that unless it could be indorsed by the body present, he should withdraw his name:—

WHEREAS, Uncertainty and misapprehension are alike in the minds of some at the attitude of the American Sabbath Union toward those who, in good conscience, observe as the Sabbath a day other than the Lord's day, therefore, that all may co-operate with us with the greatest assurance that the methods and aim of this organization are in accord with the broadest toleration and with the principles of American civil and religious liberty, be it

Resolved, That we indorse that provision in the Sunday law of Michigan which exempts from its legal penalties those who religiously observe as a day of rest, a day other than the Christian Sabbath.

This called out remarks from Rev. Mr. Ware, who said he considered the resolution unnecessary because he had assured the people already that the attitude of the American Sabbath Union would be favorable toward the Adventists, and he therefore objected to the resolution going into the minutes of the organization of the county Union. But Mr. Perrine had the chair and also the control of the meeting. The resolution was put to vote and the chairman announced that it was passed unanimously. There was no enthusiasm following this, and later proceedings were very brief indeed, as little remained to be done.

Whether the American Sabbath Union has designs upon the Adventists or not, in their zeal to organize in behalf of Sunday, one thing is very evident. The attention their workers give to the Adventists in all their speeches show that this people are a source of aggravation to them; and causes those among whom the Adventists reside to be suspicious that harm is intended to these people when the Union gathers strength enough to itself to safely inflict it. All this, the Sabbath Union now denies, but as they grow stronger their real animus toward the Adventists will be seen by all. If they have no evil designs against them, it would be as well for them to be a little less incendiary in their public speeches when referring to their work, as such a course is sure to give other communities the same ground of suspicion against the work of the Union as was expressed by the meeting in Jackson, Michigan.
