THE National Religious Liberty Association is the only organization now in existence which has for its purpose the defense of both civil liberty and religious freedom, with the idea of impartial protection to both, in the knowledge that neither the civil nor the ecclesiastical authority can trench upon the sphere of the other without becoming, in either case, as well uncivil as irreligious; and does this purely, solely, and unseemingly, without fear of prejudice, party, or man, from the principles laid down in the Bible, and enunciated by Jesus Christ, who with the Father, made the world and man, and gave to humanity the right of self-government.
