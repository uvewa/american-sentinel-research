LORD MACAULAY ironically says, that in matters of conscience "majorities are all right when I'm in the majority; but all wrong when I'm in the minority."

To illustrate, take the case of the infidel. Has he no rights? He has no convictions or scruples as to religious observances. Would it be right for the Christian, who might be in the majority, to compel the infidel to observe a Christian institution? It would be all right and proper if it would be right for the infidel, who might be in the majority, to forbid such observance. But if one is wrong so is the other.

It must, therefore, be clear to all, that the only position for the civil government, or local authorities, is simply to protect every man in his rights. If we should try to compel a man who is not a Christian, to act as do the Christians, we should only make a hypocrite of him who otherwise would be a good citizen, and thus he would become a dangerous man, and hence a dangerous citizen. Let us be consistent, and look at this question from the standpoint of the Golden Rule. "Therefore all things, whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
