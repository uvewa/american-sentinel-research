"SUNDAY in Great Britain."

This is the heading of an article published in the *Westminster Review* in *, 1891.* The article shows distinctly, that, from its very earliest origin, the Sunday Sabbatarianism idea has tended both to religious and civil bondage. It shows also that in the controversy arising in the pliant attempts to enforce Sunday by law, almost every argument now brought forward by Mr. Crafts, and the American Sabbath Union, as something entirely new, and based on the forces competition of our modern civilization, has been brought forward before, and fairly replied to by the friends of liberty.

The paper is very long, and space forbids us to do more than transcribe a few of the most striking passages. In speaking of the well known historical fact, that the Scotch were the first people to give to the gradually developing Sunday institution the gallantly Sabbath idea, the *Review* very aptly says:—

The Scotch habit of Sabbath-breaking was called a thing wrong, and persuaded others to treat a thing a thing wrong, and had been held to be right through the long ages of Christian antiquity, and is all to right by the old practice throughout the continental Europe. They proved it was wrong by the canon of their own Kirk, no other authority, a law but upon occasion. However what their topic may have been, the fact remains that they broke new ground in the history of the world. Having laid established it, they raised a new external standard by which to measure the duty of the day. If they made an apparent *fiat*; they have exisited thousands of years upon what is generally considered a good authority. They have committed this sin, and sedulously this they have committed this sin, and sedulously the people have waded in. They increased the sin of Sunday breaking as normally men after offending as the priests of Egypt and India inverted the sin of breaking a fast, in England to this kind we trace those sins of judicial invention have not counterpart of and how much the world has suffered ever since.

The present writer, who is a Scotchman, thinks that Scotch Sunday could know the history of the "holy day" they have invested with the sanctity of worship as at a convention to as to future of generations.

This last is also true of the present victims of the Sunday superstition, and the Sunday laws. However this may be with the victims, the ambitious clergy, who are seeking political power, and desiring to establish a theocracy through Sunday legislation, are now, as then, not deterred in the slightest from carrying out their designs by Biblical or other knowledge.

After quite a lengthy account of the use of the Sunday festival, and the gradual encroachments into the modern Sabbath, the paper continues:—

The custom of the Sabbath was imported from England into Scotland about the close of the sixteenth century, at a time when the influence of Puritanism had by that time greatly increased, and was soon to come to such a pass in the Puritan spirit, found ready acceptance north of the Tweed. The different bodies of spiritual persons (churches) set to work, driving people to church, fining them, imprisoning those and bewildering them; and thus commenced the long, sad, disheartening history of action. Several collections of the ordinances of the Kirk Session have been published recently, and there we have the whole record of this mournful but ludicrous history. There are already any contemporary documents which equally set before us the life of the quiet homely citizens of the day as does these dusty rolls—when a frightful spiritual bondage was a gratuitous felony. All games were strictly prohibited. One writer is "at the pillars" for playing at bowls on the Sabbath, another is ordered by eyelid fiddler for playing at football. Salmon fisheries gave occasion to many troubles; routine expulsions seem like kind of the whole population at times were accused of fishing on the Sabbath. Occasionally some tradesmen had been detected at the crime of "baking the bread of them." But generally, their tyranny was only limited by opportunities of the people. They happened to pay eight marks "for having epin and wool on the Sabbath;" two men were punished for "carrying peats," for mending their creels, for "fetching and walking in the foord for, was fined for being found in the street during "sermon time." Again a boy "who, while on errand for a stroll to Cuthfield, was punished with imprisonment and fined:" another "heard tell of a man who was imprisoned for 'going to Cramond on the Lord's day morning with a load of salt, and another who was held suspect against a repetition of the offence. The magistrates and their spiritual eyes were on a sharp look out for offenders, and to prevent profanity it was directed that they "shall go up and down" the town on the Lords day, and all other fast days and cause make particular notice of all transgressors, by working on their callings, walking in the streets, and cause cite them before the Session, and such as shall be found tippling in time of sermon and tyranny was, perhaps, reached by the Edinburgh magistrates, who ordained "that the magistrates to examine some English soldiers for going the streets in the time of sermon;" visitors, both before sermon and after sermon, and to cause delinquents to suffer punishment, with certification of those who shall violate this statute of their known sin and charge."

After all this, and much, much this, writer asks "And now how is Sunday at the close of the nineteenth century spent in Scotland and England?" This is a very important question; for on the same principle are now being advocated for establishing the "proper observance" of Sunday here in this country, it is well to know what kind of an observance is thus produced. The paper continues:—

Of the Scottish Sabbath, it is scarcely possible for the unhistorical to be say anything. Scotland is a nation which possesses few or no amusements, and in which the people still follow the customs of old religious life. The Scotch Sunday is one of unbroken dullness, with a degree of severity not has been learned from St. Paul, the doctrine of Christian liberty. Innocent pleasures has this country and has never even shaken the idea Jews, and their monotony more noticeable than that of the United States. Scotch law provides severe penalties against any one making a quiet stroll on Sunday beyond the limits of their own parishes, and can hardly have believed that their descendants, own principles, or morals, would ever be weakened by blinds on Sunday, let their eyes should wander beyond their Sabbath days' journey. In truth the "Scottish Sunday" is a wonder of the age and holds that. In the nineteenth century of the Christian era should people consent to be kept on the Sabbath by men who have freely hold for the sun, is a country that has more respect for its observances than its neighbors at present. Such bondage like Adam Smith and Sir Walter Scott, is actually thought a misfortune's heritage to fall.

Scotch religion in Scotland says "you shall close the blinds of windows and only last hats such on the Sabbath;" just as an English gentleman who had discovered an African tribe did that did this, what similar performances are gone through. It is of course, what subscriptions, and teachings, and edemas for, their conversions. Yet do not seen that this custom has been the most significant one in the avaricious custom but is one frequent enough to be noticed not as a Social collection.

Yet it is a fact that enlightened Massachusetts, in this present year of grace, has furnished a parallel to this picture of Scottish penance.

In a certain case of the American Sabbath Union, held in Island Lowell, the Unitarian minister testified that he and his wife were on the street in his town on a certain Sunday, and that thomsands of the people came out, and shot themselves up in the darkness; that of the sounds of the bicycles and horseback pleasure riders, who came throughing by.

A young lady, a member of the who had a house was near the beach, was compelled to look horrod at a dark room, because the shades were down on their Sabbath. This is the kind of Sabbath which the American Sabbath Union desires to make universal in this country. Although they have factored daily for physical recreation for the Sabbath, outside of that the bone and the amusement. But we will close this article with one more quotation from the *Review*:—

From all the towns near in Scotland to any railway running trainline whatever on Sunday. Ministers go off to the country for rest and relaxation, and although he was beaten in the general election, this is his only hope for freedom; and those who have worked with him has lived to see the truth of his faith made clear enough to get throughout the street. The inhabitants of the town feel it or not. "Is it fair and is it just (she turned bountiful and bravely and opened quite so beautifully)? And what does this century lead to? Is it not to a demand which is spreading fast to Scotland?" "Yes," or so it seems, it requires a man not to labor but may not go out and refresh himself, a man obligated to a holiday without means to lend himself with whiskey. Sunday strictness on the part of the Kirk, is far better now than they want further prohibitions. If the 'American' understand the English plan, let it hold, the Forbes MacKenzie Act already closes the taverns, so that refreshment of passengers depends upon the sale liquors on Sunday. Ross has begun to dose bread and provision shops on Sunday."

This same result will be seen before here whether it is known or not, in the law getting out into the country on Sunday will be regarded a crime, and one having his Sabbath, as the authorities consider the amusement and instruction in art galleries, museums, and picture galleries.

These lovers of religious despotism, the result will be that social clubs will be forced, by the thousand, in our cities and towns. Their sole purpose in private houses, will engage in loud playing, and carousing and worse things, in places beyond the law.
