The statement is frequently made, and appears even in some school books, that the earliest official recognition of religious liberty in this country was by a Roman Catholic in Maryland. And the impression is sometimes given that this was the origin of the American idea of freedom of conscience. The truth is, however, that while the Governor of the Colony, Lord Baltimore, was a Roman Catholic, at the time of the passage of the act of religious toleration in 1646, the Catholics had more than enough to do to hold their own against an aggressive Protestant majority; and it is not strange that Lord Baltimore favored religious freedom since his own people, the Catholics, had everything to gain and nothing to lose by it.

At that time England was Presbyterian, and with a majority of Protestants in Maryland and in the Colonial Legislature, the most natural thing for the Catholics to do was to favor entire freedom in religious matters.

But the so-called religious freedom of Maryland was not worthy the name, for as late as 1723 a law was enacted, Section 1 of which, reads as follows:—

Be it enacted by the right honorable the lord proprietor, by, and with the advice and consent of his lordship's governor, and the upper and lower houses of assembly, and the authority of the same, That if any persons shall hereafter, within this province, wittingly, maliciously, and advisedly, by writing or speaking, blaspheme or curse God, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the person's thereof, and shall be thereof convict by verdict, or confession, shall, for the first offense, be bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor to be applied to the use of the county where the offense shall be committed, to be levied on the offender's body, goods and chattels, lands or tenements, and in case the said fine can not be levied, the offender to suffer six months' imprisonment without bail or mainprise: and that for the second offense, the offender being thereof convict as aforesaid, shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B and fined forty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor, to be applied and levied as aforesaid, and in case the same can not be levied, the offender shall suffer twelve months' imprisonment without bail or mainprise; and that for the third offense, the offender being convict as aforesaid, shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy.

It is true that this statute was Puritan rather than Catholic, as was also Section 10 of the same law providing severe penalties for Sunday labor. But that only shows that Maryland was Protestant and not Catholic; and, that in securing a statute of toleration the Catholics were actuated not by principle but by self-interest.
