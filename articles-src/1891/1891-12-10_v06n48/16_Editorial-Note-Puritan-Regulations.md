AN English paper has this pointed paragraph in reference to ancient Puritan regulations.

The Puritan settlers in New England left behind them severe laws against Sunday traveling or recreation of any description. They also punished witchcraft with death, and inspired as much gloom as possible in the community. These things induced a worthy American to observe that it would have been a great deal better for the country, if, instead of the Pilgrim Fathers landing on Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock had landed on the Pilgrim Fathers.

Although this is rather a crushing sentiment yet it would no doubt have found an echo in the feelings of the violinist Remonyi when these same "severe laws against Sunday traveling," prevented his reaching New York in time to take part in the Seidl concert, of November 29, and caused him to telegraph; "Arrived in Springfield in time, but there is no train to New York before evening, owing to Connecticut Sunday laws. You may imagine my grief, but it is not my fault," etc.

The Recorder notes that he was able to wire the impossibility of keeping his engagement, and asks, "If it is right to wire, why not to run a train? If it is right to use electricity, why not steam?"

The Sunday Unionists would no doubt congratulate themselves upon such an incident as this, but for what sufficient cause? Is any one nearer heaven because of it? No, because the obedience is but an unwilling subjection to man's law instead of a glad doing of the will of God.
