"CONCEALMENT, evasion, ambiguity, are the resort of those who cannot remain silent, and yet are afraid to speak. Great openness and frankness are powerful prepossessions in favor of the truth." These sentences express facts which are given a loftier significance in the words of the Apostle Paul, "Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech."

At no time in the history of the world has there been such an opportunity as at present, for the use of plain speech, in the fear of God, to make clear to the minds of the people the fallacy of the subtle and ambiguous reasonings, by which they are being led to accept man's law in the place of God's law; church creeds in the place of the Bible; and ecclesiastical dogma as the rule of civil affairs.
