THE President of the Anglers' Club of Clark's Lake, New York, has been arrested and fined in the justice court for fishing on Sunday, and carried the case to the County Court where the action of the justice was sustained, and Judge Wisner held that the question could not arise as to whether the religious repose or sentiment of the community had been disturbed or outraged, but that by force of the statute, that specific act of fishing on Sunday was made criminal.

Thus gradually, but surely, the sword of the Sabbath Union is being tempered and sharpened.
