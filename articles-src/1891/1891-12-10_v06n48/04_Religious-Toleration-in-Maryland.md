That statement is frequently made by the earnest friends of Roman Catholicism, the earliest official recognition of the right of freedom of conscience for all worshippers in this country was by a Roman Catholic in Maryland. And the intimation is sometimes given that this was the origin of the American idea of freedom of conscience. The truth is, however, that while the Governor of the Colony, Ps. Lord Baltimore, was a Roman Catholic, and the claim was made of the act of religious toleration in 1649, the Catholic had no more than enough to do to hold their own position against the Puritans in the Colony; and it is not strange that Lord Baltimore favored religious freedom since his own people, the Catholics, had everything to gain by it.

At that time England was Presbyterianity, with a majority of Protestantism in its several forms, predominating. And the most natural thing for the Catholics was to favor toleration, and the next most natural thing was for the Puritans to try to crush the Catholics, and their policy gained the mastery.

But the *secular* religious legislation of Maryland was not worthy this name, for the reason that, in 1723 a law was enacted, restricting the liberty of Catholics.

It is enacted by his lordship being horrible the lord proprietor of this province, by and with the advice of his lieutenant governor, and the upper and lower houses of assembly, and the authority of the same:—

That if any person shall hereafter, within this province, willfully, maliciously, and advisedly, by writing or speaking, blaspheme or curse God, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the said three Persons of the Trinity, or the unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, and shall thereof be convict by verdict, or confession, he or she, for the first offence, shall be bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds sterling, and their power pending of the lord proprietor or his lieutenant governor for the time being, that in case the said fine be not paid within six months after sentence is passed, the offender to suffer six months imprisonment without bail or mainprise; and that for the second offence, the offender being thereof convicted as aforesaid, shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B, and fined forty pounds sterling, the offender being thereof convicted as aforesaid, the offender shall forfeit all his or her lands to the lord proprietor, and suffer imprisonment without bail or mainprise; and that for the third offence, the offender being convicted as aforesaid, shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy.

It is true that this statute was Puritan and not Catholic, but it was a Maryland statute providing severe penalties for Sunday. But that only demonstrates that Maryland was Protestant at this time, not Catholic, and that the Catholics could only take what the Puritans would give, and so a good deal of their free talk is only bombast.

God never intended that the pulpit, and the Church, and the press, and personal influence, should give place, in any great moral conflict for reform, to the baton of the policeman.
