THE Baltimore correspondent of the Examiner, writes at some length of the last effort made by the Grand Jury of Baltimore, to revive the Sunday laws of that city, and says:—

There is a symptom of returning righteousness in the enforcement of the Sunday law. The Ministerial Union of Baltimore raised its voice and cried aloud, recently, against negligent grand juries and a conniving polish force, and pledged its support to the State Sabbath Association. Strange as it may seem, the desired effect was produced, and for a few weeks arrests and indictments have been numerous. Whether all this righteous indignation so suddenly aroused is a symptom of an improved moral sense, or a mere passing spasm, is a question of the future.

So this correspondent thinks that the enforcement of the statute laws of Maryland forbidding bodily labor, buying and selling, keeping open places of amusement, hunting and fishing, or dredging for oysters, on Sunday, the first day of the week, is an evidence of conformity, by the corporate soul of the city of Baltimore, to the divine law of Sabbath rest on the seventh day. Numerous arrests and indictments are proof positive, to his mind, of an awakening of the ancient and composite conscience of the civic Lady Baltimore. This misapplication of the legal theory of the corporate personality of a municipal or other corporation, in civil affairs, to spiritual and religious responsibilities is the characteristic intellectual unsoundness of the age.

By religious fiction the sacredness of the seventh day has been transferred to the first, and the burden of preserving its sanctity and maintaining righteousness, laid upon the shoulders of civil law; by an unwarranted spiritualizing of a legal fiction, applicable only to human affairs, a civic ghost is materialized. The offspring of these personified fictions is an illegal monstrosity.
