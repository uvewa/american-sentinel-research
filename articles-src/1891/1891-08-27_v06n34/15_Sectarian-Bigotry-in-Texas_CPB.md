The following from the Sunday Gazetteer, of Denison, Texas, reveals about as curious a phase of combined bigotry and paternalism as has ever come to our knowledge:—

Under the head, "A Nice Question," the Fort Worth Gazette publishes a dispatch from Austin which conveys the remarkable intelligence that those at the head of the Summer Normal School at San Antonio are in a quandary because several sisters of charity who have been in attendance at the school have passed creditable examinations and demand their certificates. They pretend that they don't know whether the certificates should be issued or not, because "the sisters belong to purely religious orders," whose work is all done in the interest of the mother church, and their wages would go to the church, in derogation of the law that no part of the public school fund shall be used in the interest of any sect or church." The dispatch further continues that "the superintendent saw fit to refer the question to the attorney-general for his opinion in the matter."

That such a question should be raised is extremely ridiculous. If those ladies have proved themselves competent they are entitled to their certificates, under the law, and no person can justly deprive them of them. It is no business of the State what these sisters or any of the public school teachers do with their money, and there is no violation of State law in giving the money they earn by teaching in the public schools to aid the spread of Catholicism if they want to. A Catholic school teacher has as much right to donate her money for this purpose as a Protestant teacher has to contribute her hard-earned savings to foreign missions, or to buying a new carpet for the parsonage. The law forbids the appropriation of money for the support of schools where religion is taught, and hence no teacher in a public school should be allowed to teach religion or permit religious observances or ceremonies of any kind in the school room. This is a very wise provision, and should be strictly enforced, but there should be no discrimination in the choice of teachers because of difference of religious faith, or on account of a lack of it.

That such a question as this should be raised for the reason given is almost past belief. Had the objection to granting the certificates been on the ground that being devoted to the service of the Roman Catholic Church, and having adopted the peculiar garb of their order, they would necessarily, because of that peculiar dress, and naturally, because of their devotion to that form of religion, exert a sectarian influence over their pupils, it would have been more reasonable;—which however is not saying much;—for it would seem that that question could have been safely left to the local school boards employing them. As it is it seems that in the case of these sisters bigotry and paternalism have run wild. The writer is not prepared to say that objection might not properly be made to a distinctively religious garb in the public school room, but the idea that certificates should be refused solely on the ground that the persons receiving them would, if employed, devote their wages to the interest of a particular church, is utterly repugnant to the spirit of our free institutions. Paternalism could scarcely go further, and bigotry never attained a more vigorous growth even in the hot-bed of mediaeval superstition.
