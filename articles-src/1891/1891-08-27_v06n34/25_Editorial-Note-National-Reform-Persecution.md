THE *Christian Statesman* says there is no intolerance and no persecution in National Reform, and adds, "Nay, more, here is the highest, most efficacious safeguard against persecution. For if, as THE SENTINEL believes, the law of God forbids all persecution for opinion's sake, how then can the acknowledgment of that law by the State lead the State to persecution?"

The question is not difficult. National Reform proposes to administer the law of God, or, in other words, it proposes to make men judges of the divine law. The effect must be to put the government in the place of God and thus destroy individual responsibility to God; for if it were the duty of human government to administer the divine law, it would also be the duty of the subject of human government to obey implicitly that law as given to him by the government. It follows that under the National Reform regime, men would inquire not what says the law of God, but what says the interpreter about that law. In short, the real standard of action would be not the divine law, but a human and fallible interpretation of that law, which would afford not the slightest guarantee against persecution. Moreover National Reform is not a new thing; the history of the Papacy, written in the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, tells us just what the inevitable result of human administration of the law of God must always be. All human government is force, and all force in matters of religion is persecution.
