## God of Caesar.

ALTHOUGH for the sake of the political Christian party, many religio-political reformers stigmatize our secular form of government as "atheistical," and in the same set it a "political atheism," yet it remains a fact that the words "We are Christians" were spoken. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's," and the churches that "the rulers who have nations on earth say to the ground, 'We are one body,' and that are God's," probably had more moral influence in the adoption of our secular form of government than anything. Those words were made the basis of sermons by ministers in all parts of the land; they were used by statesmen, conventions and legislatures; they were canvassed in political discussions, until Christian people everywhere thoroughly understood that the Christian theory and the secular government were one and the same thing.

Ex-President Madison had occasion to remonstrate concerning paying the corner-stone of St. Matthew's Church in New York—an address which touched upon the relation of religion and the State. Speaking of the address, Madison says:—

> ...natural, with past independences, and of sordid attachment to a particular creed, understood with [page 269] seriousness entirely. It illustrates the condition of a system [our secular theory] which, by a due distinction, in which the greater and courage of both parties to religion and society are at best secured, and what is due to God, best promotes the discharge of both obligations.

> The experience of the United States is happily adapted of the one so long needed in the moment of the old world. Previous to the revolution of ours as well in the corrupt forms of penetrating more of both have been sustained to a degree that in all civil policy, neither could be supported. A reflection is calculated to console us most friendly that religion is no less necessarily for civil society, to social harmony, and to political prosperity.

With the directness that constitutes greatness that government is the direct offspring of the great religious movement—the Reformation—and his reference to the words of Christ, we may give full credence to the assertion words from Bancroft's rather than accept the prejudicial adorn of those who would, if they could, destroy our grand political system of the American Republic, and substitute what an actual realization of the world. Bancroft says:

> Vindicating the right of individuality in religion, and in religion above all, the new Nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to find the principles first divinely ordained in Judea. It felt the impossibility of temporal powers; in the temporal power; but the American Constitution, in harmony with the largeness of the several States, withheld from the National Government the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul, and not from *indifference,* but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and its purtiful power.—"*History of the Formation of the Constitution,*" book 4, chap. 8.
