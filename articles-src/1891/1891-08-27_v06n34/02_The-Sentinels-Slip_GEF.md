Under this heading, Freethought of July 25, published a criticism on an article of the writer's, in THE SENTINEL. The "SENTINEL's slip" consisted, according to Freethought, in saying of a true theocracy: "This is, and must ever remain, the perfect ideal government."

The reasons given in THE SENTINEL for this statement are as follows. "God is infinite in goodness and in wisdom. Because he is infinite in goodness, he always desires what is best for the people, and what is best for them is always the best for his own honor and glory. Because he is infinite in wisdom, he always knows what is best—knows it better than any one man in the nation, and better than the majority of men in the nation. Therefore a true theocracy to every devout believer in God, must ever remain the ideal of government, far in advance of monarchy or republicanism."

Now, even Freethought, if it will for a moment lay aside the sectarian prejudice of agnosticism enough to think freely, can not deny one of those propositions. To deny them is to deny the goodness and wisdom of God, and to deny God's goodness and wisdom, is to deny his existence as God. This is atheism, and not agnosticism. Freethought may deny that God ever did or ever will reveal himself to humanity for the purpose of such government, but that does not affect the ideal. It still would be something to dream over and long for.

The Bible asserts that God will thus reveal himself to humanity, and that he will not only give them his perfect law of liberty, but that he will write that law not on statute books merely, but in the hearts of his subjects; so that they will keep it, not from fear of punishment, but because they love it and want to keep it. Thus will all restraint of law be changed to restraint of love, and the perfect ideal be realized in a redeemed world. Now Freethought may deny that all this will ever be, but it cannot deny the ideal—it cannot deny that if a perfect God saw fit to thus write a perfect law in the hearts of his subjects, it would be the only perfect liberty of which intelligent beings are capable.

Now a perfect ideal is never perfectly realized in an imperfect world, and the writer did not assert that the theocratic ideal was even on the start, perfectly realized by Israel.

The fact is it was never realized at all, for from the very foot of the smoking mountain they rebelled against God. The Israelites were a barbarous, ignorant race, from which the shackles of slavery had just been broken. They were utterly incapable of true liberty, till right ideas of truth and justice had been implanted in their hearts; and yet they were the only people who had preserved, even though imperfectly, the sublime truth of the unity of Deity. That one God sought to reveal himself to them in such a manner as to make them capable of liberty.

He first gave them his perfect law, a law that even Freethought can not improve upon. The design of that law summed up, was to bring all men to the worship of this one God, as father; thus uniting them in one family of brothers and sisters, so making them capable of true liberty.

It was necessary to the realization of the ideal of liberty, that this law should be more than written on tables of stone; it must be written in the heart, so that men of their own free will will want to do the things it requires.

God was revealed in infinite love, by the gospel of his promised Son, to do this very work; but this gospel "did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."

Even as Freethought does to-day, "they stumbled at this stumbling stone," Christ, so rejecting him, the law could not be written in their hearts. Therefore to restrain their brutal passions, and prevent complete anarchy, it was necessary that the motive of fear be brought in play by severe penalties. All those imperfections in the government of Israel, which Freethought points out, and which the writer deplores as much as *Freethought* can, were either the necessities of the barbarism of the times, or the results of that barbarism. In either case they were the result of the *revolt against* the divine ideal of government, which can only be realized by faith, and not the result of its realization. As a true theocracy perfectly realized in the heart of each individual, as it will be in the redeemed world, is the most perfect liberty; so a false man-made theocracy, enforcing its so-called, divine laws, upon the outward man, without power to change the heart into harmony with these laws, is the most perfect of despotisms. It may be that *Freethought*, bound by its prejudice against God and the Bible, and redemption through Christ, can not think freely enough to appreciate these sublime truths, but to the Christian intellect as well as heart, they are evident and precious.
