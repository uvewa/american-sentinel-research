## NATIONAL Religious Liberty Association.

The Philistines of Hastings, Michigan, spoke of the King case.

As what has been accomplished in Tennessee against the Seventh day people, may to other States and communities encourage to attempt similar prosecution and by their cruelty. Now we ask: to do we alert for it.

A meeting held in the Amphitheatre at Chautauqua on the 11th instant, in the interest of the American Sabbath Union, the following resolution, offered by Bishop Vincent was unanimously passed:—

> Desiring that in the interest of workingmen and in harmony with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures and the public necessities of our republic, we most earnestly petition that the proper authorities to close the gates of the World's Columbian Exposition on the first day of the week.

The Bishop evidently agrees with Mr. Crafts that "take the religion out and you take the last out," and so left the religion in when writing this resolution.

LOUISIANA, Indiana, has a pastor that is an enthusiast in the Sunday-closing movement. He says things there; and one man has been arrested for following his usual vocation on the first day of the week. This makes divine has not the only State whose Sunday law has been enforced lately, but it very mild in his threatening: he only thinks it a necessity to drive any and every man who will oppose Sunday laws. If the Lord Jesus were on the ground among these people he would drive the atheist, infidel, and all opposers of his laws out of the world; and so now they ought to try to do the same.

With a proper regard for facts it is hard to conceive that any sane man could say that such ministers do not have the spirit of Christ instead of that of the Devil.
