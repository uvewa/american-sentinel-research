Although for the sake of prejudicing Christian people, many religio-political reformers stigmatize our secular form of government as "atheistical," and the secularist as a "political atheist," yet it remains a fact that the words of Christ, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's," probably had more influence in the adoption of our secular theory of government than any other one thing. Those words were made the texts of sermons by ministers in all parts of the land; they were used by statesmen, conventions and legislatures; they were repeated in political disquisitions, until Christian people everywhere thoroughly understood that the Christian theory and the secular of government were one and the same thing.

Ex-President Madison had occasion to recall this fact on receiving an address at the ceremonial of laying the corner-stone of St. Matthew's Church in New York—an address which touched upon the relation of religion and the State. Speaking of the address, Madison says:

It is a pleasing and persuasive example of pious zeal, united with pure benevolence, and of cordial attachment to a particular creed, unthictured with sectarian illiberality. It illustrates the excellence of a system [our secular theory] which, by a due distinction, to which the genius and courage of Luther led the way, between what is due to Caesar and what is due to God, best promotes the discharge of both obligations.

The experience of the United States is a happy disproof of the error so long rooted in the unenlightened minds of well-meaning Christians, as well as in the corrupt hearts of persecuting usurpers, that without a legal incorporation of religious and civil polity, neither could be supported. A mutual independence is found most friendly to practical religion, to social harmony, and to political prosperity.

With this direct acknowledgment on the part of Madison that our secular Government is the direct outgrowth of that great religious movement—the Reformation—and his reference to the words of Christ, we may give full credence to the following words from Bancroft, rather than accept the prejudiced slurs of those who would, if they could, destroy the grand political system of the American people—a system which commands the admiration of the world. Bancroft says: "Vindicating the right of individuality even in religion, and in religion above all, the new Nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relations to God the principle first divinely ordained in Judea. It left the management of temporal things to the temporal power; but the American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several States, withheld from the Federal Government the power to invade the home of reason, the citadel of conscience, the sanctuary of the soul; and, not from indifference, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom and purity and power."—History of the Formation of the Constitution, book V, chapter 1.
