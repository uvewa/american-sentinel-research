## Religious Freedom.

[This article is from the News of Aug., entitled "Religion and the Sabbath Day," that each one hath his own will ever be celebrated, nor does a use the State day set for whatever use.] Nevertheless the first day of the week has now been set apart by more of the States than any other day. Nevertheless the day is only as religious if one finds it is not in itself.

The *News* of yesterday announces the decision of Judge E. S. Hammond, of the Federal Court, at Memphis, who reversed an interesting nature which was appealed from the Supreme Court of Tennessee. R. M. King is a Seventh-day Adventist, and was convicted of Sabbath-breaking by plowing on Sunday, which verdict was sustained in the higher State Court. The Federal judge refused any relief to the defendant, who was remanded to suffer fine and imprisonment. He having based his petition upon the constitutionality of Sabbath laws, and raised the broad question upon the fact that King was convicted under the statute of Tennessee law, and it is not in the province of the Federal Court to review the case, religiosity or otherwise, or disbar a prosecution, but it has never been violated that fact never disturbs the base business. "The Court adds that the offense may be harmless in itself," because the preliminary thing was to determine that the State may, for the public, not set apart that day for rest and holiday, and yet if man has not it apart in date for by law, he must be moral to man's law if not in God's law.

This prosecution has gained consideration. King's case having been accepted by the United States Supreme Court, we selected then M. Dickenson for the defense. Without doubt it will be taken to the highest tribunal, to test the manner of the necessary theory that is guaranteed by the national Constitution.

One more quarter of a century of political schools and other civilizing auxiliaries which are now actively at work will influence the last vestige of such laws as this under which King is being persecuted for living up to his religious convictions. For will the repeal of each worn out legislation be at all inconsistent with a proper recognition of the economic value of taking one day out of seven for rest, or of agreeing upon Sunday as that day out of deference to the wishes of the dominant population of the country. But it will be understood and generally accepted that only the social form of public opinion can be employed to influence such observance, except in particular measures necessary to insure domestic protection and to those who regard Sunday as a sacred day to be devoted to religious purposes. It is absurd to assume that King, taught by his religion to observe the seventh day instead of the first, any encroaching upon any one's rights in planting land on Sunday. The same is different were King one of a procession, with loads of music, which should choose the hour of Christian worship to parade the streets, or the disturbance of religious gatherings engaged in their devotion. Individuals in such an event would be justifiable, because it would be necessary to the freedom of worship which is guaranteed by American custom race.

The constitutions of the United States Supreme Court in King's case that of interest being, and if the record will admit of that issue on the merits, the decision will be salutary. We badly need a fresh and conclusive ruling which shall maintain the distinction of a nation to observe religious freedom, and the unconstitutional existence of legislation with a religious history, by which there is discrimination for or against any class of people in this free Nation. The Court can reach no other result. The principle involved in the King case is one which has been several times aggravated. There has been too much misconstruction, cooperating with both State and national governments in recent years, and it is well in order to define the distinction which exists between Church and State, in the interest of religious as well as of civil liberty.

Judge Cooley, in his "Constitutional Limitations," says in substance that American judicial opinion when he says it is conclusive that the framers of the Constitution will nothing more fully or plainly state than the desire that they should forever preserve and perpetuate religious liberty, and to guard and secure the rights of every individual towards freedom of or civil or political rights, based upon difference of religion.

Various texts have been suggested by which to judge of the highest type of civilization, one writer premitting that it is best measured by the quantity of its soap and sugar consumed, others by the percentage of illiteracy, the statistics of crime, and so. The truest test for liberty is the degree of respect which the people of a nation have for each other's religious convictions, and the measure of religious [page 268] liberty which is secured to them as an inalienable right.

In the glory of our Government that, rightly interpreted, all restraints upon religious liberty have been abolished. In that particular at least we have realized a central features of Isaac Taylor's "Ultimate Civilization," which undertakes to shadow forth what shall be the condition of society when all the social functions are brought to their highest altitude and perfection. That author, out of the most thorough masters of English literature one of the most learned, says of religious freedom:—

> The harbingers of men to inspect of right the sovereignty and professions and conduct of others is one never to be entrusted to men in the mass; on this ground even does not curse if he is not driven to take concern; for beyond the reach of religious liberty, in its amplified and when in the most amplified, or to take the grounds when impossible.
