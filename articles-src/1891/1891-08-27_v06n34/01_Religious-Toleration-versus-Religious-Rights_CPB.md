HON. RICHARD M. JOHNSON well said in 1829, in his report to the United States Senate on Sunday mails:

If the principle is once established that religion, or religious observances, shall be interwoven with our legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum. We shall, if consistent, provide for the erection of edifices for worship of the Creator, and for the support of Christian ministers, if we believe such measures will promote the interests of Christianity. It is the settled conviction of the committee, that the only method of avoiding these consequences, with their attendant train of evils, is to adhere strictly to the spirit of the Constitution, which regards the general Government in no other light than that of a civil institution, wholly destitute of religious authority. What other nations call religious toleration, we call religious rights. They are exercised not in virtue of governmental indulgence, but as rights, of which Government can not deprive any portion of citizens.

The idea is that free men spurn toleration; and very properly so, too, for that which is tolerated is exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence. That is what the word means. Webster says:

Tolerance. 1. The power or capacity of enduring; the act of enduring; endurance. 2. The endurance of the presence or actions of objectionable persons, or of the expression of offensive opinions; toleration.

Tolerate. To suffer to be, or to be done, without prohibition or hindrance; to allow or permit negatively, by not preventing; not to restrain; to put up with; as, to tolerate doubtful practices.

Toleration. 1. The act of tolerating; the allowance of that which is not wholly approved. 2. Specifically, the allowance of religious opinions and modes of worship in a State when contrary to, or differing from, those of the established church or belief.

That which government merely tolerates it might properly prohibit. Toleration is the granting of an unmerited favor, not the acknowledging of a natural right; hence, in the Virginia convention of 1776, Madison objected to the use of this word in the Declaration of Rights. It was proposed to provide that all men should "enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate." But, as noted in "American State Papers," page 99, Madison opposed the use of the word "toleration." He pointed out the distinction between the recognition of an absolute right and the toleration of its exercise; for toleration implies the power of jurisdiction. He proposed, therefore, instead of providing that all men should "enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion," to declare that "all men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience."

In 1827, Lord Stanhope voiced the same sentiment in the British House of Lords. He said: "The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as a right; but the time will come when it will be spurned as an insult." Philip Schaff and Judge Cooley have also both emphasized the same distinction. The former says: "In our country we ask no toleration for religion and its free exercise, but we claim it as an inalienable right." The latter declares that in this country we "have not established religious toleration merely, but religious equality."

Thus it is seen that the distinction between religious toleration and religious rights is not merely a figment of the mind, but a living reality seen and acknowledged not only by lexicographers, but by statesmen. And not only that there is a distinction, but that toleration is opposed to rights, for it is a denial of them. In the face of these facts, how puerile is the claim of the Christian Statesman that National Reformers are the real "guardians of freedom!" Folly could scarcely go further.

THE SENTINEL has repeatedly arraigned these self-styled reformers before an intelligent reading public, and has as often convicted them upon their own testimony as conspirators against religious liberty. But because of a denial which has recently been entered by the Christian Statesman, we revert to the subject again.

In the Statesman of August 13, of the present year of grace, we find the following "eloquent words," as the Statesman puts it "of the lately deceased Dr. Jonathan Edwards, spoken at the National Reform Convention in Cooper Institute, in New York, in 1873:"—

Our objectors, then, may learn that they are merely a body of men who are in their turn feeling the inconvenience of dissent. And they may be reminded that under our proposed amendment all the essentials of their citizenship will be none the less secure to them than they are now.

The atheist is a man who denies the being of a God and a future life. To him mind and matter are the same, and time is the be-all and the end-all of consciousness and of character.

The deist admits God, but denies that he has any such personal control over human affairs as we call providence, or that he ever manifests himself and his will in a revelation.

The Jew admits God, providence, and revelation, but rejects the entire scheme of gospel redemption by Jesus Christ as sheer imagination, or, worse, sheer imposture.

The Seventh-day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are conjoined with the other members of this class by the accident of differing with the mass of Christians upon the question of what precise day of the week shall be observed as holy.

These are all, for the occasion, and so far as our amendment is concerned, one class. They use the same arguments and the same tactics against us. They must be counted together, which we very much regret, but which we can not help. . . .

They must be named from him [the atheist]; they must be treated, for this question, as one party.

What are the rights of the atheist? I would tolerate him as I would tolerate a poor lunatic, for in my view his mind is scarcely sound. So long as he does not rave, so long as he is not dangerous, I would tolerate him. I would tolerate him as I would a conspirator. The atheist is a dangerous man. . . . Tolerate atheism, sir? There is nothing out of hell that I would not tolerate as soon. The atheist may live, as I said, but, God helping us, the taint of his destructive creed shall not defile any of the civil institutions of all this fair land! Let us repeat, atheism and Christianity are contradictory terms. They are incompatible systems. They can not dwell together on the same continent.

In the light of the plain distinction already noted between toleration and rights, the words of Dr. Edwards are utterly indefensible, except from the standpoint of the bigot; yet the Christian Statesman quotes them for the express purpose of defending them. It says:—

The bloody Nero dressed the Christians who were condemned to death in the skins of wild beasts, and gave them to dogs to be devoured. The Sentinel imputes to friends of National Reform sentiments and purposes as foreign to their real spirit and designs as those skins were to the hapless victims enshrouded by them, and then summons the watch-dogs of human freedom to make an end of them.

The Statesman has placed THE SENTINEL upon the right side. Such sentiments ought to be destroyed by the "watch-dogs of human freedom," and THE SENTINEL is proud to summon them to the work. Nor do we impute to National Reformers sentiments and purposes foreign to their real spirit. Of the truth of this the Statesman itself furnishes the evidence in the very article under review. In its defense of the sentiment uttered by Dr. Edwards, it says:—

He said expressly, "The atheist may live, as I said;" and again: "They [our objectors] may be reminded that under our proposed amendment all the essentials of their citizenship will be no less secure to them than they are now." Though there was "nothing out of hell" which he would not tolerate as soon, yet he expressly declared he would tolerate even the atheist. But he did not propose to surrender to the atheist the Government of the United States.

This is not a disavowel of the mischievous sentiment voiced by Dr. Edwards; it is simply a defense of it; a declaration that National Reform proposes to substitute toleration in this country for rights; they will tolerate the atheist, i. e., all who oppose them, including the Seventh-day Baptists, just as they would tolerate lunatics and conspirators. And this they tell us is the best possible safeguard of religious liberty! Believe it, ye who can! As for THE SENTINEL, it will ever insist that all men are entitled to full and perfect religious liberty, not as a favor to be granted them by government, but as an inalienable right with which they have been endowed by their Creator. The time has come when toleration is spurned as an insult. In this country only cravens would think of accepting it; only bigots would propose it.
