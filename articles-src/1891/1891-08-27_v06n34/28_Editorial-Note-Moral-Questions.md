"Moral questions," says the National Reform Declaration of Principles, "can not be determined by majorities; otherwise morals might be reversed at every election." This is true, and it is just the reason why civil government has no business to meddle with morals. It is also true that moral questions can not be decided by civil courts, otherwise there might be as many standard of morals as there were courts. We marvel that all can not see this. Government can and should require all men to practice civility, but morality is beyond the jurisdiction of earthly governments and earthly courts.
