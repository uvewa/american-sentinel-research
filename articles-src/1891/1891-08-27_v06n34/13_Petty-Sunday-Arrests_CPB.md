POLICEMAN WILLIAM WHATELY, of the Madison Street Station, entered Joseph Rifkin's dry-goods store on Sunday last and said:

"Let me have a pair of white cotton gloves."

"I don't sell anything on Sunday," replied the storekeeper, who knew Whately to be a policeman.

"That's all right," remarked Whately, "You need n't fear me."

The sale was made, and the storekeeper was arrested. He furnished bail in the police station.

The same policeman entered David Alterman's grocery at No. 113 Division Street, and asked for shaving soap.

"Come around to-morrow," said the groceryman.

"No," replied the policeman, "I want it to-day."

He was handed the soap, and the storekeeper was made a prisoner. He also furnished bail.

"I wish you would employ yourselves otherwise," remarked Justice Duffy in the Essex Market Police Court yesterday, as he held the two men for trial. "I don't like to see policemen make such petty arrests."—New York World, August 4.

Policeman Whately of the Madison Street Station, in citizen's clothes, went to Solomon Jacobs' dry goods store at 35 Division Street, Sunday morning. He found the door closed, but knocked until Mr. Jacobs opened it. "You can't buy anything here to-day," said Jacobs, "we are closed on Sunday." "But," the policeman told Jacobs, "I want to get ten cents' worth of ribbon for my little girl to tie her hair with so that she may go to church."

Jacobs consented as a favor to sell the ribbon. Whately then arrested him. At Essex Market Court, yesterday morning, Justice Ryan said the arrest was an outrage, and discharged Jacobs.—New York Sun, August 18.

That such a man as this Whately is on the police force is a disgrace to the city. It is true that Sunday laws encourage and invite just such methods, but these arrests are none the less infamous. A man so utterly devoid of principle as this Whately has shown himself to be, is a dangerous man in any community, but he is doubly so as an officer. The most dispicable of all beings is a man who aspires to be a detective, but has only sufficient brains to adopt the very worse methods of the most unprincipled scamps that have ever disgraced the profession.
