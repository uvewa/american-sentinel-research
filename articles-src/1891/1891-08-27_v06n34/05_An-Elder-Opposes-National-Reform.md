## An Elder Opposes National Reform.

The following letter speaks for itself. The writer is unknown to us personally:—

EDITOR SENTINEL: I have been taking THE SENTINEL for considerably more than a year, and like it better all the time. It is unfair ours for Christianity in its purity, as well as for freedom for the citizens of the commonwealth from all compulsory religion.

I am a ruling Elder in the Presbyterian Church, but would rather lose my right arm than to see any set or religious body get control of the affairs of the State. We would then have religion bigotry, which has always been the case when and wherever there has been a union of Church and State. There was a time when without giving the subject a little honest, unbiased reasoning, I really thought we could, as Paul said, *do* God service by legislating religion into human beings, making Sunday laws and attaching penalty for their transgression. But if we examine the "Law of love," we shall find that Christ taught us that, "Whatsoever ye would that men should [page 269] do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets." "His kingdom, Christ's, do so deliver into on that."

It does seem that the eyes of many are blinded to the plain truth at it is in God's revealed word. Said Jesus, "My kingdom is not of this world," and, "Ye are not of the world even as I am not of the world."

Jesus sent his apostles two and two to preach and teach, and told them to go armed with—no weapons of worldly warfare. He will come to take the world at the last day; but if the Scriptures are true He will not find it conquered by pseudo-religious people by force of arms those of whom he said, "Many will say in my name and I will answer, Lord, Lord, we have not prophesied in thy name and in thy name done many wonderful works?" Such are to go on to the very last days, the last generation, to the day of Armageddon. No, Christ's law is love, and the nations of the world have no the law of anything of this world.

"Keep the Church and State forever and entirely separate."
