[This article is from the Denver News, of August 4. The Sentinel is not so sanguine as is the News that such laws will ever be obliterated, nor do we agree that the State has any duty whatever in legislating in regard to Sunday from any standpoint any more than any other day. Nevertheless the article is excellent in the main, and is worthy of more than cursory reading.]

The News of yesterday announced the decision of Judge E. S. Hammond, of the United States District Court, in a case of an interesting nature which was appealed from the Supreme Court of Tennessee. R. M. King is a Seventh-day Adventist, and was convicted of Sabbath-breaking by plowing on Sunday, which verdict was sustained in the higher State Court. The Federal judge refused any relief to the defendant, who was remanded to suffer fine or imprisonment. The Court evaded decision upon the constitutionality of Sabbath laws, and reached its conclusion upon the fact that "King was convicted under the process of Tennessee law, and it is not in the province of the Federal Court to review the case, religiously or otherwise, or dictate a prosecution, but if the law has been violated this fact never shields the law-breaker." The Court adds that the offense may be harmless in itself, "because, as the petitioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness, and yet if man has set it apart in due form by his law, it must be obeyed as man's law if not as God's law.

This prosecution has gained considerable notoriety, King's case having been espoused by the Adventists of the United States, who secured Don M. Dickinson for the defense. Without doubt it will be taken to the highest tribunal, to test the measure of religious liberty that is guaranteed by the national Constitution.

One more quarter of a century of public schools and other civilizing agencies which are now actively at work will obliterate the last vestige of such laws as that under which King is being persecuted for living up to his religious convictions. Nor will the repeal of such worn out legislation be at all inconsistent with a proper recognition of the economic value of taking one day out of seven for rest, or of agreeing upon Sunday as that day out of deference to the wishes of the dominant population of the country. But it will be understood and generally accepted that only the moral force of public opinion can be employed to influence such observance, except in particulars necessary to insure freedom and protection to those who regard Sunday as a sacred day to be devoted to religious purposes. It is absurd to assume that King, taught by his religion to observe the seventh day instead of the first, was encroaching upon any one's rights in plowing land on Sunday. The case would be different were King one of a procession, with bands of music, which should choose the hour of Christian worship to parade the streets, to the disturbance of congregations engaged in their devotions. Interference in such an event would be justifiable, because it would be necessary to the freedom of worship which is guaranteed by American organic law.

The conclusions of the United States Supreme Court in King's case will be interesting, and if the record will admit of a decision upon the real issue, the result will be salutary. We badly need a fresh and conclusive ruling which shall maintain the absolute nature of American religious freedom, and the unconstitutionality of all legislation with a religious basis, by which there is discrimination for or against any class of people in this free Nation. The Court can reach no other conclusion without disregarding all precedent that applies to the question.

The principle involved in the King case is of an importance which can not be exaggerated. There has been too much denominational coquetting with both State and national governments in recent years, and it will be well to enforce the distinction which exists between Church and State, in the interest of religion as well as that of civil liberty.

Judge Cooley, in his "Constitutional Limitations," reflects the concensus of American judicial opinion when he says:

He who shall examine with care the American Constitutions will find nothing more fully or plainly expressed than the desire of their framers to preserve and perpetuate religious liberty, and to guard against the slightest approach towards inequality of civil or political rights, based upon difference of religious belief.

Various tests have been suggested by which to judge of the highest type of civilization, one writer premising that it should be measured by the quantity of soap and sugar consumed, others by the percentage of illiteracy, the statistics of crime, and so on. The truest test by far is the degree of respect which the people of a nation have for each other's religious convictions, and the measure of religious liberty which is secured to them as an inherent right.

It is the glory of our Government that, rightly interpreted, all restraints upon religious liberty have been abolished. In that particular at least we have realized a central feature of Isaac Taylor's "Ultimate Civilization," which undertakes to shadow forth what shall be the condition of society when all the social functions are brought to their highest altitude and perfection. That author, one of the most thorough masters of English style and one of the most learned, says of religious freedom:

The bandaging of men in respect of their religious convictions and professions and conduct is a restraint which is useless more than any other; for danger on this ground does not come if it be not created; and it is prejudicial more than any other; because religious liberty, in its amplitude and when it is enjoyed by many, does by itself render despotisms impossible.
