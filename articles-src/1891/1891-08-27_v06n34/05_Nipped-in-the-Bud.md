In the struggle for secularism—for the entire separation of Church and State—the founders of our Government had no easy time. They had to be continually on the watch lest the advocates of State-Churchism should push through some bill incorporating their religio-political ideas into the State polity. In noticing these attempts Madison wrote to Monroe as follows:—

It gives me much pleasure to observe by two printed reports sent me by Colonel Grayson, that in the latter, Congress had expunged a clause contained in the first for setting apart a district of land in each township for supporting the religion of the majority of the inhabitants. How a regulation so unjust in itself, so foreign to the authority of Congress, so hurtful to the sale of the public land, and smelling so strongly of an antiquated bigotry, could have received the countenance of a committee, is truly matter of astonishment.

It is exceedingly fortunate for the American people that this little scheme was thus nipped in the bud, for with a precedent like that, together with the sectarian leanings of some of our legislative bodies, much more money would be likely to find its way into denominational channels than does at present.
