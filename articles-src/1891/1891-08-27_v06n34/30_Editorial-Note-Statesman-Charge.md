THE *Christian Statesman* asserts that "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL rejoices in every token of decay of the observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath, even when the decline is due to the growth of irredigion and atheism." The charge has just as much but no more truth in it than has the charge made by papists that Protestants rejoice in the decay of Romanism in Mexico even though the decline is due to the growth of atheism rather than to the increase of Protestantism.

The following note, published in THE SENTINEL of August 13, is made by the *Statesman* the basis of the charge which it makes against us:—

It is said that reports from "Sabbath observance" societies in France and Italy show a change in the conduct of English travelers in regard to Sabbath observance. They are beginning to adopt the lax Continental customs, and to regard with indifference the character and claims of the day.

The wish was certainly father to the thought with our contemporary, for the item complained of was, with the exception of the first four words, copied verbatim from one of the great religious papers of this city. Would the *Statesman* have us suppress the truth in the interests of Sunday sacredness?
