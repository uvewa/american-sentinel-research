At Prohibition Park, August 16, Sam Jones gave his idea of the proper enforcement of Sunday laws thus:—

Ah, to see it like my State, Georgia. There every open saloon means a man in jail. Every engine that goes along means an engineer and fireman to be tried the next day. There, in that glorious State, the Sabbath is recognized as it should be throughout the world.

It would be difficult, however, for Mr. Jones or anybody else to show that Georgia is any better morally than are those States that have no Sunday laws, or that do not enforce those that they have. Such States as Georgia and Tennessee are living witnesses to the fact that people are no better for living under Sunday laws.
