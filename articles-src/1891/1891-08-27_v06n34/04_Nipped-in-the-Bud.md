## Nipped in the Bud.

In the struggle for secularism—for the entire separation of Church and State—the founders of our Government had a hard time. They had to be continually on the watch lest the advocates of State Christianity should push through some bill incorporating their religio-political ideas into the State policy. One of these attempts Madison wrote to Monroe as follows:—

> It gives me much pleasure to observe by two of your late favors, that the proceedings in the latter, Congress had stopped a cheese custom that had been in the habit of promoting or otherwise to enrich each other, as an established in each in contending for supporting the religion of one sect to the prejudice of the rest, and of against in itself, to foreign to the authority of the whole. They shall be more readily presented on the surface as strongly of an antiquated proposition which could have preferred the countenance of a modern body in every matter of administration.

It is exceedingly fortunate for the American people that this little scheme was thus nipped in the bud, for with a precedent like that, together with the insidious leaching of some of our legislation, much more money would likely to find its way to denominational channels than at present.
