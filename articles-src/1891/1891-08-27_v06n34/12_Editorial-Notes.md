## Editorial Notes.

THAT Religious Liberty Association has announced by a circular letter to all its members that the case of R. M. King will be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.

ACCORDING to the *Telegraph*, San Bernardino, California, like Los Angeles, was found by actual experiment that Sunday business was not more or less than the business. Whatever may be true of prohibition, Sunday-closing very certainly do not prohibit.

SAN FRANCISCO, August 14.—San Jose had forth at Prohibition Park, Staten Island. As usual his denunciation of the "American Sabbath" has been set out in "scathing terms," never seeming to understand necessarily in fact that he was a party to an arrangement having by means who advocated to bring the tax cents option, the regular admission fee, for the privilege; and that on Sunday, the day upon which was made, the "holy Sabbath." It is very evident that Senator's platform is not the end all of Sunday money-getting.

THE *Christian Statesman* says there is no intolerance and no persecution in National Reform, and adds, "Nay, tolerance is the highest, most efficacious safeguard against persecution. For, as THE SENTINEL believes, the law of God forbids all persecution for opinion sake, then can the acknowledgment of that law be by each State in the nation a permanent"

The question is not difficult. National Reform propose to administer the law of God, or, in other words, it propose to make men judges of the divine law. The effect must be to put the government in the place of God and this destroy individual responsibility to God; for if it were the duty of human government to administer the divine law, it would also be the duty of the citizen of human Government to obey implicitly that law as given to him by the government. It follows that under the National Reform regime, men would inquire not what says the law of God, but what says the interpreter about that law. In short, the real standard of action would be not the divine law, but a human and fallible interpretation of that [page 272] law, which would afford not the slightest guarantee against persecution. Moreover National Reform is not a new thing; the history of the Papacy, written in the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, tells us just what the inevitable result of human administration of the law of God must always be. All human government is force, and all force in matters of religion is persecution.

THE Christianity of to-day is no more the Christianity of the Bible, than was the Christianity of the third and fourth centuries. Yet out of these centuries came the worst system of iniquity which ever cursed the world. But this system represented for the governments, and was used for the conservation of what was considered vital to Christianity.

---

In this Government there are rights of the people, separate from and above both the rights of the States and of the United States. These are the rights above the rights of the States; there is also such a thing as the rights of the United States and there is yet further such a thing as rights of the people. In other words there are these rights: national rights, or civil personal rights; and each of these is important.

---

"Moral coercion," says the National Reform Declaration of Principles, "could be not determined by majorities," could have its morals rightfully be reversed at some election." This is true, and it is just the fact that proves civil government impotent to meddle with morals. It is also true that moral question can not be decided by civil courts, otherwise there would be as many standards of morals as there were courts. We marvel that all can not see this. Government can and should require all men to practice civility; but morality is beyond the jurisdiction of earthly governments and courts to settle.

At the recent meeting held at Charleston, under this, the State in the interest of American Sabbath Union, a resolution was adopted demanding the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. A gentleman who was present writes us that after the resolution was read, all present, men, women, and children, were invited to vote. But they were plainly given to understand that only affirmative votes were wanted. The speaker stated that any who should vote against the resolution would be pitted against the constitution and aims of the formation of the American Union. "One of the leading men got up," said the speaker, "and said to the Baptist minister, 'I pity you.'"

Having thus paved the way to a free (!) expression on the resolution in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, the vote was taken. It was of course almost unanimous, but not quite, for three persons present had the courage to vote in the negative, when President Mill, of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, said, "I pity you." The incident was worthy of the Sunday cause.

Possibly the expression of pity was produced of the time when those who are engineering the American Sunday Union—National Reform Christian Statesmen—shall have secured the crowded power to reduce to a really pliable condition all who shall dare to resist them.

*The Christian Statesman* asserts that the *American Sentinel* refuses to explain any taken of decay of the observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath, are men whose decline is due to the growth of irreligion and atheism." The charge has just as much fact as no foundation in it. It is true, but it rather than has the charge made by prelate that really republics in the decay of the Roman Catholic in Mansion in Mexico even though the decline it is due to a growth of atheism rather than to the interest of Protestantism.

The following note, published in the *Statesman* of August 19, is by itself a very Statesman the basis of the charge which it makes against us.

> It said that notes from "Sabbath observance" should come from "Sabbath observance," from Sunday or from Seventh-day Sabbath observers. They are beginning to argue that any decay is not decay though it is indifferent the sanctioned and choice of the day."

We challenge the Statesman to take any thought with our contemporary, for the interpretation coming of what, as the exception of the first four words, copied verbatim from our columns, is contained in the papers of this city. Would the Statesman have us to suppress the truth in the interests of Sunday observance?

A Prohibition Party, August 18, gave them his idea of the proper observance of Sunday laws as here.

As, so as in like say State, Georgia. Peoples, as above all now the world is not the "Rev. Rule," National Reforms Association, for the defence. Without doubt will be so to refer to the rest day. There is also a greater part of this not of which were made.

It would be difficult, however, for Mr. Jones or anybody else to show that Governments that have no Sunday laws, are as a rule in a better condition morally than those States that have no Sunday law, as he is not obvious that these days, those are States in Georgia and Territories who are living here. The fact that people are no better for having Sunday laws.
