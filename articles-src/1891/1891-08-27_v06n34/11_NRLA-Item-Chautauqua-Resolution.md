At a meeting held in the Amphitheatre at Chautauqua, New York, on the 9th inst., in the interests of the American Sabbath Union, the following resolution, offered by Bishop Vincent, was enthusiastically passed:—

Resolved, That in the interest of workingmen and in harmony with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures we, the representatives of churches here assembled, respectfully and earnestly request the proper authorities to close the gates of the Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath day.

The Bishop evidently agrees with Mr. Crafts that "take the religion out and you take the rest out," and so left the religion in when writing this resolution.
