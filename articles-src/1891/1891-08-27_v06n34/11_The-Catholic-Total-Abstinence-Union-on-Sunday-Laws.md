## The Catholic Total Abstinence Union on Sunday Laws.

THE meeting of the above association at Washington, D. C., August 5. In a preamble to the resolution passed upon this question, they state why they oppose the liquor traffic that it is "is the only community relationship of the existing evils restraining influence of Sunday." A resolution was offered pledging the support of the church labor organizations, believing that it could greatly assist the laboring men in resisting the evil night. But no influential priest considered that they ought to know the principles of those their fathers are also confederating with them. He said they kept all socialites, and also oppose Sunday observance, and are trying to get the laboring men in line and so as to oppose a union with any labor organization, for the purpose of securing a total abstinence. Abstinence Union on these public points.

In addition to this the members of the Sunday question at different times during the meeting, they were addressed as follows:

> Resolved that we consider it the duty of all good citizens to do all in their power to encourage the enforcement of Sunday laws closing liquor establishments.

The foregoing would indicate that Sunday reform is to receive full endorsement and also the cooperation of the Union. Let all good people bid them good day. If they wish to see the Sunday law their total abstinence. It is one of the most feasible measures. If they had no use for Sabbath. What people to observe Sunday better; it is surely their pledges to do so. But when they are against they perhaps the plan is for them to maintain them as the saloon is to be halved and so much of the Sunday program is received to close them; you yet to obey shall it up on Sunday is a big step back for the non-enforcement of our Sunday cause. It only on Sunday it cannot help making the impression that it is the interests of Sunday observation generated, and that the saloon is not so bad if it is closed upon it on other days.

But this is only another of the many illustrations that Sunday laws are becoming very popular, and that the tyrannical reign of ecclesiasticism, that always are the wheels of opposition in motion wherever it is advised the power, is arriving for recognition. This statement is on each tomor- [page 272] it was a Catholic society that passed such a resolution had been lost on the periodicals of the prelates. The facts show that Protestants and Catholics alike favor the rest of the same programme, though States at their consecrated and are devoid of the Christian religion.

And just as soon as the State controls itself the Sunday laws, it advances the step to that mark, teach, and opens the way for such more to follow. Paired all of the religions denominations or religious belief, even through all the world as a whole.
