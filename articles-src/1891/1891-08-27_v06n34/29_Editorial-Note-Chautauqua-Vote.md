At the recent meeting held at Chautauqua, this State, in the interests of the American Sabbath Union, a resolution was adopted demanding the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. A gentleman who was present writes us that after the resolution was read, all present, men, women, and children, were invited to vote. But they were plainly given to understand that only affirmative votes were wanted. One speaker stated that any who should vote against the resolution would be pitied like a Baptist minister who voted against the formation of the American Union. "One of the leading men got up," said the speaker, "and said to the Baptist minister, 'I pity you.'"

Having thus paved the way to a free (?) expression on the resolution in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, the vote was taken. It was of course almost unanimous, but not quite, for three persons present had the courage to vote in the negative; when President Mill, of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, said, "I pity you." The incident was worthy of the Sunday cause.

Possibly the expression of pity was prophetic of the time when those who are engineering the American Sunday Union-National Reform-Church and State scheme shall have secured the coveted power to reduce to a really pitiable condition all who shall dare to resist them.
