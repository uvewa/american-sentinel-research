## Religion—Its Relation to Civil Government.

Religion is as antagonist of so many of its institutions—"We wish, as the agents of a Christian Nation, a church whose members was not admitted to be read on as religious liberty as a basis, but on those advantages more accounted to its acceptance of society."

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The religious persecution which characterised the Middle Ages had shown to the founders of this Government that to the State belongs no power of religious legislation. Well could they see the effect of a union of Church and State, and well did they know that a hierarchical form of government would have been a great weakness upon them as had existed in the mother country under such form; therefore the above was adopted as the first amendment to our "Constitution of Liberty."

From the fourth century the aim of the Church had been to gain, not only absolute religion, but also civil every facility they did obtain and for many years held. Under that rule no religious tolerance [page 270] was known. Much consciousness was retained; freedom of thought was suppressed. But the flame at last did burst forth and religious liberty took the place of religious despotism.

From the wise thought of our forefathers this country has known no persecution on account of religion; and when, comparing the prosperity of this with other countries, no student of history can fail shadow the advantages of such laws as ours. But even while we boast can we look at Russia, Spain, France, Austria, Turkey, and others having the church represented in the government with the persecution attending the same to-day? Not one example with even that in our country of freedom there is already arisen a spirit of intolerance that would enforce religious principles on all, Christian and non-Christian.

Twenty-five, yea ten years ago, such a statement as the above would be considered largely visionary. Then. They were unreasonable, and now, some, transactions which the agentless of work, would seem impossible.

But notice the workings of Congress for the past few years, and the repeated and earnest appeals at religious enforcement that have been made. The last "star" was the introduction of the Blair Bill by Senator Blair, May 21, 1888, and was determined, then, a bill to assure to the people the enjoyment of the Lord's day, commonly known as Sunday, as a day of rest, and to promote its observance as a day of religious worship.

This bill was no less in meaning and its results, than to the suspension of every freedom from any secular work; to prohibit carrying the mail, carrying of passengers by railroad, running of all kinds of transportation, the paying or receiving of money, and all worldly or secular amusement. The bill applied to all whether they believed in Sunday observance or not, and made no right for any sect observing any other day of worship.

That is it not effort comprehend all the aims of its founders and leaders, the "National Reform Party." Not only do they wish to secure more particularly our Sabbaths, but they wish to compel every man, using their own words, "to seek to have the amended; the so-called establishment, and the whole people agree, and its acknowledging committee," of the law which says "Congress shall make no law establishing of religion."

Its aim then not remains is for the injustice of religious persecution.

*National Reform Declaration of Principles,* "could be not determined by majorities," could have its morals rightfully be reversed at some election." This is true, and it is just the fact that proves civil government impotent to meddle with morals. It is also true that moral question can not be decided by civil courts, otherwise there would be as many standards of morals as there were courts. We marvel that all can not see this. Government can and should require all men to practice civility; but morality is beyond the jurisdiction of earthly governments and courts to settle.

At the recent meeting held at Charleston, under this, the State in the interest of American Sabbath Union, a resolution was adopted demanding the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. A gentleman who was present writes us that after the resolution was read, all present, men, women, and children, were invited to vote. But they were plainly given to understand that only affirmative votes were wanted. The speaker stated that any who should vote against the resolution would be pitted against the constitution and aims of the formation of the American Union. "One of the leading men got up," said the speaker, "and said to the Baptist minister, 'I pity you.'"

Having thus paved the way to a free (!) expression on the resolution in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, the vote was taken. It was of course almost unani- [page 271] mous, but not quite, for three persons present had the courage to vote in the negative, when President Mill, of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, said, "I pity you." The incident was worthy of the Sunday cause.

Possibly the expression of pity was produced of the time when those who are engineering the American Sunday Union—National Reform Christian Statesmen—shall have secured the crowded power to reduce to a really pliable condition all who shall dare to resist them.
