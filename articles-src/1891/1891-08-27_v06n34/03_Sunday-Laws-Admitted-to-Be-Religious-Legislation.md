## Sunday Laws Admitted to Be Religious Legislation.

No man should compel themselves toward their fellow citizens with Government shall decide, but as regards our duty toward God in civil government, nor of rights have anything to do; that rest solely upon human estate God.

Civil government has nothing to do with religion as God, as religion; we owe him anything or not, or for service, we owe him anything, *is* not government.

George Washington said: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and is to be protected in worshipping God according to the dictates of his own conscience."

Our national Constitution provides that the civil Government shall have nothing to do with religion; or with what is due to God, but shall see that every man's conscience and his God. As long as he is a good citizen the civil Government shall protect him and law him perfectly free in the things of religion to do as he pleases, be he pleases, or not to worship at all.

In 1796, in the treaty made with Tripoli, it was declared: "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."

The very first amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted by the first Congress in 1791: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

Our own State Constitution, Article 1, Section 3, provides for "the free exercise of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, bold, and worship shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of religion."

The plea heretofore insisted on, and the [page 268] sophism with which some judges have sought to justify their persecution of right, justice, and the sacred provision of the Constitution, has been that enforced Sunday observance was not a religious but a civil law; Sunday advocates declaring that civil law did not them a law to enforce religious observance of the day, but a civil institution, a sanitary ordinance, their interest not being for the upholding of a religious observance, but loving desire to provide rest for the poor, dear wage-earner.

At last the chief organ of the God-in-the-Constitution and the Sabbath law party, representing the majority of the Protestant ministers and their churches, admits the truth, that it is not a civil enactment they are working for, but a law to enforce *religious* observance of the day.

The following article is from the editorial columns of the *Christian Statesman*, published at Philadelphia, Pa., *June 25, 1891:*—

> The *American* Secretary of the National Reform Association writes that the Sabbath laws—Washington need to sleep, and there is no more can be said on this subject, and this is what time all shall go to prayer? Such have as sure as an act of man compelling all persons to eat between the hours of 8 and 4. If the people of the United States have good sense enough to not rest on Sunday or any other day they may think good to in certain in working.

> The object of Sunday laws is wholly religious. The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, the leading Sunday-law advocate, declared: "Take religion out of the day and you take the last out of it."

Joseph Cook, lecturing on Sunday law at Bauttle—(Bartlett) before, says: "_Not only that you will be in vain endeavor to preserve Sunday without preserving Sabbath; and that without worship. Unless Sabbath observance be founded upon religious reasons you will not long maintain it._"

It is being admitted that Sunday is a religious institution, any legislation, national, State, county, or municipal, in regard to its observance must be unconstitutional.

Religious zeal enlists the strongest prejudices of the human mind, and what man maintained (under the delusive pretext of doing God service) section the most oppressive of our nature. This man undertakes to become God's avenger he becomes still worse. Driven by the frenzy of a religious zeal, he loses every gentle feeling, [page 269] forgets every claim of justice, mercy, and humanity, and becomes ferocious and unrelenting.

If there is a day which the Almighty desires to be preserved he can surely by his virtue (and remember that the prophecy both biblical and historical, is that Baal-worship, be seventh), and not Sunday, the first, is that day); it would it not be better of the world had its almighty power than one of the arm of the law?—Schoolcraft (Wash.) *Democrat.*
