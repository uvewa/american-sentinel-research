## Religious Toleration versus Religious Rights.

THIS at once carries us into the realm of conscience, upon the plane of the spiritual; and it can be secured only by spiritual forces, none of which have ever been committed to the State, but to the Church alone.

HON. RICHARD M. JOHNSON said in 1829, in his report to the United States Senate on Sunday mails:—

> If the principle is once established that religion, or religious observance, shall be interwoven with our legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum. We can, if consistent, provide for the revival of obsolete habits of worship at the Church; and for the support of Christian ministers, if we choose; such an outgrowth will promote the interests of Christ against Christ, of sect against sect, of the believers in the Bible against the believers in the Koran. We have the only method of avoiding these results; that is, to adhere strictly to the spirit of the Constitution, which has wisely provided that the Government of the United States shall not be a party to the decision of any religious controversies. What other Nations call religious toleration, *we* call religious rights. They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence, but of rights, of which Government cannot deprive any part of citizens, however small.

The idea is that free men *own* toleration, and need very much, owe, to the thing which is federal discretion is carried in virtue of governmental indulgences. That is all the word means. Webster says:—

> Toleration—the act of tolerating; the allowance of that which is not wholly approved; as, the act of *enduring;* a *sufferance;* a forbearance of that which can be done or is done, positive, or the expression of opinions obnoxious.

> *Tolerate.* To *suffer* to be, or to be done, without prohibition or hindrance; to *allow* or *permit* negatively, by not preventing; not to restrain; to *put up with;* to *bear;* to *tolerate* the doubtful doctrines of a man.

> *Toleration.* 1. The act of tolerating, the allowance of that which is not wholly approved; a *forbearance,* a sufferance or enduring.—2. The allowance of religious opinions and modes of worship in a State when contrary to, or different from, those of the established church or belief.

That which government merely *tolerates* it might properly prohibit. Toleration is the *granting* of an immortal right, not the *acknowledging* of a natural favor; hence in the Virginia convention [page 266] of 1776, Madison objected to the use of this word in the Declaration of Rights. It was proposed to protect that all men should "enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, *unpunished* and *unrestrained* by the magistrate." But, as noted in "American State Papers," page 70, Madison opposed the use of the word "toleration." He pointed out and insisted "the distinction between *the recognition* of absolute right and the *toleration* of its exercise; for *toleration implies the power of persecution.*" He proposed, therefore, to amend, instead of providing that all men should "enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion," to declare that "all men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise of *religion* according to the dictates of conscience."

In 1827, Lord Stanhope voiced the same sentiment in the British House of Lords. He said: "The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as a boon; it is now demanded as a right; but the time will come when it will be scorned as an insult." Philip Schaff and Judge Cooley have both well said in substance: "In our country we say no toleration of religion and no free exercise, we claim it as an inalienable right." The latter declares that in this country we "have not established religious toleration merely, but religious liberty."

It is true that the distinction between religious toleration and religious rights is not merely a figment of the mind, but a living reality seen and achieved not only by lexicographers, but by statesmen. And not only that there is the distinction, but that not only there is the difference.

This is not a discovery of the mischief to which it is subjected by Dr. Edwards, it is simply a defense of it, a declaration that National Reform proposes to substitute toleration in this country for rights; they will tolerate the atheist, i. e., all who oppose them, including the Seventh-day Baptists, just as they would tolerate Israelites and non-conformists. And this latter talk as in the last its post sauerkraut of all and for THE SENTINEL, it will ever insist that all men are entitled to full and perfect religious liberty, not as a favor to be granted them by government, but as an inalienable right with which they have been endowed by their Creator. The time has come when toleration is scorned as an insult. In this country only craven would it be to accept of anything less. What would it propose?

convicted them upon their own testimony as conspirators against religious liberty. But actually a relief which was recently first selected by the *Christian Statesman*, was proved to be only religious toleration.

In the *Statesman* of August 12, of the present year of grace, we find the following "eloquent words," as the *Statesman* puts it" of the lately deceased Dr. Jonathan Edwards, spoken at the National Reform Convention in Cooper Institute, in New York City, in 1873:—

One objection, they may learn that they are scarcely of more use in one direction than, for on the other hand, we do believe that the monstrels of their citizenship will be come the established faith and practice.

The atheist is a man who denies the being of a God and a future life. He has milled and made his the same, and time to be all and the end all of consciousness and of character.

The practical force of these beliefs has no power to control even over what makes and mars a free will in a revolution.

These hold fast, truth, providences, and revelation, besides the entire scheme of gospel redemption with all its deep, sweet, regenerating, inspiring, and saving power.

The Seventh day Baptists believe in God and Christianity, and are compliant with the other essentials of this class for up to conformance of ideas with the name of Christian upon the question of what promise day of the week shall be observed for the Sabbath.

These are, all, for the occasion, and no for the use and purpose. They would, if they could, only arrange arguments and the same tactics against us, which they would be ready to use against each other, regret, but with which we have not made. They need to convert these facts to their use and use as will be a revelation.

What are the rights of the atheist? I would sooner be told that I would give a passer from her, as my own her initial is scarcely sensed. No loss is here or now, so long as he is quiet and in his own business. Wherein he becomes obnoxious I would compromise. The atheist is a dangerous man. I would put much confidence in him, taking nothing out of bold that I would not tolerate as a part of this great human fabric to which we belong, in the task of his destructive creed shall not disturb any of the civil institutions of his adopted land.

Let us not be misremembered.—Although this was only for an instant, but rather assert forever, that the principle of the Christian religion received into the heart and carried into the life will make a man a good citizen always. But it is only because it derives its anarch from the divine source—because it is rooted in the very soul and sustained by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit. This, however, the State of itself can never secure.

This do we impute to National Reform sentiments and purposes foreign to their real spirit, the truth of this the Statement itself furnishes the evidence in the very article under notice. In the defense of the sentiment uttered by Dr. Edwards, it says:—

> In mist expatch, the atheist may say, as we can I said—and again—"They (not objectors, yet to the churches under notice and proper propulsions) as but of the rights of citizens they are surer to the men are more sincere than they can ever." Though writers have claimed this "we" to them, and then, say this to us as soon, yet so expressly declared to would still further on, we do believe it did not propose to subvert the atheist the government of the country.

This is not a discovery of the mischief to which it is subjected by Dr. Edwards, it is simply a defense of it, a declaration that National Reform proposes to substitute toleration in this country for rights; they will tolerate the atheist, i. e., all who oppose them, including the Seventh-day Baptists, just as they would tolerate Israelites and non-conformists. And this latter talk as in the last its post sauerkraut of all for THE SENTINEL, it will ever insist that all men are entitled to full and perfect religious liberty, not as a favor to be granted them by government, but as an inalienable right with which they have been endowed by their Creator. The time has come when toleration is scorned as an insult. In this country only craven would it be to accept of anything less. What would it propose?

ever did or ever will reveal himself in humanity for the purpose of such government, but that does not affect the ideal. It will would be something to dream over to-morrow.

The Bible asserts that God *will* thus restrain men and make them do *his* will, but only give them his precepts of liberty, that he will write that law in our hearts, *enable* us to keep it in the hearts of his subjects; so that they will keep it, not from fear of *punishment*, but because they *love* it and *want* to keep it. When this is accomplished, sin being restrained to its fullest extent, and the perfect ideal of liberty actually *realized.* Freethought may deny that all this will be, but it cannot deny the *ideal,* and cannot deny that if a perfect God sees fit to thus write a perfect law in the *hearts* of his subjects, it would be the very highest liberty of which intelligent beings are capable.

Now a perfect ideal is never perfectly useless in an imperfect world. Jesus Christ did not assert that the theocratic form of government should continue to be employed by Israel.

The fact is it was *never* realized at all, for from the very first of the ten commandments they rebelled against God. The Jewish nation was a harbinger, a prophecy; from which the shadow of slavery had become mere substance. They never had a real liberty. But whatever becomes of the ideals of true liberty, till right ideas of their beauty, and yet they were the people who had preserved, even though imperfectly, the earliest and the truest ideals of liberty. That on God would only reveal himself to his own in a manner to make them capable of liberty.

He begins not then to perfect the ideal, but even Freethought can not improve the ideal of true liberty. That, it must be said, was to bring all men to the knowledge of the one God, *a father,* thus uniting them into one family of brethren and of lovers, so making them capable of true liberty.

It was necessary to the culmination of the ideals of liberty that this law should have been more written on tables of stone, must be written in the heart, so that the selves of *their own free will* will want to do the things it requires.

God was revealed in infinite love, by the gospel of his promised Son, 6,000 years before; but this gospel could not then be—men being mixed with faith in some of them that heard.

As Rev. Freethought does to-day, so in the past, every Government claimed that by rejecting him, the law could not be written in them. There was nothing to restrain their brutal passions, and prevent complete anarchy, it was necessary that the motive of fear be brought in play by severe penalties. All those imperfections in the government of Israel, which Freethought points out, and which the writer [page 268] deplores as much as Freethought can, were either the necessities of the barbarism of the times, or the results of that barbarism. In either case they were the result of the revolt against the divine ideal of government, which can only be realized by faith, and not the result of its realization. As a true theocracy perfectly realized in the heart of each individual, as it will in the redeemed world, is the most perfect liberty; so a false man-made theocracy, enforcing its so-called, divine laws, upon the outward man, without power to change his heart into harmony with those laws, is the most perfect of despotism. It may be that Freethought, bound by the prejudice against God and the Bible, and redemption through Christ, can not think freely enough to appreciate the sublime tribune truth, but to the Christian intellect as well, it is clear, important, and precious.
