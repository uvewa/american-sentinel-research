FAIR HAVEN, a popular summer resort on Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, is enforcing Sunday observance. The law which has been put in force provides that—

"Whoever is present at a game, sport, play or public diversion, except a concert of sacred music, upon the evening of the Lord's day or upon the evening next preceding the Lord's day, unless such game, sport, play or public diversion is licensed by the persons or board authorized to grant licenses in such cases, shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding five dollars for each offense."

"Whoever on the Lord's day keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity or charity, or takes part in any sport, game or play, or except as allowed or prohibited in the preceding section, is present at any dancing or public diversion, show, game or entertainment, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding fifty dollars for each offense."

Even Mr. Crafts would scarcely have the hardihood to claim that this is a law for the enforcement of a merely civil day: it is plainly a civil ordinance requiring the observance of a religious institution; and in this respect it is not unlike all other Sunday laws; the underlying thought and motive in all of them is religious.
