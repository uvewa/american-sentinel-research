LIBORIER, Indiana, has a pastor that is an enthusiast for Sunday laws. He has been stirring things there; and one man has been arrested for keeping a confectionary stand open on the venerable day of the Sun. This zealous divine has not openly advocated the rack, thumb-screw or stake yet, but is very mild in his threatening; he only thinks it is necessary to drive any man from town who will oppose Sunday laws. If the Lord Jesus Christ had the same spirit as the Ligonier minister, he would drive the atheist, infidel, and all opposers of his laws out of the world, and not even give them a chance to see their wrongs and repent.

With a proper regard for facts it is hard to frame a sentence like the last one so as not to say that such ministers do not have the spirit of Christ. To make the effort is only to fail.
