STRANGE as it may at first glance seem that in our free country, under the blazing light of history and modern progress, there should be established a far-simile of the medieval Inquisition, it is, after all, only a logical necessity in the course of the development of that work which has for its aim the enforcement of religious dogmas and practices by law. Let no one, then, who has taken note of this work be surprised to learn that the modern inquisition, a faithful pattern of the ancient one, is now set up, with full facilities for the apprehension and punishment of modern incorrigible heretics!

The city of St. Paul has lately been the scene of profound agitation over the subject of Sunday rest, out of which has developed a "Rest-day League," the fifth article of the Constitution of which says:

"Committees shall be appointed as follows: The secretary shall appoint an investigating committee of four, known only to himself, the first of whom shall on the first week of each month, the second on the second, and so following, ascertain personally what violations—first, of the civil law, second, of the higher laws of God—are in progress, and report fully in writing to the secretary, who shall, in turn, inform the public authorities, so far as he can wisely do so, as to the violations of the State law, and the public as to these and all other wrongs related to the work of this orgagination."

This is exactly what the Inquisition did in the Dark Ages. Spies were put upon the track of all suspected persons, and as fast as they were discovered doing that which was in violation, "first, of the civil law; second, of the higher laws of God," they were reported to the public authorities, apprehended, and punished according to the approved methods of the times.

Upon the Rev. (?) W. F. Crafts, more perhaps than upon any other, rests the unenviable notoriety of following foremost in the footsteps of the long-departed Torquemada. His utterances upon the occasion are calculated to dispel any lingering doubt which might exist in the mind as to the animus of the whole proceeding. "You make the laws," said he to the assembled audience, "and we'll enforce them;" and further, speaking of the "investigating committee" of the new Rest-day League, "You furnish the light, and we'll furnish the lightning."

So then all that now remains is for the inquisitorial "lightning" to strike!
