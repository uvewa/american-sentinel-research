[The following letter speaks for itself. The writer has our hearty thanks for his words of cheer.]

**EDITOR SENTINEL:** I have been taking THE SENTINEL for considerably more than a year, and like it better all the time. It is outspoken for Christianity in its purity, as well as for freedom for the citizens of the commonwealth from all compulsory religion.

I am a ruling Elder in the Presbyterian Church, but would rather lose my right arm than to see any sect or religious party get control of the affairs of the State. We would then have religious bigotry—which has always been the case when and wherever there has been a union of Church and State. There was a time when without giving the subject a little honest, unbiased reasoning, I verily thought we could, as Paul said, do God service by legislating religion into human beings, making Sunday laws and attaching a penalty for their transgression. But if we examine the "Law of love," we shall find that Christ taught us that "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets." This being Christ's law, to do otherwise would be unchristian.

It does seem that the eyes of many are blinded to the plain truth as it is in God's revealed word. Said Jesus, "My kingdom is not of this world;" also, "Ye are not of the world even as I am not of the world."

Jesus sent his apostles two and two to preach and teach, and told them to take no staff with them—no weapons of worldly warfare. He will come to take the world at the last day; but if the Scriptures are true He will not find it conquered by a pseudo-religious people by force of arms—by those of whom he said, "Many shall come in my name and shall say, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name done many wonderful works?" Such are to go on quarreling and fighting until the great day of Armageddon. No, Christ's law is love, and has nothing in common with the laws of the kingdom of this world. "Keep the Church and State forever separate."
