SUNDAY, August 16, Sam Jones held forth at Prohibition Park, Staten Island. As usual he denounced "Sabbath-breakers" in scathing terms, never seeming to recognize any inconsistency in the fact that he was a party to an arrangement whereby those who listened to him paid ten cents apiece, the regular admission fee, for the privilege, and that on Sunday, the day that the noisy Georgian calls the "holy Sabbath." It is very evident that the Sunday-law advocates want a monopoly of Sunday money-getting.
