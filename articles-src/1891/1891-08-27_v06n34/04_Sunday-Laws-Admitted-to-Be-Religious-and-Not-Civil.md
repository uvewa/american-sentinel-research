How men should conduct themselves toward their fellow-men civil government must decide, but as regards our duty toward God no civil government can of right have anything to do; that rests solely between man and God.

Civil government has nothing to do with what we owe to God, or whether we owe him anything or not, or whether, if we do owe him anything, we pay it or not.

George Washington said: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and is to be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience."

Our national Constitution provides that the civil Government shall have nothing to do with religion or with what pertains to God, but shall leave that to every man's conscience and his God. As long as he is a good citizen the civil Government must protect him and leave him perfectly free to worship whom he pleases, when he pleases, as he pleases, or not to worship at all, if he pleases.

In 1796, in the treaty made with Tripoli, General Washington declared: "The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."

The very first amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted by the first Congress in 1798: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

Our own State Constitution, Article 1., Section 11., provides: "Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief, and worship shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of religion."

The plea heretofore insisted on, and the sophism with which some judges have sought to justify their perversion of right, justice, and the sacred provisions of the Constitution, has been that enforced Sunday observance was not a religious but a civil law; Sunday advocates declaring they did not desire a law to enforce religious observance of the day, but a civil law, a sanitary ordinance, their interest not being for the upholding of a religious observance, but loving desire to provide rest for the poor, dear wage-earners.

At last the chief organ of the God-in-the-Constitution and the Sabbath Union fanatics, representing the majority of the Protestant ministers and their churches, admit the truth, that it is not a civil enactment they are working for, but a law to compel religious observance of Sunday.

The following article is from the editorial columns of the Christian Statesman, published at Philadelphia, Pa., June 25, 1891:—

**THE AMERICAN SENTINEL** quotes with approbation the language of the Secretary of the Washington Secular Union in argument against our Sabbath laws: "Workingmen need to sleep at night. Shall we have a civil law decreeing under fine and imprisonment what time all shall go to sleep? Shall we have an act of the council compelling all persons to eat between the hours of 12 and 1? If the people of the United States do not know enough to rest on Sunday or any other day when they need rest, it is certain they much more require a law to send them to bed at night."

This reasoning is valid against those who would take our Sabbath laws exclusively on physiological or economic considerations. But the National Reform Association has not made this mistake. While appreciating the value of the argument from nature, it has always held that the only ultimate foundation for the law of Sabbath rest is found in the law of God, which has reserved one seventh of man's time from secular uses, has made the right to rest during that portion of the time one of the chiefest of human rights, and made the obligation of rest as binding on States and nations as on individuals.

The object of Sunday laws is wholly religious. The Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, the leading Sunday-law advocate, declared: "Take religion out of the day and you take the rest out."

Joseph Cook, lecturing on Sunday laws (Boston Monday lectures, May, 1887), said:—

The experience of centuries shows, however, that you will in vain endeavor to preserve Sunday as a day of rest unless you preserve it as a day of worship. Unless Sabbath observance be founded upon religious reasons you will not long maintain it.

It being admitted that Sunday is a religious institution, any legislation, national, State, county, or municipal, in regard to its observance must be unconstitutional.

Religious zeal enlists the strongest prejudices of the human mind, and when misdirected (under the delusive pretext of doing God service) excites the worst passions of our nature. When man undertakes to become God's avenger he becomes a demon. Driven by the frenzy of a religious zeal, he loses every gentle feeling, forgets every claim alike of justice, mercy, and humanity, and becomes ferocious and unrelenting.

If there is a day which the Almighty desires should be exclusively devoted to his worship (and remember the proof, both biblical and historical, is that Saturday, the seventh, and not Sunday, the first, is that day), would it not be better to rely on his almighty power than on the arm of the law?
