"Church and State both have the mission to further human happiness, each in its own way. But neither Church nor State has any right to prevent any man from enjoying the free exercise of his opinions."

"Denying governments, in which there is an established religion, may with some show of consistency forbid, but in this free country, where the Constitution provides against the establishment of any religion, they are absolutely out of place."

For the State to favor the Christian religion so that to profess it would promise practical advantages, would be to put an immense premium upon hypocrisy; and when there is already entirely too much of the profession of religion for only what can be gained in this world by it, politically, financially, and socially. Moreover, for the State to sustain the evil principles, and promote the practice, would bring upon the country just as foul a corruption of religion as it is possible for the world to conceive.
