[This article is an abridgment of an essay by William A. Westworth, a pupil of the Buffalo High School. The essay was given honorable mention, but was not admitted to be read on account of its "too radical character." The character of the paper remains unchanged. We have simply abbreviated it to accommodate it to our limited space.]

"CONGRESS shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The religious persecution which characterized the Middle Ages had shown to the founders of this Government that to the State belonged no power of religious legislation. Well could they see the effect of a union of Church and State, and well did they know that a hierarchical form of government would soon bring as great persecution upon them as had existed in the mother countries under such form; therefore the above was adopted as the first amendment to our "Constitution of Liberty."

From the fourth century the aim of the Church had been to gain, not only absolute religious, but also civil sway; this they did obtain and for many years held. Under that rule no religious tolerance was known. Man's conscience was subjugated; freedom of thought was suppressed. But the flame at last did burst and religious liberty took the place of religious persecution.

From the wise thought of our forefathers this country has known no rupture on account of religion; and when, comparing the prosperity of this with other countries, no student of history can disclaim the advantages of such laws as ours. But even while we boast our superiority over such countries, as Russia, Turkey, and others having the church represented in the government, we are not likely to notice that even in our own land of freedom there is already arising a spirit of intolerance that would enforce religious principles on all, Christian, Jew and infidel.

Twenty-five—yes, ten years ago, such a proposition would have been greeted as preposterous, and even now, some, unacquainted with the agencies at work, would ridicule the idea.

But notice the workings of Congress for the past few years, and the repeated attempts at religious enforcement stand out prominently. The last bill was introduced by Senator Blair, May 21, 1888, and was denominated thus, "A Bill to secure to the people the enjoyment of the first day of the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, as a day of rest; and to promote its observance as a day of worship." The bill was to compel all to refrain from any secular work; to prohibit carrying mail matter, transportation of goods, the paying or receiving of money, and all military or naval drills or parades. The bill applied to all whether they believed in a rest day or not. No provision was made for any sect observing any other day of the week.

Nor did this effort comprehend all the aims of its founders and leaders, the "National Reform Party." Not only do they wish to secure some particular day as a Sabbath, but they wish to compel every man, using their own words, "to acknowledge that God is sovereign, that Christ is ruler and that the Bible is the supreme law." The Christian Statesman (their mouthpiece), of October 2, 1884, says:

Give all men to understand that this is a Christian Nation, and that, believing that without Christianity we perish, we must maintain by all right means our Christian character. Inscribe this character upon our Constitution. Enforce upon all that come among us the laws of Christian morality.

But the National Reform Party is not alone in this movement. The Women's Christian Temperance Union—and I speak of them with due appreciation of their foundation principles, seen in their name, that is, the suppression of the liquor traffic—has joined hands with the National Reform Association and perhaps the truest idea of their position can be gained from the saying of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in convention in 1887:

The Women's Christian Temperance Union, local, State, national and world wide, has one vital organic thought, one all-absorbing purpose, one never dying enthusiasm, and that is that Christ shall be this world's king—yea, verily, this world's king in its realm of cause and effect. King of its courts, its camps, and its commerce, king of its colleges and cloisters—king of its customs and Constitutions. . . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of the law through the gateway of politics.

Thus would they make the God of righteousness, the Creator of the universe, an earthly ruler by the corrupt means of politics, and this in the face of such authority as is found in their own, would-be, civil supreme law, the Bible, which, quoting Christ's own words, in John 18:36, says, "My kingdom is not of this world." Whom then shall we believe?

But the seed sown has not been without its effect. How many know that in the State of Arkansas during the period from April 26, 1885 to May 16, 1887, there were twenty-one cases brought to court for Sunday labor, and every one condemned, after it was proved conclusively that they observed regularly another day of worship? Such is liberty under the Constitution of the United States! Even now there is under bonds in Tennessee, R. M. King, for working on Sunday, after observing Saturday. The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His fine of seventy-five dollars could easily have been paid but his denomination preferred to make it a test case of the constitutionality of the laws of Tennessee.

Representatives in eleven States and Territories of this boasted "free country" have promised to introduce Sunday rest bills. Stop for a moment and think of nations who have made religion compulsory; where are they? Did they succeed? You cannot drive people into the kingdom of God; they must go voluntarily. Again we are continually confronted by efforts to introduce religious instruction into our schools, and the ministers of the different denominations are trying to compromise upon something that will please all. Think of it! Compromise religion by leaving it to the decision of school boards. But while there remains the spirit of liberty, which prompted our forefathers, there never will be found a level to which all must come.

Although skepticism is not to be wished for or promoted, can this land be considered as free, and, at the same time prohibit from its shores all those who cannot accept Christianity or the promulgations of a so-called Christian Government?

I will in closing . . . say history can leave no better admonition than that spoken by the greatest law-giver of all, "Render ye therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
