## The Inquisition Revived.

RESEARCH is may as at this glance appear that in matters, under "modern" Union and our more model country or modern progress, there should be established a system of the modern Inquisition; it is, after all, only a logical movement as has been proven of the methods of the Inquisition. For a summary of that work has for his use the method of the following.

Let us see, then, who has taken note of this idea. It has been the way of the Inquisition in a practice from even the early formation of this, a faithful pattern of the ancient and holy office, and was conducted in the very identical methods of modern incorruptible investigation of crime.

The C. P. of L. had its first principles in a profound agitation over the subject of Sunday rest, the early church, in dealing with heresy to its first article the Constitution of which accordingly provides "That this C. P. of L. shall promote the observance of Sunday as a day of rest." All of this, knows only to himself, the first of the two articles, after the appointment of a committee on the second, and so following the appointment of a committee for different districts, which shall appoint agent fully to writing to the secretary, who shall preserve a minute of every such proceedings in the locality, and the public so as to give them account of all the acts and doings of the council.

This is exactly what the Inquisition did in the beginning. It was at first nothing more than a censored speech, and as fact as they were discovered. In other words, the Inquisition embraced three judicial powers: first, the spiritual; second, the civil law; second, of the higher laws of God. Note these historical facts, for they are the very methods of the time.

Taken in connection with all the above, and all that time and space does not here permit, can there any exist, the conceivable insanity of that portion of American citizens who have deported Torquemada. His utterances upon the subject of the compulsion of the observance of their day of the rest who voted to be at the same time also what it was for the whole? With the methods of the "manifest destiny," and its acknowledging committee," of the law which permits.

Its aim then not remains is for the injustice of religious persecution.

The following from the *Schoolcraft (Wash.) Democrat* speaks directly about enforcing a purely religious matter by civil law:—

> If these ladies have proved themselves so inconsistent from the earliest time, the very first Christian Temperance Union to convention in 1887. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, social, State, national and world wide, has one vital regular thought, on an all-absorbing purpose, our every dying enthusiasm. And that is that Christ shall be its in every where pro—as he really is, worlds undiscovered, as in camps, and its consummate, king of its institutions, king to law, its customs, its manifold administration. The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of the law and through its advocacy.

This would they make the God of righteousness, the Creator of the universe, an earthly ruler to the corrupt morass of politics; and this in the face of such authorities as is found in their own, that would be, civil supreme law, the Bible, which, quoting Christ's own words, is described, "My kingdom is not of this world." Whom then shall we believe?

But the word laws has not gone without its effect. How many know that in the State of Arkansas during the period from April 21, 1885 to May 14, 1887, there were twenty-one persons prosecuted for the offense of violating the Sunday rest law for Sunday labor, and every one convicted, after it was proved conclusively that they observed regularly another day of the week? Such is liberty under the Constitution of the United States! Even now there is under bonds in Tennessee, R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, who was convicted of the offense of observing Saturday. The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. His fine of seventy-five dollars could easily have been paid in cash, but he was arrested in a case of unjust and unfair penalty for a free American.

Representatives in eleven States and Territories of this boasted "free country" have been known to introduce Sunday bills. Stop for a moment and think of the motive which has stirred the observers of Sunday who have initiated such. Had they ever known, where are they? Did they consider? You cannot drive people into the kingdom of God; they must come voluntarily. Again we are continually confronted by efforts to introduce religious instruction into our schools, and the ministers of the different denominations are trying to superimpose upon something that no one can think of.—*Temperance Bulletin,* by having it to the decision of school boards. But while there remain the spirit of liberty, which prompted our forefathers, there never will be found a representative who shall succeed in establishing them in it——
