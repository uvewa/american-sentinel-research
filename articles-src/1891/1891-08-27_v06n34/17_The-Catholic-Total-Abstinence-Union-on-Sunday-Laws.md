THE Catholic Total Abstinence Union met in Washington, D. C., August 5. In a preamble to one of their resolutions they gave as one of the reasons why they oppose the liquor traffic that it is "by its sales constantly weakening the hallowed, restraining influence of Sunday." A resolution was offered pledging the support of the Union to labor organizations, believing that it could greatly assist the laboring man in securing his rights. But an influential priest counselled that they ought to know the principles of these labor unions before confederating with them. He said they might be socialistic, and also oppose Sunday observance. In view of these things the resolution was modified so as to oppose a union with any labor leagues that were not in harmony with the Catholic Total Abstinence Union on these points.

In addition to this discussion of the Sunday question at different times during the meeting, they passed the following resolution:—

"Resolved, that we consider it the duty of all temperance men to support candidates for public office who honestly pledge themselves to labor for the enforcement of Sunday laws closing liquor saloons on that day."

The foregoing would indicate that Sunday received its full share of attention during the meeting of the Union. Let all good people bid them God speed in anything they can do to advance total abstinence. It is one of the most laudable of causes. If they wish to use their influence to persuade people to observe Sunday better, it is surely their privilege to do so. But when they ask for civil law in its favor it is time to object. As much as the saloon is to be hated and as much as all lovers of mankind should labor to suppress it, yet to only shut it up on Sunday is a big step back instead of in advance. When the saloon is closed only on Sunday it cannot help making the impression that it is the interests of Sunday being guarded, and that the saloon is not so bad if it is only strictly boycotted on Sunday.

But this is only another of the many indications that Sunday laws are becoming very popular, and that the tyrannical reign of ecclesiasticism, that always sets the wheels of oppression in motion wherever it is allowed the power, is striving for recognition. This statement is not made because it was a Catholic society that passed such a resolution, but because of the principle involved. The facts show that Protestants and Catholics alike will persecute when they have the power of the State at their command and are devoid of the power and enlightening influence of the Spirit of God. And just as soon as the State commits itself to Sunday laws, it advances ecclesiastical rule just that much, and opens the way for much more to follow. Protest all in their rights, but compel no religious belief, even though all the world was a unit in believing it to be right.
