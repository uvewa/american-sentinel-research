## Petty Sunday Arrests.

POLICEMAN WILLIAM WHATLEY, of the Maiden Street Station, noticed Joseph Blikin's dry goods store was open, on a recent Sunday.

"Let me have a pair of white cotton gloves," the officer demanded of the proprietor's clerk. Abromson, who acted "a Whatley" to the customer, who said he "wished a pair of gloves." "All right," remarked Whatley, "You're under arrest."

The sale was made, and the storekeeper was at once taken to the station.

The same policeman entered David Abromson's grocery, on 101 Division street, and asked for shaving soap.

"Come around to morrow," said the grocer-man.

"No," replied the policeman, "I want it to-day."

On the handed to the man, the storekeeper was arrested.

When arrested the man furnished bail.

"I wish you would make prosecution," complained a police captain. He also furnished bail.

Both stores—for Sundry Indictment was their penalty—were on the lower East Side, where the stores were, mounted Judge Daly in the Extra Mains, Part I of the Criminal Court yesterday, so he told the two men that they should pay a fine of $2 each for "such petty arrests."—*New York World*, August 1.

On the 9th of August, a man named Jacobi, in citizen's clothes, went to Solomon Jacobs' tobacco store on Sunday. He bought a cigar. He found the door closed, but knocked until he gained admittance. "Are you open today," said Jacobi; "we are closed on Sunday, but I open to let you in." "I want to get my wife some worth of ribbon for my little girl; do for her but wait on me while she runs out to the house." He sent for the police. Whatley arrested him. At Essex Market Court the complaint of the officer was that the store was an outrage, and discharged Jacob's clerk. Jacob was outraged also.

That such a man as this Whatley is on the police [page 271] force is a disgrace to the city. It is true that first day have encourage and invite just such methods; but these arrests are mere the base informers, who are seldom of interest to first day observers, who once showed himself to be a dangerous man. The most despicable of all things is a man whose pretends of authority to be brings a man. Surely the government of the great city of New York hesitate to adopt the very worse methods of the Old World Inquisition—entrapment of citizens.
