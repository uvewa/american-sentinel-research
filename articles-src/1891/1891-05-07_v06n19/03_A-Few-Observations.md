## A Few Observations.

[page 148]

The following paragraph under caption "The Sabbath Question," appears in the *Christian Statesman,* of April 23, 1891:—

> A petition has just been received from the Seventh-day Adventists of Melbourne, Australia, signed by H. Muckel, G. Stofred, Samuel Ramsey, to the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition, and praying that the gates of the Exposition be opened every Lord's day during its progress. The petition bears fourteen hundred and eighteen signatures. Mr. Mangles writes that not one-fourth of the signatures of the seventy-one bars had been called upon. He says, that all classes give their Sabbath most willingly except infidels and the Seventh-day Adventists. These last, though Christians, are misguided. But their peculiar views of the Sabbath have no effect, and should have no effect, because it is entirely a civil in civil government, from co-operating with Christians in their efforts for the Lord's day.

This is about as fair a statement of the case as respects the petition of the Seventh-day Adventists, as we have ever seen in the *Statesman.* It admits that they are Christians; but besides of their particular views of the Sabbath (which peculiarity, by the way, consists simply in taking the Sabbath commandment as it reads) they do not lend their influence toward Sunday-keeping; and that on account of their opposition to the introduction of religious questions into civil government, they are not willing to unite in an effort to secure the recognition and enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath, or any other Sabbath or religious institution, by law.

The observations we would make on this are these: (1) If opposition to moral and religious questions in civil government leads to a refusal to help along a movement for the recognition and enforcement of Sunday by law, can the favoring of Sunday laws be but an effort to introduce into civil [page 148] and religious questions into civil government? In other words, what are Sunday laws but religious laws? and what the enforcement of them but the enforcement of religion? And what is the enforcement of religion but a union of Church and State? (2) If the observance of the Sabbath commandment, as it reads, leads one to oppose a union of Church and State, so to the effect of such observance good? (3) And if the Christianity of a certain class does not lead them to take God at his word, and this leads them to oppose a union of Church and State, is not that a good sort of Christianity to have?
