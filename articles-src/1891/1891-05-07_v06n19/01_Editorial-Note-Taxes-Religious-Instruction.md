TAXES come from all the people; taxes should be used for all the people and can be properly used no other way. The use of taxes, therefore, to impart religious instruction, that is, their use to turn the sentiments of one part of the people against the sentiments of another part, is unlawful and unjust.—*Independent Patriot.*
