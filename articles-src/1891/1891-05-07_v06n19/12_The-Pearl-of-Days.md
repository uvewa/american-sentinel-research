## "The Pearl of Days."

[page 152]

"The Pearl of Days" argues thus in favor of Sunday laws:—

There are now not a few things to alarm us all against the dead march of moral and spiritual progress, we hear that. Gaming crimes are too frequent. Too many of our sons and daughters are drifted are trained into habits of industry and honesty. We have Sunday concerts, theaters, and many kinds of demoralizing amusements. We have licensed Sunday excursions by railroads and steamboat, lawful beer gardens and gaming in a thousand forms. We have regular Sunday railroad trains and Sunday newspapers, and consequently Sunday to some is no standing order. Our post offices are open on Sunday, which alone duplicates many thousand men and women of a needed day of rest.

It is evidently the thought of the editor of the "Pearl" that it is the duty of the State to remove all those adverse influences; to see to it that our sons and daughters are all properly trained, and [page 152] that every evil influence is banished. But something of this kind has been upon trial in Germany for about one hundred years, and the result is that no country in the world runs so large a per cent. of infidels. Faith is a plant of sturdy growth that will not bear petting, and the atmosphere of the hot-house kills it.
