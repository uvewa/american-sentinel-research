IN concluding a recent account of sermons Rev. W. C. Copeland, of Tacoma, Washington says:—

I have preached three sermons and given three Bible readings on the subject of the relation between religious freedom and civil freedom as taught in the revelations of Bible truth and history. With the Republic enters another hundred years is entered submissiveness. No. This is that devout and earnest Christians can take from their position the Liberty, protected as we are on a price, is in danger, and but few are alarmed. Most persons launch a long hunger, utterly forgetful of the lessons of history written in letters of blood.

As to the position of the Roman Catholic Church on this question of religious liberty no possible doubt can exist. The church stands where it has always stood, the unrestrained master of education and liberty. It only lacks the power to compel and to punish as it did in the past. All the evidence of this can be seen in the universal opposition against the Public schools throughout the United States, in the establishment of parochial schools in every Roman Catholic parish, and their allegiance to a foreign potentate whose commands are law. You all know that of Romanism [page 150] But only few know that there is a rapidly growing sentiment among so-called Protestant Christians which prompts preachers and laymen give votes to aid which intends with ever increasing emphasis an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that shall recognize God, Jesus Christ, the Bible, and the Sabbath; that shall declare this Nation to be by law a Christian Nation. On the demands of this party a bill was introduced into Congress which proposes to establish by law the Christian religion. . . . They in and Christian churches declare that to attain their ends even a resort to force will be justifiable. These people do not hesitate to have the first day of the week watched for legislation in its favor and the first has in fanaticism to be prescribed by them; that God must be recognized as supreme ruler, and the Bible is the supreme law of the land; that they say willing to go so blessed and extremely we show their mile.

Once this party and the Roman Church join hands as both have shown a willingness to do on common ground shown with religious gives civil liberty. Nor are shown.

And is the indifference to which Mr. Copeland refers, less the chief danger of the situation? Is it not the true danger. Who except "the danger it would cease to be danger."

JAMES P. MILLS, general and field Secretary of the sixth district of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in the leading cities on Illinois in behalf of the better observance of Sunday. He spoke in Bloomington April 19, and on the Monday following organized a local union for the community. He afterwards had attended his lectures state that it is their still to with in a working or for and Monday, to secure as better observance of Sunday, or to fight the Seventh-day Adventists. Every place he goes the same particular rules to tell how hard the Seventh-day Adventist people are working against Sunday laws. This people have evidently done much to open the eyes of the people in these sections and to show them what it means to enforce any religious doctrine by civil law. Let all lovers of civic and religious freedom, study the question carefully in the light of the revelations of the past, and the majority will see that it is their duty to oppose such legislation, no matter how lightly they may regard Sunday.
