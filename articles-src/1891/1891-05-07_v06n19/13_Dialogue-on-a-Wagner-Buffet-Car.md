## Dialogue on a Wagner Buffet Car.

[page 152]

PASSENGER.—Say, Porter, I got a long way to go this car yet.

Porter.—No, sah. It's against de law to sarve victuals on Sunday.

PASSENGER.—Well, can you get me something to drink?

Porter.—No, sah, I can't give you anything. I got a drink to get on dis car my own self.

I got anything to drink on this car.

Porter.—Yes, sah, anything you like. It's against de law, but what has to do it to 'commodate passengers, yo' know.—*Puck.*
