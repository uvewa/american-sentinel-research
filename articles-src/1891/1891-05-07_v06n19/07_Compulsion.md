An infidel once said, "It is hard for a Christian to be tolerant;" and why should he have said it but for the fact that so many so-called Christians have been, and are now intolerant? And so learned and eminent a man and historian as Macaulay, has said, "the doctrine of all sects, when condensed into a few words, is simply this, 'I am in the right and you in the wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me, for it is your duty to tolerate the truth; but when I am the stronger, I shall persecute you, for it is my duty to persecute error.'" Macaulay judged as the infidel did; he judged all Christians by the tendencies and acts of the most numerous, wealthy, learned and influential bodies of so-called Christian men, and hence his conclusion; and it will be the conclusion of all thinking men. But the truth is that no real Christian can be intolerant, because it is a fundamental principle of Christianity "that all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them," (Matt. vii.) and "as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Luke vi. And Christ said, also, "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves." Matt. x.

What Primitive Baptist would persecute any man for his religion, however erroneous he might know it to be? There is not one that would. There is not a Primitive Baptist church anywhere that would hold a member in fellowship who would join in burning or destroying the property or otherwise injuring a Roman Catholic on account of his religion. Not one would; though knowing, at the same time, that the Catholics have in the past, hanged, drawn, and quartered many of our brethren. Stephen called down the blessing of God upon those who stoned him to death, and Christ prayed for those who crucified him. Surely the religion of Christ is not of this world.

No body of Christians can, in Christ's spirit, seek by law or force to harm any class of men, whether believers or unbelievers either in person or property. But all denominations of Christians in this country, so far as I know, except the Primitive Baptist, seek to mix, to some extent, Church and State. They all favor chaplains in the Federal and State Legislatures, men who are paid to pray by the civil Government—paid by taxing Jews and unbelievers as well as believers. It is superfluous to ask if that is according to Christian principle, for it is too plain that it is not. They also favor the exemption of all church property from taxation, which is just, as far as religious people are concerned, but it is not just to citizens professing no religion. Christ did not design that his religion should be a burden to any man, nor can Christians in his spirit make it so.

The Ohio Supreme Court held (*American Law Register*), "that there is no such thing as 'religion of State.'" "When Christianity," continues the Court, "asks the aid of Government beyond a mere impartial protection, it disowns itself. Its laws are divine, not human; its essential interests lie beyond the reach and range of human governments. United with government, religion never rises beyond the merest superstition; united with religion, government never rises above the merest despotism; and all history shows that the more widely and completely government and religion are separated, the better it is for both. If it be true that our law enjoins the teaching of the Christian religion in the public schools, surely all the teachers should be Christians. Were I such a teacher, while I should instruct the pupils that the Christian religion was true, and all other religions false, I should tell them that the law (the law requiring religion to be taught in the schools) itself was an unchristian law. One of my first lessons would be to show the pupils that it was unchristian, and that lesson would be, "whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." I could not look the veriest infidel or heathen in the face and say that such a law was just; I should have to tell them it was an outgrowth of false Christianity, and not one of the 'lights' which believers are to shed upon an unbelieving world."

How then can Christians ask, according to Christ's teachings, for their church property to be exempt from taxation? or, in other words, how can they ask that non-professing tax-payers be taxed to support their religion? That certainly is not Christian . . . Now consider the value of all the church property of all the denominations in the United States, of the Episcopalians, Methodists, Catholics, Baptists, Presbyterians, and running up in value to hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars, exempt from taxation, and the deficiency, aggregating millions of dollars, that is forced out of the non-professing tax-payers to support the so-called religion of Christ, and that in a Government boasting of religious liberty, and a complete separation of Church and State!

I confess that it may seem that these things are too trifling and unimportant to notice; but when we consider their tendency, they become matters of grave import to lovers of real Christianity and religious liberty, as well as lovers of free government, whether religious or irreligious. It was the beast that had two horns like a lamb that spake as a dragon. Rev. xiii.
