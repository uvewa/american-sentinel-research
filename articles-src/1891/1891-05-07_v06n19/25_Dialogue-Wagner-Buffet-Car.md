PASSENGER.—Say, Porter, can I get anything to eat on this car?

Porter.—No, sah. It's Sunday, an' its 'gainst de law to sarve victuals on Sunday.

Another Passenger.—Say, Porter, can I get anything to drink on this car?

Porter.—Yas sah, anything you likes; its 'gainst de law, but we has to do it to 'commodate passengers.
