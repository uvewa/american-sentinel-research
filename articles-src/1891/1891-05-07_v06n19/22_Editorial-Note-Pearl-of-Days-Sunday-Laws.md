THE "Pearl of Days" argues thus in favor of Sunday laws:—

> There are now not a few things to alarm the friends of good order, of moral and spiritual prosperity, in our land. Glaring crimes are too frequent. Too many of our sons and daughters are not trained into habits of industry and honesty. We have Sunday concerts, theaters, and many kinds of demoralizing amusement. We have frequent Sunday excursions by railroad and steamboat, baseball, beer gardens and gaming in a thousand forms. We have regular Sunday railroad trains and Sunday newspapers, and consequently Sunday labor to an amazing extent. Our post-offices are open on Sunday, which alone deprives many thousand men and women of a needed day of rest.

It is evidently the thought of the editor of the "Pearl" that it is the duty of the State to remove all these adverse influences; to see to it that our sons and daughters are all properly trained, and that every evil influence is banished. But something of this kind has been upon trial in Germany for about one hundred years, and the result is that no country in the world can show as large a per cent. of infidels. Faith is a plant of sturdy growth that will not bear potting, and the atmosphere of the hot-house kills it.
