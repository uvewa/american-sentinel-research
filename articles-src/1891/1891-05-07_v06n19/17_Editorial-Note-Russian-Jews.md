THE *Mail and Express* says:—

> We hope and believe that the end is near, and that the civilized nations of the earth will demand at the hands of the Russian Government that freedom of action, occupation, and residence for the Jews which is enjoyed by all the citizens of free countries.

At the same time the *Mail and Express* is in the van of those influences which are at work in this country to impose similar disabilities upon those in this country who do not conform to the religion of the majority.
