THE important lesson of this hour is, that as the common school instruction, in the ideal American State, must be entirely secular, the Church must supplement and reinforce the public school instruction by more vigorous religious teaching at home, and through the varied agencies of the Church. The spiritual energies of the Church must be summoned here, as elsewhere, to supply the deficiencies of the State or rather do what the State can not do in the very nature of the case. In the inevitable separation of the Church and State (a separation so complete, that religion is ruled out of our popular education) the Sunday-school rises into an importance of which the founders of that institution had no conception. It becomes the great agent for leavening the minds of the youth of the land, with those religious truths, which are essential to moral conduct as well as to spiritual vigor, the hope and bulwark of modern society. Heavy as is the burden thus laid on the broad shoulders of the Church she is able to bear it, and to gloriously accomplish the work that of right belongs to her.—Rev. T. D. Peake.
