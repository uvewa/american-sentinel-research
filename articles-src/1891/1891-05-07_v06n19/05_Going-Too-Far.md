## Going Too Far.

[page 149]

RECENTLY the editor of *Twentieth Century* of Providence attempted to make the statement of the effect that "the Government of Mexico to-day is the most enlightened Government on the face of the earth," Mr. Hugh O. Pentecost says:—

> However greatly we admire the reform of Mexico, that it has gone too far. . . . A recent law has been made that "a vast amount of church property has already been confiscated," that priests and even Jesuits are banned, that no church has "the legal right to hold any real property," that no churches are not allowed to wear the official garments of their order outside of the churches. They can not perform a legal marriage. I confess from this fact that I have always drawn a distinction between . . . a church people out of the country, or make of any persons who are herein beyond no check upon the church in its power to exercise its rights. . . . The returned might be considered still worse. In all this . . .

I regard the Church as an magnificent evil, and, as an institution, have a cardinal dislike to it, but as I am an American, I believe with Jefferson and Paine in equal religious liberty. And there should be first of all by Liberals. While it is evil, its worship may be no better than fetich worship; but it still to the church in the Church is it stands before it, and should be protected by the law of religious property should be real, not as the holding of such property is a menace or hindrance. If the priests like to wear their almond vestments and shawls and select these a priest or nun, or to marry them, whose affair is it but each individual's?

All of this, with the exception of Mr. Pentecost's expression of his contempt of the Church, we regard as good sense. There is as wide a difference between toleration and the smiles upon an opposition to religion. All should remember that it is no more the province of government to oppose religion than it is to foster it.
