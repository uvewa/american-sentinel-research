In concluding a recent series of sermons Rev. W. E. Copeland, of Tacoma, Washington, said:—

> I have preached these sermons and given these lectures to arouse men to see the danger which threatens religious freedom and civil freedom as well. The question has been recently discussed, Will the Republic endure another hundred years? I answer unhesitatingly, No. That is, if certain devout and earnest Christians can have their way. Our liberty, purchased at so dear a price, is in danger, and but few are alarmed. Most persons laugh at any danger, utterly forgetful of the lessons of history written in letters of blood.
>
> As to the position of the Roman Catholic Church on this question of religious liberty no possible doubt can exist. The church stands where it has always stood, the uncompromising enemy of education and liberty. It only lacks the power to compel conformity; the desire is as great as ever. Evidence of this can be seen in the universal opposition of Roman Catholics to the public schools of the United States, in the establishment of parochial schools in every Roman Catholic parish, and in their allegiance to a foreign potentate whose commands are law. You all know this of Romanism.
>
> But only few know that there is a rapidly growing sentiment among so-called Protestant Christians which prominent preachers and laymen give voice to, and which demands with ever increasing emphasis an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that shall recognize God, Jesus, the Bible, and the Sabbath; that shall declare this Nation to be by law a Christian Nation. In the interests of this party a bill was introduced into Congress which proposed a compulsory Christian education, and prominent members of this party declare that to attain their ends even a resort to arms would be justifiable. So anxious are these fanatics to have the first day of the week marked as God's day, which every one shall observe in a fashion to be prescribed by them; that Jesus should be recognized as supreme ruler, and the Bible as the supreme law of the land; that they are willing to go to almost any extremity to secure their ends.
>
> Once this party and the Roman Church join hands and religious liberty is gone, and as history has always shown with religious goes civil liberty. Nor is the prospect of such union as remote as many suppose.

And in the indifference to which Mr. Copeland refers, lies the chief danger of the situation. Were the American people awake to the danger it would cease to exist.
