From lawyers and magistrates in North Carolina who have received two numbers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL:—

> I like to read your paper very well. I like your cause, as I do not believe in a law religion. I want it as our forefathers handed it down to us, to worship God according to the dictates of our consciences. Whenever anything else comes it will cause blood to run. Let the Church and God make Christians. When we undertake to run over our Constitution and trample on it, we are a ruined Nation.

> Your paper received and appreciated very highly. We fully indorse your cause in regard to religious rights. I am an old-school Baptist and a Democrat. My grandsires fought through the Revolutionary War for religious rights and liberty. I want to march under the same banner.

> Yes, I'll gladly receive and read your paper. I am in hearty and prayerful sympathy with every work that looks to the preservation of our civil and religious rights in the United States of America. God bless your paper.

> I have examined your paper called THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and have a good opinion of its merits. I desire to make further examination of the paper.

From individuals who have had THE SENTINEL two or three months:—

> I thank you for the copies of THE SENTINEL sent free, but am sorry to say I do not see my way clear to subscribe now. I think the great body of the people want Church and State forever apart, and that only "cranky" individuals and small sects desire a union.

> Your paper, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, has afforded me much light upon the National Reform movement of which it treats. The positions it has taken are to my mind eminently correct. All subjects that pertain to civil and religious liberty should be carefully studied, and all efforts, looking to a union of Church and State, uncompromisingly opposed. Such a thing would eventually lead to the worst results. Allow me also to say the reading of your paper has afforded me much pleasure.

The editor of the "oldest German newspaper in the South" writes:—

> The copy of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL you kindly sent us was received. After a careful perusal of the same, we entirely indorse the position you take by it, and shall be only too glad to give expression of our approval through the columns of the Anzeiger. At a period when fanaticism, sailing under the false flag of religion, is endeavoring to overthrow our sacred institutions, the publication of a journal like THE SENTINEL, which bravely breaks a lance with orthodoxy and hypocrisy is only to be hailed with pleasure, and every true American ought to make it his duty to spread it among the people, so that they might recognize the danger of the Republic becoming subjugated by the Church. Please place the Anzeiger on your mailing list, and oblige.

From gentlemen in Birmingham, Alabama:—

> I heartily indorse your sentiments, as expressed in THE SENTINEL of January 22. Please send me a few copies in February and March; if pleased with them will subscribe.

> I would be glad to read further on the subjects treated in your SENTINEL.

> I will be pleased to receive your journal.

> I have, I think, read every word in the copy of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, received this morning and am more than pleased with it. Wife and children will read to-night. Send it on.
