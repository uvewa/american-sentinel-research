At a recent meeting of some of the most ardent advocates of Sunday laws, in Wisconsin, at which J. P. Mills was the chief speaker, it was decided that the present Sunday laws of that State are as good as they could desire. They will direct their efforts toward raising a sentiment to secure their enforcement. They will also hold a meeting in June to revive a nearly dead society, called the "Wisconsin Civil Sunday Association," organized at Milwaukee a year ago last December. They will then work to effect local organizations in every county, city, township, and voting precinct in the State, with a view to canvassing for names to a petition to close the World's Fair in 1893 on Sunday.
