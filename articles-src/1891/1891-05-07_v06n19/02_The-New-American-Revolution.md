## The New American Revolution.

[page 145]

Last week we showed that which is repeated in clear to every reader of the Declaration of Independence, namely, that the American principle of government is that the Government is simply a piece of machinery which the people set up in order more fully to make themselves secure in the enjoyment of their rights. This principle of the Declaration is carried out in the Constitution of all the States of the American Union, and of the national Constitution of this Union. These Constitutions, State and national, are simply the expression of the people as to the form of government which they will have, defining the powers and limitations upon the Government which they have thus established. This doctrine of the popular composition and sovereignty of the Government, is one of the two grand elements that formed the American Revolution.

As long as this principle shall be maintained in its integrity, so long the beneficent fruits of the Revolution may remain to bless the American people; and through them other nations, but if this principle shall be lost sight of and it shall come to that place where the Government shall be considered a thing above the people, [page 146] then the design of the Revolution will be frustrated or indeed undone. There will, in fact, be a revolution backward and the re-establishment of the principle of European Governments and of the despotisms which it was the design of the revolutionary fathers for themselves and their posterity forever to escape. It may be news to the American people when we state that this revolution backward has already been accomplished for the Government of the United States. It may be news to the American people to be informed that the American principle and system of government has been supplanted by the British and the Roman, both, however, in the fact. All this has already been done. This reversal of the American Revolution has been already accomplished. Now to the proofs, and we sincerely ask the reader's careful attention.

May 19, 1890, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its decision in the case of the condemnation of the Mormon Church property expounded from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Utah. The case arose in consequence of the enforcement of what is known as the Edmunds Law or Act of Congress, February 19, 1887, "forfeiting and escheating to the United States the property of corporations obtained or held in violation of section three, of the Act of Congress, approved the first day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-two," to wit: "That it shall 'not' any corporation for religious or charitable purposes was forbidden to acquire or hold real estate in any Territory, during the existence of the territorial government, of greater value than $50,000."

By the year 1887, the Mormon Church organization had become possessed of real estate to the amount of about two millions of dollars, and personal property of the value of about one million. All of this property, above $50,000 worth of real estate, was declared forfeited to the United States.

The Mormon Church claimed that this property was held in trust by the corporation for the individual members of the church by donations, bequests, etc., and had placed their property in the hands of the corporation to be held in trust. The United States disputed this claim. The case was tried in the territorial court, and the whole sum was declared confiscated to the United States. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the decision of the territorial court, condemning the property, was confirmed.

It is not necessary for us to enter upon any discussion as to whether the Mormon Church had violated the law of 1862, first, because the Supreme Court of the United States decided that it was not necessary that that law should be violated in order that the corporation might be dissolved, not that "Congress for good and sufficient reasons of its own, independent of that limitation, and of any violation of it, has a full and perfect right to repeal the charter and abrogate its corporate existence, which of course depends upon its charter;" and second, because the merits of the question as between the Mormon Church and the United States is not material for the purpose of this article. The principle upon which the Supreme Court acted is all that is necessary to be discussed here and that principle is discernible without any examination or discussion as to the merits of the controversy.

The argument of the Court proceeds as follows:—

> When a business corporation, instituted for the gain of public or private interest, is dissolved, the modern doctrine is that its property, after the payment of its debts, belongs to its stockholders. But this doctrine has never been extended to public corporations. As to this, the counsel and established rule seems to be, that the property belongs to the general public, that is, to the disposal of the sovereign authority.

Now with all due respect to the honor of this Court, it may be inquired, why should not this modern doctrine be applied to public corporations as well as to private? why should the ancient doctrine be adopted in such cases, when to do, it is virtually to proceed in the face of the principles and institutions of the Government, of which the court is but a part. When the ancient doctrine is adopted the principles of the ancient government must likewise be adopted, because the ancient doctrine is but the expression of the principles of the ancient governments, and the principles of all those governments were directly the reverse of the principles of the Government. This will be seen more fully as we proceed. It is in fact seen in the above expression that personal property, in such cases as this under consideration, devolves subject to "the sovereign authority."

Upon this the question at once arises, Who or what is the sovereign authority in this Government? And to this question we have an answer that is certainly plainly expressed, and certainly true, of [page 147] not absolutely authoritative. Bancroft is the historian of the Constitution if not indeed of the country, and upon this very point he has the following plain statement. "It is it who is the sovereign of the United States? The word sovereign acts, subject and subjects are unknown to the Constitution."—*History of Constitution, Book V, chap. 1, par. 30.*

By this it is evident that the Supreme Court steps upon foreign ground when it suggests the existence, in this country, of a sovereign authority. It is true that the people are sovereign; but the people do not exercise their sovereign authority as such and directly, nor of themselves. "The people of the United States have declared in their Constitution that the law alone is supreme; and have defined that supremacy." *Id. par 1.* With Bancroft's quotation from the opinion of the Court it is made manifest that the existence of a sovereign authority was necessary to sustain a decision confirming the judgment already pronounced by the territorial Court. And as, according to the quotations given from Bancroft, there is no such thing known to American principles or institutions, the Court was necessarily driven beyond this Government and its institutions to find a basis for this sovereign authority. According to the decision, proceeds:—

> The principles of the law of charities are not confined to a particular people or nation, but prevail in all civilized countries pervaded by the spirit of Christianity. They are found imbedded in the civil code of Rome; in the law of the European states, and especially in the laws of that nation, from which our institutions are more immediately derived.

But the principles of the government of Rome and all the European nations, especially that nation from which the American institutions are most derived—the British—have always been directly the reverse of this. In those governments *were* sovereign authorities. They were not governments of the people, but governments of the sovereign, and the people were subjects. That of Rome was also absolute. The Emperor was supreme in everything. He was *persona potior,* that is, father of the country, and father of the people in the complete and fullest sense. He fed the people, he gave them money and whatever else they wanted; whenever wars made political rearrangement of boundaries desirable, he made boundaries and transferred peoples from one province to another with the despotism of ownership, and organized them as he pleased. He was proprietor, and organizing its parts in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness." So that in this Government, and according to American doctrine, there is no such thing as sovereign authority and there is no place for a sovereign force of the thing about to be discussed.

Therefore, as there is in this Government, neither king nor sovereign potentate which the property in this case might go, it follows logically from the previous statement of the Court that the administration and application of the estate involves the right of the Government to deal with them upon the judicial institution and establishment of the particular charity to which they are subject, that the decision of the territorial Court should have been reversed and the money involved returned to the individuals to whom it belonged. Both in the logic of the case, according to the principles and institutions of the Government of the United States. But this logic was not followed. Instead of it, the Court proceeded to establish a sovereign power, and clothe it with the office of the parent of the country and the father of the people.

The Court first quoted a number of decisions, Roman, Spanish, and English, to contain the principles which it had adopted contrary to American principles. American institutions there is no king, and aside from the people there is nothing that corresponds to a king. And even the people all told that no monarch is a king is for the individual; for each individual American citizen is sovereign and king in his own right.

The Court, the Court says:—

> This prerogative of *parens patriæ* is inherent in the supreme power of every State, . . . a party or person who is *in lege* is a ward in a royal preen in an absolute the Chancellor in the courts of the Legislature; in the United States, . . .

*in the law alone,* and in the Constitution that represents it.

It is true that the decision of the Court is qualified by the expression, that "within constitutional limitations, or rather in the exercise guaranteed by constitutional limitations, the Legislature of this country is possessed in this regard which the sovereign possesses in England." But this neither instance nor the reversal of the principles of our Government. This argument that the Legislature of the Government is a sovereign, and can exercise that power of the sovereign which the government of America is restrained by constitutional limitations.

Whereas, the truth is that the truth is that the Legislature has no power at all. It is possessed of no authority to do, and can exercise none except as it is granted. The powers that the Legislature does exercise, are not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. The express picture of the Constitution is, that the powers not delegated are reserved. The doctrine of this decision implies, if not expressed that powers not prohibited are possessed and held. This is the direct reverse. This in itself would be sufficient ground upon which entirely to set aside the decision. But it was not set aside; it was laid against it, by the Chief Justice, the additional evidence that the Legislature is restrained by the very constitutional limitations suggested by the Court.

The Chief Justice, with Justice Field and Justice Lamar, concurring, dissented from the decision. In his dissenting opinion the Chief Justice says:—

> I am unable to agree with the opinion of the majority . . . and the limitations it imposes, and sincerely the provisions expressed in the Constitution, and I regard it of vital importance that they be not nullified in that instrument. And as such power is expressly limited by the act of Congress, and as a condition is conferred by the Constitution, nor by any of its property . . . The confiscation . . . of civil consequences did dissolve the corporation; it did not . . . beyond no check upon the Legislature.

The legislative power of Congress in legislating for the Territories is subject to the restraint the power to make needful rules and regulations for suppressing crime; and it is inconsiderable even though that crime cover . . . of a criminal nature. Congress has the power to extirpate policy in any of its Territories, but to Congress, or as in the Court, may deal with this property to confiscate it under the cover of that power to confiscate the property merely because, in the estimation of Congress, was an organization; without notice found, because confiscation may have been guilty of criminal practices.
