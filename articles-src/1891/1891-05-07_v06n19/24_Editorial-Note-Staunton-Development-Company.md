ONE of the neatest things that has come under our notice in the advertising line is a pamphlet descriptive of the new South, issued by the Staunton Development Company, of Staunton, Virginia. The pamphlet will be of interest to both pleasure-seekers and money-getters, as it describes one of the most attractive parts of the South.
