## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

[page 150]

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We believe in the utter and the so most our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government.

We believe that the rights of religious and civil liberty should be co-extensive.

OFFICERS.

*Roon Bland, New York;* &emsp; *Battle Creek, Michigan.*

C. ELDRIDGE, &emsp; *President.*

W. A. COLCORD, &emsp; *Secretary.*
