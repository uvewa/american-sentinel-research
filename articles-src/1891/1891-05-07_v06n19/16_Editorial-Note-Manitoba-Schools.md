CARDINAL TASCHEREAU and his suffragan prelates of Quebec have protested in joint letter against the act of the Manitoba Legislature abolishing separate schools in that province. The bishops declare that the Church, as the representative of her divine Founder, not only has the right, but the duty to direct through her ministers the moral education of her children.
