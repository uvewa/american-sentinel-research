TAXES come from all the people; taxes should be used for all the people and can be properly used no other way. The use of taxes, therefore, to impart religious instruction, that is, their use to turn the sentiments of one part of the people against the sentiments of another part, is unlawful and unconstitutional.—*Independent.*

IN his opening address at the State University, at Cheyenne, Wyoming, Dr. A. A. Johnson, the Methodist minister who planned the land of that institution, said, he recognized the fact that State and Church work were widely separated and was glad it was so. He understood the genius of public institutions and believed they should be administered in the interests of the entire people without regard to creeds or dogmas. He believed in the Christian religion, and all that its doctrines were necessary to meet the needs of the people; yet during his administration no sectarian teaching should be allowed in the University. Dr. Johnson's platform is heartily approved by the people of the State.—*Denver Weekly News.*

THE important lesson of this hour is that the common school institution, the ideal American State, must be entirely secular, the Church must supplement and reinforce the public school instruction by more vigorous religious teaching at home, and through the varied agencies of the Church. The spiritual energies of the Church must be summoned, as churches, [page 146] where, to supply the deficiencies of the State or rather is what the State can not in the very nature of the case. In the inevitable separation of the Church and State is separation so complete, that religion is ruled out of our popular education the Sunday-school rises into an importance of which the founders of that institution laid no conception. It becomes the great agent for impressing the minds of the youth of the land, with those religious truths, which are essential to moral conduct as well as to spiritual vigor, the hope and bulwark of modern society. Heavy as is the burden thus laid on the broad shoulders of the Church she is able to bear it; and to gloriously accomplish the work that of right belongs to her.—*Rev. T. D. Proks.*
