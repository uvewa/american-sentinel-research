The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. The following minor issues were noted:

### Page 1, Header
- **Transcribed as:** "THE AMERICAN SPORTING"
- **Should be:** "THE AMERICAN SENTINEL"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - obvious OCR error, corrected based on known publication name

### Page 8, Date
- **Transcribed as:** "NEW YORK, MAY 7, 189."
- **Should be:** "NEW YORK, MAY 7, 1891."
- **Confidence:** HIGH - year incomplete in OCR, corrected based on issue date

### Page 6, Author Name
- **Location:** Article "Going too Far" - mentions "Hugh O. Pentecost" and editor of "Freethought"
- **Note:** OCR rendered "Freethought" as "*Free thought*" - preserved as *Freethought* for consistency

### Page 8, Subscription Prices
- **OCR rendering unclear:** prices listed as "—Me." and "The."
- **Transcribed as:** left as-is since these appear to be OCR errors in advertisement section
- **Note:** These are subscription rate placeholders that were illegible in original

- **Author:** Jessie O. Barber
- **Location:** Ann Arbor, Mich.
