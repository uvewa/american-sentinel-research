# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, May 7, 1891 (v06n19)

## General Note

This issue presented significant OCR challenges. The scan quality is notably poor compared to other issues, with very small text, blurriness, and general degradation throughout. Pages 146-149 were especially difficult. Many passages required extensive interpretation, and several remain uncertain despite multiple review passes.

## 02_The-New-American-Revolution.md

### OVERALL NOTE

- **Reason:** Text is blurry at this transition

### Page 146, Right Column — Bancroft quote
- **Transcribed as:** "It is it who is the sovereign of the United States? The word sovereign acts, subject and subjects are unknown to the Constitution."
- **Confidence:** LOW — the exact wording of this Bancroft quote is uncertain
- **Reason:** Text is very small and blurry; the actual Bancroft quote may read differently

- **Reason:** The legal Latin and surrounding text are blurry and partially illegible

- **Transcribed as:** Multiple passages in the Chief Justice's dissenting opinion

## 03_A-Few-Observations.md

### Page 148, Left Column — Author initials
- **Transcribed as:** "W. A. C."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The initials at the end of the article appear to be "W. A. C." which does not match any known regular contributor. Could potentially be "W. A. B." (W. A. Blakely) if the final letter is a B rather than C. However, "W. A. C." could refer to W. A. Colcord, who is listed as Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association on the same page.

### Page 148, Left Column — Petition details
- **Transcribed as:** "H. Muckel, G. Stofred, Samuel Ramsey"
- **Confidence:** LOW — these names from the Melbourne petition are difficult to read
- **Reason:** Very small text; names could be different spellings

### Page 148, Left Column — Mangles reference
- **Transcribed as:** "Mr. Mangles writes that not one-fourth of the signatures of the seventy-one bars had been called upon"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "seventy-one bars" seems incorrect but is what appears in the text
- **Reason:** Blurry text makes exact reading uncertain

### OVERALL NOTE
- This article by Josiah O. Barber spans pages 148-149 and was one of the most difficult articles to transcribe in this issue. The text is very small, the arguments wind through dense prose, and the scan quality is poor throughout.

### Page 148, Center Column — Mrs. Hemans quote
- **Transcribed as:** 'With "unbounded beauty" of passion but Mrs. Hemans said:— They left unmated what then they feared. Freedom to worship—not!'
- **Confidence:** LOW — this passage is very difficult to read
- **Reason:** The poetry quotation and surrounding text are blurry

### Page 148-149 — Multiple passages
- **Issue:** Numerous passages throughout this article are of LOW confidence due to scan quality
- **Second pass completed:** Yes, multiple passes
- **Reason:** The article text is very small and the scan is degraded; while the general arguments about Puritanism, Roger Williams, religious liberty, and church-state separation are clear in theme, many specific word choices are uncertain

### Page 149, Left Column — Attribution at end
- **Transcribed as:** "—*Rev. —'M. V. Edgar Mowrage, Primitive Baptist.'*"
