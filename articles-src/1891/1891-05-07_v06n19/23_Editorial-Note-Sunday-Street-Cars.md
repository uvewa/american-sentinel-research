"YESTERDAY," says the *Mail and Express*, of April 27, "was a day of days, and a stroll through the park or in the upper part of the city was attended with delights unnumbered. The air in the vicinity of Washington Heights and Fort George was redolent with the perfume of cherry and apple blossoms, the trees on some of the old estates being huge bouquets of beauty. The breeze was just strong enough to temper the sun's rays, and from points where a good view of the noble Hudson could be had, so clear was the atmosphere that one could distinguish houses on the river bank as far north as Tarrytown." This perfect day, this "day of days," was a Sunday, and doubtless thousands enjoyed its beauties to the full; but if the *Mail and Express* had its way only those who live in those delightsome quarters of the city and those who own carriages, could enjoy the fragrance of apple blossoms, and the beauty of the suburban landscape, for there would be no Sunday street-cars to take them out of the more crowded portions of the city.
