## What They Say about "The Sentinel."

[page 150]

FROM lawyers and magistrates in North Carolina who have received test numbers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL:—

I like your paper very religious. I came to read your paper very religious. I find it is devoted to a large religion. I want and appreciate its value. I have read your pamphlet according to the dictates of our consciences. Your excellent paper is indeed this will cause blessed to rest. Let the Church and God make Christians . . . and they re-examine in our Constitution and trample on it, we are a ruined Nation.

Your paper received and appreciated very highly. The daily believe your cause is regard to religion is right. I am an old school Baptist and a Democrat. My grandfather fought through the Revolutionary War for religious rights and liberty. I want to march the same banner.

Yes, I'll gladly receive and mail your paper. I feel that it is a needed and proper duty with work that looks to the preservation of our civil and religious rights in the United States. And I bid God bless your paper.

I have examined your paper under The American Sentinel, and have a good opinion in regard to it. I desire to make further examination of the paper.

The individual who has told me, THE SENTINEL, two or three months—

I thank you for the copies of The American, and they say the party to see he was on my way to subscribe now. I think the great body of the people want Church and State forever apart, and we are "truly" individuals and small morals.

Your paper, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, has afforded me a good deal of information on the subject of which it treats. The position it takes is in my view most eminently correct. I feel that all persons to civil and religious liberty should be carefully studied, and all efforts, looking to secure a union of church and State should be resisted. Such a thing would eventually lead to the worst of tyrannies. The oldest "illiterate German newspaper," the "oldest German news-," has affected me much greater.

The copy of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, you kindly gave to me is of great value. After giving you hardly indeed I endorse the position you take in it, and shall be very rich give me the expression of our national through the columns of the damage. It is a period when fanaticism, sailing under the false flag of religion, is endeavoring to overthrow our sacred institutions, the publication of a paper like The Sentinel, which weirdly breaks a lance with every would-be enemy of religious liberty is a pleasure, and every true American ought to make it his duty it is spread the people, as so that they might recognize the danger of the Republic becoming subjugated by the Church. Please place me on your mailing list, and oblige.

Young gentlemen; in Birmingham, I was lately—

I can hereby indicate your invitation, as expressed in a letter of January 31. Please send me a few copies in February and March; if pleased I will subscribe.

I would be glad to read further on this subject treated in your fortuitous.

I have, I think, read every word in the copy of the American Sentinel, received yesterday and am more than pleased with it. Wife and children will read its reading. Send it on.

I will be pleased to receive your journal.
