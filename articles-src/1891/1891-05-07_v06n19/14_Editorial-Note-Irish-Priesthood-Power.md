*Public Opinion*, of London, says, that "Sir Henry James, M. P. addressing the members of the Liberal Union Club at their annual meeting in Westminster, said it had become a demonstrated fact that the Roman Catholic priesthood held the balance of power between all parties in Ireland, and that if the Government were ever given into the hands of the people it would, in fact, be handed over to priestly control." This is an evil by no means confined to Ireland; a desperate effort is being made to give the Protestant clergy the same power in this country that the priests exercise there.

The insolence of the aggressor is usually proportioned to the tameness of the sufferer.—Ames.
