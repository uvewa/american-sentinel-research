At a recent meeting of some of the noted advocates of Sunday rest of State, in Wisconsin, at which J. P. Mills was the chief speaker, it was decided that "the present Sunday laws of that State are as good as they could desire. They will concentrate their efforts toward raising a sentiment to secure their enforcement. They will also hold a meeting in June to form a newly dated society, called the "Wisconsin Civil Sunday Association." A similar organized at Milwaukee a year ago last January. They will also shortly begin to organize organizations in every county, city, township, and voting precinct in the State, with a view to canvassing for names to a petition to close the World's Fair in 1893 on Sunday.
