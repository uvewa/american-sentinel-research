JAMES P. MILLS, general and field Secretary of the sixth district of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in the leading cities of Illinois in behalf of the better observance of Sunday. He spoke in Bloomington April 21, and on the Monday following organized a local union for the county. Those who have attended his lectures state that it is difficult to tell which he is working for the hardest; to secure a better observance of Sunday, or to fight the Seventh-day Adventists. Every place he goes he takes particular pains to tell how hard the Seventh-day Adventist people are working against Sunday laws. This people have evidently been reading history and know what it means to enforce any religious doctrine by civil law. Let all lovers of civil and religious freedom study the question carefully in the light of the record of the past, and the majority will see that it is their duty to oppose such legislation, no matter how highly they may regard Sunday.
