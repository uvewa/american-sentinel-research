The following paragraph under caption "The Sabbath Question," appears in the *Christian Statesman*, of April 23, 1891:—

> A petition has just been received from the hands of T. C. Maughlin, of Stafford, Kansas, addressed to the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition, and praying that the gates of the Exposition be closed every Lord's day during its progress. The petition bears three hundred and eighteen signatures. Mr. Maughlin writes that not one-fourth of the inhabitants of the country have had opportunity to sign; that all classes give their names willingly except infidels and the Seventh-day Adventists. These last, though Christians, are prevented by their peculiar views of the Sabbath, and by their opposition to all moral and religious elements in civil government, from co-operating with other Christian people in this effort.

This is about as fair a statement of the case as respects the position of the Seventh-day Adventists, as we have ever seen in the *Statesman*. It admits that they are Christians; that because of their peculiar views of the Sabbath (which peculiarity, by the way, consists simply in taking the Sabbath commandment as it reads) they can not lend their influence toward Sunday-keeping; and that on account of their opposition to the introduction of religious questions into civil government, they are unwilling to unite in an effort to secure the recognition and enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath, or any other Sabbath or religious institution, by law.

The observations we would make on this are these: (1.) If opposition to moral and religious elements in civil government leads to a refusal to help along a movement for the recognition and enforcement of Sunday by law, what can the favoring of Sunday laws be but an effort to introduce moral and religious elements in civil government? In other words, what are Sunday laws but religious laws? and what the enforcement of them but the enforcement of religion? And what is the enforcement of religion but a union of Church and State? (2.) If the observance of the Sabbath commandment, as it reads, leads men to oppose a union of Church and State, is not the effect of such observance good? (3.) And if the Christianity of a certain class leads them to take God at his word, and this leads them to oppose a union of Church and State, is not that a good sort of Christianity to have?
