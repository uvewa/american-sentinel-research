Every question of the day, generally speaking, has both a popular and an unpopular side; for the majority of mankind, if they think at all, are apt to think as others think, depending more upon the judgment of those whom they esteem as scholars and men of deep thought, than upon personal investigation. But often time has proved that the unpopular view of a subject was the right one.

There is no idea more prevalent at the present time than that all we have and are we owe to our "Pilgrim Fathers," and there is no idea more erroneous. The place given them in history has been given too freely, not but that they have wielded a powerful influence in our Nation, but that that influence is not in its effects entirely good.

The desire for freedom from religious tyranny was the motive which induced them to flee from England to the New World. With wonderful beauty of expression has Mrs. Hemans said:—

> They left unstained what there they found—
>
> Freedom to worship God.

But is it true? Read their old "Blue Laws." Attendance at religious worship was made compulsory; and any violation of this was punished by imprisonment and fine; a second offense by stripes; and should the offender protest, he was likely to have a red hot iron thrust through his tongue.

Do you remember the persecution of Roger Williams, who was compelled to flee from them because they were attempting to found a theocracy, and because he maintained that to God, and to God alone, was he responsible for the convictions of his conscience, or the practice of any form of religion? Can you listen to the story of the "Salem Witchcraft"? can you read that black page in the history of our country, when innocent men and women by the score were executed merely to gratify the zeal of a superstitious and fanatical religious body, and still justify the Puritans?

But you say: "Their zeal, their fear of God, prompted them to all this." Granted! But was their conception of Jehovah the conception of a Christian? "There is no fear in love," and "God is love." And that charity, the greatest thing in the world, could never prompt to deeds like this. They who sought in the literal interpretation of the Scriptures, guidance for every matter of every-day life, must have forgotten the commandment: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."

Many outgrowths of puritanism exist at the present time, which from long custom we have ceased to question whether or not they be in accordance with perfect liberty. The observance of any form of religious worship in our public schools is another outgrowth of puritanism. Religion should be taught in the home; for as soon as we refer the violation of right to the law of God, we are sure to interpret that law according to sectarian views and principles, and this interferes with freedom.

The employment of chaplains in the army and in Congress are other traces of the old force which sought so completely to effect the total union of Church and State, though Jesus had once and forever severed them by that clean-cut statement: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

We point to our glorious Republic, and refer all honor to the Puritans, but do we not know that the very principles on which our Constitution was founded, were in direct opposition to all puritanic ideas? Freedom of conscience no less in religious than in civil matters was to be preserved, and no religious test was to be made as a qualification for office.

But puritanic forces are working to-day, and they are all the more dangerous to our Government from the fact that they are in the hands of those who are regarded as our best people. When a New England senator introduces into Congress a bill which provides for the compulsory observance of Sunday as the American Sabbath in a manner consistent with the demands of a Christian Nation, and when he is supported by the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and orders of a like nature—when this is done, and thousands of American people sign a petition to Congress to make that bill a law, is it not time for us to stop and think? Is this the freedom of conscience secured us by the Constitution? Is this the freedom of conscience which is ours as a divine gift? Is this perfect liberty? A thousand times—No. It is tyranny, religious tyranny, no less to-day than of old. It is only a step toward the establishment of a national religion—the union of Church and State. The observance of any day of the week as Sabbath is purely a personal matter which lies between man and God; then how, while liberty exists, can we consent to such a measure?—A measure that binds us in an ecclesiastical servitude, which is of all subjection the most galling.

Consistency of creed and daily works can, of course, never be fully realized, however much we aim at that quality; but can we not at least note the rocks on which other ships have been stranded and steer clear of them? Can we not preserve the freedom of our Government?

Finally, when we sum up the good and evil effects of puritanism, and while conceding the existence of the former, we look behind them for the motives which actuated their causes, and see selfishness, self-righteousness, lack of charity, persecution of countrymen, do we not fear that judgment from on high, "Weighed in the balance and found wanting"? for "by their fruits ye shall know them."
