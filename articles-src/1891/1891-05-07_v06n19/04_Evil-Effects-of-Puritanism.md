## Evil Effects of Puritanism.

[page 148]

Every question of the day, generally speaking, has both a popular and an unpopular side; for the majority of mankind, if they think at all, are apt to think as others think, depending more upon the judgment of those whom they admire as scholars and men of deep thought, than upon personal investigation. But often time has proved that the unpopular view of a subject was that the right one.

There is no idea more prevalent at the present time than that we have only to go back to our common ancestor, and even to see in it "Pilgrim Fathers," and them to draw instruction. The place given them in history has been among the first; but history of late has brought out truth that has not indeed wielded a powerful influence in our Nation, but that that influence is not in its effect entirely good.

The desire for freedom from religious tyranny was the motive which hallowed them to flee from England to New World. With "unbounded beauty" of passion but Mrs. Hemans said:—

They left unmated what then they feared. Freedom to worship—not!

But is it true? Read their old "Blue Laws." Attendance at religious worship was made compulsory; and any violation of that law, first; a moderate fine was first due; a second offence by stripes; and should the offender persist, he was likely to have a not too free breath through his future Union.

Do you remember the persecution of Roger Williams, who was compelled to flee from those because they wanted religious war for no one to lay hold black. It is true he found a theocracy, and became an establishment that to God, and to God alone, was he responsible for the conviction of his conscience, or the practice of any form of religion? Can y'a listen to the tune of the "Saints Witchcraft?" in can you read that black page in the history of our country, when innocent men and women felt the curse of morality? A country to gratify the zeal of a superstitious and fanatical religious body, and still justify the Puritan?

But you say: "Their zeal, their fear of God, compelled them to list this." Granted! But was their conception of Jehovah the conception of a Christian? There is [page 149] not a body of Christians can, in Christ's spirit, seek by law or force to harm any

cas, of course, never to fully realize, however, we may so at that quality, but can not at all least note the rocks on which other ships have been stranded and steer clear of them. Can we not perceive the defections of our Government?

Finally, when we state up the good and evil effects of puritanism, and while condemning the existence of the former, we boldly hold before them the motives which activated their causes, and real selfishness, self-coarseness, lack of charity, persecution of contrition, we do not fear that our judgments on high. "Weights" in their fruits ye shall know them.

JOSIAH O. BARBER.

*Ann Arbor, Mich.*

An infidel once said, "it is hard for a Christian to be tolerant;" and why should he be marveled it but for the fact that so many so-called Christians have been, and now are, intolerant? And I've learned and eminent a man and historian as Macaulay, has said, "the doctrine of all sects, when combined, is a few words, is simply this; I am in the right and you in the wrong. When you are the stronger, you ought to tolerate me, for it is your duty to tolerate the truth; but when I am the stronger, I shall persecute you, for it is my duty to persecute error." Macaulay judged as he beheld did; he judged all Christians by the tendencies and acts of the men who were weakly, learned and influential bodies of so-called Christian men, and brass on conclusions; and it will be the condition of all thinking men. But the truth is that no real Christian can be intolerant, because it is a fundamental principle of Christianity "that all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Matt. vii, 12 "and ye would that men should do to you, do also to them likewise." Luke vi. And Christ, said, also, "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves, be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves." Matt. x.

What Puritan Baptist would persecute any man for his religion, however erroneous he might know it to be? There is not one that would. There is not a Primitive Baptist church anywhere that would hold a member in fellowship who would join in burning or destroying the property of or otherwise injuring a Roman Catholic on account of his religion. Not one would, though knowing, at the same time, that the Catholics have in the past, hanged, drawn, and quartered many of our brethren. Stephen called down the blessing of God upon those who stoned him to death, and Christ prayed for those who crucified him. Surely the religion of Christ is not of this world.

No body of Christians can, in Christ's spirit, seek by law or force to harm any class of men, whether believers or unbelievers either in person or property. But all denominations of Christians in this country, as far as I know, except the Primitive Baptist, seek to, yea, to some extent, Church and State. They all have facilities in the Federal and State Legislatures, men who are paid to prey to the civil Government—paid by taxing which and indebtedness as well as believers. Is the use of money to pay such lobbyists in accordance to Christian principle, for it is too plain that it is not. They also favor the exemption of all church property from taxation, which, is just, as far as religious people are concerned, but is it not just, in justice professing no religion. Christ did not desire that his religion should be a burden to any man, nor can Christians in his spirit make it so.

The Ohio Supreme Court held (*American Law Register*), "that there is no such thing as religion of State."—When Christianity," continues the Court, "asks the aid of Government beyond a mere impartial protection, it disowns itself. Its divine are, divine, not human; its essential power; it encloses beyond its real range of human governments. United with government, religion never rises above the nearest government; never rises above the nearest superstition, and all history shows that when the spirit widely grows or grows of government no religion are separated, the better it is for both. It is for that our law centers; the teaching of the Christian religion, in the public schools, nearly all the teachers should be Christians. Won't all teachers, while I should instruct the people in that the Christian religion was true, and all other religious false, I should tell them that the law the law requiring religion to be taught in the schools she'd was an unchristian law. One of my first would be to show the pupils that it was mischievous, and that lesson would, I believe, be so worthwhile that each had you to do, ye even so to them." I could not teach but that to refuse. I would look the face and say that such a law was just; I should have to tell them it was an constitutional of false Christianity, and not one of the "lights" which believers are sliced are an unblemishing world."

How then can Christians ask, according to Christian teachings, for their church property to be exempt from taxation? or, in other words, how can they ask that tax-in-professing tax-payers be taxed to make up their religion? "That certainly is not just."

Now consider the value of all the church property of all the denominations in the United States, of the Episcopalians, Methodists, Catholics, Baptists, Presbyterians, and imagine, its value to hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars, exempt from taxation, and the deficiency, aggregating millions of dollars, that is forced out of the nonprofessing has-payers to support the so-called religion of Christ, and that in a Government boasting of religious liberty, is a complete separation of Church and State!

I confess that it may seem that these things are so trifling and unimportant to notice, but when we consider how tenaciously they become masters of graver import to lovers of real Christianity and religious liberty, as well as lovers of free Government, whether religious or otherwise. It was the beast that had two horns like a lamb that spake as a dragon.—*Rev. —"M. V. Edgar Mowrage, Primitive Baptist."*

The observance of any form of religious worship in our public schools or in another outgrowth of puritanism. Religion should be taught in the home and in the church. The observance of the violation of right by the law of the free, we are to interpret that each person, viz, we are to interpret their own personal views on religious views and principles, and this interferes with freedom.

The employment of chaplains in the army and in Congress are other traces of an old order which would eventually, if unchecked or wholly set on contempt to effect the total union of Church and State, and, though dead long since our modern states, would though dead one and rise once more:

"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

We point to our glorious Republic, and refer all honor to the Puritans, but so be it remembered that this same Republic, which our Constitution was founded, was other in direct opposition to all ancient principles of the fathers, but the first on the principles of Government of conscience in men as to religion in this in civil matters was to be preserved, and as religious test that it was a man's right to say conscience with religion.

But patriotism forces are working today, and they are all the more dangerous to our Government from the fact that they are in the hands of those who are regarded as our best people. When a New England church is in a manner consistent with the demands which provision for the compulsory worship on Sunday at the American State, in a manner consistent with the demands of an enlarged public conscience. Surely this is most to be noticed.

The church is supported by the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and orders of a like nature. When this in time, and thousands of religious sects and people, a portion in Congress to make that bill a law, it is very clear for us no ray of the black. It is this the freedom of conscience secured by the Constitution? Is this the freedom of conscience which is come a divine gift? Is this perfect liberty? A thousand times —No. It is tyranny, religious tyranny, yes in one to-day than of old. It is only a step toward the establishment of a national religion—the union of Church and State.

Now the observance of the first day of the week as Sabbath is purely a parental matter, for which the line between man and God; but how, whilst liberty exists, can we consent to such a measure—a measure that holds in an ecclesiastical servitude, which is of all subjection the most galling. Consistency of creed and daily works
