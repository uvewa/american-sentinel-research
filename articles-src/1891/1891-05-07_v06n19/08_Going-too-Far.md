REFERRING to a quotation from the editor of *Freethought* to the effect that "the Government of Mexico to-day is the most liberal Government on the face of the earth," Mr. Hugh O. Pentecost says:—

> To substantiate this statement Mr. Putnam relates that a "vast amount of church property has been confiscated. . . . Convents are forbidden. The clericals are not allowed to wear the official garb on the streets. They must dress like other folks: They can not perform a legal marriage." I judge from this that if the Mexican officials should drive the church people out of the country, or make it a capital offense to be a Christian, the Mexican Government might be considered still more liberal. Is the kind of tyranny Mr. Putnam describes his idea of being liberal? On Mr. Putnam's own showing the Mexican Government is exceedingly illiberal toward the Catholic Church, quite as illiberal as that church is toward other people.
>
> What right should a government have to confiscate church property, or forbid priests to dress as they please, or not recognize the legality of the marriage they solemnize? The Liberals of the United States would do well to regard Mexico as missionary ground, on which to teach the first principles of liberalism, rather than to regard it as the most liberal country in the world. He upon liberality that does not concede to the Church liberty to exist and work without governmental interference of any kind! There should be no statutes either favoring or oppressing the Church. It should be given a fair field in which to play its part in this world.
>
> I regard the Church as an unmitigated evil, and, as an institution, have a cordial dislike to it, but as long as public opinion can sustain such an institution its right to exist should be recognized and contended for first of all by Liberals. While we have a Government, the utmost that a Liberal should ask of it with regard to the Church is that it should extend it no official aid. While other property is taxed church property should be taxed, but no legislative discrimination should be made against the Church. If the priests like to wear their absurd petticoats who should object? And if persons wish priests to marry them, whose affair is it but that of the contracting parties?

All of this, with the exception of Mr. Pentecost's expression of dislike for the Church, we regard as good sense. There is by far too much of the "liberalism" that smiles upon an opposition to religion. All should remember that it is no more the province of government to oppose religion than it is to foster it.

A THANKLESS task has he who tries
To chip and model
The world to just the form and size
Of his own noddle.
