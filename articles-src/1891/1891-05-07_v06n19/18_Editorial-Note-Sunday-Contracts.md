THE *Cincinnati Post* remarks that "an Indianapolis church member who subscribed to a church building fund attempted to wriggle out of it by claiming that the contract was illegal as it was made on Sunday, but the Court has decided that he must pay up." It is true that the law of the State makes void Sunday contracts, but as it is also true that Sunday laws are in the interests of the Church, it is only natural that the courts should construe them in that interest. Of course the whole thing is contrary to the spirit of our institutions, but nowadays that don't count.
