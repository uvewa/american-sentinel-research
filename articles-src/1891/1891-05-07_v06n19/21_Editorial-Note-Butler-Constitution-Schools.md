GEN. B. F. BUTLER thinks that the Constitution of the United States ought to be studied in the public schools. He says:—

> Would it do any harm if I should suggest that such study might be taken up in the public schools instead of the study of the Scriptures, the prosecution of which, more or less compulsory, has worked great harm in our schools? . . . That there should be no governmental teaching of any religion, or recognition of any religious faith, was fundamental in our Constitution: and after powerful and thorough debate there was no recognition of any religion in that instrument. The first chapter of the first Act of Congress struck out the word "God" from the obligation of an official oath, and the calling upon the Supreme Being in an official oath never obtained until the ironclad oaths of the Rebellion. I feel sure that pure religion will not lose but gain by being withdrawn from contestation among the pupils of the schools, as I trust it will always gain when kept out of controversy.

Well, no; we do not think that the suggestion will do any harm; and we are very certain that the practice would not. The Bible ought to be read and studied by everybody, but the public school is not the place for such study.
