"YESTERDAY," says the *Mail and Express,* of April 27, "was a day of toads, and a stroll through the park or in the upper part of the city was attended with considerable pleasure. The air in the vicinity of Washington Heights and Fort George was redolent with the perfume of cherry and apple blossoms, the trees in some of the old estates being huge bouquets of beauty." Yes, The bees, year just long enough to temper the sun's rays, and from points where a good view of the noble Hudson could be had, so clear was the atmosphere that one could distinguish points on the river back as far as north of Tarrytown." This perfect day, this "day of toads," was a Sunday, and doubtless thousands enjoyed its beauties to the full. Why only those who live in those delightsome quarters of the city and those who on carriages, could enjoy the fragrance, the apple blossoms, and the beauty of the magnificent landscape, for there should be no Sunday street-cars to take them off and the more crowded portions of the city.

ONE of the neatest things that has come under our notice in the advertising line is a pamphlet is descriptive of the new Staunton, the advertising the hotel company, of Staunton, Virginia. The pamphlet will be of interest to both pleasureseekers and money-getters, as it describes one of the most attractive parts of the South.
