IN his opening address at the State University, at Cheyenne, Wyoming, D. A. A. Johnson, the Methodist minister lately placed at the head of that institution, said he recognized the fact that State and Church were widely separated and was glad it was so. He understood the genius of public institutions and believed they should be administered in the interests of the entire people without regard to creeds or dogmas. He believed in the Christian religion, and that all its churches were necessary to meet the needs of the people; yet during his administration no sectarian teaching should be allowed in the University. Dr. Johnson's platform is heartily approved by the people of the State.—*Denver Weekly Times.*
