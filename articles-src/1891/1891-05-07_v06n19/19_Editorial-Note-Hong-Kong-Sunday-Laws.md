THE Sunday-law advocates in Hong-Kong are terribly in earnest in demanding Sunday legislation for that Colony. In answer to the objection that it would deprive the poor coolies of a considerable part of their already slender income, a correspondent of the *China Mail* says:—

> This cry about the poor coolie losing a day is all "cry and no wool." The business man of Hong-Kong cares for the coolies about as much as he does for a cockroach. He may not go out of his way to crush a cockroach, but the roach must not run across his foot. And so with the coolies. . . . It might entail a little more night work (but I doubt it), and as that costs the ships no extra expense, I do not see their reason for refusal.

It seems a little strange that Sunday rest is so important that these poor heathen must be compelled to rest upon that day even if they do earn less wages and have to work nights to do it. We suppose that it is, however, for their health in some way.
