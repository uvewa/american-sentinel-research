[page 152]

THE Portuguese Ambassador has left Rome for Lisbon in order to receive the instructions of his government with reference to the future ecclesiastical relations of the Vatican with Belgium to the arbitration of the Pope. The dispute is in regard to the southern portions of the Congo-State.

CARDINAL TASCHEREAU and the suffragan bishops of Quebec have protested in a pastoral letter against the act of the Manitoba Legislature abolishing separate schools in that province. The bishops declare that the Church, as the representative of her divine Founder, not only has the right, but the duty to directly look through her ministers the moral education of her children.

"The *Mail and Express*" says:—

We hope and believe that the end is not, and that the so-called virtues of their representatives at the hands of the Russian Government that others upon it, series, occupation, and tolerance to the Jews which is enjoyed by all the citizens of that country.

At the same time the *Mail and Express* is in the race of those influences which are at work in this country to impose similar disabilities upon those in this country who do not conform to the religion of the majority.

A BROOKLYN Irish Prohibitionist that "an Indianapolis church member who felt a claim to a church building fund attempted to wriggle out of it by claiming that the contract was illegal as it was made on Sunday, but the Court has decided that he most pay." It is to this that the law of the State makes work Sunday working; but to us it also may this Sunday laws are on the interests of the Church, it is only natural that the church would otherwise count them in that interest. But of course the whole thing is contrary to the spirit of our institutions, but moralizing that don't count.

THE Sunday-law advocates in Hong Kong are terribly in earnest the demand for Sunday legislation for that Colony. In answer to the objection that it would deprive the poor coolies of one-seventh part of their already slender income, a correspondent of the *China Mail* says:—

This city about the poor coolies being a day is an unjust and so send. The business men of Hong Kong [page 152] carry the coolies about as much to be done for a cockroach. He may get out of his way to avoid a cockroach, but the roach could not run across his path, a little more sight work than I'd shall do, and at that costs the the disgrace screw expense. I do not see the concern reason for behind.

It seems a little strange that Sunday rest is so important that these poor heathens must be compelled to rest upon that day even if they do earn less wages and have less to buy food. Welcome to some of them in, however, for their self. We give some in, however, for their Welfare, to some of the rest.

It is stated that there is under consideration a plan for a grand North American Roman Catholic Council on the model of the one recently held in Baltimore. Where it will be held is not yet decided, but the majority of the bishops indorse the project. The aim of the Council will be the entire reorganization of the American hierarchy.

GEN. B. F. BUTLER thinks that the Constitution of the United States ought to be studied in the public schools. He says:—

> Would it do any harm if I should suggest that every student ought to be taken in the public schools the particular of the study of the Scriptures, the present studies of which, more on the constitution, be most great harm in our schools?

There should be no governmental teaching of any religious or recognition of any religious book, was formed neutral in our Constitution, and we have provided and distinctly drawn there was no recognition of any religion in that instrument. The first charge of the first Act of Congress even established a form, from the obligation of an official oath, and the second the religion was but set for the Government entered until the insofar until the codes of the belief.

I wish to add that these gentlemen who have been arguing by being withdrawn, from constitutions among others, have the right to state of property that they can have were kept out of controversy.

Well, yes, do we not think that the suggestion will do any harm; and we are very certain that the practice would not. The Bible ought to be heard and studied by everybody, but the public school is not the place for it.
