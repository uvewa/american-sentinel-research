THE People's Trade and Labor Party, at a meeting held in Chicago, have memorialized the World's Fair Commissioners asking that the Fair be opened on Sunday at half rate for admission. The last two of the series of resolutions show that some of the reasons given for asking that the Fair be closed on Sunday are distasteful to the workingmen. These resolutions read as follows:—

> Resolved, That we repudiate with scorn the statement of certain so-called and self-alleged Christian ministers, deacons, and deaconesses, and defamers of workingmen in general, that "disgraceful conduct of the dangerous masses would ensue if the Fair be opened Sunday."

> Resolved, That we hereby declare to those traducers of men and women who earn their bread by the sweat of their brows, that their absence from the Fair, Sunday, will only add to the pleasures of a visit by workingmen and their families on that day.
