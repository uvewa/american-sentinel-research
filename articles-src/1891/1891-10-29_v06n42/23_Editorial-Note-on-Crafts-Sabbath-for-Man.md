IN his book, "Sabbath for Man," page 258, Mr. Crafts says: "It is not sufficiently emphasized that the Jew is left absolutely free to observe the seventh day. He can close his shop; he can refuse to work." In view of this a member of the National Religious Liberty Association asks: "Is not every other man just as free to observe the first day? Cannot every person who desires to keep Sunday close his shop and refuse to work? Where, then, is the need of Sunday laws? What more can consistently be asked than absolute freedom?"
