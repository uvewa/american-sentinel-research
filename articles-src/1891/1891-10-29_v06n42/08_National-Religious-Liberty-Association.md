NATIONAL

Religious Liberty Association

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ, and regard its principles and purposes and spirit as set forth in the Scriptures.

We believe in civil government as divinely ordained for the protection of the people in their natural rights.

We believe in the total separation of church and state as taught by Jesus Christ, and maintained by the apostles.

We believe that legislation upon the subject of religion is a perversion of civil power, and subversive of civil liberty.

We believe it the duty of every American citizen to maintain this separation of religion and the State, as the fundamental principle of the American government.

We believe that all religious legislation by civil government endangers the rights of every citizen, and robs them of one of their most sacred rights.

We believe that it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

Lecture Bureau of the National Religious Liberty Association.

The Lecture Bureau of the National Religious Liberty Association is of competent lecturers in various parts of the United States, and one standing invitation upon the subject of religious liberty and the relation of Church and State. For information apply to the Secretary, Allen Moon, the Secretary of the Bureau, in College Place, Washington.

Luce Freeman, a present citizen of this city, sold a quart of potatoes on the 11th of, was arrested and the next morning was taken before Judge Allison, in the town Justice in the Essex Market Court, on a charge of Sabbath breaking.

A "Law and Order" League of one thousand members has just been formed in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Their special aim is, to enforce the strict enforcement of Sunday laws. It is likely that the mischief to the King has been that the State has given them encouragement to that kind of work.

The workingmen of Minneapolis recently adopted a resolution protesting against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and demanding "that the board of managers shall refrain from any action that will shut out workingmen from enjoying a day of recreation at the fair." This, it is the only solution for them and their quiet whilst?
