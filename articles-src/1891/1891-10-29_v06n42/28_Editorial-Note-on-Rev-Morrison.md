In a recent sermon in Duluth, Minnesota, Rev. George W. Morrison said:—

> The greatest Sabbath-breaker on record is the Sunday newspaper: it is one of the most violent forms of Sabbath breaking. . . . Some people say it is the Monday paper which is responsible, but that is not so—it is the Sunday sheet. There is more necessity for a saloon seven days in the week than there is for a paper every day.

And why does this minister think the Sunday paper worse than the Sunday saloon? The answer is not far to seek; the Sunday paper keeps people from church who would probably go were it not for the paper; they read the paper and "let the hour of public worship go by unheeded," while scarce one in a hundred of those who frequent the saloon on Sunday would go to church if the saloon were closed. The Sunday paper is the foe of the Sunday preacher, because it reduces his congregation by offering greater attractions than he has to offer.
