Civil society rests upon a social compact between individual men acting in obedience to a law of their being, and under the impulse of their common nature. . . . For man is essentially a social and political, as well as a moral and intellectual being. There is a law of his nature which impels him toward political society. He has certain well-defined faculties and capacities which not only seek, but depend, for their highest development, upon association with his fellows: and while the social impulse is confirmed and justified by certain obvious advantages which belong exclusively to such association, yet, in the movement toward society, his whole nature is operative; and he attains the highest development of his whole nature only in the manifold relations of such society.

There is a sense, indeed, in which the individual concedes something of personal liberty and advantage in exchange for the advantages which accrue to him from his social compact with his fellows. But there is a higher sense, in which every such concession not only secures a gain, but is in itself a gain, to the individual. The obligation of society, then, is in the direction of the highest development of the individual; and the tendencies of individual progress are not toward the disintegration of civil society, but toward the better establishing and perfecting of it.

Only let it be freely acknowledged that the basis of civil society is a social compact between men acting as free, but social and moral, beings, and we reach the great conclusion that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed; and that civil society becomes more and more authoritative in the true sense of that word, and more and more secure, as men advance in the development and appropriation of civil liberty.

—S. S. Harris, D.D., LL.D., Bishop of Michigan.
