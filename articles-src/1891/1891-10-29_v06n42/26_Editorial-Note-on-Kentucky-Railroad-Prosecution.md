The County Court of Green County, Ky., has assessed $900 and costs, against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company, for the violation of the Sunday law, by labor done in the repairing of tracks on Sunday; and the Frankfort Court of Appeals, on Oct. 13, affirmed the judgment. It is a significant fact that the majority of the prosecutions under religious laws are in the southern States, and that the vote of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Fair in favor of Sunday closing would have gone largely the other way had it not been for the Southern members. Sam Small and W. F. Crafts also speak boastfully of the attitude of the southern States upon the Sunday law question as being uncompromisingly for a strict enforcement. Why is this? Have these States, which are now so ready to prosecute and persecute, been the cradle in which has been bred and and from which has gone forth to the world an intelligent, broad, evangelical, Christian spirit in greater degree than from other communities which are slower in appeal to the civil law to enforce their religious beliefs? Is this so, or is it not so? And if it is, or is not, what does the fact teach?
