It is a notable fact that for all that is said about a Sunday rest being so much needed for the poor laboring man, but few laboring men are putting forth exertions to obtain it, or are heard in the lecture-field championing it. If they are undergoing an Egyptian bondage, as would seem from the claims of some, it indeed seems strange that their cries and groanings should not be heard. If they are so sorely oppressed would not the labor organizations strike for Sunday rest, the same as they have for higher wages and shorter days? The ministers are about the only men who are heard clamoring for a compulsory Sunday law. Not, however, to make men religious. Oh, no; but they only want a civil Sunday law, to protect the day as a religious institution. So they say.

One clergyman in the city said: "A reaction is setting in, in favor of a God-fearing observance of Sunday." Another said: "But unfortunately the trains are moving, mails are being sent over the land, machinery is in motion, men are working incessantly, and we Christians are patronizing their employers." Which way is the reaction setting in? Is it a fact that the world is growing more in favor of a God-fearing observance of Sunday? and that with church members a reaction to patronize Sunday breaking institutions is setting in? It looks this way, according to these statements. It also looks as though the call for this Sunday rest law is to stop trains, the mails, etc., so that Sunday keepers cannot go on excursions or get the mails on the Lord's day. Are Christians so weak in moral character that a civil Sunday law must be enacted to remove all temptations, so they will not break the holy day? How much better would they be at heart if the Sunday trains were stopped, the post-offices and the gates of the baseball grounds closed, and all quiet within?

Again, it was said by a pastor of this city, in speaking on this question: "The world's health, both here and hereafter, depends upon it," and then added, "respect for the Sabbath is the beginning of a true regard for eternal things." Of course he was pleading for the law on a civil basis, with purely sanitary ends in view; but at the same time argued that it will work a true regard for eternal things, and then would not have us think for a moment that the law is to be enacted for the religious observance of the day, or especially in the interest of religion. Religion is a good thing to have, and everybody ought to have it, but no one wants any religion or religious institution forced upon him by law, openly or disguised. Such action would work injury to both parties.

Now let us look at it from the standpoint of physical rest. If a man must be compelled to rest one day in the week for his health, why not enact a law to this effect, allowing him to choose his own day? I will guarantee that there are thousands of people that can just as well rest on Saturday, and feel as fresh on Sunday morning to work, attend or play baseball, as they would to rest on Sunday and work or play on Monday. There are some in the Nation who observe the seventh day Sabbath, which they believe to be commanded by the Scriptures, and who would get just as much physical rest on that day as on Sunday. The work they perform on Sunday is just as civil as though it were performed on Monday. Why should work or recreation that is civil on Monday be considered uncivil when done on Sunday? It is not, and every minister in this world knows it is not. If a Sunday law is made and enforced it is because Sunday is regarded as the Lord's day, and the making of such a law would be legislating for the Lord, and can be nothing less than religious legislation. A civil Sunday rest law cannot be consistently argued from any other than a religious basis. The day is a religious institution, set apart for religious purposes by the Church; and when she calls for a civil law to protect a religious institution it is incompatible with reason, and the Church is overstepping the limits of her jurisdiction.
