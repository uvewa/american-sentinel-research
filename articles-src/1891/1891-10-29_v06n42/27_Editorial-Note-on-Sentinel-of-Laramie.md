On the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the Sentinel of Laramie, Wyoming, says:—

> We don't care very much about the matter, either way, and it is not likely anything we might say would have much influence in deciding it. . . . But it looks to us very like pharissical fanaticism that would close the Fair and open the saloons and beer gardens on Sunday. It is our private opinion that nine-tenths of those who would visit the great Exposition on Sunday—if they had a chance—would, if it is closed, put in their Sunday in a very much worse place. Anyhow, if we were running a saloon or a beer garden in Chicago, we would be in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday for fear it would, if open, attract our patrons away from us.

This is a sufficient answer to all the "civil" pleas made for Sunday closing. Of course it does not touch the religious phase of the question, which after all is the only phase there is to it; for were it not for the religious character of the day, nobody would want the Fair closed on Sunday, except it might possibly be the saloon-keepers.
