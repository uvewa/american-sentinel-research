"Compulsory Sunday Observance" was the subject discussed by the Rev. John R. Grow, of the Chicago Hyde Park Baptist Church, at his morning service, Oct. 18. True to the historic Baptist principle of complete separation of Church and State, he declared himself opposed to compulsory Sunday observance. The speaker traced our Sunday laws back to Constantine's famous law enforcing the observance of "the venerable day of the Sun," and stated that that law and subsequent Roman legislation touching Sunday observance, came as the result of spiritual dearth; that the Church shorn of the power of the gospel could not successfully cope with the circus and theater, and the power of the State was consequently invoked.

The speaker paid an eloquent tribute to the power of the gospel of Christ as opposed to legal compulsion in extending the influence and practice of religion, and declared that the laxity of Sunday observance in France was not the result of a laxity in Sunday laws, but the result of centuries of ecclesiastical corruption and tyranny; that the difference between the "continental Sunday" and the "American Sunday" was not a difference effected by civil legislation, but was the result of a difference in the spiritual life of the people.

Touching the Sunday closing of the World's Fair the speaker said the way to exhibit Christianity at the coming Exposition was not by means of a compulsory closing of the Fair, which would drive the people on excursions into the country, to the parks, or the saloons, but by presenting to our visitors a living Church whose vitality comes not from the State but from Christ, the living head of Christianity.
