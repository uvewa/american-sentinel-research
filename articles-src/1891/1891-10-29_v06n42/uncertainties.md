# Uncertainties Log - Volume 6, Number 42 (1891-10-29)

## General Notes

This OCR transcription from Mistral OCR was of good quality overall. Most content was clear and readable.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 4, "Politics and Religion" article
- **Issue:** The phrase "woven late the minds" appears in the text
- **Transcribed as:** "woven late the minds and lives of men"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "woven into the minds" - the original likely reads "into" rather than "late"

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association block
- **Issue:** Address listed as "13704 AND CASTRO STE."
- **Transcribed as:** "13704 AND CASTRO STE., OAKLAND, CAL."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** The "13704" seems unusual for a street address; this may be "1370½" or another format, but OCR rendered it as shown

### Page 6, National Religious Liberty Association block
- **Issue:** Name appears as "A. F. BALLLENGER" (three L's)
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. BALLLENGER"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This is clearly a typo in the original or OCR error; should be "BALLENGER" with two L's based on known author name

### Page 7, Advertisement text
- **Issue:** Unclear text "[INTERIAT GUEST ALAR]" in Atlas advertisement
- **Transcribed as:** "[INTERIAT GUEST ALAR]"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be severely corrupted OCR of a graphic or decorative text element; unable to determine original text

### Page 7, Advertisement
- **Issue:** "Tats is one of the most" at beginning of Siberia book ad
- **Transcribed as:** "Tats is one of the most"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Should likely be "This is one of the most" - appears to be OCR error

### General OCR Quality
- The OCR successfully captured the overall content
- Some advertisements and decorative elements were unclear
- Main article text was generally accurate and readable
