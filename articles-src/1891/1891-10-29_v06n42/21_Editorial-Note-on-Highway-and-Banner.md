THE Highway and Banner, a paper devoted to the subject of "holiness," published in Des Moines, Ia., heads an article on Judge Hammond's decision in the King case, "A Needed Legal Decision." In a short editorial in the same paper the editor exhorts his brethren not to break camp, when leaving their camp meetings, "on the Sabbath." He says, "If we are a holy people we ought to keep the Sabbath holy, and give the enemy no occasion to complain." How shall we interpret the Banner on this Sunday question? Does the Banner find that those who are now "holy" still persist in not keeping "the Sabbath holy"? And so to give the appearance of holiness to those who are holy, it is necessary to have a "needed legal decision" to compel holiness in those who are holy? Or is the Banner so holy that it is entirely different from the long-suffering Heavenly Father, and so wants to crush the refractory sinner by civil law without bearing with him any longer? Or is the Banner aware of the fact that King had observed one day as the Sabbath, and in working on Sunday was following out his honest convictions; and knowing these things is it so intolerant that it will not accord to others the rights of conscience that it asks for itself?
