THE workingmen of Minneapolis recently adopted a resolution protesting against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and demanding "that the board of managers shall refrain from any action that will shut out workingmen from the Fair on the day which, under existing conditions, is the only available one for them and their families."
