Russia is not left entirely without a witness for religious liberty. One of the greatest writers of Russia has just published a short disquisition on "The Relations of Church and State," which shows that the connection of religion with the Government—the so-called "Christian nation" idea—is not only opposed by Christians in America, but by Christians in Russia as well. It would be well for those who are clamoring for laws to show that this is a "Christian nation," to read and ponder what is said by one who knows what it is to have such laws put into practical operation. His article appeared in the April number of the London Fortnightly Review, and after speaking of those who have themselves once been oppressed, he said:—

"Can anything be more incomprehensible than the fact that the class thus proscribed and persecuted and hounded to death, should, as soon as an opportunity offers, go and do likewise, anathematizing, torturing, slaying every refractory man and woman upon whom it can lay hands without reasonable fear of speedy reprisals, and that a third category of persons should imitate the second, a fourth should vie with the third, and so on without end? And all of them solemnly curse, cruelly maim and mutilate, ruthlessly slaughter each other in the name of the principle that all men should believe as they believe, and not otherwise. . . .

"What motives, desires, necessity, can there be to impel me to insist that any person whatever should express his truth, his relations to the Deity, in precisely the same terms as I do? I cannot force him to change his belief by means of violence, cunning, or fraud (pseudo-miracles). If his faith be his very life, and the proposition is one from which it is impossible to withhold our assent, how should I seriously think of depriving him of it, and proposing to give him another in its stead? As well might I take out his heart, and amicably offer to put another and a better one in its place. Action of that kind would be feasible if the man's faith and mine were mere words and not the solid basis of our lives, an excrescence on the body, and not the living, palpitating heart within.

"But such interference is also impossible for another reason: it is not feasible to deceive a man or compel him to believe in that in which he does not believe; because he who believes (i. e., he who has already determined and regulated his relations to God, and consequently perceives that faith is the relation of each man to God) cannot wish to determine the relations of another man to God by means of violence and fraud. This, I maintain, is impossible; and yet to all seeming it is precisely what is being done now, and was always and everywhere practiced in bygone times.

"Let me explain; it is impossible, and therefore cannot be done; but something extremely similar has been and still is being perpetrated. What really takes place and has for long ages past been continually taking place is this: people force upon their fellow-men a semblance of faith which the latter, much against their will, accept; this likeness, however, is but a counterfeit. Real faith cannot be forced upon any one, nor can its acceptance by others be the result of extrinsic considerations, such as violence, fraud, or lucre. What people propagate by means of violence and accept from fear or cupidity is not faith, but faith's counterfeit, and this counterfeit was the old condition of the life of humanity.

"The notion of the true Church was also occasionally made use of as an argument against those who dissented; but down to the reign of Constantine and the meeting of the Nicene Council it was still a mere notion and had not got beyond this embryonic stage of its evolution. From the time of Constantine and the Nicene Council, however, it became hardened and crystallized into a thing—a thing of fraud.

"The causes that led to this deception were of an evil nature. 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' They consisted of hatred, human pride, hostility to Arius and others, and an evil incomparably greater than any of these? the unholy alliance of Christians with the temporal power. Constantine, the Emperor, who personified that power, and had attained at that time—according to Pagan notions—the summit of human greatness (he was enrolled among the gods), embraced Christianity, gave an example to all his subjects, converted the people, lent a helping hand against heretics, and by means of an ecumenical council built up a 'united, true Christian faith.' In this wise the Christian Catholic faith was fixed for all times and countries.

"It was so natural to allow oneself to be thus imposed upon that even at the present day people continue to believe in the salutary effects of that momentous event. And yet, interpreted by the light of simple reason unclouded by theological prejudices, the effect of it all was that the majority of Christians there and then abjured their faith. It was the epoch of the parting of the waters, when the rank and file of Christianity turned round from right to left, and moved off in the direction of Paganism. Charlemagne and Vladimir rallied the stragglers later on; and the people have continued to march steadily in the same direction ever since. The ecclesiastical fraud consisted in the adoption of Christianity by the temporal power, an act which was desirable and useful only to those who, understanding the letter of Christianity, failed to comprehend its spirit. For to embrace Christianity without first renouncing the temporal power, is either to deride the doctrines of Christ or to falsify them. The consecration of the power of the State by Christianity is blasphemy; nay, it is more than blasphemy,—it is the ruin of Christianity itself.

"Having lived fifteen hundred years under this sacrilegious union between pseudo-Christianity and the State, it needs no slight effort on the part of mankind to forget all the specious sophisms by means of which, during that protracted period, the teachings of Christ have been garbled and twisted and contorted for the purpose of fabricating arguments to prove the legality and sanctity of the State and the possibility of its becoming truly Christian. But underneath these heaps of sophisms lies the hard fact that the words 'Christian State' have about as much meaning as the words 'warm' or 'hot ice.' Only one of two alternatives is possible: either there is no State or else there is no Christianity.

"Putting on one side the history of all other nations, let us cast a glance at the history of that State which was the first to make an alliance with Christianity. In Rome a nest of highwaymen had come to be established in the course of time, of men who throve on the proceeds of robbery, murder, violence of all kinds, and had become so powerful that they subdued whole nations. These robbers and their progeny, led by ringleaders commonly called Cesars, plundered and tortured the population in order to glut their lusts and passions. One of the heirs of these robber-chieftans, Constantine by name, having read a large number of books and cloyed his passions with life's pleasures, came to the conclusion that he preferred certain Christian dogmas to his former beliefs, the mass to human sacrifice, and one God and his Son Christ to the worship of Jupiter, Venus, and Apollo; and he accordingly issued orders that his faith be introduced and spread among the people under his sway.

"'Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them . . . but it shall not be so among you.' Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; judge not; resist not evil. There was no one to call his attention to these teachings; but what was said to him by those whose duty it was to accentuate the main doctrines of Christ, practically amounted to this: 'You wish to call yourself a Christian, and to continue at the same time to be a robber chief, to strike, burn, go to war, live lewdly, slay, and repose elegantly in the lap of luxury? All this is feasible enough.'"

"And they adjusted Christianity to his wants and wishes, arranging it far more pleasantly than could have been expected. They were sagacious enough, however, to foresee that when reading the gospel he would, sometime or other, become painfully aware of what the new faith does really demand of all men who embrace it, viz., a Christian life, and not merely the construction of churches and frequent visits to them. This they anticipated and duly provided for by adding to and abstracting from Christianity in such an ingenious way that he might continue to call himself a Christian, to live as a Pagan, and not perceive that there was any contradiction between his profession and his acts. On the one hand, Christ, it was clear, had come solely for the purpose of redeeming him and all men; and, on the other hand, the fact that Christ had died gave Constantine the right to live in harmony with his tastes; nay, more, he had only to repent and swallow a morsel of bread and wine, and behold he had salvation in his clutches, and everything was forgiven him.

"Nor was this all. They actually blessed and consecrated his power and influence as robber chief, declared that it was from God, and anointed him with oil. In acknowledgment of this he, on his part, arranged to their liking the gathering of the clergy, he decreed the nature of each individual's relations to God, and ordered the decree to be read over and repeated to each man for his guidance. And every one was satisfied, and the faith thus trimmed and arranged has prevailed on earth for more than a thousand years.

"The main question is the evolution of the deceivers, the pseudo-Christians. We find, then, that they degenerated from what they were or might have been, in consequence of their unnatural union with the brigands. It could not be otherwise, for they left the right road from the moment that they consecrated the first king and assured him that by using violence he could assist the faith whose essence lies in meekness, self-denial, and endurance of evil.

"All this is not the story of a fantastic church, but of the real church such as it has been ever since its hierarchy fell under the power of kings and Czars; and its history is made up of a long series of vain efforts on the part of this unfortunate hierarchy to preserve the truth of Christ's doctrine intact, while preaching it by means of lies and deviating from it by their acts. The significance, the raison d'etre of the hierarchy is founded upon that of the doctrine which they undertake to teach. This doctrine speaks of meekness, of self-denial, of love, of poverty; and is preached and propagated by means of violence and lies.

"In order that something should be left for the members of their hierarchy to teach, it was absolutely necessary for them to hold fast to (i. e., not formally repudiate) the doctrine of Christ, but in order, on the other hand, to be in a position to whitewash themselves and their illegal union with the temporal power, they were forced to resort to the most ingenious devices to hide the essence of that doctrine, and for this purpose deliberately shifted its center of gravity from the essence to the outward form and expression. And this was done by the hierarchy, i. e., one of the sources of that counterfeit faith which is preached by the Church. The source itself is the union of the hierarchy, under the name of Church, with that form of violence known as temporal power. And the reason why people are so eager to teach their faith to others is because the true faith would convict them of apostasy; hence, they seek to set up a concocted creed of their own in its place, the sole advantage of which is that it acquits them of all crime.

"Now true religion may be present anywhere, everywhere; except, of course, where manifestly false religion holds sway over men; that is to say, when the faith which is allied with violence—the State religion—prevails. Thus all so-called schisms and heresies may be in possession of the true faith, whereas of a certainty it will not be discovered in the creed that is united with the temporal power. It may appear paradoxical, but it is none the less true that the appellations, "Orthodox," "Catholic," "Protestant" faith, as these words are used in every-day language, mean neither more nor less than religion allied with the temporal power, mean State creeds, and therefore false religions.

"From the time of the Nicene Council, called together by the Emperor . . . being united with the temporal power, it [the self-styled church] began to act like that power, and it is a proven fact that every form of religion that ever allied itself with the secular power ceased by that same act of alliance to be a religion, and became a fraud."
