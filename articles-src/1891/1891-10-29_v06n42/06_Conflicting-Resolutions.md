J. S. S. COLVIN, *Offering*, reporting in the *United Presbyterian* of September 24th, says, the meeting of the Kansas Synod at its last communication, says:—

This year, as last, the Kansas Synod met in Emporia, Citizens, and there were taken from a full session on Christian education and the following was reported. The following, on the subject of the times was adopted:—

1. Let us as a synod, while other churches, both higher and lower in matters of faith and reputation, stand by the old Bible and vindicate its God-given, infallible authority on all subjects.

2. Let us stand for the old Bible in matters of morals.

3. Let us as a synod stand by our Christian Sabbath and fight the running of all Sunday trains.

Now, by the adoption of the second resolution, they mean that they will be earnest in their effort to have civil laws against the enforcement of the observance of Sunday. But in their first resolution they propose to "stay by the old Bible" and promulgate its teachings in a way "that wisdom may be justified of her children."

Now the question arises with this observation: If they really have taken upon the great convention of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, held some time ago, is already bearing fruit, not only in the matter of the resolution to close the World's Fair on Sunday, but, as we have expected, in favor of Sunday, both of it in general. The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor of Detroit, through its Recording Secretary, has addressed several imperative circulars to the Mayors and Councils of large cities in that city, and suggesting that it be given an airing in the local press, both as a compulsory, and compel preservation.

But suppose the youth little thought that they were putting so strong and so complete a request for the propagation of error and the establishment of a truly ecclesiastical to this control of the gospel. Christ's was their first mission to publish the gospel.

The County Court of Green County, Ky., has assessed $100 and costs, against the Louisville and Nashville and Nashville Railroad Company, for the violation of the Sunday law, by labor done in the repairing of tracks on Sunday; and the Frankfort Court of Appeals, Oct. 15, affirmed the judgment. It is a significant fact that the majority of the prosecutions under religious laws in the southern States, and that the vote of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Fair in favor of Sunday closing would have gone largely the other way had it not been for the Southern members. Sens Small and W. F. Crafts also speak beautifully of the attitude of the southern States upon the Sunday question as being unconquerable for a strict enforcement. Why is this? Have these States, which are now so ready to persecute and prosecute, been the cradle in which has been bred and from which has gone forth to the world an intelligent, broad, evangelical, Christian spirit in greater degree than from other communities which are slower in appeal to the civil law to enforce their religious beliefs? In this, so, or it is not? And if it is, or if not, what does the fact teach?
