CIVIL society rests upon a social compact between individuals, human beings establishing between themselves the conditions of a law for being, and making the impulses of their common nature . . . goal, as well as a moral and intellectual soul. It is the organized . . . based on the civil, as well as a moral and intellectual impulse him toward political society. He enters his compact for . . . purposes which contain not only moral acts, but depend, for their highest development, upon association with the believer, and with this the social requirements is not justified and at certain points defined advantages are exclusively set forth for Christian instruction, and with these provisions he expects, and he attains the highest efficiency for the promulgation and the development of the individual relations of each other.

There is a sense, indeed, in which the Christian may view the civil government with interest and advantage to exchange in those advantages which accrue to him because a citizen in compact with his fellows. But this advantage comes from the compact; and such concession can not only secure a gain, but sacrifice the Christian principle, if its highest advantage, that of Christian liberty, is forfeited.

The obligation of a society, then, is in the direction of the highest development of its individual members; and the methods of civilization progress are not toward the incorporation of civil power, but toward the better establishing and perfecting of it.

Only in this freely associated character of the civil society is a social compact between men setting a free, full social and moral, beings, and so far as they are Christians so be they. And the idea of forming all governments for the benefit of the governed, and the highest of all interests, that civil society becomes more and more authoritative in the true sense of that word, and more and more sacred, with all social advancement, the preservation of civil liberty.—*S. S. Harris, L.L.D., Bishop of Michigan.*

THE basis of the State in the moral province as recognition that the basis of the Church is supernatural, the province of the Church in the interest of the spiritual. The State and the Church can never of right having anything at all to do with the State, and the State can never of right have anything to do with the Church except as it has to do with any and all bodies and associations of men.
