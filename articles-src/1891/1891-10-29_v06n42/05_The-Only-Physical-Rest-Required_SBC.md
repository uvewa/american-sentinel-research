It is a notable fact for all that is said about Sunday rest being so much needed for the post-resting man, but, for laboring men are putting forth strenuous efforts to obtain it, or are heard in the letter-field championship. If they are undergoing an Egyptian bondage, as would occur in the States from the claims of need, indeed seems strange that their cries and groundings should be heard. If they are seriously oppressed would not the labor organizations exhort for to-day, just as they are, as they have for higher wages and shorter days? The ministers are about the only men who have been clamoring for a compulsory Sunday law. Not, however, to make men religious. Oh, no, but they may enact a civil Sunday law, to protect the day as a religious institution. So they say.

One clergyman in the city said: "A resolution is setting it, in favor of a God-fearing observance of Sunday." Another said: "But unfortunately the trains are moving, mails are being sent over the land, machinery is in motion, men are working incessantly, and we Christians are participating in every way, and in what way is the reaction setting in? Is it fact that mankind is being allowed to prove to have a God-fearing observance of Sunday?" and this which church members are scrutinizing to permit Sunday breaking institutions is setting in? It looks this way, according to these statements. It also looks as though the call for this Sunday rest law is to Sunday law experts cannot go so far as to get the man the Saints of the Lord's day. Are Christians so weak in moral character that a civil Sunday law must be enacted to remove all temptation, so that they will not keep the holy day? How much better would they not be healed if the Sunday trains were stopped, the post-offices and the game and must not think us unkind for them and quit whilst?

Again, it was said by a pastor of this city, in speaking on this question: "The world's Columbian Exposition to be closed on Sunday," and then added, "respect for the Sabbath is the beginning of a true regard for eternal things." Of course he was pleading for the law on a civil basis, but with purely secular ends in view, but at the same time argued that it is both a true regard for eternal things, and then must not have us think for a moment that the law is to be enacted for so the religious observance of the day, or especially to the interest of religion. Religion is a good thing to have, and everybody ought to observe it, but in no manner may any person or religious institutions forced upon him by law, openly or disregard. Such action would work injury to both parties.

Now let us look at it from the standpoint of physical rest. If a man must be compelled to rest one day in the week for health, why not make a law to this effect, allowing him to choose his own day of rest? There are many thousands of persons that feel just as well on Saturday, and feel as fresh on Sunday morning to be worked, attend to play baseball, as they would to rest on Sunday and work or play on Monday. There are those in the Nation who observe the seventh day Sabbath, which they believe to be commanded by the Scriptures, and who attend to their religious duties on that day on Sunday. The work they perform on Sunday is just as civil as though it were performed on Monday. Why should work or recreation that is civil on Monday be considered criminal when done on Sunday? It is not, and every minister in this world knows it is not. If Sunday law is made and enforced it is not in the interest of rest, or the Lord's day, and the making of such a law would be legislating for the Lord, and is nothing less than religious legislation. A civil Sunday rest law cannot be consistently urged upon any other than a religious basis. That day is a religious institution of the Church; and when she asks for a civil law in the interest of religion it is incompatible with reason, and the Church is overstepping the limits of her jurisdiction.—*H. E.* in the *Indiana Farmer*.

If they would only do that, they would not be threatened with destroying heresy and damnation, nor would they apply to the State to have all the people compelled to observe Sunday, or resort to the civil law to compel rest and worship on Sunday in the name of the "fourth commandment," for they would have the law of God with the fourth commandment, and the seventh day with it, written in their hearts, and would enjoy it because they loved it.
