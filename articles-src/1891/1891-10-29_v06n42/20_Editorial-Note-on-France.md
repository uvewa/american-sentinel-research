THE movement for Sunday rest continues to gain ground in France. The managers of a large porcelain manufactory at Limoges, a plate-glass works at St. Gobain, and a milling establishment at Puanos, have voluntarily relieved their employes of the Sunday work previously required of them.

The methods employed in so called "Atheistic France" to secure Sunday rest seem to be in marked contrast to those used by the Sabbath Union and Law and Order Leagues of "Christian America." So far it would appear that, if the National Reform theory is correct and a nation is a person with a religious responsibility, then, France, according to the teachings of the gospel, is much nearer the kingdom of heaven than the United States.

The unchristian theory of Sunday observance enforced by the civil law has probably a greater number of enthusiastic supporters in the United States to-day than in all the rest of the world together. That fact is an evidence of what may be expected in this country in reference to the entire body of religious forms professed by the majority of the citizens.
