THE action taken upon the Sunday question at the great convention of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, held at Minneapolis some time ago, is already bearing fruit, not only in the line of organized influence to secure the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, but, as was to have been expected, in favor of Sunday closing, by law, in general. The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, of Detroit, through its President and Secretary, has addressed several imperative requests to the Mayor and Chief of Police there, desiring them to undertake the enforcement of the Sunday laws in that city, and suggesting that if it is not done by the authorities they will themselves bring complaint, and compel prosecution.

The originators of this organized Christian effort among the youth little thought that they were preparing so strong and so zealous an agent for the propagation of error and the establishment of a civil ecclesiasticism in the place of the gospel of Christ, which it was their first mission to publish and practice.
