In the last issue of THE SENTINEL reference was made to the sitting of the Second Ecumenical Methodist Conference, at Washington, D. C., and to the fact that much interest would attach to the action taken by the Conference on the religio-political questions which would be brought before it.

The subject of memorializing the World's Fair Commissioners in regard to the Sunday closing of the Exposition was called up and subsequently referred to a committee of six which brought in a report embodied in a series of seven resolutions unqualifiedly petitioning the Commissioners to "prevent the proposed opening of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Lord's day;" and presenting this memorial to them as representing the voice of "the Methodist Churches throughout the world." The resolutions are reported as having been unanimously adopted and no hint is given of any discussion on the legal, civil, and constitutional questions involved in thus enforcing a religious rest by civil law upon all the world at the World's Fair.
