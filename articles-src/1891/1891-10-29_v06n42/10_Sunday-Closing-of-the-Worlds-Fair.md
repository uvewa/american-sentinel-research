In the last issue of THE SENTINEL, reference was made to the sitting of the Second Ecumenical Methodist Conference at Washington, D. C., and to the fact that much interest would attach to the action taken by the Conference on the religious-political questions which would be brought before it.

The Methodist of memorializing the World's Fair Commissioners in regard to the day, the Sunday closing of the Exposition was called up and subsequently referred to a committee of six which brought in a report embodied in a series of seven resolutions urging especially petitioning the Commissioners to "prevent the proposed opening of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Lord's day," and presenting this memorial to the Methodist Churches throughout the world." The resolutions are reputed as having been unanimously adopted and no hint is given of any dissension on the legal, civil, and constitutional questions involved in thus enforcing a religious rest by civil law upon all the at the World's Fair.

The People's Trade and Labor Party, at a meeting held in Chicago, has recommended the World's Fair Commissioners asking that the Fair be opened on Sunday at half rate for admission; and some of the series of resolutions show that some of the reasons given for asking that the Fair be closed Sundays are distasteful to the workingmen. These resolutions read as follows:—

> *Whereas,* in the interest of the working classes, a most of certain so called and self-alleged Christian party of workingmen in general, that "Competent" of the legislative formula would "make and keep the Sabbath."
>
> *Resolved,* That we hereby declare to those rising in power, of all political parties, that closing the Fair Sunday will only add to the pleasures of a few, and be a denial of the rights of the many.

An action taken upon this question with the great convention of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, held some time ago, is already bearing fruit, not only in the matter of the resolution to close the World's Fair on Sunday, but, as we have expected, in favor of Sunday, both of it in general. The Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor of Detroit, through its Recording Secretary, has addressed several imperative circulars to the Mayors and Councils of large cities in that city, and suggesting that it be given an airing in the local press, both as a compulsory, and compel preservation.

This movement for Sunday rest continues to gain ground in France. The managers of a large printing manufactory at Limoges, a plate-glass works at St. Gobain, and a milling establishment at Tours have voluntarily relieved their employes of the Sunday work previously required of them. The methods employed are so called "Adventist" persuasion. . . . So far it would appear that, if the American Reform interest is to cover and is aimed to a person with a religious responsibility, then, France, according to the tendencies of its people, in much nearer the kingdom of heaven than the United States.

The intolerance theory of Sunday observance enforced to the civil law has probably a greater number of enthusiast supporters in the United States to-day than in all the rest of the world combined. Any reference to this country in reference to the actual existing in this country in reference to the entire question of forced religion by the majority of the citizens.

The *Hoffnung und Banner*, a paper devoted to the subject of "Adventist," publishes in Des Moines, Ill., leads an article on Judge Hammond's decision in the King case. Having reproduced some of the short editorial in the same paper the editor exhorts his readers, to be faithful in attending all the divine meetings, "on the Sabbath . . . He says: 'The fact is this—the Sunday is the Pope's day, not the holy and give the money to continue in demand a question! Does the honest man think that those who observe Sunday in keeping what is called an institution? The fact that religion is the institution of those who are holy? Or is the enforcement of being with their families upon that one day, their Heavenly Father, and we wants to crush the refusing to work on Sunday religious law enforcement longer? Or is the dissenter aware of the fact that King had had used their influence in the dark? and in working on Sunday was following out an inherent principle. His assertion that he was so intolerant that it will not accord to others the same privileges it claims for itself.'"

The American Sabbath Union, and the National Reform Association, have been bewailing the fact that Sunday papers are read by Church members in Michigan. But the ground has at last been taken to combat the evil. Papers have been established and several places in that locality, and visiting. And of it moreover looking beyond Lyons, and organized a local union to send in promoting the work thereby stated.

The efforts of these organizations are precisely the same as those of the church in the early days, in the Middle Ages, when the Church was mistress of Europe.
