THE very use of the terms, "American Sabbath," "national," "Christian Sabbath," etc., is a confession that the institutions described by them is distinct from the Sabbath. The Bible knows only one Sabbath.

The municipal corporations of Illinois and Panama has adopted Sunday closing regulation, "following the example of other Christian countries," as the *Chicago* narrator narrates. The Isthmus of Panama, this has become a Christian country, and should receive official recognition from the National Reform Association.

THE Sunday agitators confidently expect to secure from the Fifty-third Congress some substantial recognition of Sunday sacredness; something that can at last be plead as a precedent for still more religious legislation and governmental meddling in questions with which the founders of our political system supposed they had forever left with the individual conscience.

THERE is reason to believe that the motion now setting with Mr. Crafts presumes to serve upon his country, will prove to be a concerted action on the part of the "Body of Congress" which has been organizing all over the United States, that system of secret committees and picked spies makes this feasible. Their capacity to be useful is being extended to-day by the ability of their Loyola.

The *Christian Press*, an advocate of Sunday laws and their right enforcement, recently said: "Civilization may be forced upon us, but conversion will never be." To this he responded saying:

That paragraph has the good old gospel ring. Then why enforce Sunday observance? Christians should be in favor of the sentiment of Christ's example of the true Christian, in keeping with it with his might. *Enforced* Sunday observance is not Christian Sunday observance. The *Press* can see the one; why can it not see the other just as clearly?

The question that raised by THE SENTINEL is answered by the *Colorado Sun* in these words:

> Because it [the *Christian Press*] is blinded by its consideration. It wraps dignified authority over them, but it takes no post in a national faith. A first or dominant Baptist or a denomination against. It would persecute all other religious dogmas to enrich it. It is opposed to the freedom and the rights of the individual, and no doubt religion in the perverseness of Mr. W. H. King, of Tennessee, who insisted for plowing his field on the first day of the week consequently sighed Sunday, after having carefully and devoutly observed the seventh of the week as the Sabbath, as directed by Ed. 31. Away with your hypocrisy and your assumed self-love? I brand THE SENTINEL the allowed.

And that is about the view of the question generally taken by the unbiased secular press. True religion gains nothing by attempted coercion. The spirit of the gospel is as opposed to force every effort, but the bigot knows it.

In the last issue of THE SENTINEL, reference was made to the sitting of the Second Ecumenical Methodist Conference at Washington, D. C., and to the fact that much interest would attach to the action taken by the Conference on the religious-political questions which would be brought before it.

The Kansas City correspondence, or the *Pittsburg* paper claims that although, the laws of the State are admittedly adapted to the conditions of Christian yesterday, yet the officers positively refuse to enforce them.

In a recent sermon in Batavia, Ill., the minister, Rev. George W. Morrison said— the Sunday newspaper is a far more greater evil than the Sunday work. It is not a matter of the rodent's measure; the position is that of the rodent judges that it is not as—it is the Sunday paper, for why is it because the paper comes only once. He says— "If the Sunday workers want the Sunday why is it not that this minister think the Sunday paper worse than the Sunday advices." The answer is not far to seek: the Sunday paper keeps people from church, but who would probably go to it, is not for the paper; they read the paper and sat "the rest makes ones in a hundred of those of the request themselves on Sunday would go to church if the saloon were shut up. The Sunday paper is the foe of the Sunday sermon. It has broken down the Sunday institution by offering greater attractions than the sermon."

On the question of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the *Sentinel* of Laramie, Wyoming, says:—

> We don't want any trouble from outside either way, and it is not thing anything we might say can have much influence on that question. But it looks to our very its phenomenal festivities on the question ought not to compel people to do as other gains on Sunday. It is our private opinion that they will not be able to keep close the Exposition on Sunday—if they had a class— they might be able to do it. But if they are satisfied to do nothing on the part of people who want to visit the Exposition worship place. Anyhow, if we were running the Exposition we should vote for no opening in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday if it would draw 1,000 if there were any possibility.

This is a sufficient answer to all the "civil" pleas made for Sunday closing, of course it does not touch the religious pleas of the ministers; but after all it is the only pleas the matter is for; for we as not for the religious character of the day, nobody would want the Fair closed on Sunday, nor would they want a law to close it.

It is in book, "Sabbath for Man," by Dr. Crafts. . . . It is not to such suffice it by contemplation the man, and we may reasonably say that at this period the duty. He can not his shop; he can on refuse to lest this congregation and his faith for receiving a little Christian fellowship to come forth. It may obey the Gospels so. But him on the other hand there are the proper functions for himself to sacrifice. . . . That he close his shop and refuse to work. When he . . . authority to satisfy the idle: his interest merely to believe.
