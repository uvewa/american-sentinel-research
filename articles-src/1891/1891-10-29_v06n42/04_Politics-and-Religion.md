The foregoing groping for a sure method, Col. Geo. W. Bain, a leading prohibitionist and temperance worker, is credited with the following, in the *Organ-Grinder*, *Indianapolis, Ind.*, of September 17:—

> I know it is a saying we are carrying on,—you mix temperance with politics; and yet the man who now make our cry: go to the polls and vote for politics needed in beer and whisky. It is a strange contradiction to say you can mix politics with all evil in government; and you cannot mix it with all good in government. The argument is:—"mix of Church and State;" and yet the same set join the polls and vote for union of that same. Christian men have joined in these very evil movements, they have the object of this government that created to keep silence on all political concerns. He can vote for the right man, the merchant and banker; but not to the voter. If and if tomorrow suggest that; but if another kind for the man he knows will serve the kingdom—the churches it is none of the minister's business. But this evil knows no free right that the man must just turn his vote right. He can set them up for good government but he must not tell votes for or great candidates of any political measure. These same men know of his ministers pray "Thy kingdom come; pray 'give us our day our daily bread;' and then, pray 'deliver us from evil;' and vote for the promotion of evil, and still settle the question of religion and politics. The result is a man can vote for nothing on earth; the executive votes of this. What is in a in a church conference, whether high or low, is an enormous of reform; and all politics is the former.

Mr. Bain seems to have the idea thoroughly fixed in his mind that the minister is the only one in the community that knows just how a man should vote. And so long as our Government holds to its principles of freedom the clergy will not be allowed to dictate how we shall cast our ballot. The clerical assent to want to force the matter right into church; to have the minister tell his members just how the church wants them to vote; and to comply, "cast them out of the synagogue." If such a plan as that is to be followed, why have any election at all? Why not just let the ministers manage things?

Those of us who are Christians believe it fully that "Almighty God is the source of all power in government." But has not even God himself in his wisdom declared that certain things belong to Caesar, or the civil government? And has he not always followed the precepts that "What avail" wrote "the powers that be are ordained of God." The powers he has entrusted to purely civil powers; and instead of taking the Church or the minister or the bishop, what the State should do, we often do the early faith. The morality of the State cannot possibly rise higher than the morality of the people. And if the minister gives himself wholly to the interest of religion. Religion is a good thing to have, and everybody ought to observe it, but in no manner may any person or religious institutions forced upon him by law, openly or disregard. Such action would work injury to both parties.
