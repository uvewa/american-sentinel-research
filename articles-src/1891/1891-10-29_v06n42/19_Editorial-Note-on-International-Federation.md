THE organization of associations for the furtherance of legislation to secure the observance of Sunday has gone so far that there is an "International Federation of Lord's Day Societies," with an office in London. The Secretary of this Federation publishes a circular stating that in Austria Sunday newspapers, and Monday morning papers as well, have been prohibited, because of the Sunday labor necessary to their publication. This is consistent; for if the Sunday newspaper is an evil the Monday morning newspaper is a much greater evil; but with what jealousy the Sunday Unionists and National Reformers must view Austria becoming a Christian nation, according to their definition, in advance of the United States. However, the National Reformers are doing their best to secure the necessary centralization of power in this country to enable them to despotically enact all the religious laws they wish; and when they have done this they will not be behind any Old World despotism in rendering the formal observances of religion compulsory.
