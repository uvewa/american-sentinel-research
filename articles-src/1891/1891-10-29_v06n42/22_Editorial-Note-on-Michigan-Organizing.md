THE American Sabbath Union, and the National Reform Association have been bewailing the fact that they have not, as yet, succeeded in organizing in Michigan. But the ground has at last been broken. Mr. Crafts has recently spoken in Hillsdale and several places in that vicinity, and organized local unions. Rev. Francis W. Ware, one of the field secretaries of the Union, is also busy in this line of work. On Tuesday, Oct. 9, he spoke in Lyons, and organized a local union, and is still prosecuting the work elsewhere. The vigorous and persistent efforts of these organizations should open the eyes of the people to the work being done to bind the State under the decrees of the Church. The efforts of these organizations are precisely the same as the work that led to the prosecutions of the Middle Ages, when the Church was mistress of the State.
