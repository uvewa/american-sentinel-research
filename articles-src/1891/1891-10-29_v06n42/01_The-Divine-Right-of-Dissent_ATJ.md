No man can ever of right make his religion the basis of any plea for governmental favor, nor the ground of any complaint of governmental discrimination. If there is no temporal good in the religion to pay him for professing it then there is not enough to pay the government for giving any legal notice of it in any way.

Sunday laws, and the whole line of religious legislation which goes in the same category, are alien to the letter of American institutions. They are a survival of the English Church Establishment, and should have existed, after the birth of this Republic, no more than the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the Constitution, no more than the laws governing the count of livings, and the maintenance of the Church of England. They have rightly no more place in the life of the Republic than the mere regulation of the royal succession.

This series of religious conventions which have been planned to be held during the World's Fair in Chicago will, if they are carried out as projected, be the most widespread in the observation of masses of any kind that was ever inaugurated by man. In the estimation of the different religions intended to be observed by these meetings is mentioned that of making "prominent the value of the weekly rest day on religious and other grounds;" and the *Christian Statesman*, in commenting upon this, says that "the most impressive lesson as to the influence and the value of religion would be the closing of the Exposition itself on the Sabbath." The fact is that its enforced closing which is here meant would prove just the contrary, namely, that the "influence and value of religion" had been insufficient to cause the establishment and right-intent to observe a religious rest day. And the very fact that the hand of the law had been called in to enforce a religious idea would prove to the world the weakness of true religion and conscientious principle.

**The Divine Right of Dissent.**

In the entries which have so far been given from Judge Hammond's dictum upon the subject of freedom of religious belief, there has been no recognition whatever, of the right of the individual to differ from the majority in any question of religious belief or observance; no recognition of the right of any individual to think for himself religiously, to believe according to convictions of his own conscience, or to worship according to his belief, if such things do disagree with the religious ideas of the majority, or dissents from the religious observance demanded by the majority. There is no recognition of any right of dissent—it has been particularly selected for the purpose of making this feature especially prominent. Indeed, no need to state it; necessary, because this is the prominent feature of the whole discussion. There is no recognition of any such thing in the whole course of the Judge's argument. And the sources from which this discussion comes, will justify me in pursuing further a little further, exactly that such is the nature of the discussion throughout.

This characteristic of the discussion is made the more prominent too, by the fact that the Judge holds constantly that Sunday is a religious institution, and its observance is essentially religious observance. He gives no countenance whatever [page 330] to the protests that has recently been made considerable of by the Sunday-law advocates, that it is "the economical value of the day of rest, and not the religious character which they would preserve by civil law." His statement as to the nature of Sunday observance is as follows:—

> Sunday observance is essentially a part of that system of religious ordinance which it is impossible to rid our laws of.

This again utterly ignores the fact that according to American principles enunciated both in the Constitution of Tennessee and the United States Constitution, religious observance can never rightly be made a part of the laws, nor any religious recognized by the laws. The supreme law of the United States declares in so many words, that "the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion." And the Supreme Court of Tennessee declares that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

Further, this statement is, just as far as it is possible for Judge Hammond's authority to go, material that by it he himself declares that the observers of Sunday have not only secured the aid of the civil law but continue to hold it in every just ground for religious expression, and in spite of the progress which has been made in the acknowledgment of the civil rights of each. The Judge therefore knows that Sunday legislation is religious legislation, and that the enforcement of Sunday observance is the enforcement of a religious observance. We also know, also, that this is contrary to the individual freedom of religious belief, and that it is contrary to the principle of absolute separation of Church and State; for he says only that this "sort of factitious advantages" which the observers of Sunday have secured in the control of the civil law is "in spite of the change of religious freedom, and in spite of the progress" made.

But as we have seen, he sanctions this perfunctious action of the Sunday observers, and thus justifies the sanction in the following words:—

> Civil or religious freedom may short of its fulness be claimed by dissenters only. Government knows the warning not to enforce an establishment of religion, nor to abridge full freedom in its practice. There is no political freedom which is a sham. Dissent may annoy any man who has not bid a state religion by his works of the majority,—which fairly interpreted is any *free* from which no neutral escape in the name of equal rights can be clearly shown.

It may be indeed that men may have been as full now as formerly justly dissatisfied at nothing of the majority in matters of religion. Yet it is entirely true that no such requirement ever has been, or ever can be, just. It is entirely true that neither civil nor religious freedom can ever stop short of the logic in any question of religious belief or religious observance.

Religious belief is a matter which rests solely in the individual. Religion relates to man's relationship to God, and it is man's personal relationship of faith and obedience, of belief and observance toward God. Every man has therefore the personal, individual, and inalienable right to believe for himself in religious things. And this carries with it the same personal, individual and inalienable right of freedom from and every other phase of religious belief that is held by anybody on earth.

This right is recognized and declared by Jesus Christ, not only in the words which he has commanded every man to believe or God that which is told, or whatever to Godward,— but likewise in the following words: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."

The word which Christ spoke was the Word of God. The one who is to judge, who can judge, is God. And in the last day he will judge every man for the way in which he has acted. To Him judgment the Lord Jesus refers every man who refuses to obey and rejects his words. If any man hears Christ's words, and believes not, but rejects him and his words, Christ condemns him not; judges him not, but leaves him to the Judge of all, who will render to every man according to his deeds, in the last day.

This, therefore, the Author of Christianity, the Saviour of the world, has clearly recognized and declared the right of every man to dissent from every religion known to mankind; and even the religion of Christ itself, being responsible only to God for the exercise of that right. He makes every man to believe and to be saved; but he will compel none. Christ leaves every man free to receive or reject, to assent or dissent, to believe or disbelieve, just as he chooses. His responsibility is to God alone, and it is the individual who must answer for himself in the last account. "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 14: 12. Whoever therefore presumes to exercise jurisdiction over the religious belief or observance of any man, or would compel man to conform to the precepts of any religion, or to comply with the ceremonies of any religious body, or would condemn any man for not believing or complying whoever would presume to do any such thing, puts himself above Jesus Christ, and usurps the place and the prerogative of God, the Judge of all.

Such is the doctrine of the free exercise of religion, as announced by Jesus Christ himself. And such is the doctrine upon this point that will ever be held by every one who is a Christian on principle only. This is declared and established by the Author of Christianity. It is both the human and divine right of dissent. And such is the divine right of the freedom of religious belief.

Nor is that all to this connection. The makers of the Government of the United States recognized this divine right as such, and established the exercise of it as an inalienable civil right, "by refusing to treat faith as a matter of government, or to associate a theocracy to a monarch's or a State," by excluding all religious tests; by forbidding Congress ever to make "any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" in short, by prohibiting the civil powers from ever making any law whatever upon the subject of religion.

Therefore, it is not only contrary to the example of the makers of the national Government, established in that State this first of March, as also an inalienable civil right, by declaring that "no human power can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship."

And thus the people of the United States, in harmony with the people of the several States, followed the principle first directly embodied of God in Joshua.

Therefore, it ever can be true in the United States, that other civil or religious freedom of right stop short of the logic in this matter of Sunday observance, religious observance.
