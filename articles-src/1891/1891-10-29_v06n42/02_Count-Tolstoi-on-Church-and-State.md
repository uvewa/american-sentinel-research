Russia is not left entirely without a witness for religious liberty. One of the greatest writers of Russia has just published a short disquisition on "The Relations of Church and State," which shows that the connection of religion with the Government,—the so-called "Christian nation,"—is not only opposed by Christians in America, but by Christians in Russia as well. It would be well for those who are really concerned for the advancement of a "Christian nation," to read and ponder what is said by one who knows what it is to live in a "Christian nation."

His article appeared in the April number of the *London Fortnightly Review*, and after speaking of those whose religious ideas once been oppressed, he proceeds:—

"Can anything be more incomprehensible than the fact that the class professing self-anointed and persecuted and bound by God himself, should not so as an opportunity to do good, give do likewise, serving others, instead of that, devoting every refinement of science and reason upon whom is placed that without resource men of equal reprisals, and that a third category of persons should be with, and so on and so on untrustworthy—and all this of these Christianity really cruel minds and that institutions, with the slaughter each other in the name of the principles that all men should believe the who believe, and not otherwise.

"WHAT doctrine, scheme, or creed have we been so impelled to insist that any people or nation should profess? As to our relations to the Deity, is precisely the same as if the subject had never been broached, that is human by means of violence, or by fraud (non-violent). If he has his very, and this proposition it can from which, it is impossible to persuade any honest mind honestly to think of depriving him of it, and so on."

As well might I take his coat, and heart, and deny his right to them, and then give him in its place. Action of that kind would be feasible if the main faith and principles were more social rule and not established upon a basic of our laws, an excrescence on the body and not living, enlightened soul have but to consider.

"But such interference is also impossible for another reason; it is not feasible because one can only believe or possess that in which he does not believe; because one who believes (i. e., he who has already determined and persuaded his relations to God, and consequently perceives that faith is the relation of each man to God) cannot wish to determine the relation of another man to God by means of violence and fraud. This, I maintain, is impossible; and yet to all seeming it is precisely what is being done now, and what was always and everywhere practiced in bygone times.

"Let us explain: it is impossible, and therefore cannot be done; but something extremely similar has been and still is being perpetrated. What really takes place and has for long past been nothing else is that by making their fellow-men a semblance of faith which he holds, much against their will; accept; this likewise, however, is but a counterfeit. Real faith cannot be forced upon any one, nor can the acceptance by him of the result of certain considerations, such as violence, fraud, or force. What people propagate by means of violence and accept from fear or cupidity is not faith, but faith's counterfeit, and the counterfeit was the old condition of the life of humanity.

"The notion of the true Church was also constantly made up of an argument against those who dissented; but in the reign of Constantine and the meeting of the Nicene Council it was still a mere notion and had not got beyond this embryonic stage of its evolution. From the time of Constantine and the Nicene Council, however, it became hundred-fold crystallized into a thing—a thing to make nations serve.

"The causes that led to this deception were of an evil nature. 'By their fruit ye shall know them.' They consisted of fraud, human pride, hostility to divine and old orders, and an evil incomparably greater than any of theirs by the unholy alliance of Christians with the temporal power. Constantine, the Emperor, who perceived that power, and had attained it—and that—according to Pagan morals —the summit of human grandeur (he was seated among the godly, embraced Christianity, gave an example to all his subjects, converted the people, helping one against heretics, and by means of a council composed, true Christian faith.' In this wise the Christian Catholic faith was fixed for all times and countries.

"From the time of the Nicene Council, called together by the Emperor . . . . being united with the temporal power, the self-styled church began to act like that power, and it is a power; but it had lost the form of religion that existed; to be a religion, it became a fraud."

"And they adjusted Christianity to his wants and wishes, arranging it far more cunningly than could have been expected. They were sagacious enough, however, to foresee that when they readied the gospel to the world, it sometimes or other, became fully aware of what the new faith does really demand of all men who embrace it, as a Christian life, and the poverty the construction of churches and frequent visits to them. This they anticipated and duly provided for by adding to and subtracting from Christianity in such an ingenious way that it might be to call himself a Christian, to live as a Pagan, and perceive that there we now find the tradition between his profession and his works. On the one hand, it was a simple task, but came solely for the purpose of redeeming him and all men; and on the other hand, the fat, eat Christ had said and gave the Constitution the right to live in harmony with his tastes, may be. . . . They had only to repeal and wrestle a number of things and went on with them, and everything was in the churches, and everything was apparently all right.

"For war this all. They managed . . . . and himself concentrated his power and all influence on collected civil, pledged that it was from God, and anointed him with oil. In acknowledgment of this on his part, arranged to that he liking the garb of the clergy, he borrowed the nature of such individual's relation to God, the same between right and wrong, and repeated to each man for his guidance. And every one was satisfied, and the faith thus established was arranged and prevailed on earth for more than a thousand years.

"The main question in the revolution of the clergy, the despotism, the predial services. We find, then, that they dispossessed what may or may not be sought here, and, consequently of their unwillingness that the brigands. It could not be otherwise, for they left it the right road he sought, powers to persons in the control, not on that the moment that they concentrated the first king and last named it that he by string the law ascribed to the earth the faith whose essence is his kindness, and finally, of dissent.

"All this is not the story of a fantastic church, but of the real church such as it has been ever since its hierarchy fell under the power of kings and Christ and its history is made up of a long series of acts on the part of those who endeavored most earnestly to preserve the truth of Christ's doctrine intact, while its proclaimers it by means of lies and deviation from it. The significance, the misery of the hierarchy is founded upon that of the union which they undertook. This doctrine speaks of meekness, of self-denial, of love, of poverty; it is spread in peaceful prosperity; of violence and lies.

"In order that something should be left the members of their hierarchy to teach, it was absolutely necessary for them to hold fast to (i. e., and formally repeat) the doctrines of Christ, but in order, on the other hand, to be in a position to alliance with the temporal power, they were forced to revert to the most ingenious devices to hide the essence of that doctrine, its center of gravity from the essence to the outward form and expression. And this was done by the hierarchy, i. e., the scenes of that counterfeit faith which is preached by the Church. The greatest merit is the source of the hierarchy, under the name of Church, which obtains from violence known as temporal power. Hence all the pains are made necessary; to teach their faith to others is because the true faith would convict them of apostasy; hence, they seek to set up a so-called creed of their own in its place, the sole advantage of which is that it justifies them of all crime.

"'How the religion may be prevented anywhere, everywhere; except, of course, where the State had used violence against men; that is to say, when the faith which is allied with violence—the State religion—prevails. Then all so-called heretics and heretical men be in possession of the true faith, wherever certainly it will not be discovered in the creed that is united with the temporal power. It may appear paradoxical, but it is none the less strictly true, that what is called Church, "Catholic," "Protestant" faith, as these words are used in everyday thinking, means nothing more nor less than a set of people associated with the temporal power, calling them Saintly, and therefore rendering this so-called Church Christian.

"Putting on one side the history of the other nations, let us cast a glance at the history of that State which was the first to make an alliance with Christianity.'"

"Having lived fifteen hundred years under the most various conditions, the nations of Christendom could not fail to see at last that the real fruit of Christianity is such in an ingenious way that it might not be to call himself a Christian, to live as a Pagan, and the perception that there is now the tradition between his profession and his works."

"'Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; . . . but it shall not be so among you.' Thou shalt not kill! Thou shalt not commit adultery; lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; judge not; resist not evil. There was no way to reconcile these teachings; but what was said by those who wished to accentuate the main doctrines of Christ, was easily suited: 'Give to God.' To call yourself a Christian, and to continue at the same time to be a robber chief, to strike, burn, go to war, live lewdly, slay, and repose abjectly in the lap of luxury! All this is readily fixed in his mind that the minister is the only one in the community that knows just how a man should vote."
