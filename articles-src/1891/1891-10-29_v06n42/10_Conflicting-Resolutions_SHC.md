Rev. J. S. Colvin, reporting in the United Presbyterian of September 24th, 1891, the meeting of the Kansas Synod of that denomination, says:

> This year, as last, the Kansas Synod met in Forest Grove, Ottawa, and spent nine days in synodical business and Chautauqua exercises.

> The following, on the signs of the times was very heartily adopted:

> 1. Let us, as a synod, while other churches have been threatened with destroying heresy and disruption, stand by the old Bible and vindicate its claims in word and works, in a way that wisdom may be justified of her children.

> 2. Let us, as a synod, stand by our Christian Sabbath and its civil observances in a faithful recognition and observance of the fourth commandment.

Now, by the adoption of the second resolution, they mean that they will be earnest in their efforts to have civil laws made for the enforcement of the observance of Sunday. But in their first resolution they propose to "stand by the old Bible" and promulgate its teachings in a way "that wisdom may be justified of her children."

If they would only do that, they would not be threatened with destroying heresy and disruption, nor would they apply to the State to have all the people compelled to observe Sunday, or resort to the civil power to compel their members to observe Sunday in the name of the "fourth commandment," for they would have the law of God with the fourth commandment, and the seventh day with it, written in their hearts, and would obey it because they loved to.
