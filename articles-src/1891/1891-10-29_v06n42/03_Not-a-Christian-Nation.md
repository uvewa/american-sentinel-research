It would be difficult to tax language to find an expression more unfit to describe a country than by calling it "a Christian Nation." In all the Nations there is not a single town, nor a village in which all the people are all Christians. A single family in which all are Christians is seldom found; and individual Christians are not abundant. We do not say these things to be fad truth; we are simply stating the facts in the case, as everyone who is honest will admit that they are. Let any person go anywhere in the land honestly ask himself the question,— honestly answer it, How many of my immediate neighbors and acquaintances actually show in the works of a godly life that they are real, consistent Christians?

In the face of facts as they are, the answer can only be, Very few. How many are really separated from the world, and conformed to the will of Christ?

Take even the churches themselves, and everybody knows, and the churches themselves confess, that many of their members will not bear the test of the precepts of Christ. Many of them will love the circus more than they love the prayer-meetings; and the excursions more than the services of the church; and the newspaper more than the sermon; and business more than God; and the world more than Christ. Then, while it is thus with the Church, where is the sense of calling the Nation Christian? and while the Church is itself full of worldly failings, what is the use of talking about being a Christian Nation? The trouble is that people put upon the term Christian "a construction so loose that it asserts there is scarcely any discernible distinction between many of those who bear it and those who do not, and the tendency is still further to obliterate the distinction, to extend over the whole mass, and thus they get the name Christian. But so long as the term "Christian" means what the Word of God means—no less and it means conformity to the precepts of Christ —just so long it will be that this is not, and never has been, a Christian Nation, except by such individuals becoming a Christian by an abiding walk of faith in Christ.
