With the foregoing phrase for a subject, Col. Geo. W. Bain, a leading Prohibitionist and temperance worker, is credited with the following, in the Organizer, Indianapolis, Ind., of September 17:—

> I know there is a cry going up continually, "do not mix temperance with politics," and yet the very men who make this cry go to the polls and vote for politics soaked in beer and whisky. If a convention acknowledges "Almighty God as the source of all power in government," these men cry out "union of Church and State," yet the same men go to the polls and vote for union of State and saloon. Christian men have joined in this cry until a minister is compelled in many churches by the sentiment thus created to keep silence on all political questions. He may apply the test of religion to the merchant and banker, but not to the voter. If a member of his church gets drunk he must exhort him, and if necessary expel him; but if another member votes to make a whole community of his neighbors drunkards it is none of the minister's business. He can tell his hearers to live right, but he must not tell them to vote right. He can tell them to pray for good government, but he must not tell them to vote for good government. So the pastor must hear some of his members pray "Thy kingdom come," and see them vote it shall not come; pray "give us this day our daily bread," and vote bread out of the mouths of women and children; pray "deliver us from evil," and vote for the greatest evil of earth; and yet the pastor must not mix religion and politics. The result is a man can be one thing in social life, another thing in politics. What is a sin in a church conference, whether high or low license, is a source of revenue, and is policy in politics.

Mr. Bain seems to have the idea thoroughly fixed in his mind that the minister is the only one in the community that knows just how a man should vote. But as long as our Government holds to its principles of freedom the clergy will not be allowed to dictate how we shall cast our ballot. The Colonel seems to want to take the matter right into church, and have the minister tell his members just how they shall vote; and in case of a failure to comply, "cast them out of the synagogue." If such a plan as that is to be followed, why have any voting at all? Why not just let the ministers manage things?

Those of us who are Christians believe fully that "Almighty God is the source of all power in government." But has not that same Almighty power instructed us that certain things belong to Caesar, or the civil government? And that he has ordained the powers that be? When Paul wrote "the powers that be are ordained of God," the powers then in existence were purely civil powers; and instead of either the Church or the ministers dictating what the State should do, we often find the early disciples before the civil courts to answer for their faith, and severely dealt with many times because they refused to give up their belief in Christ. It would hardly be reasonable to suppose that God ordained powers to persecute his own Church. Yet we find that the civil power, which it is expressly stated was ordained of God, doing that very thing. Then the only thing to conclude is, that since man has rebelled against God's government, the next best thing to be done for him was to ordain that he should govern himself. But in this civil or human government he has never given man the power to rule in matters of conscience toward the God of Heaven. And no matter how much we may desire to please God by introducing religion into politics, the result is only to develop a deeper rebellion against him; and hinder his work rather than advance it, by giving religious bigots an opportunity to wage the most cruel persecutions against those who desire to do God's will. And it is safe to venture the statement that if pastors attended more to the strict preaching of the word, and would not gloss things over to meet the approbation of those who only enter the Church for popularity, or to advance their business, there would be fewer members in the Church to complain of for praying one thing and voting another. And if ministers looked more to the power of God for help in his work and sought the aid of the State less, it would not be long till the Church would be an exceedingly unpleasant place for those who are holding so many inconsistencies. But just as our churches are made schools of politics, the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ will be neglected. Let the Church attend strictly to the work of the gospel, and as the great lessons of morality, found only in Christ, are woven late the minds and lives of men, politics will of necessity be purified. The morality of the State cannot possibly rise higher than the morality of the people. And if the minister gives himself wholly to the work for which he was ordained, he need have no fears about how the people of his charge will vote. Christianity, if it be real Christianity, makes men of principle; and men of principle always act in harmony with their convictions.
