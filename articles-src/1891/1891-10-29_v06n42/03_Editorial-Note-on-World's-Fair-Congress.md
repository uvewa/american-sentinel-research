THE series of religious congresses which have been planned to be held during the World's Fair in Chicago will, if carried out as projected, be the most widespread in its immediate influence of any religious effort ever inaugurated by man. In the enumeration of the different religious interests to be subserved by these meetings is mentioned that of making "prominent the value of the weekly rest day on religious and other grounds;" and the Christian Statesman, in commenting upon this, says that "the most impressive lesson as to the influence and the value of religion would be the closing of the Exposition itself on the Sabbath." The fact is that the enforced closing which is here meant would prove just the contrary, namely, that the "influence and value of religion" had been insufficient to cause the exhibitors and sight-seers to observe a religious rest day. And the very fact that the hand of the law had been called in to enforce a religious idea would prove to the world the absence of true religion and conscientious principle.
