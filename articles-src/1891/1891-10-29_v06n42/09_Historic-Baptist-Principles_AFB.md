"COMPETENT Sunday Observance" was the subject discussed by the Rev. John R. Hires, of the Chicago Hyde Park Baptist Church, at his morning service, Oct. 18. This is the historic Baptist principle of complete separation of Church and State, and he set forth the true ground of Sunday observance. The speaker traced out Sunday laws from the Roman Papacy, and showed that the observance of "the venerable day of the Sun," and asserted that that law and subsequent Roman legislation touching Sunday observance, came at the request of spiritual chiefs; that the Church was of the power of the gospel could not successfully hold the converts and that matters and the State was consequently invoked.

The speaker and replies an argument as to the influence and practice of religion, and declared that the basis of Sunday observance in France was not the result of a lately enacted Sunday law, but the result of centuries of ecclesiastical corruption and tyranny; that the difference between the "continental Sunday" and the "American Sunday" was not the result of any civil legislation, but was the result of a different basis of religion in the two countries.

Touching the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, he stated that the way to exhibit Christianity at the coming Exposition was not by means of a compulsory closing of the Fair, which would bring people on excursions into the country, to the parks, of the saloons, but by presenting to our visitors a living Church whose vitality comes not from the State but from Him, the living head of Christianity.
