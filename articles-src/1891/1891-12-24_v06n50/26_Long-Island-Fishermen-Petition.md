THE STATE SABBATH COMMITTEE OF NEW YORK WILL HAVE LEGISLATIVE LOBBYING TO DO IN OPPOSITION TO THE LONG ISLAND FISHERMAN. IT IS SAID THAT "THE BOAT OWNERS ON JAMAICA AND CANARIA BAYS ARE CIRCULATING A PETITION, WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE COMING LEGISLATURE, ASKING THAT THE LAW PROHIBITING LINE FISHING IN THOSE TWO BAYS ON SUNDAY, BE ABOLISHED." SUCH AN ITEM AS THIS IS A REMINDER OF OLD COLONIAL DAYS, UNDER A STATE CHURCH. IT SEEMS NEW YORK IS STILL IN THE SAME LEADING STRIPS.
