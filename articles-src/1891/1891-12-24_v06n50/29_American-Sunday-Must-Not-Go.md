The Christian at Work asks if the "American Sunday" must go, and says:—

We are gratified to observe that among the first documents laid before the Senate at Washington were several memorials asking legislation for closing the World's Fair on Sundays. It is desired that Congress shall make Sunday closing one of the conditions in granting the additional appropriation asked for by the managers of the Fair. This point cannot be insisted upon too early or too strongly.

The legal and constitutional attitude assumed by those who thus petition is inconsistent with any claim of intelligent loyalty to the principles of this government, or to the teachings of Jesus Christ. That the great majority of the leaders among the organized churches, and their followers, should be so utterly unable to understand these facts is remarkable, but no less strange than the delusions of false religion in previous ages of the world's history.
