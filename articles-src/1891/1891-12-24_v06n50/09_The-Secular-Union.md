The Secular Union of the State of Washington, has undertaken to fight the battles of the Church from a point of view which will probably not be appreciated. An earnest letter was addressed to the Governor of the State, protesting against the issuing of the official Thanksgiving a day of thanksgiving; his proclamation of a day of thanksgiving. The secularists object to any state proclaiming the people assemble at their respective places of worship, and give thanks etc., in keeping the prerogatives of the churches, and is an act of a violation, a visible one of the national, and our own State Constitution.

This is an unexpected source from which to hear a defense of the prerogative of the Church. To do such a service chargeably with the exception in the same spirit that is it afford. When a point, an unattended need, is made in favor of the Church, it would be unfortunate if any curtailment feeling so it in might should stifle the heart against its fullest usefulness
