A debate in the French Chamber of Deputies on December 16, concerning the relations of Church and State, was the cause of great uproar and nearly resulted in a duel. The despatches say: "The ecclesiastical controversy caused a great disturbance in the Chamber of Deputies to-day. M. Hubbard introduced a motion condemning the hostile attitude of the clergy, and demanding that steps be taken for the separation of Church and State." M. Fallieres, Minister of Justice and Public Worship, replied, and a scene of tremendous excitement and threatened violence ensued. "Resuming his speech M. Fallieres said that the government was opposed to the separation of Church and State. The Ministry, he continued, would shortly introduce a bill dealing with associations, which would apply equally to religious and secular communities. He added, however, that this bill must not be regarded as a prelude to the separation of Church and State. . . . It is the general opinion among members of the Chamber of Deputies, that the debate may be critical as regards the existence of the Cabinet owing to the dissatisfaction of the members of the Right at the Cabinet's intention to introduce a bill dealing with religious associations."
