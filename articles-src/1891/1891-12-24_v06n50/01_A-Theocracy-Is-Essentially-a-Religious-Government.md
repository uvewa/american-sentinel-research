A THEOCRACY is essentially a religious government. Sabbath laws belong only with a theocracy. As Sunday laws are advocated upon a theory allied to that of the Sabbath, so are they inseparable from a theocratical theory of government. In and is every theory Sunday laws originated —with such a theory they belong, and every argument in behalf of Sunday laws is, in the nature of the case, compelled to express a theocratical theory of government.

See then this result be avoided by calling it the "civil Sabbath." To call it the "civil Sabbath," and then attempt to uphold it as such by arguments, every one of which rests upon a theocratical basis, is simply to demonstrate the fact that the title of "civil Sabbath" is only a contrivance to save appearances, and is essentially a sham.

The State can not make men good. The State is a natural thing. It springs from man in the natural state, and neither in his nature, or in any natural process in his nature, to make men good. Nothing but the power of God as revealed in Jesus Christ can ever make men good. But that is a supernatural thing. It was miraculously manifested in Jesus Christ and is now supernaturally impressed upon men and cultivated in them. Goodness is a fruit of the Spirit of God; and the power of the Spirit of God is received only through faith, of which Jesus Christ is "the author and finisher." The State knows nothing of faith, and has nothing to do with faith, consequently the State has no power to make men good. Therefore for the State to make good men, and any professed minister of the gospel of Christ who attributes such power to the State, virtually denies the purpose and the power of Christianity. If the State can make men good, then assuredly there is no need of Christianity to make them good, and there was no need of Christ's coming down to this earth to make them good.
