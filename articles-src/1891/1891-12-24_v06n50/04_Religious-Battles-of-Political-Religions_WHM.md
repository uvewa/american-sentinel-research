The Mail and Express, quotes President Amaron, of the French Protestant College, at Springfield, Massachusetts, as saying that "the Republicans of that State may thank the French and Irish Roman Catholic vote for their defeat." And also reports the Hon. Solomon Hirsch, United States Minister at Constantinople, as declaring "that politics there are purely battles of religions. The various countries stand for their respective religions, and the position which the ambassador from any country will take on any new issue in the Orient can be foretold just as soon as it is seen how it will affect the national church of his country." Upon this the Mail and Express comments, and applies its deductions to Tammany Hall as the controlling element of the Democratic party of this city and State, and, as purely a grand Romish propaganda, trying to unite Church and State, that is the Roman Catholic Church and the State. There is a much broader application of these facts than this which restricts the warning to be derived from them solely to the encroachments of the Romish propaganda. The Mail and Express is itself the mouthpiece of a religious party in politics, precisely similar in purpose to that which is professedly papal,—a party of monopoly in political religion which says, that Roman ecclesiasticism must not rule because Protestant ecclesiasticism must rule, and when Protestantism asserts its right to civil rule it becomes no longer Protestant but Romish. The publications are many, and the organizations almost legion, which are rapidly making the politics of this country a battle of religions, and already it can be said, in some degree, of the representatives of the people in Congress, that their position can be told on any new issue, as soon as it can be seen how it affects the religious sentiment of their constituency.
