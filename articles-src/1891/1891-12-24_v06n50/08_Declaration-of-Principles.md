### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible; and recognizing the civil government, and the Church as being ordained of God; we believe that the Church and State are separate and distinct institutions, and that neither has any right to assume the powers nor the functions of the other; and that their union constitutes the "beast" of Revelation and history.

No. 43 Bond St., New York City.

President.

C. P. BOLLMAN,
Secretary.

Corresponding Secretary.

Petitions are being received by Congress, and personal, praying Congress not to grant further financial assistance to the World's Fair unless it be closed on Sunday.

The annual report of the Commissioner of the District of Columbia, in transmitting recommendations of the head of departments and his recommendations to Congress, urges the adoption of "a law to prohibit the pursued of any secular occupations on Sunday" in the District.

An attempt is being made in Oregon to revive the old Sunday law of that State, which has been a dead letter for some time, it having been rendered almost inoperative by the exemption clause added to it some years ago. When it is remembered that an attempt to enforce a similar Sunday law in that State law enacted that could only result by make the exemption clause effective. The revival of present of Sunday legislation are, in that part of country.

The New York State Sabbath Committee, organized at the convention held in Utica, consisting of ten members from every county in the State, has, among other things, "organ legislation so clearly in the use of the first day of the week for rest and religious uses, by bringing to bear upon the Legislature the best thought, and the best public feeling citizens in all parts of the State there is a direct enforcement of existing laws to the interest of Sabbath observance." The Syracuse daily *Standard*, Nov. 10, 1891, says editorially: "Gentlemen, have a care that you don't trample on the religious rights of those who differ with you."

In order to test the Sunday law in reference to Sunday cab-driving in New York City, Mr. E. T. C. are courting arrest. The Washington Star, Dec. 12, says:—

One of the many holders of Ex-Commissioner Grant's idea that a cab-driver should not be permitted to drive the hack stands on Sunday. He eventually claims to keep his hack stand and has a hack and his driver on Sunday, and this regulation also permitted hack for all over from Commissioners Grant or President and Secretary. The stand was established the position seeking a cab is obliged to go to a stable or to the nearest public telephone. The question has for days

to the despised of a fare was not universal to obtain the possession of a hack for a necessary flight into the need itself to be stopped at a street. Though in an emergency they were on the lookout for passengers, from where they were on the lookout for passengers.

The owners of cabs back, hansom-etc. always find ready sympathy by alleging that everybody in their stand on Sunday. They have, therefore, practically no means of earning their living at their stands and solicit custom, and to violate the regulations to hire cabs. One or two of them recently hired cabs on Sunday, but were arrested, as were four drivers charged with a violation of the regulation.

REV. JAMES N. KING, General Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, of the Seventh-day Adventist, is in Washington for the purpose of presenting a new petition against the religious legislation under consideration.

No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or into its property its credit, or any means thereof to any education institution, school, or system of religion; or authorize the taking, by taxation, appropriation, payment for services, or in any manner whatever, for the use of any religious denomination.

The purposes and principles of this organization, and the reason for its existence, are briefly set forth in "Protestant America," for it is true and is needed to every Institution. Its certainly ships to the study of the English language, in the interest of Americanism. The establishment of the separation of Church and State has as the theory of its purposes, its raison d'etre, the conservation
