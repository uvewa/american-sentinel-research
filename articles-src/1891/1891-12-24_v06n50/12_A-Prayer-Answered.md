The Rev. Mr. Dunn, one of the Secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, in the course of a sermon preached in Brooklyn a few evenings ago, said: "The Puritans were the greatest of all great men;" and then fervently added, "O, for more of the Puritan spirit!" The following from a late Pennsylvania paper is an example of the spirit that actuated the Puritans, and its effect on those who fell victims to it: "Frenchtown, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, has been in a turmoil for several days on account of the superstitions beliefs of the foreigners there. About a week ago, Mrs. Passacre stated that she was the daughter of a mountain shepherd in Austro-Hungary, and according to the natives such a woman has the power of bewitching. Every little misfortune that has since befallen any of the inhabitants of the town has been charged to her, and the natives have threatened to burn her at the stake unless she would commit suicide. Recently a cow, belonging to the leader against the innocent woman, died. He went to the house and demanded that the cow be brought back to life within five hours. When the five hours had expired, and the animal had not come to life, the owner collected a crowd, and proceeding to her residence, dragged her from her home and so murderously assaulted her that her life is despaired of."

"In 1617, James I. published his 'Declaration to his Subjects Concerning Lawful Sports,' sanctioning certain recreations and pastimes on the Sabbath, and ordering this sanction to be made known in all the churches. Twenty-six years later this royal book was burned by the common hangman, in Cheapside, pursuant to resolution of Parliament."

"In 1637, for writing 'Altrare Christianum' and 'Sunday no Sabbath,' Dr. Pocklington was deprived of all his livings, dignities, and preferments, perpetually disabled from holding any place in church or commonwealth, and his works were burned by the common hangman." In 1891, a book of "Bible Readings," which among other things contains the teachings of the Bible, in reference to Sunday and the Sabbath, is denounced by clergymen in the public prints as a dangerous and heretical work; and many are fined and imprisoned for failing to keep sacred the first day of the week,—even some who have religiously observed the seventh day, according to the accurate reading of the commandment.
