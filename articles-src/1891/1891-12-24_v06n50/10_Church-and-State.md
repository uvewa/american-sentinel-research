"The Prohibition Party, in National Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power in government, do hereby declare," etc.—Preamble, National Prohibition Platform.

"As American citizens we respectfully ask you to place in your platform a clear, full recognition of these two great truths, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the sovereign Ruler of our Nation, and that his moral law is the rule of all our conduct in civil and political affairs."—National Reform Petition to the Conventions of all Political Parties.

Does this indicate the sober sentiment of a nineteenth century people that have descended from forefathers who lived and died to found "a State without a king" or religious head? If they do, it will certainly not be an excess of patriotism to see how far we have drifted from their teaching.

Of course everybody knows that they had pronounced views on the total separation of Church and State. We fancy that we are true to that principle while many of us are zealously working to mix religion into government. Washington, the "father of his country," said: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience." Madison, the "father of the Constitution," said: "Religion is not in the purview of human government. Religion is essentially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both." "We are teaching the world that governments do better without kings than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that religion flourishes in greater purity without, than with, the aid of government." Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, said in the Virginia Assembly in 1785: "Almighty God hath created the mind free; all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments and burdens, or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness." We all know, too, that the Constitution provides that "Congress shall pass no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." And as if to make it forever certain that not even Christianity should be entitled to recognition as a fundamental principle of our civil laws, Washington's treaty with Tripoli—which like all other treaties is declared by the Constitution to be part of the supreme law of the land—expressly says: "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.

Our fathers meant to be understood emphatically that this is a civil government. But they were hampered by many difficulties. Only by the most earnest persuasion did the Colonies finally adopt the Constitution. Its framers did not dare to put into it a prohibition upon the States, forbidding them to establish State religions; because almost every one had been founded by the followers of some sect. The result was, and is, that the old Church-and-State "Blue Laws" still remain on the statute books of some of the States. In the District of Columbia, in the year of grace 1891, there is in force (lacking only the execution) an unrepealed law, enacted in 1723, which provides that "any person who shall wittingly, maliciously, and advisedly, by writing or speaking, blaspheme or curse God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three persons, or the unity of the Holy Trinity, . . . shall be bored through the tongue and fined twenty pounds sterling . . . and in case the said fine cannot be levied, the offender shall suffer six months' imprisonment without bail; . . . for the second offense, the offender . . . shall be stigmatized by branding in the forehead the letter B and fined forty pounds sterling . . . and in case the same can not be levied, the offender shall suffer twelve months' imprisonment without bail. . . . and for the third offense, the offender . . . shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy."

Were such a thing to be read about as a law of the Dark Ages we would doubtless thank our fortune that we had lived to see better days; yet familiarity with our modern religious liberties has in a measure dulled our once keen sense of their inestimable value.

Our initial quotations show a tendency to the theory that the government is "a moral person" accountable to God for its own and its subjects' sins. And so we hear ardent "Reformers" protesting against "that old Philadelphia lie," that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." According to this teaching the State is the parent of the people, and irresponsible to them. A co-operation of some religious associations of our country is working indefatigably to induce Congress to commit itself to the policy of legislation on religious matters, which movement, so repugnant to the original principles of our American political system, is trying to work itself gradually and seductively into popularity. The movement originated in a great religious convention held in Ohio during the most critical period of our civil war, to determine for what great national sins our beloved country was being so grievously punished. This congress finally resolved itself into a political organization called "The National Reform Association." Their avowed object then and now is "to secure such an amendment to the Federal Constitution as shall . . . place all the Christian usages, laws, and institutions of the Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." And this body with its auxiliary associations is unalterably pledged to the accomplishment of its purposes.

This movement was fathered, not by Romanism, but by a professedly Protestant denomination. By the admission of one of their most prominent members, "National Reform is simply the practical application of the principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church for the reformation of the Nation." (The italics are his own.) And this menace to American liberty is the more dangerous in that it comes from within, not from without, and from a people who are voluntary political aliens. One of the cardinal principles of this church is that no member shall vote in this country until God shall be specifically recognized in the Constitution as the source of all authority in government. It was this denomination that on the 10th of June last, at Pittsburg, by a vote in its national Synod of ninety-five to thirty-seven, expelled five of its leading young ministers for heresy, because they taught, and practiced, the elective franchise of American citizens.

All this ought to mean that it is time for every lover of American liberties to examine his own opinions on the subject of the political recognition of the Deity in any way; and to resolve that he will give no support or sympathy to any movement whose logical significance is to make our Government a despotism of the majority—by legal enactment and process to make the individual either a hypocrite or a martyr.—Frank W. Howe, in Portland Herald.
