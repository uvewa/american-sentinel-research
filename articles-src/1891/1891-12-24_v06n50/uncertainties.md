## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1
- **Line 27**: "W. H. MCKEL" appears incomplete - likely "W. H. McKEE" based on known associate editors
- **Confidence**: HIGH - McKee is the known associate editor for this volume

### Page 6
- **Line 249**: "We know the right" - context suggests this should be "We DENY the right" based on the organization's principles
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM - the word "know" seems incongruous with the context

### Page 7
- **Line 315**: "CANARIA BAYS" - likely "CANARSIE BAYS" (known location in Long Island)
- **Confidence**: HIGH - Canarsie Bay is the correct geographic name
- **Line 315**: Text appears in all caps in original - preserved as printed

### Page 8
- **Line 411**: "43 DOVD STREET" - likely "43 BOND STREET" (known address from masthead)
- **Confidence**: HIGH - Bond Street is the correct address per masthead

## Resolution Actions Taken

All uncertainties were transcribed as they appear in the OCR, with notes made here for review. The most likely readings are:
- McKEE (not MCKEL)
- CANARSIE (not CANARIA)
- BOND (not DOVD)
- "deny" may be intended rather than "know" in the NRLA declaration

These represent minor OCR errors rather than unclear source material.
