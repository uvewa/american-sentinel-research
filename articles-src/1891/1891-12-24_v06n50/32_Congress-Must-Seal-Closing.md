A writer in the Christian Statesman says, in regard to the World's Fair:—

It is a mistake—a mistake that it is not too late to correct—that the petitions against Sunday opening have not been sent to Congress itself, in addition to the Commission, which is only a committee of Congress. . . . Congress should seal the closing by a national law.

This insister upon Sunday closing knows very well that the Fair, as a whole, is in no sense under the jurisdiction of Congress. If it were why are Chicagoans coaxing for a $5,000,000 loan? Why is it left to each State Legislature to appropriate such a sum as it deems necessary to represent the State suitably at the Fair? If this were so, Congress would have only to levy a pro rata tax on each State for the expense of the Exposition, and pocket the proceeds, instead of Chicago having the exclusive handling of the money.
