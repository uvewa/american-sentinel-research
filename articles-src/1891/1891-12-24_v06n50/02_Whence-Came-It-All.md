From the ostracism which we have made and discussed, in our review of Judge Hammond's decisions, we have no doubt that many of our readers have wondered where in the world a judge of a United States court ever could have got such an abundance of such strange principles. He was sitting in the place, and speaking officially from the bench, of a judge of a court of the Government of the United States. It were to be expected, therefore, that he would announce the principles of the Government of the United States. Instead of this, however, he boldly sets forth propositions and principles that are utterly subversive of every principle of the Government of the United States, as that Government was originally established, and as the people have supposed it to be.

Where did the Judge get them? We are not left to answer this question ourselves, nor is it a way in which there need be any fear of making a mistake. The answer is already and abundantly made, and furnished ready to our hand. All we need to do is to transfer the information as may be required to answer the inquiry that has been raised.

The decisions of the Court and the decisions of the Judge, were filed at Memphis, Tennessee, August 1, 1891, and were verified in full in the Memphis *Appeal-Avalanche*, of the next day, August 2. Then in the same paper of August 20, there is a communication nearly four columns in length, entitled, "The Sunday Habit," upon the same subject, signed "E. S. Hammond" and dated "*August 12, 1891.*" The headlines of the communication show that the E. S. Hammond, whose name is signed to it, is the same one who as Judge E. S. Hammond filed the dictum August 1, which was printed August 2. And every line of the communication plainly shows that it was from Mr. E. S. Hammond, the individual, that Hon. E. S. Hammond, the Judge, obtained the principles and propositions which are set forth in the dictum.

Nor were they simply gotten up for the purpose, or prepared on short notice. Mr. Hammond's *express* statement they are shown to have been of long standing, if not inherent, in the individual. After stating again some of the leading thoughts and theories of the dictum, Mr. Hammond, with a satisfaction that is clearly apparent, says:—

Upon this line of argument, the writer some years ago, being invited to lecture before his Jewish fellow-citizens, upon its merits decided that Christianity can be a part of the law of the land, might in a domestic though chimerical career show that in a question, through chimerical domestic court of the economic necessity of another day of labor, the Sunday habit; by the comparatively weak judicial machinery of this State, is endeavoring to agitate the incorporation of an exception in the Sunday laws for a little of which religious sentiment had abstained from on Saturday.

This alone shows that the intention of obedience to a dominant religious party say that "a sort of facilities" existing and established "the *civil* power, and yet by it compel obedience to their religious opinions or dogmas," is no old and favorite doctrine of Mr. Hammond's; and he seems to be so smitten with a religious zeal that would seize upon every opportunity to air his sentiments and parade them before the public, both in his official and judicial office and the United States to create an opportunity. As for his effort to reconcile his Jewish fellow-citizens to his doctrine, we can say for Mr. Hammond that the Jews of Tennessee are much more financially liberal than they are in an intellectual way in assenting to such Anglo-Saxon ideas. We sincerely hope that every one of them will forever remain completely irreconcilable to any such un-American corruption.

request that they pay sixteen and two-thirds per cent. of their income for the service of being reconciled to "the *civic* doctrine" of obedience to a domineered and distasteful religious custom; and second, in all cases, Unless they are entirely set lost to the religious integrity that has always characterized their race, they would still less appreciate his invitation that for the privilege of being so reconciled, they pay a reasonable sum of taxes, and to a distasteful custom, all their rights of conscience.

For, to surrender all their rights of conscience is just what he asks them to do. For when an exception is either asked or granted, upon the condition that those who are excepted shall "conscientiously" abstain from labor on another day, it then becomes a matter of judicial decision as to what is conscientious abstainance or observance. This has already been declared by the courts of those States which have exemption clauses in their Sunday laws. The decisions have declared that the burden of proof of conscientiousness rests upon him who makes the claim of exemption on account of conscientious observance of another day, and the court must be made or satisfy the judgment.

That is demonstrated by that of Honorable Hammond's proposition, of which he seems to be so exhortative, having demanded to the citizens of the United States and of the State of Tennessee, shall surrender to the courts of courts and juries their own conscientious convictions, their conscientious beliefs, and their conscientious observances; that they shall no longer observe the Sabbath according to the dictates of their own consciences, but only according to the dictates of a court.

This is precisely the doctrine of the dictum of Judge Hammond, and it is evident that it was derived from it. E. S. Hammond, the individual; for it is in open contradiction to both the Constitution of the United States and of the State of Tennessee, both of which were specifically before the Judge when he set forth his dictum.

The Constitution of the State of Tennessee cities recognize Mr. Hammond as being endeavoring to reconcile the dictation of a dominant party, by asking to surrender to the courts their rights of conscience, plainly disclaims that "No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience." Therefore it is plain that in the proposed which Mr. Hammond made to his Jewish fellow-citizens of Tennessee, he spoke in open contradiction to the Constitution of that State, as well as he told in childlike of every principal of the rights of conscience, and he actually advised his Jewish fellow-citizens to surrender that explicitly declared Constitutional right as well as their own individual and divine rights of conscience.

The Constitution of the United States which Judge Hammond is empowered to construe, which he is sworn faithfully to construe, and which is intended to be the supreme guide in all the deliverance which he renders from the bench upon which he sits—"the American Constitution, in harmony with the people of the several States, withholds from the Federal Government the power to invade the home of reason and conscience of citizens." It is evident therefore that the principles of that dictum were not derived, in any sense, from the Constitution which the Judge is sworn to maintain and which is intended to be his guide; now they were derived from the Constitution of Tennessee which at that time was subject to his cognizance.

Therefore, as the principles of Judge Hammond's dictum are not the principles of either the Constitution of the United States, or the State of Tennessee, both of which were the direct subject of his judicial cognizance, and as they are explicitly the principles of Mr. E. S. Hammond, the individual, as expressed in his communication of August 12, 1891, to the *Appeal-Avalanche*, and as set forth "some years ago" from the lecture platform; it logically follows that the principles announced in the dictum of Hon. E. S. Hammond, the judge, were derived solely from Mr. E. S. Hammond, the individual. And from this it follows inevitably that upon the question of religious rights, Hon. E. S. Hammond of the Circuit Court of the United States, has not hesitated to set forth, from the judicial bench, and of judges that he has, the principles and individual opinions of citizens that are of a sort as possible with the authority that attaches to such a position, to pass them off on the American people as the principles of the Government of the United States.

This illustrates another point, and one which it utterly expatiates; that is, that whatever religious becomes in any way connected with civil government, it vitiates the personal opinions, as to religion, of those who happen at the time to be in power, that are given as the forces of law, which all are expected to accept, but to which are only obliged, by authority of Government, to submit. And the first duty of the kind by a court of the United States, ought to be enough to awaken the whole Nation to the dangerous character of the Constitution and of the governmental fellows who made it, in straitly forbidding the Government to take cognizance of religious things in any way whatever. Mr. Hammond presumes to announce, for the Jews, that which of course he declares to be their "rights" "they ought adopt this [his] plan of compliance." But we are very happy to know and to publish, that he also announces that "a Anglo-Saxon, who follows the tenet of the Jews as to the Sabbath, is in some irreconcilable to the assertions he is asked to make." After this much as to Anglo-Saxon ideas. We sincerely hope that every one of them will forever remain completely irreconcilable to any such un-American corruption. Better a thousand times to die as poor King, than to violate in his cause his conscience, in a "process of law" and under one thousand dollars bail, or even a tin dipper, than to comply with bigoted demands of a class of people whose only claim to a clamor for religious freedom and the presumption that has been made in this absurd assumption of Church and State was "only a sort of facilities advantage," "have secured the aid of the civil law." Better be the freemen of Jesus Christ, than the pampered slave of the Sunday Institution.

R. M. King, the victim of this persecution, is dead. He died as he had lived, a true, honest, manly man, and sincere Christian. He died condemned by the courts of Tennessee, the Circuit Court of the United States, and bound in one thousand dollars bail to appear in the Supreme Court of the United States. At his death his case has passed from the courts and stands appealed to the supreme Court of the Universe.

"That God will verify it, for "God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness," in that day there will sit a Judge with whom neither Anglo-Saxon ideas nor any other "directing a civil procedure," "process of law," but only justice, shall have its weight. And in that day we would not stand in King's place rather than in that of his persecutors; for He who shall sit, judges not by the flesh, nor by "processes of law."

"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me;" and "Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
