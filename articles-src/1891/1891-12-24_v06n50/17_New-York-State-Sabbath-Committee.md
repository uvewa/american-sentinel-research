The New York State Sabbath Committee, organized at the convention held in Utica, consists of two members from each county in the State, and will, among other things, "oppose legislation unfriendly to the use of the first day of the week for rest and religious uses, by bringing to bear upon the Legislature prompt united action of the Sabbath loving citizens in all parts of the State whenever such legislation is attempted, and seek to secure a better enforcement of existing laws in the interest of Sabbath observance." The Syracuse Times raises a warning voice to the Committee: "Gentlemen, have a care that you don't trample upon the rights and liberty of those who do not agree with you!"
