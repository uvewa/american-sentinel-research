Rev. James M. King, General Secretary of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, is in Washington for the purpose of influencing Congress to recommend a sixteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as follows:—

No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The purposes and principles of this organization, condensed into a watchword world be, "America for Protestant Americans," for it sets itself to restrict immigration, to establish a certain censorship as to the study of the English language, in the public schools, and while ostensibly favoring the separation of Church and State has, as the main purpose of its existence, the preservation of American ecclesiasticism.
