A REPRESENTATIVE of the learned Jesuiticals, lawyers, and politicians of London, expressed himself, in the London Echo, concerning the "Lord's Day Observance-bores," after this manner:—

Sir,—I am very glad to see that the slaves exercised in relation to accept this tyrannized Sunday lectures, and courses, for the working classes, four courses going, where the working classes resort to herewith, and I attended not less than three on a recent Sunday, each in a different part. Now this comes hard on us; we are hampered on every hand, and when both by legislation, and as we constituted about one third of the national revenue for this Christian country, we deserve better treatment. I am getting tired of being trimmed, drawing away our customers of a Sunday from us; what does it become of for the Sabbatarian day. I am tired of its being forgotten that brother learned Jesuiticals and the great brewers will enjoy their Sabbath theory, and help them in their Day Observance Society, and help them in their agitation. A PUBLICAN

CONGRESSMAN JOHN T. HEARD, of South Carolina, has been named for the chairmanship of the House Committee on the District of Columbia. To this Committee will be referred the bill introduced for the purpose of committing Congress to the principle of religious legislation by the passage of Sunday laws for the District of Columbia.

Senator Carey of Wyoming, takes the place of Mr. Blair in the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, and the member of the chairmanship of the select Senate Committee to Establish the University of the United States fills space Senator Proctor, as successor to Ex-Senator Edmunds.

The State Sabbath Committee of New York will have legislation lobbying for to take action on the petitions of the Long Island fishermen. It is said that the best owners on Jamaica and Chatham Bays are circulating a petition, which will be presented to the coming Legislature, asking that the law prohibiting line fishing in those two bays on Sunday, be abolished." Such an item as this is a reminder of old colonial days, under a State Church. It seems New York is still in the same leading strings.

"To follow worldly precedents, and with Bibles holy writ eyes, is easier than to think."
