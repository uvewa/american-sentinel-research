In Germany the Lutheran is the established church and the king is its virtual head; but there are nine churches over which the government has supervision and to which money is yearly granted. The professors of the theological institutions are appointed by the government, and they teach what they choose or omit to teach what they please, so long as they do not offend the government, and retain their positions as purveyors of religious belief. Sometime ago an officer was dismissed from the army because of the irreligious teachings of a teed, which he had published, but it did not deprive him of his membership in the church; of so artificial and perfunctory a nature are the requirements of church relationship. The Church is without power of discipline and unable to purge itself of those whose lives are unworthy. The government is the arbiter of all these things, and its attention is awake only to those qualities in its subjects which constitute an effective soldiery. This is an example of a nationalized Protestant Christianity, open to the eyes of the whole world, yet, in this country, the entire force of Church influence is brought to bear to bring about a similar condition,—a nationalized Christianity in a "Christian Nation."
