An attempt is being made in Oregon to revive the old Sunday law of that State, which has been a dead letter for some time, it having been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the State some years ago. When it is remembered that an effort was made at their last Legislature to get a Sunday law enacted that could easily be made effective, it can be readily seen how determined the advocates of Sunday legislation are, in that part of the country.
