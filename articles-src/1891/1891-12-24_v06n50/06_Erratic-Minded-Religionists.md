THERE is a class of erratic-minded religionists in our country whose mere feeling, or what they misconceive to be conscience, disquiets them, often to the extent of making them refuse to accept public trusts in the national and State services, or to sit even as jurors; and this because the Constitution, in their fancy, omits to establish, as by human positive law, that God exists; and, which would then ultimately and inevitably come to pass, take the Church of Christ, as was done by Roman-imperial and by Norman policy, under the oppressive and malign patronage of the civil service.—Chief Justice Shea.
