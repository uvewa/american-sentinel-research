This question was suggested by an editorial discussion of a subject at Chicago Sept. 3-4, in the interests of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Said the *Rev.* Dr. Patton in a report: "I am not a bigot, but I do believe in the perpetuation of the American Sabbath. We must not become like Europe." "But," said the Rev. J. Q. Adams, "the Laboring classes of people, who, by the nature of their employment, they could obtain on no other day than Sunday." "Shame upon them," replied the doctor, "Just think! I think regular holidays will be given, so that these people can attend." Shortly before the latter remark, in the course of the discussion, Dr. Sankey made the following remarkable remark:—

Why if we allowed the compensation, thousands would flock to the Fair on Sunday to see the sights of parks, and before long the whole thing would be running all Sunday. No cunning wedge in the affairs of Satan!

The following words were used by Dr. P. S. Henson on the same occasion:—

No question arises, what are we to do with the men that are sentenced on a day of six weeks to work in and out of the Exposition or Fair? What shall we do with them and for the rest of the day of rest and recreation of body?

From these remarks it appears that thousands, and even the "masses," would be glad to attend the Exposition on Sunday, if it were open on that day, which goes to show that the majority of people have but little regard for Sunday as a sacred day. But there is a certain "we" who have a great reverence for first day, and the persons who compose that "we" want to have all others compelled to conform to their ideas of right and wrong in regard to Sunday observance.

Now the question arises, Haven't the large classes of laboring men and women, which compose nine-tenths of our population, a right to spend Sunday in their own way as must they spend it as a few zealous advocates of Sunday legislation suggest?

In both of these quotations it is noticeable that the laboring classes and also the "masses" are referred to as a body of men or class of beings unable to govern themselves. The Fair must be closed on Sunday or they will attend; holidays must be given or they can not attend the Exposition. As though they must go just when they are allowed to go, and must stay at home when they are told to stay there.

Why has any right to exercise such authority over the laboring classes of this Nation? Have not the common people minds of their own to think and act for themselves? Have they not consciences to guide them in their perceptions of right and wrong or have they become a mere herd of unreasoning animals that are to be watched over and driven by some higher order of beings? This Nation was founded by the common people. It was founded for the common people, and to the day when the common people of our Nation are unable to make their own choice.

At the same meeting it was further argued that there will be about 30,000 persons employed about the grounds during the Exposition, and that if it were open on Sunday, these persons would have to labor or be out of a situation. Now if the United States Government should compel those 30,000 persons to go there and conduct the Exposition whether they wished to or not, and then held the Fair open seven days in the week, there would be some reason in such a plea as that. The employes of the World's Fair will later because they desire to do so, and they will accept the place consenting to labor on Sunday. They have a mind of their own, and can refuse to work if they do not wish to labor on Sunday. They need no overbearing "we" to cause them follow the teachings of our consciences.

If not enough men can be found to run the Exposition on the first day of the week, then, of course, it will be closed on that day without any further ceremony, but long as there are "masses" to attend on that day, if it is open, there will be plenty of willing laborers who can be hired to do the work of running the Exposition. And who has the right to say it shall not be open on that day as well as any other?

Some argue that closing the World's Fair on Sunday has nothing to do with religious legislation, but when persons are found who are so willing to close or refrain from running the Exposition on Sunday, are to the assurance to attach to look to it; if open, and all are hindered because a few zealous advocates of Sunday sacredness desire to be closed on that day, it looks very much like discrimination in favor of religion belief. Shall this Nation, at an outset, publish to all the world that this is a free country, where no religion is preferred above another, no one belief preferred above the next? Shall America say to all the world that the majority of her citizens are capable of governing themselves, or shall she proclaim from the soil of self-government, that her masses are ignorant and a dud regard for the opinions of others, the peaceful fruits of righteousness, freedom, and breakonly love!

Who owns the laboring classes? God owns them. To God alone are they responsible for how they spend their time. American laboring men are entirely capable of self-government. These alone are the keepers, give us right, and left to themselves, they will act just as conscientiously, as those who are so anxious to dictate religion to them.

Then in the words of the Reverend Doctor Patton: "I don't — don't do anything with them," "give them a rest!" This above is the show of what the actual Columbian Exposition that this is indeed a free Nation—that it stands on a broad platform of freedom and justice and equality for all. Let the world see that the American is not commensurate with that spirit of religious bigotry and impudence which moves all the thinking and all the religion to a few who consider themselves a little better than the common people—that spirit which has been the precursor of the decline and fall of governments before this, and it is on the one destruction here and now and in the past and for all time.
