The Christian Patriot, of Morristown, Tennessee, of the date December 15, has the following in its editorial paragraphs:—

The directors of the Chicago Fair, in spite of their proposal to trample on the laws of God, and of their country, and in the teeth of their solemn pledge, have the sublime impudence to ask Congress for a loan of five million dollars.

Have the directors made this proposal? So far they have not interfered with either the laws of God, or of the country. And if wise, they will continue neutral, and avoid trampling on the laws of God by attempting a civil enforcement of them.
