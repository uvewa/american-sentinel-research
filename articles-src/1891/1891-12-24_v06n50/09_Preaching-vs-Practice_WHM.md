In the course of his Thanksgiving sermon Dr. Talmage said:—

I wish you good cheer for civil and religious liberty. . . . Blessed be God that to-day we are free men with the prospect and determination of always being free. No established religion—Jew and Gentile, Arminian and Calvinist, Trinitarian and Unitarian, Protestant and Roman Catholic on the same footing. If persecution should come against the most unpopular of all the sects, I believe that all other denominations would band together and arm themselves, and heart would be stout, and blood would be free, and the right of men to worship according to the dictates of their consciences, would be contested at the point of the bayonet, and with blood flowing up to the bits of the horses' bridles.

Dr. Talmage should have heard by this time that the boundaries of the United States extend beyond his own Tabernacle walls; or are the windows of his mind and memory, like those of his church, so dimmed with the glory of stained glass and the illuminated figures of religious art and ecclesiastical tradition, that the light of God's truth and the reflection from the cross, which suffering humanity still bears, can not shine in? This is the preaching of the minister within the Tabernacle walls, but the practice of the judge without is something very different, as witness the case of R. M. King, and at least two score others precisely similar but less prominent; and the cases depending on similar principles of religious intolerance, but directed against no particular sect, in our Law Reports and of daily occurrence in courts not of record, numbering into the thousands. While as yet not one denomination, which Dr. Talmage recognizes as orthodox, much less "all other denominations," has risen to assert the right of any or all to worship as they will,—or not to worship if they have no loving loyalty to God but deny him in their hearts. But is it true that religious denominations are ready, for any cause, "to arm themselves" and contest questions of conscience "at the point of the bayonet, and with blood flowing up to the bits of the horses' bridles"? This ready reference to the trial by combat, in questions involving religion and morals, and even threats of the resort to the sword, the bayonet, and the bullet, has become very common among the most prominent of those who are accepted as the leaders of religious and moral reform in this country. Such suggestions of violence as these, amounting almost to approval, are certainly not in harmony with the command of the Master to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Such utterances upon the subject of civil and religious liberty as this of Dr. Talmage, and that of Rev. Ezra Tinker, quoted elsewhere, are examples either of unexpected ignorance from such sources, or of willful blindness. The language of violence in which they indulge is utterly without excuse. It is the open expression of anarchism and ought to meet with the same public condemnation as the inflammatory incitement to violence of the Chicago "Reds."
