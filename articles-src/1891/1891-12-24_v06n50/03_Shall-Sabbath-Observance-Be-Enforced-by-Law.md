[*Continuation of the negative argument, delivered at the annual session of the National W. C. T. U., in the Music Hall, Boston, November 16, 1891, by A. F. Ballenger, upon the question, "Shall Sabbath observance be enforced by law?"*]

Is it a Massachusetts report? If so, I find the Supreme Court deciding that the requiring of a church-going on Sabbath was permissible. The Indiana Supreme Court (p. 189) declares the hauling and boiling of large vats of water on Sabbath allowable; and the same court (p. 416) decides that mince pies and doughnuts in Sabbath is in conformity with their Sabbath laws; and civil courts since define the same. The Ohio Supreme Court holds the soul on craps or in dice is "not to be compatible with civil observance." Judge Stow, of Pennsylvania, in the case of Commonwealth vs. Griffith, says that oil mills may be running on the Sabbath day. How do such decisions tally with the command, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy"? And only when holly kept can it be said to be observed.

Then, by the express declaration of the Supreme Court, it is strictly compatible with the State idea of Sabbath observance, to run a grist mill, help gather walnuts, gather corn, work on the public roads, haul in crops, run glass and iron works, and do any other work pertaining interest demands require. Our Pennsylvania Supreme Court moreover decides that "proximity to totally inconceivable of any sharp definition and can not be appropriately defined," and that "the courts never inquire whether such work is of necessity or whether through improvements such labor may be abandoned."

If such labor constitutes Sabbath observance, what would constitute Sabbath desecration? It is the height of absurdity to expect to sustain a claim for a moment. It is not observance at all. Yet it is the observance civil law secures, and, by the quoted confession of the courts, the best day our secures through Sabbath laws.

Then it inevitably follows that the civil law does not secure *true* observance, or observance acceptable to God.

The exercise of religion is the best; manifestation of religion is worship, and worship is voluntary. Man's natural history, constituted in accordance with the division of salvation, the basic act which is love, revolts from the use of force in the observance of religious institution; "Sabbath for man," that is spiritual and force destroys the essential qualities of all worship and relegates the coerced victim's woe to the realm of hypocritical mummery, and that is spiritual and eternal death. God repudiates all force, and opens up his conception of human duty in that criterion of all religion—the moral law—the aim of which is perfect love to God and man.

The great Founder of that law here on earth, would not ally his cause with the civil power. Resisting attempted force, he says, "My kingdom is not of this world." "Who made me a judge or a ruler over you?" "They that take the sword shall perish by the sword." Nor did he use the sword, or the right to light temple with such unhallowed fire, for it is to be illumined by other and holier lights never to be extinguished. And learned and pious professor Christlieb came to teach Christ's religion of love best inculcated by force. Was he proves the Sabbath a purely religious institution. It must be admitted that Christianity repudiates all force in the observance of the Sabbath. The inevitable conclusion, and that Christianity repudiates the use of force in the observance of the Sabbath.

It is, I challenge of the fundamental ideas and plainest precepts of Christianity, some of its professors advocate the use of force. Crying out in alarm at the desecration of the day the pious alarm saved, they tack the penalties of law in hope of aid of, well knowing that were the hearts right there would be no profanation. But the heart is made right only by the boundless grace. Sabbath reform workers make when turning from it to court the favor of secular power.

Bishop Vincent says: "The Church must influence temporal power. All the Church wants is spiritual power, and this general whatever temporal power is involved in that. Christian rightly claims protection in the exercise of its religion, but protection does not mean support, patronage, or regulation of religion in any way. Christian, Jew, and pagan have a right to the exercise of the law, but none of them to its *support*. No one has the right to force on others the observance of the institutions of his religion, nor punish others for the profanation of a day he deems sacred. Every Christian republican should unite Church and State, that is the Roman Catholic Church and the State. There is a much broader application of these facts than this which restricts the warning to be derived from them to-day to the encroachments of the Romish propaganda.

The *Mail and Express* is a fair type of the merely a religious party in politics, predominantly popular—a party of monopoly in political religion which says, that one who practices ecumenicalism must not follow unless Protestant ecumenicalism must rule, and when Protestantism assents in right to civil rule it becomes no longer Protestant but Romish. The politicians are many, and the organizations almost legion, which are rapidly making the political arena this country's battle of religions, the character is can be said, in some degree, or the representative of the people in Congress, that their position can be told on any religious issue, so can it be long before it affects the religious sentiments of their constituency.

The distinction between protection of the Sabbath and enforced observance of the Sabbath is vast. It is fully proper for legislation to protect assemblies at church and religious meetings; against uproars, riots, and quietness. Yet these are not Sabbath laws as applicable to the American Bar Association. It is public opinion, if not, and not, that makes the Sunday rest perpetual. Without this opinion the proposal is good to us all, but enforced to it no law is needed. For, since all limitation can be settled as this, or civil law, and are forced only as public opinion sanctions such enforcement, it is do the people trust Christianity make its enforceable, by using the force which teaches us to deal with causes, and not with effects. The Sabbath cause will advance fastest by that which aims highest aim at, not is able to reach, the cause, it is useless.

THERE is a class of erratic unreliable men, who claim to be Christians, but who say that missionary societies to be converting, despise them, refers to the text of making these nations to accept public trusts in the national and State enterprise, or to sit in as honest. If so the churches in order, in their fancy, contribute nothing to the moral law, that God exists, and would come, ultimately and lawfully come to pass the Church of Christ, as was in the days by Roman impartial and by mere policy, under the comparison of civil patronage of the civil merits and patronage. —*Chr.*
