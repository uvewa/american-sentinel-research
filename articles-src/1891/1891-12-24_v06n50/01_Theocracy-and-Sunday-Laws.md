A THEOCRACY is essentially a religious government. Sabbath laws belong only with a theocracy. As Sunday laws are advocated upon a theory that Sunday is the Sabbath, so are they inseparable from a theocratical theory of government. In such a theory Sunday laws originated—with such a theory they belong, and every argument in behalf of Sunday laws is, in the nature of the case, compelled to presuppose a theocratical theory of government.

Nor can this result be avoided by calling it the "civil Sabbath." To call it the "civil Sabbath" and then attempt to support it as such by arguments, every one of which rests upon a theocratical basis, is simply to demonstrate that the title of "civil Sabbath" is only a contrivance to save appearances, and is essentially a fraud.
