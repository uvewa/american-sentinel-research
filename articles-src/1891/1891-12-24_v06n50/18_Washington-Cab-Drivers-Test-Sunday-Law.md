In order to test the Sunday law in reference to hacks and cabs, the cab drivers of Washington, D.C., are courting arrest. The Washington Post tells of it thus:—

One of the many hobbies of Ex-Commissioner Ludlow was that a regulation should be passed to clear the hack stands on Sunday. He eventually secured the adoption of a regulation prohibiting the congregating of hacks on the regular stands on Sunday, and this regulation also prohibited hack or cab drivers from soliciting on the streets. The law has been rigidly enforced. On Sundays one seeking a cab is obliged to go to a stable or to one of the depots in order to secure a conveyance. The cabs are allowed to go to the trains and pick up customers there. Their practice has been to drive to the depots and if a fare was not secured to drive rather rapidly along the avenue as though they either had a passenger or were going to answer a call sent to the stable for a vehicle. Though apparently driving along fully intent on an errand, they were really on the lookout for passengers, although it being the Sabbath, they were not allowed to say, "Cah, sir?"

The owners of cabs, hacks, bansoms etc., always considered it unjust both to themselves, and the public, that they should be excluded from the regular stands on Sunday. They have, therefore, instructed their men to drive along the avenue and streets and solicit custom, and to violate the regulation in order to test the validity of the law. Yesterday the officers of the first precinct arrested four drivers charged with a violation of the regulation.
