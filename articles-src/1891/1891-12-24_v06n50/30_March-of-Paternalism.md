The Louisville Courier Journal sees the onward "march of paternalism" in political and governmental affairs in this country and expresses itself, without reserve, in reference to the exhibition of this tendency in the highest branch of the Government. The Courier Journal says:—

The impression seems to prevail in the Senate that there is no interest which does not need the direction, supervision, protection, and encouragement of the Sanhedrim at Washington. Evidently the senators are losing their faith in popular government. They believe that the people are unequal to the task of taking care of themselves. We are sceptical upon this point. We have seen no indication at any recent session of Congress that the senators were endowed with superhuman wisdom.

They will need to be superhuman when they are required to put all the civil usages of this Nation on an undeniable religious basis, and maintain them there.
