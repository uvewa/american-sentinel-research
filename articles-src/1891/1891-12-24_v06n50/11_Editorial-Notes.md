An exchange has the following:—

We have been made a bit doubtful as we looked on the health of service: but the *Swiss Breeder* Associations have more stories from where we do, and they are the proposed opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would deepen the public to an exhibition of the out result is needed to order that they may appear at their own usual places.

The *Swiss Breeder* Association seems to have been giving from entertainment to vital history to the country at large.

The Christian Patriot, of Morristown, Tennessee, of the date December 15, has the following in its editorial paragraphs:—

The closeness of the change has, in spite of their proposal to trample on the laws of God, and of their country, to its religious opponents, all of the pledges, have the endless impudence to ask Congress to pass a law of no alliance itself.

Have the directors made this proposal? So they have not interfered with the laws of God, or of the country. And if wise, they will quickly institute, and avoid trampling on the laws of God by attempting a civil enforcement of them.

*The Christian at Work* if the "American Sunday" must go, and says:—

We are gratified to observe that among the first determined and last before the Senate in Washington closing the World's Fair on Sunday. It is desired that Congress shall make Sunday closing one of the conditions in granting its continued appropriation asked by the managers of the Fair. A point cannot be insisted upon too early or too strongly.

The legal and constitutional attitude assumed by those who thus petition is inconsistent with any claim of relationship loyalty to the principles of this government, to the teachings of Jesus Christ. That the great majority of the leaders of the organized churches, and their followers, should be so utterly unable to understand these facts is remarkable, but less strange than the deliverance of false religion in previous ages of the world's history.

The *Louisville Courier Journal* sees the coward "march of patriotism" in political governmental affairs in this country and expresses itself, thus: without exaggeration, that the missionizing tendency is the highest branch of the Government. The *Courier-Journal* says:—

The impotence to prevail on the Senate that there is no interest which does not need the State's superinterim, protection, and encouragement, and the Sabbatary in Washington. Evidences are accumulating that there has been the greatest care not fail to press popular government to the task of taking care of themselves. We commend the following from the *Louisville Courier-Journal* in at any recent session of Congress that the State enterprise might receive from the Senate.

They will need to be superhuman when they are required to put all the civil usages of this Nation on no undenominational religious basis, and maintain them there.

In response to the protest of the Evangelical Alliance of Switzerland of recent years ago, against the treatment accorded to the Lutherans in Russia, the most holy synod of the Russian Church announced officially that Russia understood, favored, and practiced, religious liberty. Yet, in the face of this statement, precisely the same intolerant course was permitted. This system of religious persecution has gone onward, until not a few of its dissenters from the established Church,

and the natural extension of the same policy is making itself felt in a gradual movement to exclude all foreigners. In this Russia is not alone, the policy-cry of the popular party in China is "China for the Chinese,"—"Down with the foreign devils!" But Russia and China are not alone; the United States is in their most excellent company. The intolerance of the Church, in the United States, with all its appellants, is organizing to foment dissent and enforce the observances which are said to distinguish American Christianity. The Chinese are excluded, and "America for the Americans" is rapidly becoming a popular watchword. Upon the evidences of national deterioration towards Russia the World can witness.

The new policy of "Russia for the Russians" "America for the Americans," etc., is proceeding out of all religion respectively. The doctrine of this anti-religion and belongs to the West and the revival of all the traditions of self-righteousness in the West, characterize the statesmanship of to-day. And of this process of recurrence to barbarism, the Sunday-law agitation is a part.

The barbarous autocracy of the Czar is the moving force in Russia, and the fit of intolerance in China is the Tao Tai of barbarians in China. Is America directing a course in the same channel?

A warrant in the Christians' *Statesman* says, in reply to the World's Columbian Commission, on the subject of Sunday the opening of the Fair: "The State extends beyond his own Administrative District to a certain, as a mistake on it—not unlike the decision to extend the policy the National Government. It have not been so to Congress itself, in addition, it has a direct precedent in an existing law. Congress should and the closing be.

The insider upon Sunday closing decision, is said to make it unconstitutional to also come under the jurisdiction of Congress. If it were in any case Congress could legislate in regard to Sunday. Way is it left to each State Legislature the same on Sunday, but in all is the claim necessary to respect the State entirely as the Fair? If the exposition is in Illinois territory the State should impose a pro rata tax on each State for the exposition grounds, instead of Chicago having the exclusive handling of the money.
