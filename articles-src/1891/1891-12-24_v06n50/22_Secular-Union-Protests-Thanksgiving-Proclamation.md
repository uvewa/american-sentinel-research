THE Secular Union of the State of Washington, has undertaken to fight the battles of the Church from a point of view which will probably not be appreciated. An earnest letter was addressed to the Governor of the State, protesting against the issuing of an official Thanksgiving proclamation; "because the proclamation of a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God, and recommending that all the people assemble at their respective places of worship and give thanks, etc. etc., is usurping the prerogative of the churches, and is an act of injustice, a violation alike of the national, and our own State Constitutions."

This is an unexpected source from which to hear a defense of the prerogatives of the Church. No doubt so sturdy a championship will be accepted in the same spirit that it is offered. When a point, so undeniably sound, is made in favor of the Church, it would be unfortunate if any uncharitable feeling as to its origin should militate in the least against its fullest usefulness.
