In response to the protest of the Evangelical Alliance of Switzerland, a few years ago, against the treatment accorded to the Lutherans in Russia, the most holy synod of the Russian Church announced officially that Russia understood, favored, and practiced, religious liberty. Yet, in the face of this statement, precisely the same intolerant course was persisted in. This system of religious persecution has been continued, until now it includes all dissenters from the established Church, and the natural extension of the same policy is making itself felt in a gradual movement to exclude all foreigners. In this Russia is not alone, the gathering cry of the popular party in China is "China for the Chinese,"—"Down with the foreign devils!" But Russia and China are not in their most excellent company. The entire body of the Church, in the United States, with all its appendages, is organizing to crush dissent and enforce the observances which are said to distinguish American Christianity. The Chinese are excluded, and "America for the Americans" is rapidly becoming a popular watchword. Upon the evidences of national intolerance in Russia the World says editorially:—

The new policy of "Russia for the Russians" means not alone the expulsion of foreigners but the stamping out of all religious nonconformity. The repudiation of all that belongs to the civilization of the West and the revival of all the traditions of medievalism are the chief aims of the Russian statesmanship of to-day. And of this process of barbarous retrogression the Czar is at once the author and chief promoter.

If the barbarous autocracy of the Czar is the moving force in Russia, and the fury of heathenism in China, what is the impulse which is directing affairs in this country in the same channel?
