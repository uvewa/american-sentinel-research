A REPRESENTATIVE of the licensed victuallers, brewers, and publicans, of London, expresses himself, in the London Echo, concerning the "Lord's Day Observance Society," after this manner:—

Sir,—I am very glad to see that the above excellent society is about to stop the National Sunday League in their evil and unnatural conduct of runing lectures and concerts, for the working classes, on Sunday evenings. Why, Sir, they have already four centres going, where the working classes crowd in hundreds, and I understand that they are about to open more in different districts in London. Now this comes hard on us; we are harassed on every side, first by one and then by another, and as we contribute about one-third of the national revenues of this Christian country, we deserve more consideration; and if these concerts are continued, drawing away our customers of a Sunday evening between seven and ten, I should like to know how we are to live. I am sure that both my brother licensed victuallers and the great brewers will be only too happy to subscribe to this Lord's Day Observance Society, and help them in their most righteous cause.

Yours,
A PUBLICAN.
