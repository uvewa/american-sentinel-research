"The Prohibition Party, in National Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power to govern, do hereby declare," etc., etc.— *Preamble, National Prohibition Platform.*

"As American citizens we especially ask you to place in your platform a plank, full recognition of these two great truths, namely, that our Lord Jesus Christ is the Ruler and Author of our Nation, and that the moral law is the rule of all our action in its civil and political relations."— *National Reform Petition to the Convention of the Prohibition Party.*

Does this indicate the sober sentiment of Christians generally? If they are descendants from forefathers who lived and died to found "a State without a 'religious ballot'?" If they do, it will ultimately not be an excuse of patriotism to our law so we have battled their customs?

Of course everybody knows that they had pronounced views on the total separation of Church and State. We fancy that we are true to that principle while the many of us are assiduously working to mix religion into government. Washington, the "father of his country," said: "Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen, is accountable alone to God for his religious opinions." He held that "religion is not in the purview of human government." Religion is beneficially distinct from government, and exempt from its cognizance. A connection between them is injurious to both." "We are teaching to the world that non-connected parties do better without them with them. The merit will be doubled by the other mere persons" accountable to God for its own, and the subjects' greater purity, without, than with, the aid of government." Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, said in the Virginia Assembly in 1785: "Almighty God hath created the mind free," all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments and burthens, or by civil incapacitations tend to only beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness." We all know, too, that the Constitution provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." And as if to make it forever certain that civil government should be entitled to receive Christianity as a fundamental principle of our civil laws, Washington's treaty with Tripoli,—which, like all our treaties, is declared by the Constitution to be part of the supreme law of the land—expressly says: "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

Our fathers must not to be understood as implying that this is a civil government. But they were hampered by many difficulties. Only after a bitter and continued agitation did the Colonies finally adopt the Constitution. Its framers did not dare to put into it a prohibition upon the States, forbidding them to establish State religions, because some or every one had been followed by the followers of some sect. The result was, that the old "Connecticut and Church-and-State 'Blue Laws'" still remain on the statute books of some of the States. In the District of Columbia, in the year of prior 1861, there is in force (lacking only the enforceable) an unrepealed law, enacted in 1723, which provides that "any person who shall blasphemously, civilly, and advisedly, by writing or speaking, deny the Holy Trinity, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of three persons, or the unity of the Holy Trinity, . . . shall be forced through the jail and fined  twenty pounds sterling," and in case the said fine is not levied, the offender shall suffer six months' imprisonment without bail, . . . for the second offence, the offender . . . shall be stigmatized by branding on the forehead the letter B and fined forty pounds sterling; . . . and in case the same can not be levied, the offender shall suffer twelve months' imprisonment without bail, . . . and for the third offence, . . . the offender shall suffer death without the benefit of the clergy.

Were such a thing to be read about as a law of the Dark Ages we would doubtless thank our fortunate star that we had lived to see better days; yet familiarity with our modern religious liberties has in a measure dulled our sense of keen of their inestimable value.

On the critical question there now a tendency in the theory that the government is "a moral person" accountable to God for its own and the subjects' sin. And so we hear ardent "Reformers" protesting against "that old Philadelphia lie," that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed," all according to this teaching the State is the parent of the people, and irrespective to it. A cooperation, of accepting and recognizing associations of our country is learning to commit itself to the policy of legislation on questions of a religious character, plainly repugnant to the original principles of our American political system, to try and to work their gradually and relentlessly into popularity. The movement constituted in a great reform convention held in Ohio during the most critical period of our civil war, to determine for what or great national our beloved country was being so grievously punished. This question finally resolved itself into a political organization called "The National Reform Association." Their avowed object was "to secure such an amendment to the Constitution as will declare the nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the Christian usages, laws, and institutions of the Christian religion, placing all Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our government on an undeniably legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." And this body with its auxiliary associations, is maintained to pledged accomplishment of its purposes.

This movement was fashioned, not by Romanists, but by a prominent body of Protestant Christians, and from the start some of their most prominent members said: "*National Reformers is simply the profession of the principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church for the rest of the Nation.*" (The italics are his own.) And this means to Americans, and it means to this country, that it comes from within, not from without, the evangelical churches.

the bayonet, and the ballot, has become every instrument among the vast possessions of those who are accepted as the leaders of religious and moral reform in this country. Both suggestions of violence as threatening almost to approval, are certainly not to be harmonize with the command of the Master to Peter, "Put up again thy sword into his place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Both utterances upon the subject of civil and religious liberty as those of Dr. Talmage, and that of Rev. Earle Cranston, quoted elsewhere, are examples either of unexcused ignorance from such sources, or of wilful blindness. The language of violence in which they indulge is utterly unbecoming. It is the open expression of anarchists and ought to be met with the whole public condemnation as the inflammatory incitement to violence of the Chicago "Reds."

"The question of the relation of the Church to the State is agitating France. This question takes its origin from the thoughtless act of a French Catholic Bishop to Rome, who wrote on the church register of the church at Rome— 'Long live the Pope.' This was understood as a bit of bravado directed against the Italian Government, which is of course, the improper power of the Pope. Excitement ran high, and at once it was feared by many that violence, until the situation became so serious that the French Government felt compelled to ask protection for French subjects in Italy,—to which the Italian authorities responded and suppressed all disturbances. Much bitter feeling, however, continued. In order to withhold further food for disorder, the French 'Minister of Public Worship' sent a circular to the French bishops, requesting them not to promote or conduct any more pilgrimages to the holy city, for the present. To this very reasonable request, for the avoidance of difficulty which threatened international complications, the bishops returned in many instances indecent and insolent replies. The Archbishop of Aix has been brought before a civil court to answer for his language to a public officer, and resistance to the civil authorities. This movement to a political prelate, and has taken a similar position, in France, to the Covenanter in this country in reference to voting. The French Chamber of Deputies has been drawn into the discussion and much political, legislative, and religious, significances attaches to the matter. It is a part of the world-wide politico-political movement, of which the National Reform party and its allies are the exponents in this country."
