An exchange has the following:—

We never knew that a Sabbath was conducive to the health of swine; but the Swine Breeders' Association know more about swine than we do, and they say the proposed opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday would deprive the animals on exhibition of the rest which is needed in order that they may appear at their best.

The Swine Breeders' Association seems to have been giving free lessons in natural history to the country at large.
