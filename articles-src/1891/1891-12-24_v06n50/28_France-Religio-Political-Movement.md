The question of the relation of the Church to the State is agitating France, and the present activity of the discussion takes its origin from the thoughtless act of a French Catholic pilgrim to Rome, who wrote on the church register of the Pantheon at Rome—"Long live the Pope." This was understood as a bit of bravado directed against the Italian Government, and in favor of the temporal power of the Pope. Excitement ran high, and the pilgrims were threatened with violence, until the situation became so serious that the French Government felt compelled to ask protection for French subjects in Italy,—to which the Italian authorities responded and suppressed all disturbances. Much bitter feeling, however, continued. In order to withhold further food for disorder, the French "Minister of Public Worship" sent a circular to the French bishops, requesting them not to promote or conduct any more pilgrimages to the holy city, for the present. To this very reasonable request, for the avoidance of difficulty which threatened international complications, the bishops returned in many instances disdainful and insolent replies. The Archbishop of Aix has been brought before a civil court to answer for his language to a public officer, and resistance to the civil authorities. This Archbishop is a political prelate, and has taken a similar position, in France, to the Covenanters in this country in reference to voting. The French Chamber of Deputies has been drawn into the discussion and much political, legislative, and religious, significance attaches to the matter. It is a part of the world-wide religio-political movement, of which the National Reform party and its allies are the exponents in this country.
