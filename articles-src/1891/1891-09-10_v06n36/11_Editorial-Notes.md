# Editorial Notes.

[page 288]

THE *Sun* expresses the opinion that the same principle is involved in the question of opening the World's Fair on Sunday, that was in opening the Metropolitan Museum of Art in this city on that day, and that it will be decided in the same way.

---

It is stated that the Mayor of Philadelphia has ordered all the street horse-cars attached to that city closed on Sunday, the street cars and extension boats are still running, however, and the well-to-do church member still reads his Sunday newspaper, eats his elaborate Sunday dinner, and takes his Sunday drive, just as usual.

It is to the credit of the Pennsylvania Prohibitionists that at their recent State Convention the usual Sunday rest plank was omitted from the platform. A resolution, independent of the platform, opposing the appropriation of the State funds for the World's Fair if opened on Sunday, was passed, however, by a Protest vote delegates, and was passed by the Convention. The platform was also given a religious coloring by this introduction—

The Prohibition Party of the State of Pennsylvania, in Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as the rightful Sovereign of all men from whom the just powers of government are derived.

This is all right if rightly understood; but we fear that the Pennsylvania Prohibitionists do not intend it in the only sane admissible without letting go their basis to all the vagaries and abuses of avowed National Reform. The resolution in which each resolution is discussed in an article on the first page of this paper.

---

The Prohibition Convention at Albany, on the 3d inst., set forth this declaration.

The Prohibition Party of the State of New York, in Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as Governor of the Nation.

There are some necessary deductions to be made from this, that possibly our Prohibitionist friends have not thought of. If God is the Ruler of this Nation it follows that those who make and administer the laws of the Nation are simply His vicegerents.

The Prohibitionists are striving after [page 288 col 2] the power to make and administer the laws.

It follows that they propose to rule as God's vicegerents. The claim is neither better nor worse than that of the Papacy, for it is the same.

---

If the Prohibitionists wish to acknowledge God in a way that will not involve the nominalizing assumption of divine right, let them adopt the immortal words of the Declaration of Independence.

We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among those are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

And let them further declare that as the blessings of civil government are for all men,—for both the just and the unjust, alike for the servants of God and for him that serveth him not,—and that as a small minority of the men of any nation have ever been truly the servants of God, and so, for the most part, civil government is necessarily in the hands of men who really know not God, it is manifest that in civil affairs men are to be governed only by the law of natural right—that great law that is the base to which all human law that the natural man can properly appreciate and rightly interpret; and because God in his infinite wisdom has made it ample for all the needs of human government, and is truly honored by obedience to it.

[page 288 col 3]

This resolution which ought to have been passed long ago, will operate to prevent such disgraceful arrests as those noted in these columns two weeks ago. The act had special reference to a certain reprehensible system of espionage upon saloons, a system that while accomplishing nothing for the cause of temperance was demoralizing the guardians of the peace of the city; but it will doubtless serve to protect from police outrage small shopkeepers, and other dealers in small commodities.

NATIONAL Reformers and American Sabbath Unionists should demand that no persecution would result from the success of their movement, but such result amounts to nothing; and the fact remains that the logic of their scheme stops nothing short of the prosecution of "common" violators. Of course they would not call fines and imprisonment persecution. The Catholics never persecuted: they only adjusted the Church's guilt in voluntary seclusion of civil law, and then turned them over to the civil authorities to be punished for the good of the State, as a warning to evil doers? and this is just what the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Unionists propose. They would not say to those who violate their Sunday laws, have the civil authorities punish by fines, imprisonment, and still-standing and they who do not readily submit themselves to the proposed regime.

Every one should read the article on another page, "Lakeside and National Reform." It reveals the true history of some of who are posting for the Church and the Church as the apostle of "reform" in the interests of the "poor working man." The writers who are really trying to establish an American soil a despotism as cruel as any that ever cursed the priest-ridden countries of Europe.

We cannot take a single step in the matter of religion without injury. We have no right in this country, which invited all persons of all creeds, to set up the icons of our religious nations as against the religious nations that any one else may honestly hold. Just as far as we proceed, we set for ourselves in the nullity which is the basis of our Government.

SEPTEMBER 1, the Police Commissioners of this city passed a bill declaring that the Board "disapproves in general of any action on the part of the force partaking of the character of scouts or spies, or of acting in a surreptitious manner in the discharge of its duty."

Two to three weeks since we noted the fact that on certain Brooklyn church members, dancing was prohibited on Sunday, but that the boats made their trips to Rockaway Beach on that day as usual, and beer was sold at the bar the same as on other days. The place (?) owners could tolerate Sunday excursionists even Sunday liquor selling, but drew the line at Sunday dancing! Another fact is worthy of note. The Sunday at North Beach, Long Island. The yacht-coaches, the merry-go-rounds, the toboggan slide, the Wild West show, and numerous other nickel-catching devices run full blast, and even the saloons are open on Sundays as on other days, but the authorities draw the line at dancing, and it is prohibited on Sunday. Such facts simply emphasize the absurdity of Sunday laws in general, and of such Sunday regulations in particular.
