NATIONAL Reformers and American Sabbath Unionists have denied that persecution would result from the success of their movement, but such denials amount to nothing; and the fact remains that the logic of their scheme stops nothing short of persecution for conscience' sake. Of course they would not call fines and imprisonment persecution. The Catholics never persecuted! they only adjudged people to be guilty of violation of the civil law, and then turned them over to the civil authorities to be punished for the good of the State, and as a warning to evil doers! And this is just what the National Reformers and the American Sabbath Unionists propose. They would not persecute; no, not they; they would only have the civil authorities punish by fines, imprisonment, and disfranchisement, those who do not readily submit themselves to the proposed regime.
