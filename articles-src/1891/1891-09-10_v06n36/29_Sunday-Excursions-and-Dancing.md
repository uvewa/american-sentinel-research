Two or three weeks since we noted the fact that on certain excursion boats owned by Brooklyn church members, dancing was prohibited on Sunday, but that the boats made their trips to Rockaway Beach on that day as usual, and beer was sold at the bar the same as on other days. The pious (?) owners could tolerate Sunday excursions and even Sunday liquor selling, but drew the line at Sunday dancing! The same monstrous inconsistency is observable at North Beach, Long Island. The razzle-dazzles, the merry-go-rounds, the toboggan slide, the Wild West show, and numerous other nickel-catching devices run full blast, and even the saloons are open on Sundays as on other days, but the authorities draw the line at dancing, and it is prohibited on Sunday! Such facts simply emphasize the absurdity of Sunday laws in general, and of such Sunday regulations in particular.
