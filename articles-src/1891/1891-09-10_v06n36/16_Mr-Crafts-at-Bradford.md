As noted last week, Mr. Crafts has been at Bradford, Pennsylvania, and here is what the Era of that city says about it editorially:—

> Rev. Mr. Crafts has discovered that Bradford people, as a whole, have less respect for Sunday than any other town in the United States, or the world, perhaps, and wants a law passed to instill a due amount of reverence into our citizens. There is less sniveling hypocrisy here than in many another town, no doubt, but the standard of morality is just as high as you will find anywhere else. Like a coconut, the rough side of Bradford is out. However, there is nothing here to shock the most refined moral sense, more than in any other town, excepting the fact that cigars, fruits, soda water, etc., are sold openly on Sunday instead of clandestinely.

> The fact has been abundantly demonstrated by repeated experiments that you cannot make a man religious by passing Blue Laws. You may succeed in making a hypocrite of him, but a careful analysis of his heart will not show any stronger traces of true piety than before. But because the Bradford City Council concluded to leave it to the consciences of the people whether or not they should buy or sell on Sunday, Rev. Crafts denounced them as being "worse than the Chicago anarchists—and they were hanged." The real truth is this: The more freedom you give the people the stronger they will develop, both morally and intellectually. Individual responsibility is the best. If the law could make it impossible for all men to do evil, how much credit would they deserve for their abstinence? and how would we distinguish the bad from the good? The intolerance that stifles free thought and dwarfs the heart and brain of man is the worst cannibalism. It consumes the soul instead of the flesh.
