This heading might lead one to think that quotations were to be made from a number of statements from the various organizations favoring Sunday laws, telling of their deep interest in and sorrow for the trial of Mr. King, of Tennessee.

As the readers of THE SENTINEL are well aware, the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and other organizations that are working to secure Sunday laws and their enforcement, have asserted with great emphasis that such legislation would work no hardships to any, and that no one would be persecuted who saw fit to observe another day. And they are not slow to denounce Russia for her persecution of the Jews, and to say that such oppression is only becoming to a cruel despot.

But R. M. King, of Tennessee, was indicted for quietly plowing in his field on Sunday, after he had carefully observed the previous day as the Sabbath. He has been prosecuted through the various courts of Tennessee, up to the Supreme Court of that State, and has just received the confirmation of the sentences of all the lower courts by the United States Circuit Court remanding him to prison or pay a fine. And all this in a land that boasts of her religious freedom. Yes, and caused by the enforcement of laws that the various organizations that are working to secure such legislation, have gravely told us would never interfere with the rights or religious freedom of any one.

Now if the National Reformers, and allied organizations are the friends and champions of religious liberty, as they insist that they are, why don't we hear of some of them denouncing the persecution of Mr. King? Is there any element of justice in a man being fined and imprisoned for quietly performing honorable labor on Sunday? Even if Mr. King had not sacredly observed the day before, could it be said that any of the principles of equity and right would admit of fines and imprisonment being imposed on him for quiet labor on a day that is religiously observed by some of his fellows? Certainly any one who is free from bigotry and the mediaeval spirit of intolerance, will say that such persecution or prosecution, whichever we might please to call it, is wrong in every sense of the word.

In the matters that are purely civil we have it, as the established American principle that majorities are to rule. This is the most perfect of all forms of governmental doctrine, and under its benign influence our liberty is the boast of our Nation. No less important is another of the principles underlying our system of government, and that is, that in matters of conscience the right of the minority is to be sacredly guarded, even if that minority should chance to be a single individual. We could not have religious freedom without sacredly guarding this principle. The Japanese who pays his devotion to Buddha, the Hindoo, who pours out his petitions before the quadruple-faced image of Brahma, the Chinese paying his adorations to Joss, or the Christian who with enlightened understanding devoutly lifts his voice in prayer and praise to the one all-powerful Creator and his Son, Jesus Christ, all these, yea, and even he who disbelieves all religions, stand on an equality before our just laws, and are alike accorded their right to worship or refrain from it as they may choose.

The Christian is pained to see his less enlightened neighbor, worshiping at the shrine of an idol which has been fashioned by the hand of man; he feels sorrowful to hear the blasphemous oath or behold the derisive sneer of him who would reject the world's Redeemer. But all he can do is to instruct, persuade, entreat. God has so ordained it, and our Government has tried thus far to keep the bigot with his intolerant zeal from invading the sacred precincts of conscience.

The case of Mr. King is plainly that of one whose rights of conscience have been invaded. And if Sunday laws are not intended to work hardships to any, why do not their advocates denounce this persecution of Mr. King as unjust and tyrannical? Why spend all their vocabulary of invectives upon the Czar of Russia, when we have cases of oppression right at home, if not so cruel, at least quite similar to that of the Jews in the country of the Russian bear?

Sunday laws are purely religious, no matter what other name we may give them, and their enforcement can do nothing else than end in religious persecution. And the silence of the National Reformers, and kindred Sunday-law associations, upon a case that has attracted such widespread attention as that of Mr. King, speaks volumes in regard to the hidden purpose of Sunday legislation. If they do not intend that Sunday laws shall oppress any one, but only to have them operate for the good of man, why don't some of them come out and denounce the prosecution of Mr. King as cruel and unjust? The fact that they do not do it, leaves room for many reflections in regard to the real motives of those who are the prime movers in this work of Sunday legislation.
