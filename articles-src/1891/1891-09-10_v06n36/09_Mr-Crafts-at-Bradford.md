# Mr. Crafts at Bradford.

[page 286]

AS noted last week, Mr. Crafts has been at Bradford. Some may think that we overstate what that city says about it editorially.

Rev. Mr. Crafts has been at Bradford. The people, as a whole, have less respect for Sunday legislation to-day than when he came. He created still a fine stream of reverence into our citizens. The fact is, the Sunday question and its effect is just as high as you will find anywhere else. Like every man, if his coming had the slightest tendency to create a sentiment of reverence among the people, we will readily acknowledge it. However, there is nothing to alarm the most experienced experimentors that you cannot make a tree religious by passing all laws. You may succeed in making a hypocrite of him, but a careful analysis of his hand will help any man or woman who has a desire to keep the law of God in the heart. And City Council concluded to leave it to the citizens as to whether they should have their liberty of will on Sunday. Rev. Crafts denounced them as a "Godless City Council." What he wants is more freedom you give the people the stronger they draw to a conclusion. Why isn't that the better answer? and how would we distinguish the him from the prophet? The endeavor to sell this land to make it impossible for all sorts to do evil, however much it may add to the discomfort of the community, will neither establish the evil thereof.

The advocates of Sunday laws are just now making a desperate effort to convince the workingman that it is ruined by its opponents in getting Sunday work, a working-day divorce; desist, man. Any such work, a bondage, this divorce; the more not to rest on Sunday, but provision that the same law will prevent him to misuse its whole sun-lit opportunity.

Recently an American Sabbath Union lecturer, after a monotonous portrayal of "our modern Sunday system" Sunday described "sleeplessness and disgust in his tone." "I am astonished that the common man has never raised his voice against the construction on account of working on Sundays, in favor of Sunday laws with a blanket exemption for everybody." Allowing the fact that the Sun-day laws of the various States do this on a Sunday the statutes leave us a dead, and each one which may set any time be revised by some religious bigot. He has no laws similar to those in other States that have been enacted (lately) the only way to do in this country what the above indicates, namely to be so assured is to repeal totally and forever every Sunday law in the statute book of the Union. In this, and in this way alone, will the rights of the Sabbatarian Christian, and the conscientious Jew, in this country be protected from the demands of the ever-encroaching Sunday legislation.

REV. MCLAIN, in explaining the objects of the National Reform Association at a recent evening address, said a movement similar to the same work was noticed in this Government years and years ago. We have read of that movement and its sad consequences, and have regarded the present movement as "similar," but until now were able to see an official statement to that effect.

It is what we have been always asserting—that to make the Federal Constitution make it obligatory upon the people to observe some day as a day of rest, is on a par with the design entertained by Madison, Jefferson and other founders of the Government to get the National Government, if they could, to protect such State legislation, if they could, which State legislation if they could keep in check. Thus the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Sabbath Alliance, etc. The case of R. M. King, in the Circuit Court of Tennessee, is another point, and is published in that form by the National Religious Liberty Association from the same Court, and the result will be looked for with great interest.
