Paul says, "God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers." 1 Cor. 12:28. In Eph. 4:11-13, he enumerates substantially the same classes, and states for what purpose and for how long a time God set them in the Church: "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God."

But ambitious and unregenerate professors have been wont to bring another element into the gospel plan,—that of force. They have sought to set kings, emperors, and rulers in the Church. Even in our own day, and here in republican America, this idea is being advocated and fostered. Men are asking for laws requiring all to keep Sunday, and making it obligatory that religion shall be taught in the public school. With this fact in mind it may be well to ask what the end will be, and look for an answer in the history of the past, as history repeats itself. Bower thus describes an attempt of the Emperor Justinian, in the year 532 A. D., to bring all into the unity of the faith:—

> While the Arian king was striving, by the most just and equitable laws, to clear the Church from all simony in the West, the Catholic Emperor (Justinian) was employing the most unjust and unchristian means of clearing her from all heresies in the East, that of persecution, and the most cruel persecution any Christian emperor had yet set on foot, or countenanced. By an edict which he issued to unite all men in one faith, whether Jews, Gentiles, or Christians, such as did not, in the term of three months, embrace and profess the Catholic faith, were declared infamous, and, as such, excluded from all employments, both civil and military, rendered incapable of leaving anything by will, and their estates confiscated, whether real or personal. These were convincing arguments of the truth of the Catholic faith; but many, however, withstood them; and against such as did, the imperial edict was executed with the utmost rigor. Great numbers were driven from their habitations with their wives and children, stript and naked. Others betook themselves to flight, carrying with them what they could conceal, for their support and maintenance; but they were plundered of the little they had, and many of them inhumanly massacred by the Catholic peasants, or the soldiers who guarded the passes.—Bower's History of Popes, Vol. 1, pages 333, 334.

The gospel seeks to persuade men by the meekness and gentleness of Christ. National Reform seeks to drive men by the power of civil Government. Therefore National Reform is opposed to the gospel.
