# The States and Religious Liberty.

[page 282]

THE Prohibitionists who always have held that there could be no union between Church and State anywhere in this country, a recent decision of Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court of Tennessee, comes as a startling surprise. A resident of that commonwealth has been convicted of violating a State law by working on Sunday. The matter was brought before the Federal court, where an attempt was made to establish that the law was unconstitutional. Judge Hammond, however, declared that "the several States have the right to make whatever laws they please on the subject of religion. They may make Sunday laws of the strictest character; not only this, but they may establish a creed and a church."

Such legislation is forbidden to the national Government under the Constitution, but there is no such prohibition on any State, unless the people of that State have laid it themselves. In any case, however, the United States would have no right to interfere with such laws. Judge Hammond contended that since the national Government is expressly prohibited from dealing with religious matters, such matters, existing in the Constitution limiting the powers of the States in the particular, the legal inference is that such powers are reserved to the States.

In this view shall be sustained by the United States Supreme Court, it will rest [page 283] with the people of the States separately to say whether or not they will be true to the spirit in which this Nation was founded, and which has prevailed through its life. The fuller liberty has been enjoyed in religious matters, with perhaps some exceptions such as that which has given occasion for Judge Hammond's decision. It would be absolutely certain that no change would follow anywhere if Americans were to remain as they now are and as they have been from the first. If, however, the plans for religious combination and new coalition such as were originally formulated in the Citizenry propositions were to be carried out, it might readily be believed that one or more States "in this Union would be greeted in time with a creed and a church."—*American.*
