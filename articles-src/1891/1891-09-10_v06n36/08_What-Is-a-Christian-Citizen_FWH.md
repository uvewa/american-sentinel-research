"So you want to get religion?" "I do." "What do you want to be—Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian, or what?" "To tell the truth I hadn't thought of any of them; I want to be a Christian."—New York Press.

APART from the intended humor of this little squib, and the possible indication of a commendable sincerity in its last clause, there is much that ought to be very suggestive to National Reformers and their sympathizers. It is fairly probable that a large proportion of these unwisely zealous people "hadn't thought" of their individual relations to a national Christianity (?) in exactly this light. It ought to be worth while to give the subject a careful consideration.

These people emphatically assert that this is a "Christian Nation;" and therefore they are working indefatigably to make it a Christian Nation, by having its Christian character recognized in the national Constitution and laws. Notwithstanding these inconsistencies, they are discerning enough to know that the realization of their plans demands that some "practical" influence be brought to bear upon the individual citizen. But instead of employing the only influence which the Author of Christianity ever authorized to be used for man's reformation—teaching and persuasion, their programme is to legislate men into this "Christian Nation." The most obvious way of carrying out this idea is to compel the individual to conform to an outward appearance of worship in harmony with orthodox Christian teaching. An appropriate time must be set apart for this, and so there must be laws regulating his observance of the "Christian Sabbath"—though to disarm a certain prejudice which Americans have for non-interference in religious matters, it is better to pass such laws ostensibly to "protect the American Sabbath," or the "civil Sabbath." It is true that some will see an apparent incongruity in the first expression, but the latter term is particularly available because it mixes the religious and secular in such inextricable confusion that it is sure to deceive those who are to be the elect citizens of this Christian Nation.

With these paternal provisions made for the religious welfare of the individual, the attention of these would-be reformers is naturally directed to a consideration of the influence which this Christian Nation should exert upon nations. We are soon to have a great World's Fair. It ought to be the occasion of exhibiting to the assembled hosts that we are a Simon Pure Christian Nation—because we are, you know. So the gates of this great Exposition must be closed through all the hours of the Christian Sabbath, in order that all peoples, kindreds, tribes, and nations may know that in Chicago the "American Sunday" is not the "Continental Sunday." Incidentally, too, this will greatly strengthen the faith of some of our own countrymen who are not yet quite sure they are full Christian citizens—though of course this is doubtless a "Christian Nation."

But we stop to wonder whether these zealous reformers have ever thought of these things this way. We wonder if they have ever thought what kind of a creed they will all individually subscribe to when their plans are worked out. Who will prescribe it? What will be the final authority in its preparation and interpretation? What the penalty for heresy? Whither shall the spirit of Liberty have flown?

Isn't it worth while to stop and ponder seriously and long the thought suggested in this fact: If a man honestly before God feels to say, "I want to be a Christian," may he not do it by divine help without any assistance or dictation from civil Government? If he does not want to be a Christian, can Government do anything more than to make him a hypocrite?
