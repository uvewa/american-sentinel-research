THE following is from the May number of the Christian Press, a paper advocating Sunday laws and their rigid enforcement:—

> Conviction may be forced upon us, but conversion will never be. Does God call me? Does he love me? Does he need me? Are questions to which I may be compelled to give an affirmative answer; but, Will I yield to him? Is a question which must be decided by myself, and which I am free to decide. Many are making the fatal mistake of waiting for conversion to be forced upon them, and they persuade themselves that they honor God by waiting for "God's own time." God's accepted time and day of salvation is now.

That paragraph has the good old gospel ring. Then why enforce Sunday observance? Any Christian should be in favor of the sentiment expressed in the foregoing, and be ready to work for it with all his might. Enforced Sunday observance would not be a whit better than enforced conversion. The Press can see the one, why can it not see the other just as clearly?
