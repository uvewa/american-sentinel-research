THE Sunday Gazetteer of Denison, Texas, after stating the charge against R. M. King, of Tennessee, says:—

> His attorney held that his punishment was in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which says, "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens in the United States," and it specifies that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States." On the other hand Judge Hammond rules that this amendment did not reach the question at issue. The first Constitutional Amendment says emphatically that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," but this is construed by the judge as applying only to Congress and as having no binding force upon the States, and he goes so far as to say that there is left to the States the most absolute power on the subject of religious legislation, and any of them may, if they choose, establish a creed and a church and maintain it.

> If Judge Hammond's opinion is correct, and the Supreme Court should so decide, religious freedom in this Republic is in danger. Any powerful religious sect might be able to get political control of a State, establish a State religion, and then make it exceedingly unpleasant for dissenters to remain within its borders. It has been the popular belief that the Federal Constitution made it obligatory upon the States to maintain religious freedom for all citizens, and that was the understanding of Madison, Jefferson and other founders of the Government. If they were wrong and Judge Hammond is right, the people will have to carefully watch State legislation if they would keep in check the growing tendency to more closely unite Church and State, a sentiment already pushing its way into politics, through such organizations as the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Sabbath Alliance, etc. The King case will be taken to the United States Supreme Court, and the result will be looked for with much interest.
