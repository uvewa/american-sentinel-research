It is stated that the Mayor of Philadelphia has ordered all the street shoe-blacking stands in that city closed on Sunday. The street cars and excursion boats are still running, however, and the well-to-do church member still reads his Sunday paper, eats his elaborate Sunday dinner, and takes his Sunday drive, just as usual.
