REV. McCLAIRS, in explaining the objects of the American Sabbath Union in a recent Sunday evening address, stated that a movement similar to theirs was inaugurated in England several hundred years ago. We have read of that movement and its sad consequences, and have regarded the present movement as "similar," but until now were without an official statement to that effect.
