It is to the credit of the Pennsylvania Prohibitionists that at their recent State Convention the usual Sunday-law plank was omitted from the platform. A resolution, independent of the platform, opposing the appropriation of the State funds for the World's Fair if opened on Sunday, was offered, however, by a Forest County delegate, and was passed by the Convention. The platform was also given a religious coloring by this introduction:—

> The Prohibition Party of Pennsylvania, in Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power in government, do hereby declare.

This is all right if rightly understood; but we fear that the Pennsylvania Prohibitionists do not intend it in the only sense admissible without letting down the bars to all the vagaries and abuses of so-called National Reform. The danger which lurks in such resolutions is discussed in an article on the first page of this paper.
