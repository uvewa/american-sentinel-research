# Sunday and the Fair.

[page 286]

ON the 5th inst., the National Columbian Commission at Chicago is hearing to the advocates of the Sunday closing of the Fair.

Col. Elliot F. Shepard, a President of the American Sabbath Union, presented the memorials of the Union, praying for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. He also, as President of the Sabbath Observance Committee of the General Assembly of that body for its own sake. He likewise read a strong letter from President Harrison of the University of Pennsylvania, giving his assurance to the movement, and also its memorial in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, passed by the Farmers' Alliance Convention last day.

Rev. Sylvester Scovel, President of Wooster College, Wooster, Ohio, gave a brief review of the history of Sunday legislation and Sunday Observance, and their effects on the nation, socially and otherwise.

Gen. O. O. Howard presented the question from the patriotic point of view, quoting from Washington, Lincoln, Grant, McClellan, and President Harrison.

Rev. T. A. Fernley, of Philadelphia, had before the Commission the appeal of 500,000 names presented to the Commission, including nearly 500,000 names, that Sunday laws were not founded on religion, or a religious purpose, and that the Fair should remain permanently free without a day of rest.

Hon. Thomas Crafts,—of Iowa, representing the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, presented the subject on behalf of that organization, and the wage-earner in general.

Rev. Francis E. Patton, President of Princeton University, presented the question from the biblical point of view. He said he had no doubt of the commercial success of the Exposition, but the most important point in interest was the religious side.

H. L. Chase presented a petition from 12,000 citizens of Illinois, representing the American Sabbath Union, claiming that he and others present personally represented the individual interests of more than forty-seven millions of the population, including the United States, who, with their representative ministers and church members, actually at forty-seven millions of the population, the Commission shall take action on the Sunday-closing question which be deliberated until the broad directors of the Exposition have made their rules and submitted them to the Commission for approval.

The opinion is confidently expressed by the advocates of Sunday-closing that the Fair will be closed. The decision may, however, be delayed for some time yet. Meanwhile the interest in the proposed reforms is growing.
