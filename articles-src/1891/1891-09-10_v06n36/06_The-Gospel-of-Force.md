# The Gospel of Force.

[page 285]

PAUL says, "God set in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers." 1 Cor. 12: 28. In Eph. 4:11, 13, he enumerates substantially the same classes, and states for what purpose and for how long a time God set them in the Church; "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God."

In all ages since the Apostle's day, missionaries and preachers and friends of God's cause have been wont to bring another element into the gospel place, of force. They have sought to set up kings, emperors, and rulers in the Church. Even in our own day, and here in republican America, this idea is being advocated and fostered. Men are laying for old and leaving all to keep Sunday, and making a sin against nature of being willing to attend the public school. With this fact in mind it may be well to ask what the end will be, and seek for an answer in the history of the past, as history repeats itself. Those who describe any catering of that Emperor Justinian, in the year 533 i.e. to bring about the unity of the faith by force.

While the Arian king was striving, by the most just and equitable laws, to unite the Church from all sects in one faith, whether Jews, Gentiles, Donatists, Arians, it matters not, the whole Catholic Empire would assume then at, like a true son of the medieval spirit, to obtain national, embrace and profess the Catholic faith, went despotic influence, and, on the earth, wielded from all employments, both civil and military, and compelled menials of having servants willing to suffer all this estate confiscated, whether real or personal. Those were common instruments of the old Roman Catholic faith: but many, however, withstood them, and against much and more, did their inspiration was rewarded with the utmost rigor. Great numbers were driven from their habitations with their wounded and sickened infirm, and many old women took themselves to flight, carrying with them what articles of value they could bear on their persons; but they were plundered of the little they had, and were subjected to hunger, cold, thirst, the passionate barbarity of thieves of Catholic persuasion, or the soldiers who guarded the passes.—*Bower's History of the Popes.* Vol. I, pp. ——.

The gospel seeks to persuade men by the meekness and gentleness of Christ. National Reform seeks to drive men by the power of civil Government. Therefore National Reform is opposed to the gospel.
