# What Rights Have the Minority?

[page 282]

ALL men are created equal. It then follows that each person in the minority has just the same rights as any person in the majority. In other words, the same respect, protection, and natural rights must be guaranteed to each individual without regard to whether he be one of the many or one of the few. It is the grand measure of this country that the weakest shall be afforded equal protection with the strongest that made the free government in contradistinction to the despotic power; and having this principle clearly in view the early American statesmen aimed to incorporate into our political system such a guarantee of the rights of the minority, that those rights would never be trampled upon, no matter how numerous or overwhelming the majority might be.

When the foundations of this Government were the fundamental and inalienable rights of man declared, but our Government was organized into three separate, distinct, and sovereign departments for the express purpose of each being a check upon the other should it be inclined to violate the Constitution by infringing in any way upon the rights of the people.

John Adams, while vice-president, in his "Defence of the Constitutions and Government of the United States of America," called attention to the inclination of majorities to oppress minorities, and in so doing, fully predicted the despotism of the judiciary departments of our Government, in addition to the legislative or representative departments. Mr. Adams said:—

> Since all men are so inclined to act according to their own will and interests, to making, administering, and executing laws, to the prejudice of the people's liberty and security, the people must at once constitute more departments of power in the Government, each to be solely lodged in one assembly; though each assembly be safely trusted with its own department, and its just limits; their leaders, the principal people, will commonly be in one assembly, the people themselves, or their common representatives, will compose the other; and each must have a power to defend itself, its own authority, its rights, and interests, against the other, and govern laws for their own watch, power, grandeur, and glory to the prejudice of the liberty and security of the minority.

The minority, to secure justice to all, must be protected. Hence, the majority can not be trusted with unlimited power; a majority would just as surely abuse such power as would a king. Any nation, in order to be free, must place safeguards around each individual, over which the government—be it a monarchy or be it a republic; be it the rule of one or be it the rule of a majority—shall not, under any pretence, pass. The idea of thinking that because we have a Republic, there is no danger of the rights of the people being infringed, is absurd. All experience with human nature is to the contrary.

In the present Sunday agitation it is urged that some of the leaders in the movement are among our best men; that they too much regard for justice; too Bible to the people for their religion, to use the Sunday laws to wrong an American citizen, their Declaration to entitle them to religious freedom.

It means that a man's right to his own religious convictions, and to impart them to his own children, and has their right to employ is one which comes from a higher source than the Almighty, are as sacred in the eye of the law as the right to the possession of property, and that though in the minority, it shall be protected in the field as hereinabove stated thereof. The "protection" guaranteed by the section in question means protection. Constitutions are enacted for the very purpose of protecting the weak against the strong, or the few against the many.

The celebrated United States Senate report emphasizes the same idea in the following:—

It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true, or what false. Our Government is a civil, and not a religious institution. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the Government, so long as they do not invade the rights of others.

If these American principles are regarded there will be no occasion to allude to the fact that Sabbatarians are only "seventh-tenths of one per cent" in this community; for even if it be so they must be treated as well, and protected as thoroughly by the Government, as though they numbered sixty millions.

No course, however, should be supported or defended by unjust means. Doing evil that good may come will always yield evil results.—*Signs of the Times.*
