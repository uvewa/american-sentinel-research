# The Prohibition Party and National Reform.

[page 281]

WE believe the Church is stronger on its own foundation than when it leans on something else. Whenever the Church reaches out to the State for help it places itself below that government, or at least on an equality with it.—*Colorado Graphic.*

The great trouble with National Reformers is that they fail to distinguish between moral government and civil government, between the government of God and human governments, between a divinely administered theocracy, and a man-made and humanly administered civil government. There is a true theocracy (God himself is the Ruler; in this, man is of God, but not by his authority, just as popes and kings ruled in the Dark Ages, "Drunken with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs.")

The moral law, the law of God, binds the conscience of men. It follows, therefore, that to make men the administrators of the divine law would be to give them power over the consciences of their fellowmen. The unavoidable conclusion is that National Reform seeks to endow human governments with the sovereignty of conscience, a sovereignty which, according to the gospel, belongs only to God. If this be so, and surely as it has been said before, that National Reform would make the divine law as revealed in the Scriptures, the law of the land no further than to make it the model for human legislation, that, and only so far as it might be applicable to civil government. But how far would it be held to be applicable? This question is one the Government would have to decide, and it would be decided not by any fixed and infallible rule, not by divine wisdom and direction, but by man certain to err even as men have erred before in deciding similar questions. It would just as certainly make man judge of the divine law as it would to declare the whole law of God the supreme rule in civil affairs.

In commenting last week upon certain resolutions passed by the Prohibitionists of St. Lawrence County, New York, we said that "to be consistent every man who demands prohibition because the liquor traffic is an evil, must with avowed National Reformers demand the enforcement of the whole of the moral law as summed up in the ten commandments; in short, every logically consistent Prohibitionist is, whether he knows it or not, committed already to the National Reform scheme." And this not because proper prohibition is a religious question, but because the Prohibition Party approach the subject from a wrong standpoint.

The whole Prohibition movement, as at present constituted, seems to be instinct with National Reform thought and motive. The basic declaration of National [page 282] Reform is that:—

*Almighty God is the source of all power and authority in civil government.*

The first declaration of the convention that nominated John P. St. John in 1884, set forth this:—

The Prohibition Party in National Convention assembled, acknowledging Almighty God as the rightful Sovereign of all men from whom the just powers of government are derived, and to whose laws human enactment should conform as an absolute condition of peace, prosperity and happiness.

This the attitude of the Prohibition [page 283] Party in 1884, and, judging from the utterances of every convention, county, State, and national, since that time, it is its attitude still; and it is a most dangerous attitude.

It is true in one sense that the just powers of government are derived from God, and from God alone; but it is not true in the sense in which National Reformers and Prohibitionists intend. By creating man a social being, by placing him in this world, and suffering him to continue in it after sin entered, God made civil government a necessity, and so ordained it; ordained that men should govern themselves in communities; but he did not give special men or parties authority or right to rule in his name, that he gives any government or party any divine right, independently of the people, that is, of the governed, is a dangerous, unrepublican, and un-American doctrine. It is, however, the doctrine of both National Reformers and Prohibitionists. Both declare that they are destined under God to effect that for which they are striving and both seem to say "in the name of," that is, the authority of God,—God is the Sovereign, and they are his ministers to execute the divine will.

It is the right of the rightful moral Sovereign of all, and all human souls should conform to his law; but to declare that all "human enactments" should conform to the divine law, is simply to declare that human enactments are the proper interpreters of that law; and not only that they should so interpret it but that they should enforce it upon all.

To some it may seem inconsistent to say that all human acts should conform to the divine law and at the same time to deny that human enactments should conform to the same standard. But the inconsistency is only seeming. God has made every man morally responsible to Him alone; any interference on the part of human government to enforce this responsibility, is also to take away that freedom of choice that is necessary in the acceptance of character. Men are morally responsible to God.
