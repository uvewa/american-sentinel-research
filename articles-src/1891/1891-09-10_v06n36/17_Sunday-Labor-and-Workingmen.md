THE advocates of Sunday laws are just now making a desperate effort to convince the workingman that he is enslaved by corporations requiring Sunday work, a bondage, they declare, worse than African slavery; but the workingman does not generally join the movement for some reason, probably because it not only promises to secure a law compelling corporations to give their employes rest on Sunday, but promises that the same law will prescribe the manner in which he shall spend the day.

Recently an American Sabbath Union lecturer, after a passionate portrayal of "our modern slavery," Sunday labor, declared with disappointment and disgust in his tones, "I am astonished that the laboring man has never raised his voice against this imposition." This is not astonishing, for laboring men can see a long way ahead of their noses, and while some of them prefer to rest on Sunday if they could do so without losing their job, they don't propose to jump "out of the frying-pan into the fire."
