All men are created equal. It then follows that each person in the minority has just the same rights as any person in the majority. In other words, the same respect, protection, and natural liberty must be guaranteed to each individual without regard to whether he is one of the many or one of the few. It is the maintenance of this principle (that the weak shall be afforded equal protection with the strong) that marks the free government in contradistinction to the despotic power; and having this principle clearly in view the early American statesmen aimed to incorporate into our political system such a guarantee of the rights of the minority, that those rights would never be trampled upon, no matter how numerous or overwhelming the majority might be.

In order to accomplish this, not only were the fundamental and inalienable rights of man declared, but our Government was organized into three separate, distinct, and sovereign departments for the express purpose of each being a check upon the other should it be inclined to violate the Constitution by infringing in any way upon the rights of the people.

John Adams, while vice-president, in his "Defense of the Constitutions and Government of the United States of America," called attention to the inclination of majorities to oppress minorities, and in so doing fully justifies the executive and judiciary departments of our Government, in addition to the Legislature or representative department. Mr. Adams said:—

> Since all men are so inclined to act according to their own will and interests, in making, expounding, and executing laws, to the prejudice of the people's liberty and security, the sovereign authority, the legislative, executive, and judicial power, can never be safely lodged in one assembly, though chosen annually by the people; because the majority and their leaders, the principles jeepall, will certainly oppress the minority, and make, expound, and execute laws for their own wealth, power, grandeur, and glory, to the prejudice of the liberty and security of the minority.

The minority, to secure justice to all, must be protected. Hence, the majority can not be trusted with unlimited power; for a majority would just as surely abuse such power as would a king. Any nation, in order to be free, must place safeguards around each individual, over which the government—be it a monarchy or be it a republic—be it the rule of one or be it the rule of a majority—shall not, under any pretense, pass. The idea of thinking that because we have a Republic, there is no danger of the rights of the people being infringed, is absurd. All experience with human nature is to the contrary.

In the present Sunday agitation it is urged that some of the leaders in the movement are among our best men; that they have too much regard for justice, for their religion, to use the Sunday laws to wrong an American citizen; their Christianity is sufficient warrant that no injustice will be done. But such arguments as these have been used before. It was necessary for Madison to show this fallacy, and what he said over a century ago is worthy of repetition. He takes up the subject in answer to the question, What is to restrain the majority, when united with a common passion, from unjust violations of the rights and interests of the minority or of individuals? Will their religion? In his comments he says:

> It [religion] is not pretended to be such [a restraint as will insure the recognition of rights] on men individually considered. Will its effect be greater on them considered in an aggregate view? Quite the reverse. The conduct of every popular assembly acting on oath, the strongest of religious ties, proves that individuals join without remorse in acts against which their consciences would revolt if proposed to them under the same sanction, separately, in their closets. When, indeed, religion is kindled into enthusiasm, its force, like that of other passions, is increased by the sympathy of a multitude. But enthusiasm is only a temporary state of religion, and, while it lasts, will hardly be seen with pleasure at the helm of Government. Besides, as religion in its coolest state is not in. fallible, it may become a motive to oppression as well as a restraint from injustice.—Notes on the Confederacy (1787).

The surest way of having our rights made secure, is to remove all means by which they can be invaded. If this can not be done, the next best thing is to come as near as possible to that state of affairs. Hence, the surest way of preventing persecution on account of working on Sunday, is to have no Sunday laws with which to persecute. Instead of allowing the Sunday laws of the various States to remain upon the statute books as a dead letter, which may at any time be revived by some religious bigots (as has been done repeatedly lately) the only way to do in order that the security of the Sabbatarian may be assured is to repeal totally and forever every Sunday law in every State of the Union. In this way, and in this way alone, will the rights of the Sabbatarian Christians, and the conscientious Jews, in this country be protected from the fanaticism of the over-zealous Sunday-keeper.

The very object of laws is to prevent oppression—to protect the individual. See then, how the power delegated to government is abused when they enact, or allow to remain on the statute books, laws that are the means of oppression. Some persons seem to think that all government is for is to protect the majority. But this idea is far from the truth. The primary idea of government is to protect the minority—to protect the weak from oppression by the strong—to protect the few from oppression by the many. On several occasions in our history have our leading jurists had occasion to call attention to this truth. In the Ohio decision on the Bible in the public schools, the Court declared that the religious rights of the minority were to receive the same protection as those of the majority. Speaking of the guarantee of religious freedom the Court said:—

> It means that a man's right to his own religious convictions, and to impart them to his own children, and his and their right to engage, in conformity thereto, in harmless acts of worship toward the Almighty, are as sacred in the eye of the law as his rights of person or property, and that although in the minority, he shall be protected in the full and unrestricted enjoyment thereof. The "protection" guaranteed by the section in question means protection to the minority. The majority can protect itself. Constitutions are enacted for the very purpose of protecting the weak against the strong; the few against the many.

The celebrated United States Senate report emphasizes the same idea in the following words:—

> It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true, or what false. Our Government is a civil, and not a religious, institution. Our Constitution recognizes in every person the right to choose his own religion, and to enjoy it freely without molestation. Whatever may be the religious sentiments of citizens, and however variant, they are alike entitled to protection from the Government, so long as they do not invade the rights of others.

If these American principles are regarded there will be no occasion to allude to the fact that Sabbatarians are only "seventh-tenths of one per cent" in this country; for even if it be so they must be treated as well, and protected as thoroughly by the Government, as though they numbered sixty millions.
