# Are We a Christian Nation?

[page 285]

IN a recent issue a correspondent characterizes our country in its present condition as a "Christian Nation ruled by infidelity;" yet he tells us that this condition comes from the fact that "Christianity" "elects the administrations maintained by 'the misty ring of infidelity.'" But evidently, then, we are not quite a "Christian Nation." Nor ought it to be the purpose of the Prohibition Party to make it a Christian Nation. If as individuals we are at liberty to use our natural purposes to make the whole world Christian. But when we use it to characterize political methods for that purpose we disclose hypocrisy or martyrdom. It does the same practicalism no more good to bring a thousand to Christ by force than it does to advertise the hypocrisy of many so-called Christians. Our right is not against publicity per se, not against the faith. In some of our home communities much of "infidelity gains its converts" from its representation in the liquor traffic. But its enthusiasm is only a temporary enthusiasm. The party is right—that is the work of the Church, and of political parties and men, is not to advance the cause of prohibition by trying to be the conscience of everyone who does their business in the fight the nation, not to reform hypocrites, not to convert but to save.—*New Era (Prohibition.).*

DECEMBER, Rev. B. R. Tupper, spending his vacation at Long Branch, New Jersey, has been writing some very ably, but to no means for reading men to his class of its discussions upon the Sabbath question on that day to a Doctor's Referring to this, the *Colorado Graphic* directed to quietly plowing in his field on Saturday, after he had carefully observed the previous day as his Sabbath. He has been proceeded through the various courts of Tennessee, to his Supreme Court of the State, and has just received the condemnation of the sentence of all the lower courts by the United States Circuit Court, condemning him to prison or pay a fine. And all this in a land that boasts of her religious freedom. Yes, and cursed of the enforcement of laws that the various organizations that are working to secure legislation, have gravely held us and would never interfere with the rights or liberty of any individual.

Now if the National Reformers, and allied organizations are the friends and champions of religious liberty, as they insist that they are, why don't we hear of them discountenancing the persecution of Mr. King? Is there any element of justice in a man being fined and imprisoned for quietly performing honorable labor on Sunday? Even if Mr. King had not sacredly observed the day before, can it be said that any of the principles of equity and right would admit of fines and imprisonment being imposed on him for quiet labor on a day that is religiously observed by the Tupper and those who cling to the Church of Rome, and that the Church at its loggerheads with itself on this the very point.

The Graphic is right; if Sunday be a work holiday, the preachers have no right to dictate to the people how they shall spend it; if it be a religious day, the State has no right to meddle with it in any form.
