The fifteenth annual encampment, which recently closed at Lakeside, Ohio, like all similar gatherings held this year, was infected with the growing State religion theory of the National Reform Association. Besides a day set apart for the presentation of the views of the Association, Professor Coleman of Pennsylvania, Professor of Political Ethics in the National Reform Association College of that State, delivered daily lectures on the relation of God to civil government.

Professor Coleman is in general, a fair minded gentleman, and it is the prophecy of the writer that he will be among the first to desert the cause he so earnestly advocates, when he sees its practical working, unless his character becomes radically changed. He has too much of the spirit of the Golden Rule, at present, to execute his persecuting theory.

The Professor allowed his hearers to question him publicly during his lectures, and some of the questions brought forth a frank "I don't know." One of these was, "If the Government should enforce the moral law, as you advocate, what would you do with Catholics and others who violate the second commandment, which forbids bowing before graven images?" Professor Coleman was not prepared to imprison the whole Catholic Church of this country. He also unwittingly acknowledged that the enforcement of the fourth commandment on dissenters would be persecution. In the process of illustrating another point he stated that if the Government were to enforce the seventh day of the week on Christians who keep Sunday, it would be persecution. Later, a listener referred to this statement and asked, "What would it be if the Government should enforce the observance of the first day of the week on Christians who keep the seventh day?"

The Professor acknowledged having made the statement, but answered by saying, "I had in mind an improbable condition of things i. e., a majority of the whole people in the wrong." In this statement he betrayed the supreme arrogance, folly, and wickedness which lie at the root of the whole movement. By paraphrasing this answer its true import is more clearly seen. "When we, the majority, enforce obedience to our views upon you the minority, it is not persecution for it is improbable that we the majority are in the wrong; and it is not persecution for we, who are right by virtue of our majority, to enforce obedience to our views of the fourth commandment upon you, who are wrong by virtue of your minority."

Leaving the particular question of which day is the Sabbath, we attack the infallible majority theory with the prophetic word of God, with all history, sacred and profane; and lastly, we hurl Professor Coleman himself against the theory, for he declared in the same lectures that at no time since the end of Israel's theocracy had the theory or practice of a majority of the Christian world been right as regards the relation of religion and civil government. Notwithstanding all this, he proposes to use this erring majority to enforce his interpretation of the commandments of God upon others because in this instance he believes with the majority.

**DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF.**

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, of the American Sabbath Union, delivered his two lectures here, taking great care to inform his hearers, as usual, that his movement for compulsory Sabbath observance was based entirely upon natural, economical, and sanitary grounds, and not upon religious reasons as Seventh-day Adventists and others ignorantly declared it to be. If Mr. Crafts is sincere in this, and we will not discuss that question here, then we have the American Sabbath Union, which Mr. Crafts represents, in deadly conflict with the National Reform Association which voted at its Washington Convention to eliminate from its writings and speeches the term "civil Sabbath," alleging that the will of God as expressed in the fourth commandment, was the only true basis of Sabbath laws. How Mr. Crafts can oppose the views of National Reformers, and they in turn attack his views, and yet both labor in blissful harmony, to secure the same end, is, until explained, very strange conduct; but when understood it has in it the wisdom of the serpent. The writer asked a prominent National Reform advocate, at the close of Mr. Crafts's address, why the speaker advocated Sabbath laws based entirely on secular grounds, and opposed the National Reform or religious basis as presented by himself. He answered that he supposed Mr. Crafts presented the question in that light to escape the criticism which would result from placing his desired legislation on a religious basis. In further proof of this a representative of of American Sabbath Union stated recently before a minister's meeting that for good reasons the representatives of these two views were not to publicly affiliate but to work independently, as both could work to better advantage and with greater success.

This explains why these two organizations do not quarrel. They both want Sunday laws. The vote of the man who wants Sunday laws for secular reasons will count as much as will the vote of the man who wants such laws for religious reasons. So at these summer gatherings both views are presented, and the listener offered a choice between them, and the acceptance of either view is looked upon as encouraging. And why not? When R. M. King is securely locked in a Tennessee prison, it will make no difference to him or to either wing of the Sunday-law movement, whether he was placed there by a Sunday law, secured by a majority of "civil Sunday" votes, or a majority of "sacred Sabbath" votes; in either case he will not be at liberty to plow his field on Sunday, and thus again "give offense to the sense of propriety of those on their way to church," and continue to offer "a willful and intentional slight to the community." (These quotations are not from "Fox's Book of Martyrs," but from a stenographic report of the testimony of Christian witnesses against R. M. King, in the Circuit Court of Tennessee, and published in that form by the National Religious Liberty Association.)

**NOT ALL ONE-SIDED.**

The writer found a strong sentiment at Lakeside against the views presented by these representatives of legal-suasion reforms. Nearly one half of Mr. Crafts's large audience left the auditorium before the conclusion of the second address.

A State officer of the Non-Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Ohio, stated that Mr. Crafts's manner of presentation, his voice, countenance and general demeanor, reminded her so much of the hanging of witches and Quakers, that she left before the conclusion of the address, and others expressed the same in substance.

There were some prominent Christian workers at this gathering who noticed and deplored the present mania for law as opposed to the Gospel in bringing about reforms.
