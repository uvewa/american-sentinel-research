THE Prohibition Convention at Albany, on the 3d inst., set forth this declaration:

> The Prohibition Party of the State of New York, in Convention assembled, acknowledges allegiance to Almighty God as Governor of the Nation.

There are some necessary deductions to be made from this, that possibly our Prohibitionist friends have not thought of.

If God is the Ruler of this Nation it follows that those who make and administer the laws of the Nation are simply his vicegerents.

The Prohibitionists are striving after the power to make and administer the laws.

It follows that they propose to rule as God's vicegerents. The claim is neither better nor worse than that of the Papacy, for it is the same.

If the Prohibitionists wish to acknowledge God in a way that will not involve the monstrous assumption of divine right, let them adopt the immortal words of the Declaration of Independence:—

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

And let them further declare that as the blessings of civil government are for all men,—for both the just and the unjust, alike for the servant of God and for him that serveth him not,—and that as only a small minority of the race or of any nation have ever been truly the servants of God, and so, for the most part, civil government is necessarily in the hands of men who really know not God, it is manifest that in civil affairs men are to be governed only by the law of natural rights; that this alone is the higher law to which all human law should conform, because it is the only law that the natural man can properly appreciate and rightly interpret; and because God in his infinite wisdom has made it ample for all the needs of human government, and is truly honored by obedience to it.
