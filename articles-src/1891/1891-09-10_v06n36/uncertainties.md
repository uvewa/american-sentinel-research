## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1
- Line 33: "W. H. MCKEN." - Listed as Associate Editor. This appears to be an OCR error for "W. H. McKee" (consistent with known editors). Corrected to "W. H. MCKEE" in masthead.

### Page 2
- Line 92: "the principles jeepall" - appears to be OCR error in John Adams quote. Context suggests this should be a term related to leadership or rule, but exact original wording uncertain. Transcribed as appears in OCR due to being within a quote.

### Attribution Notes
- Author "F. W. Howe" appears as "Frank William Howe" in one article signature and "F. W. Howe" in another (reprint from New Era). Used full name for article 08, initials for article 12 per the signatures.
- Author "A. F. Ballinger" signed article 09 - corrected from OCR "Ballinger" based on known author list which shows "A. F. Ballenger" - however, OCR shows "Ballinger" consistently. Used "A. F. Ballenger" per known author conventions.

### Content Classification
- Several very short editorial notes (1-2 sentences) were given their own files per instructions
- All advertisements and subscription information on pages 7-8 were skipped per instructions
