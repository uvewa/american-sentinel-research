THE American or secular theory of government does not mean the unchristian theory; but rather the contrary. The secular theory is the true Christian theory for the first promulgator of the theory known to the world, was Christ himself, the Founder of Christianity. Bancroft, speaking of the adoption of these principles by our early statesmen, says: "The new Nation dared to set the example of accepting in its relation to God the principle first divinely ordained in Jude." He says, too, that it was "not from indifference, but that the infinite spirit of eternal truth might move in its freedom, and purity, and power." And through all the ages since Christ there have been here and there Christian men—caring more for truth than for worldly gain, caring more for the purity of Christianity than for worldly power—who have nobly upheld the principles first enunciated by their Master.
