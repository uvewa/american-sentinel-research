SEPTEMBER 1, the Police Commissioners of this city passed a mild resolution declaring that the Board "disapproves in general of any action on the part of the force partaking of the character of sneaks or spies, or of acting in a surreptitious manner in the discharge of its duty."

This resolution which ought to have been passed long ago, will operate to prevent such disgraceful arrests as those noted in these columns two weeks ago. The action had special reference to a contemptible system of espionage upon saloons, a system that while accomplishing nothing for the cause of temperance was demoralizing the guardians of the peace of the city; but it will doubtless serve to protect from police outrage small shopkeepers, and other dealers in useful commodities.
