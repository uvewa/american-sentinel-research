IN commenting last week upon certain resolutions passed by the Prohibitionists of St. Lawrence County, New York, we said that "to be consistent every man who demands prohibition because the liquor traffic is sin, must with avowed National Reformers demand the enforcement of the whole of the moral law as summed up in the ten commandments; in short, every logically consistent Prohibitionist is, whether he knows it or not, committed already to the National Reform scheme." And this not because proper prohibition is a religious question, but because the Prohibition Party approach the subject from a wrong standpoint.

The whole Prohibition movement, as at present constituted, seems to be instinct with National Reform thought and motives. The basic declaration of National Reform is that—

> Almighty God is the source of all power and authority in civil government, that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Ruler of nations, and that the revealed will of God is of Supreme authority in civil affairs.

The first declaration of the convention that nominated John P. St. John in 1884, set forth this:—

> The Prohibition Party in National Convention assembled, acknowledge Almighty God as the rightful Sovereign of all men from whom the just powers of government are derived, and to whose laws human enactments should conform as an absolute condition of peace, prosperity, and happiness.

This was the attitude of the Prohibition Party in 1884, and, judging from the utterances of every convention, county, State, and national, since that time, it is its attitude still; and it is a most dangerous one.

It is true in one sense that the just powers of government are derived from God, and from God alone; but it is not true in the sense in which National Reformers and Prohibitionists intend. By creating man a social being, by placing him in this world, and suffering him to continue in it after sin entered, God made civil government a necessity, and so ordained it; ordained that men should govern themselves in communities; but that God now gives special men or parties authority to rule in his name, that he gives any government or party any divine right, independently of the people, that is, of the governed, is a dangerous, unscriptural, and un-American doctrine. It is, however, the doctrine of both National Reformers and Prohibitionists. Both claim that they are destined under God to effect that for which they are striving; and both assume to act "in the name of," that is, by the authority of God,—God is the Sovereign, and they are his ministers to execute the divine will.

God is the rightful moral Sovereign of all, and all human acts should conform to his law; but to declare that all "human enactments" should conform to the divine law, is simply to declare that human governments are the proper interpreters of that law; and not only that they should interpret it but that they should enforce it as well.

To some it may seem inconsistent to say that all human acts should conform to the divine law and at the same time to deny that human enactments should conform to the same standard. But the inconsistency is only seeming. God has made every man morally responsible to Him alone; any interference on the part of human lawmakers tends to destroy this responsibility, as also to take away that freedom of action that is necessary in the development of character. Men may, and in truth have, honestly sought to do God service by endeavoring to model their laws after his law; but this is contrary to the divine plan.

God has reserved moral government to himself, but has left men free to govern themselves in civil affairs; and this for obvious reasons. Had God commissioned men to administer his law, and to require of their fellows the discharge of duties due to the Divine Being, it would have destroyed responsibility to God, and have put man in the place of God. On the other hand, had God not committed to men the power to regulate to some extent their relations with each other, to enforce and preserve their own rights, one of two things would have followed: either punishment would have been so long delayed as to afford no protection to those in need of it, or else vengeance would have been so swift and certain as to defeat the very design of God in making man a free moral agent.

All human government is force, and party platforms are simply declarations of the principles which will be crystallized into law, and so enforced upon all by the party in the event of its success. Therefore for a party to say that "all human enactments" should conform to the divine law, is for it to declare that should it come into power it would adopt legislation requiring everything that the divine law requires and forbidding everything that the divine law forbids; in other words to pledge itself to administer the divine law.

The just powers of government are necessarily limited to securing impartially to all the free exercise of natural rights, to the securing of civil order; and it was for this purpose that civil government was ordained. Whatever is less than this falls short of what government may do, and of what it should do; and whatever is more than this exceeds the just powers of government and restricts natural rights.

The National Reform Association and the Prohibition Party both hold that the Government should recognize the law of God "as of supreme authority in civil affairs;" and it involves them both in the same difficulty, namely, in the assumption that they are commissioned to interpret and enforce the law of God, to prohibit sin and to promote righteousness. This leads them alike to decide, not only for themselves but for others, what sin is and what righteousness is, and to seek to mete out rewards and punishments as they judge right. In short, they assume prerogatives which belong only to God. The trouble is, as we have seen, that they start wrong. They approach the subject of government not from the human, but from the divine side.
