On the 3d inst., the National Columbian Commission at Chicago gave a hearing to the advocates of the Sunday-closing of the Fair.

Col. Elliot F. Shepard, as President of the American Sabbath Union, presented the memorial of the Union, praying for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. He also, as President of the Sabbath Observance Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, presented a petition of that body to the same end. He likewise read a telegram from Archbishop Ireland, of St. Paul, giving his acquiescence in the movement, and also the resolution in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, passed by the Farmers' Alliance Convention at Ocala.

Rev. Sylvester Scoville, President of Wooster College, Wooster, Ohio, gave a brief review of the history of Sunday legislation and Sunday Observance, and their effects on the nations, socially and commercially.

Gen. O. O. Howard presented the question from the patriotic point of view, quoting from Washington, Lincoln, Grant, McClellan, and President Harrison.

Rev. T. A. Fernley, of Philadelphia, laid before the Commission a petition for the closing of the Fair on Sunday, containing nearly 300,000 names.

Col. Alexander S. Maitland, of Brooklyn, urged that Sunday laws were not founded on religion, but on the rights of man, and that no nation could remain permanently free without a day of rest.

Hon. Thomas Coffin, of Iowa, representing the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, presented the subject on behalf of that organization, and of wage-earners in general.

Rev. Francis L. Patton, President of Princeton University, presented the question from the Biblical point of view. He said he had no doubt of the commercial success of the Exposition, but the most important point in success was the moral one.

Mrs. R. L. Carse presented a petition from 10,000 members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. And then after a few words from Colonel Shepard, claiming that he and others present were representing the Christian churches of the United States, who, with their communicants, families, and affiliations, represented safely at least fifty-seven million of the population, the Commission took a recess.

It is announced that action on the Sunday closing question will be deferred until the local directors of the Exposition have made their rules and submitted them to the Commission for approval.

The opinion is confidently expressed by the advocates of Sunday-closing that the Fair will be closed. The decision may, however, be delayed for some time yet. Meanwhile the interest in the matter grows, and the agitation increases.
