No wonder the laboring man does not join the "civil Sabbath law" movement, for it is not only ungenrous and uncivil, but it is tyrannical. A representative of this movement recently stated to a Chicago audience, that the objection made by some that the occupants of crowded tenements ought to have an opportunity to visit the parks and breathe the fresh air, was "mere sentimentalism, without foundation." "There are no tenement houses," said the speaker, "that will not hold all the occupants when assembled on Sunday, and they had better be there than desecrating the Sabbath by going to the parks." The laboring man has reason to fear this return to puritanical narrowness and hypocrisy.
