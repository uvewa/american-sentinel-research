THE moral law, the law of God, binds the consciences of men. It follows, therefore, that to make men the administrators of the divine law would be to give them power over the consciences of their fellowmen. The unavoidable conclusion is that National Reform seeks to endow human governments with the sovereignty of conscience, a sovereignty which, according to the gospel, belongs only to God. It may be said, however, as it has been said before, that National Reform would make the divine law as revealed in the Scriptures, the law of the land no farther than to make it the model for human legislation, and that only so far as it might be applicable to civil government. But how far would it be held to be applicable? This question is one the Government would have to decide, and it would be decided not by any fixed and infallible rule, not by divine wisdom and direction, but by men certain to err even as men have erred before in deciding similar questions. It would just as certainly make men judges of the divine law as it would to declare the whole law of God the supreme rule in civil affairs.
