# Lakeside and "National Reform."

[page 283]

THE fifth annual encampment, which recently closed at Lakeside, Ohio, like all its similar gatherings held its own, has kept abreast with the growing State restriction theory of the National Reform Association. Besides an essay on the right for presentations of the views of the National Reform Convention of Professors, Professor of Political Ethics in the Na- [page 284] tional Convention, delivered daily lectures on the relation of God to civil government.

Professor Coleman is in general, a fair minded gentleman, and it is in the spirit of the writer that he will be among the first to desert the cause on coming to fully know its true nature. In his professional working, unless his character becomes radically changed. He has so much of the spirit of the Golden Rule, at present, to execute his persecuting theory. The Professor did his best to answer questions put to him by his followers which the day of the meeting was his subject upon the platform, not last in bearing; the Lord rested on the seventh day and his followers have a right at first on it then later and do all work; but, the seventh is holy; keep it holy. Pastor Truex and Mr. Tupper know that the religious question is one that they face and to get at the heart of this question, and that the two factors herein belongs are duty and liberty of the people. And they are ought to know that the law of God will only be honored as the man of God is free with no bondsmen as the citizen of a free Country is in bondsmen.

question him publicly during his lectures and some of the questions brought made a frank "I don't know." One of those was, "If the Government should enforce the moral law, as you advocate, what would you do with Catholics and others who violate the second commandment, which forbids bowing before graven images?" Professor Coleman was not prepared to imprison the whole Catholic Church of this country. He also acknowledged that the enforcement of the fourth commandment on this basis would be persecution. In the process of illustrating another point he stated that if the Government were to enforce the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath for Christians who keep Sunday, it would be persecution. Later on, a listener referred to his statement and asked, "What would it be if the Government should enforce the observance of the first day of the week on Christians who keep the seventh day?"

The Professor acknowledged having made the statement, but answered by saying, "I had in mind as impossible things of things i.e. a majority of the people is in the wrong." In this statement he betrayed the supremest arrogance, folly, and wickedness which lie at the root of the whole movement. By this reasoning the answer is true its import simply plainly oblivious; our very existences not only our civil, social, religious work upon the minority, is not persecution for it is impossible that the majority is in the wrong; the legal is not persecutory as the rule of our majority, to enforce obedience to the will of that majority it not persecution upon you, who was wrong by virtue of your minority.

Having the particular question of which day is the Sabbath, we attack the infallible majority theory with the plain word of God, with all history, ancient and profane, and lastly, we let Professor Coleman himself against his theory, for he declared in the same lectures that at in no time since the end of Israel's theocracy had the theory or practice of a majority of the Christian world been right as regards the relation of religion and civil government. Notwithstanding all this, he proposes to use this very instrument to purify the interpretation of the commandments of God upon others because in this instance he believes with the majority.

"SABBATH MARKET REPORT."

Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, of the American Sabbath Union, delivered his two lectures at Lakeside. There was nothing to learn, as he has said, the movement for compulsory Sabbath observance was based entirely upon natural, economical, and sanitary grounds, and not upon religious reasons as Seventh-day Adventists and others had ignorantly declared to be. If Mr. Crafts is sincere in this, and we will not discover that question here, then we have the American Sabbath Union, which Mr. Crafts represents, in deadly conflict with the National Reform Association which voted at its Washington Convention to eliminate from its writings and speeches the term "civil Sabbath," alleging that the will of God as expressed in the fourth commandment, was the only true basis of Sabbath laws. How Mr. Crafts can oppose the views of National Reformers, and they in turn abide his views, and yet both labor in blissful blindness, to secure the same end, is, to all humanity, a very strange condition; but when understood it has in it the wisdom of the serpent. The writer asked a prominent Christian Sabbath advocacy at the close of Mr. Crafts's address, why the speaker or Sabbath laws based entirely on secular grounds, and opposed the National Reform or religious basis as that presented by himself. He answered that he supposed Mr. Crafts presented the question in that light to escape the criticism which would result from placing his desired legislation on a religious basis. In further proof of this a representative of American Sabbath Union stated recently before a ministerial meeting that for lack to work independently, as both could work to better advantage and with greater reason. So at these summer gatherings both views are presented, and the listener offered a choice between them, and the partisans of either view is looked upon as encouraging. And why not? When R. M. King is secretly locked to a Tennessee prison, it will make no difference of the sentiment of one of all the history by a Sunday law; record to a charge of guilty of "civil Sunday" notice, or a majority of "sacred Sabbath," in all things either case he will not be at liberty to plow his field on Saturday, and this again gives offense to the sense of propriety of the court on this day to be charged, continues to offer "a willful and intentional slight to the community." (These quotations are not from "Park's Book of Martyrs," but from a stenographic report of the "sufferings of Christian witnesses against R. M. King, in the Circuit Court of Tennessee, and published in that form by the National Religious Liberty Association.)

ROT ALL OFF-DYED.

The writer found a strong sentiment at Lakeside against the views presented by these representatives of legal-coercion religion. Nearly one half of Mr. Crafts's [page 285] large audience left the auditorium before the conclusion of the second address.

A State officer of the Non-Partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of Ohio, stated that Mr. Crafts's manner of presentation, his voice, countenance and general manner, reminded her so much of the banging of widows and Quakers, that she left before the conclusion of his address, and others expressed the same in like terms.

There were some prominent Christian workers at this gathering who described and deplored the present mode for law enforcement to the Gospel in bringing about reform.
