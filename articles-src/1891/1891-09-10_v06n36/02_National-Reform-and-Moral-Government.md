THE great trouble with National Reformers is that they fail to distinguish between moral government and civil government, between the government of God and human governments, between a divinely administered theocracy, and a man-made and humanly administered counterfeit theocracy. In a true theocracy God himself is the Ruler; in a man-made theocracy men rule in the name of God, but not by his authority, just as popes and kings ruled in the Dark Ages, "drunken with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus."
