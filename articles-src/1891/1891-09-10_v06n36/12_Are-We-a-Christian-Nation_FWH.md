In a recent issue a correspondent characterizes our country in its present condition as "a Christian Nation ruled by infidelity," yet he tells us that this condition results from the fact that "Christianity" elects the candidates nominated by "the whisky ring of infidelity." Evidently, then, we are not quite a "Christian Nation" yet. Nor ought it to be the purpose of the Prohibition Party to make this a Christian Nation. As individuals we are at liberty to use every proper means to make the whole world Christian, but when we use distinctively political methods for that purpose we make only hypocrites or martyrs. It does the cause of prohibition no more good to bring a railing accusation against infidelity than it does to advertise the hypocrisy of many so-called Christians. Our fight is not against infidelity per se, but against the saloon. It is none of our business how much "infidelity gains ground" apart from its representation in the liquor traffic. We can never make this a Christian Nation by legislation—that is the work of the Church, not of political parties—and we can not advance the cause of prohibition by trying to be conscience for somebody else. Our business is to fight the saloon, not to reform hypocrites, nor to defeat Bob Ingersoll for the presidency.—F. W. Howe, in New Era (Prohibition).
