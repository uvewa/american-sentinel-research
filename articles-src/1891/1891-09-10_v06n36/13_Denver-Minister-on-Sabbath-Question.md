A Denver minister, Rev. Kerr B. Tupper, spending his vacation at Long Branch, New Jersey, has been writing some very silly, but by no means original things on the Sabbath question to a Denver paper. Referring to this, the Colorado Graphic says:—

> Will Mr. Tupper, who is a Hard-shell Baptist, please tell his fellow-citizens which day of the week is the "Lord's day"? If the Graphic has not lost its bearings, the Lord rested on the seventh day and blessed it; and the Lord said, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," etc. Mr. Tupper knows that the religious denomination of which he is a member is divided on the Sabbatarian question, and that the two factions have been fighting each other bitterly for years and years; and he ought to know that until he can agree with his brethren on this point . . . he is not competent to instruct others as to their duty on the secular Sunday.

> What are we personal liberty advocates to think of Dr. Tupper and the people who cling to his theory of the means of salvation? The Baptist Church is at loggerheads with itself on this very question.

The Graphic is right; if Sunday be a civil, a secular day, the preachers have no right to dictate to the people how they shall spend it; if it be a religious day, the State has no right to meddle with it in any manner.
