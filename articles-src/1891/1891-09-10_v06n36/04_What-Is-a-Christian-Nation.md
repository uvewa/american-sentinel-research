# What Is a Christian Nation?

[page 283]

"Do you want to get religion?" "I do." "What do you want to be—Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Campbellite, or Presbyterian?" "I want to be a Christian."—*New York Sun.*

AS HAVE been the intended humor of this little squib, and the possible implication of its commendable sincerity in the last clause, there is more truth ought to be very much grateful to National Reformers and their sympathizers. It fairly proclaims that a large proportion of those variously styled people's "bodies" or "churches" of Christianity bear relations to a national Christianity (!) in exactly this light. It ought to be worth while to give the subject a careful consideration.

These people emphatically assert that this is a "Christian Nation;" and then say that they are working individually to make it a Christian Nation, by having its Christian character recognized in the national Constitution and laws. Notwithstanding those inconsistencies, they are sincere enough to know that the realization of their plans demands that some "practical" influence be brought to bear upon the individual citizen. But instead of properly relying upon the blessed influence of the Author of Christianity ever authorized to be used for men's reformation—teaching and persuasion, their perseverance is to legislate men into this "Christian Nation." The most obvious way of carrying out this idea is to compel the individual to conform to an outward appearance of worship in harmony with orthodox Christian teaching; as the appropriate time must be set apart for this, and as there must be laws regulating his observance of the Christian Sabbath,—"though to disarm a certain prejudice which Americans have for non-interference in religious matters, it is better to pass such laws ostensibly to 'protect the American Sabbath,'" "the civil Sabbath." It is true that some will see an apparent incongruity in the first expression, but the latter term is particularly available because it invites the religious and secular in most inevi- [page 284] table combination that it is sure to deceive those who are the be the elect against this Christian Nation.

With these material provisions made for the religious welfare of the individual, the attention of those who would so reform is naturally directed to a consideration of the influences which this Christian Nation should exert upon nations. We are soon to have a great World's Fair. It ought to be the occasion of exhibiting to the assembled hosts that we are a Simon Pure Christian Nation—because we are, you know. So the gains of this great position must be closed through all the items on the Christian Sabbath. Certainly, that all peoples, kindred, tribes, and tongue may know by these tokens that "American Sunday" is not the "Continental Sunday." Incidentally, too, this will greatly strengthen the faith of all of our own countrymen who are not yet sure they are full-blown citizens of this Christian Nation,—though of course this is doubtless a secondary consideration.

But stop to wonder whether those reformers have ever thought of this subject in any true way. We wonder if they have ever thought what kind of a mess will all individually embrace to whom their plans are worked out. Who will preside in it? What will be the final authority in its preparation and interpretation? The Vicar? What if for a bounty land shall the spirit of Liberty have been drawn?

Isn't it worth while to stop and ponder seriously and long the thought suggested right here. If a man may be forced before a face to say, "I want to be a Christian," no man is satisfied to it by what others may think any assistance or dictation from the government? If he does not want to be a Christian, can Government do anything more to make him a hypocrite? If he does,—
