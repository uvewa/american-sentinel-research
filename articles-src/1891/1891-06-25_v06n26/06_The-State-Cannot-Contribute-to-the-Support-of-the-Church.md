# The State Cannot Contribute to the Support of the Church.

[page 204] IT must ever be the mission and duty of the true Church of Christ, and those of the Church of Christ, and every one from the standpoint of the State. The State has nothing to do with religion; it is not from the standpoint of the State the commission of the Church to accomplish these ends. The Church must depend entirely upon voluntary contributions from members and friends.

If it is perfect in practice that the property of the Church is exempted from taxation, other property must be additionally taxed to make up the amount contributed. This increase of taxation levied on other property is in itself, that it may be given by the municipality to the Church. It is a gift secured not by voluntary contributions of the people, but by compulsion from the taxpayers. Thus the Church is accepting for its support in part that which, by the fundamental law, has been found from property holders.—*Should Church Property Be Taxed?—by Rev. A. F. Ballenger.*

abling only to preserve civil and natural rights, liberty, equality and justice, and extending equal protection to all.

The principle touching the support and propagation of Christianity in the world, shining as a rainbow on the pages of the New Testament, is voluntariness—simple and solitary. Force is utterly alien to the spirit of the Christian religion. Peter recognized the principle fully when condemning Ananias for lying—"Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold was it not in thine own power?" No man was in his gave according to his purse and in his heart, yet grudgingly or of necessity," says Paul.

Since have forced the presentation of this principle, as the principle of the Christian religion, to God's disfavor the church comes in the character of personal salvation? Never has he forced a soul to accept salvation. Never has he impressed a soul into his service. Why not? says not belong to it? God's interest in the passion to save? Because he does not save by compel? Has the whole, he created the soul to power or for the most will.

Let Calvary speak of his passion to save. And yet he said: "wholist and that shall perish," has never forced a soul into salvation. "Whosoever will come may come." If the Almighty God, in its paramount wisdom, has exercised no compulsion to introduce the demands of compulsion into this matter of the salvation of man from sin, well as we, who are charged with his gospel, and are enabled to be "labourers together with God," in the transport and extension of the kingdom of Christ on earth—shall we, by its our wisdom, try the introduction of force in any form or degree into this work of God? The command of our Lord to Peter, "Put up thy Sword," has never been revoked or abandoned by the Captain of salvation. In man they would compel by lawgiving the support of his cause by the sword of things, so that midnight hour in Gethsemane? And we are also charged in the support of his cause that which, in case of resistance, is wrested from the taxpayer at the point of the bayonet?

These men one dispute the thought that exemption from taxation is really a gift conferred by the State on the Church. Mr. Gladstone puts it simple and straight— "An exemption is a gift." What the State remits to a man it gives to him." In that of a gift it is the free; and a house of a beneficent; and in its a friend. "If a gentleman his carriage and horses he is liable to pay a price for each horse, and if and towards for each carriage, and if these sums levied from his neighbors are and from him, it is the same thing as if, having been levied, they had been given back to him." That is perfectly clear. And yet, if a tax is levied on my neighbor's property and on any church property, it is the same thing as if, having been levied, it had been given back to the church.

And Gladstone said further: "Exemption from taxation is a positive pecuniary [page 205] abling to preserve civil and natural rights, or State obligation," adding, "I maintain that an exemption is a grant, and that properly stated you are to have no reason for the enjoyment of all property." I do not think it possible to successfully dispute Mr. Gladstone's position.

The annual municipal grant of the churches of New York City must be a very large sum contained (at $3,000,000, the Fifth Avenue Cathedral alone, getting $60,000). Brought out from under cover, it would set an upright man thinking in my year to the churches? Who would venture to propose State aid in open form? We Baptists would shout ourselves hoarse in crying out against it. And yet such a method of State aid would become reform to the less than that granted under the present disguise. I quote again from Mr. Gladstone: "When there is a public grant from year to year, we see what we are about; we let in the light of day." W. A. C.
