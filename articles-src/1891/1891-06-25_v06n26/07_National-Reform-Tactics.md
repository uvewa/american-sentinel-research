Although the National Reform Association (so-called) was first in the field for the subversion of the secular principles of the Federal Constitution, its chief auxiliaries, the American Sabbath Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Prohibition Party, etc., have come to the front as the principal elements of the grand army marshalling for the overthrow of civil and religious liberty in this country. The avowed theocratic propensities of the former made it obnoxious to all except the extremest bigots; hence the necessity for a change of base. These schemers hope to divert attention from their ulterior designs by leading in various reforms more or less in the line of the moral and religious trend of the popular churches.

It is in accordance with such strategy as this that the Blair Educational (constitutional amendment) bill has been kept before Congress so persistently. It provided for teaching popular Christianity in the public schools, and thus, by insidious indirection, would have made the religion of the majority within the churches to be the State religion. The same thing is true of Edmunds's educational amendment. The Breckenridge Sunday bill, if it should become a law, would practically commit the Government to the union of religion with the State. All these measures have the hearty approval of all the before mentioned Church and State organizations. Could this issue be brought directly before the American people in fair, full and free discussion, their verdict would decide for the Constitution as it is, with all its guarantees to civil and religious freedom intact, but the danger lies in the possibility that Congress may be induced to submit a disguised Church and State amendment to the State legislatures, and that, in the exigencies of the political parties, a trade may be effected by which the Government will be subverted without the question coming before the voters at all. Thus an incubus would be fastened upon the country that would take us far back toward the centuries of bigotry and persecution, from which deliverance could only come through the warring of factions till reason and intelligence would banish all superstition.
