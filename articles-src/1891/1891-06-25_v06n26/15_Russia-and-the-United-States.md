It is stated that "the most holy governing synod" of Russia has issued orders to the effect that students of all religious denominations must attend lessons in the orthodox catechism, and that all industrial establishments must have an orthodox church within a distance of twenty kilometers. But this is not a matter of surprise since in the United States laws are demanded that "would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel,"—and this by men who reckon as infidels, and even as atheists, all who do not keep Sunday. And we already have in every State laws requiring the observance of the "Christian Sabbath." The difference between Russia and some of the States of the American Union now as regards religious laws is in degree and not in kind. For instance, it has been held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that Christianity is the religion of the State; it is also the religion of Russia, only the government of Russia gives a little narrower interpretation to the term "Christianity."
