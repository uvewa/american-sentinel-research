PARKER PILLSBURY, of Concord, New Hampshire, well known as one of the original anti-slavery agitators has rendered the country another valuable service in writing "Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles." Mr. Pillsbury's book is interesting and valuable now; it will be more so in years to come. Time ever adds to the value of accurate history. The author has not only grouped together in this book an imposing array of most interesting facts concerning the anti-slavery agitation, but he has thrown into his narrative the energy of the deep convictions which nerved him for the important part which he himself took in the struggle for the freedom of an enslaved race, and which he now modestly but faithfully relates. Those especially who have grown up since the war which struck the shackles from four millions of their fellow-beings, should read this book as it will enable them to estimate more nearly the value of human freedom and the degrading influence of serfdom.
