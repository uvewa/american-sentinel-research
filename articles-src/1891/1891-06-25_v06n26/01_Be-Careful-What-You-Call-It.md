# Be Careful What You Call It.

AT a funeral in Millbank, South Dakota, April 19 last, there was distributed in the pews of the church in which the funeral was held a number of copies of Woman's Christian Temperance Union leaflet No. 3, Sabbath Observance Department. A friend who was at the funeral sent us one of the leaflets. It is entitled, "Seventh-Day Question Box, as Answered from the Lecture Platform by Mrs. J. C. Bateham." It is composed of eight questions, to which answers are given by Mrs. Bateham, and such accounts of the ones which they represent are worth laying before the readers of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. The first question and answer read as follows:—

> Is it right to legislate on religious subjects?

> *Answer.* That depends upon what one calls religious. The laws against murder and theft, which also have been enacted and which we call civil laws, are based upon the moral law. Turn to one's own hand—to the fourth commandment. It contains no one and nothing but God, himself his rest day, and on the other with our distinction. Rest spoken of here in this law is for the bodies of the toilers. Now if we count the words and put half on one table and half on the other we find that it is the second table that has what we have called the Sabbath command. But this the first part, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," puts it where it belongs, as containing our duty to God. This is the heart and core Christian. On the second table we have put the rest of the command, which says *when* people may rest, and which is the hand of our civil Sabbath. No one asks both legislatures to order that the day may be kept holy; that lies between God and the conscience. Whereas to the second table, the matter of rest, we appeal for legislation. . . . And for the same reasons; why not also to protect the rest day of the fourth commandment as such, the Sabbath, as we say we are only asking for protection of the command as we see it.

[page 201] By it seems from this that whether a thing is religious or not depends altogether upon what you call it. If you call it religion, then it is such, and if you call it something else, then it is not religion. This is in fact the rule which is followed by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the other organizations that are working for Sunday laws. Every one that they propose is framed in religious phrases and proposes to enforce the religious observance of the day, and yet they all call them civil rest laws. They call it civil Sabbath and the observance which they insist is reform. They call the civil observance of the day; and of course the observance is what it is, because they call it that; and the religious words, phrases, and nature of the proposed laws are all taken away by simply calling the thing civil. Then, on the other hand having thus committed themselves to civil and political things, when they are charged with being political organizations and with working for political power, advantages, and things, they assume an air of virtuous indignation and declare that they are religious organizations having nothing at all to do with politics, and that their work is altogether religious work. And then of course it is all religious because they call it that. If Jeremiah had only known that, the rod, the iron, never had any injury, "that the leopard change his spots?" He could change his spots by calling them something else.

This is a very pretty theory that Mrs. Bateham has framed for the dividing of the commandment of having the first half relate to God and the second half to man. Let us test it and see. It reads thus: Work is the first part, fourth commandment as God gave it:—

> Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

[page 202] She says, "Count the words and put the first half on the one table and the second half on the second, and we find the first going on the first table containing our duties to God, and all the rest put on the second table, pertains to our duties to man;" "that the first part forms the basis for the religious Sabbath and the second half the basis for the civil Sabbath."

Now there are ninety words in that commandment. To divide those words equally the division must be made including the forty-seventh word. The forty-seventh word is "manservant." All of the command, therefore, up to and including this word, according to Mrs. Bateham's theory, belongs on the first table, as containing our duties to God; and all below it, that word belongs on the second table, as pertaining to our duty to man.

Now, by what rule is it that the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will make the words, "thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant" apply to our relationship to God, and make the words, "nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates," pertain only to our duty to man? Because, in our relationship toward our cattle certainly our relationship to fellow-men? If our man's duty to his cattle pertains to his duty to man? And by what rule is it that the Union, by Mrs. Bateham, makes our relationship to son, daughter, and manservant pertain to God and our relationship to maidservant, cattle, and stranger to man? By what rule is it that the words "servants and household women" (Ex. 20:10) make the words, "for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it," pertain to our duty to man? By what rule is it that they make these words pertain to our duty to man? Just where is it in these words that our duty to man comes in? How much of our duty to man is involved in either the fact, or the statement of the fact that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them is? or the fact that he rested the seventh day? or the fact that he blessed the seventh day? or that he hallowed it? All this pertains to our duty to man, why is it that the words in the first part of the commandment, "six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it thou shalt not do any work," do not pertain likewise to man? In short if these last words in the commandment pertain to our duty to man, then why is it that all the words in the commandment do not likewise pertain to man? Why is the expression, "the seventh day is the Sabbath," having the "i s" on the first table and the "a" on the second table? In fact there is no point in the whole commandment at which either the commandment alone or the ten commandments as a whole can be counted as pertaining wholly to one table more than the other. This whole theory of Mrs. Bateham and of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union is only a piece with the whole Sunday-law movement. It absolutely denies the divine character and basis of the Sabbath and reduces it wholly to its human. And it is only to destroy the Sabbath. Just as far as this view of it is accepted the ten commandments are spoken of in the original Scripture as the "ten words." Each word is the expression of a sublimest thought. And the thought expressed in the fourth of the ten words pertains as wholly and as certainly to our duty to God as any of the three which precede it. "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work." Why? "Because God rested the seventh day. In it he did no work. Why keep it holy? Because the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it." "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work." Why? "Because in six days the Lord made heaven and earth." It is all from first to last, in every view in both the first part and the last part of this commandment. The first part states the facts, and the last but partly states the reason for observing and commemorating the fact.

This word does indeed spread to man, to his daughter, his manservant, his maidservant, etc., not because it contains duties pertaining to duty, but because it contemplates his duty to God; not because man as the head of the family, and so made responsible to God for the conduct on the Sabbath day, of those under the jurisdiction which God bestowed upon man in his headship of the family. So that as a matter of fact, as a matter of truth, and according to the fourth commandment, as well as God spoke it and wrote it, but according to all the other Scriptures upon the question, the fourth commandment pertains wholly to man's duty to God as surely as any of the first three do. It is all and all that in them is.

It may be indeed that Mrs. Bateham's manner of the counting and dividing of the words of the fourth commandment sort of that whole law, and that from this the division will be made as so as to leave on the first table the words, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;" while the rest of that commandment will rest upon the second table; but that is not what the Papacy intended. It implied that the words counted and evenly divided, only those words of the fourth commandment which say, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy," will be left upon the first table.

But this is not true in any view. To count the words of the whole law and divide them evenly, the dividing line comes in the middle of the word "is," in the expression, "the seventh day is the Sabbath," having the "i s" on the first table and the "a" on the second table. In fact there is no point in the whole law at which either the commandment alone or the ten commandments as a whole can be counted as divided so as to leave on the first table only those words of the fourth commandment which Mrs. Bateham implied will be left there by the division which she had suggested. In fact any attempt to divide the law or as a whole, or the fourth commandment alone, as suggested by Mrs. Bateham and published by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union turns the holy law of God into an absurdity.

[page 203] As before said by the Graphic, the Church must be in a deplorable condition when it is compelled to depend upon civil law and the police commissioner to fill its pews. Religion must live by pure persuasion and not rest on force. Even those who believe that God consecrated the seventh day and set it apart as a day of rest and worship do believe that the State is intended to restrict the religious liberty of his people or deprive them of any of their natural rights by the imposition of such restrictions. The life of Christ teaches the contrary.

The Oakland (Cal.) *Times* says: "The Sunday law is simply indefensible. It is entirely without the pretense of the law. The mystic and the supernatural have no part in the affairs of government. The spirit that incites and sustains legislation is a hideous survival of medieval intolerance and superstition. The Sunday law is as much out of season and as meaningless as the Renaissance." This being true, what else may we expect but open revolt resultant in chaos, unconstitutional amendment arends Graphic.
