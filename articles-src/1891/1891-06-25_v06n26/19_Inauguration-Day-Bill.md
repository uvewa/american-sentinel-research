The "Pearl of Days" says, "the bill introduced in the Fifty-first Congress providing for the changing of the beginning of the presidential term to the 30th day of April will be renewed early in the next Congress. It is possible that a provision may be inserted in this bill to fix the time on the last Wednesday in April, thus avoiding a repetition of the disgraceful Sabbath profanation in Washington that unfortunately accompanied the last inauguration. 'It is gratifying,' says the "Pearl," 'to be able to state that this bill, which is based upon historical, economic, sanitary, legislative and other important reasonings, is favored by eminent men of both political parties.'"

Possibly the other reasons might be discovered, but why it would be more "sanitary" to inaugurate a president upon the 30th of April than upon the 4th of March is not apparent, neither is it easy to see why men would be more liable to take cold upon Sunday than upon Wednesday.
