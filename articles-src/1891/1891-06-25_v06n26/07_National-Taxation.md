# National Taxation.

ALTHOUGH the National Reform Association (so-called) was first in the field for its endeavors at the national principle though the Federal Constitution, its chief mischief is now about done. Two others, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and Prohibition Party, have come to the front as the principal elements of the grand army marshaling for the overthrow of civil and religious liberty in this country. The several theocratic principles of the former make is a standing to all accept the extremist lengths; hence the necessity for a change of base. These schemes hope to divert attention from their ultimate designs by battling to reform reform more or less in the line of the moral sentiment and tastes of the popular churches.

It is in accordance with such strategy as this that the Blair Educational (relating the other day or having been the original amendment) bill has been kept before Congress as permissible. It provided for teaching popular Christianity in the public schools, and thus, by insidious indirection, would have made the religion of the majority within the churches to be the State religion. The same thing is true of Edmunds' educational amendment.

The Breckinridge Sunday bill, if it should become a law, would practically commit the Government to the union of religion with the State. All these measures have the hearty approval of all the before mentioned Church and State organizations. Could this issue be brought directly before the American people in its fait, full and free dimensions, their verdict would decide for the right of conscience as it is, with all its guarantees to civil and religious freedom intact; but danger lies in the possibility that Congress may be induced to pass a bill establishing a compulsory national observance of the day of rest, as it is called. The same interests caused Church and State amendment to the State legislatures, and, that in the legislation of the political parties a strong may be effected by which the Government may be subverted without its Christian coming before the voters at all. Thus an luncheon would be injurious to the country and would take for its fact we ever reach the sincerity of liberty and of freedom, from which deliverance could only come as the result of revolution. The measures and intelligences would all mean superstition. —*Freethought.*

"A SUNDAY law of any description. It says the Nottingham *Express,* "is to put a stop to industrial pursuits one day because be invoked the Lerds Day Observance act to prevent persons from opening for the sale of an entertainment upon Sunday, Sundays the magistrate before whom the case was tried demanded that the information be deposited to the Home Secretary who applied to believe for him imposed and the costs."

It is stated that in Minnesota, the men and workmen at their trade on Sunday were not set forth and were not furnished night in great centres of population, it had been tolerated by assorted means that in Portugal twenty years ago five shops were open today more than one is to be seen now on Sunday, and the streets in that country present an appearance of almost complete quietness." "Many people go to their churches on Sunday more or less, so that the European country Sunday is becoming not more but less a holiday, more of the American Sunday is becoming not more but a holiday, more a holiday, a holiday, and, more building a holiday, and, instead of assuming a day of rest."

And yet such men would pretty much follow all efforts to make Sunday a holy day by all the absence of genuine regard for it as in the minds of the horde of people. Sunday laws only foster the hypocrisy, namely, sending forth new lessons to convert, but not to purify.

Just as the part of the conduct of any one for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.—*Mill.*
