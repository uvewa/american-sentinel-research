RECENTLY the Chicago Post protested as follows against the use of the word Sunday:—

Some one inveighs against the use of the word "Sabbath" in a newspaper, and pertly declares "it is not journalistic—Sunday is the correct word." Pray, for what reason? Sunday comes to us from a dead mythology, which was once the world's curse; Sabbath from a live religion, which is now the world's blessing. Sunday has associations so cruel they might make angels weep; Sabbath has memories so gentle and so sweet that they make men rejoice. One in its very sound is harsh and cold; the other is soft and musical. One has in it the noon-day glare; the other the soft light falling through cathedral windows. Sunday recalls the noise and bustle of a Parisian holiday; Sabbath brims over with suggestions of quiet and of rest. The Sabbath day! Long may those words remain the favorite designation of the day most dear to hearts American.

Upon this the Sabbath Recorder, Seventh-day Baptist, comments thus:—

The Post could hardly have put the case more clearly and forcibly. But the difference which that journal so sharply defines is more than a difference in name; it is a difference in fact. Sunday and Sabbath are not the same thing. The Post says truly that "Sunday comes to us from a dead mythology, which was once the world's curse;" and that "Sabbath [comes] from a living religion, which is now the world's blessing." It is because this is so, that men refuse to call Sunday the Sabbath or treat it as such. It is against this effort to mix things that the plea is made which the Post takes as its text for the above paragraph. A man may call white black until his face is red, but that does not make it so. In like manner the Post may call Sunday Sabbath with all the fervor imaginable, still the fact remains that Sunday is the child of pagano-papal device, while the Sabbath is the "Sabbath of the Lord thy God." We, too, pray that the Sabbath as the symbol of God's power and love in the world may never depart from the hearts of the people; but calling Sunday the Sabbath will never prevent so great a calamity.

It is very true that calling Sunday the Sabbath can never make it so if God has not made it the Sabbath; yet it is less than a month since the *Sabbath Recorder* contained an editorial plea for the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, because, as it said, "the attack upon Sunday is really an attack upon American Sabbath-keeping, represented by Sunday, and involves not the question of a day, but the Sabbath idea and principle." Now if "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, and if observing it is "Sabbath-keeping," why not adopt the suggestion of the *Post* and call it the Sabbath? And if "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, how does it still remain true that it "is the child of pagano-papal device." But be this answered as it may, one fact does remain, namely, that putting this quotation from the *Recorder* alongside of former utterances of the same paper, the conclusion, though unwelcome is unavoidable, that that paper's opposition to Sunday legislation is not from love of religious liberty in its broad sense, but from zeal for another day, which, were such a thing possible, it would like to see honored by civil Government even as Sunday is now exalted. If in this we err, we would be glad to be corrected.
