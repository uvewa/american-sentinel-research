In his late encyclical on the condition of labor, the Pope seeks to justify compulsory cessation of secular work on Sundays and certain festivals, and says:—

The rest from labor is not to be understood as mere idleness; much less must it be an occasion of spending money and of vicious excess, as many would desire it to be; but it should be rest from labor, consecrated by religion.

This is only putting in other phrase the words of Mr. Crafts: "Take the religion out and you take the rest out." However we do not accuse "his holiness" of plagiarism; probably he never even so much as heard of Mr. Crafts and his Sunday-law propaganda; the similarity of thought is only a family likeness; it inheres in the very Sunday-law idea. The sole purpose of Sunday laws is to secure a rest consecrated to religion, and it is not strange that that thought crops out in both Protestant and Papal utterances.
