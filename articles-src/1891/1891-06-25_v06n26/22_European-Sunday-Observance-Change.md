It is stated that in Europe "open shops and workmen at their tasks on Sunday are not such frequent sights in the great centres of population as formerly. An observant traveler asserts that in Paris twenty years ago five shops were open and a dozen workmen were seen at their tasks where one is to be seen now on Sunday. The same change is noted in Berlin, Vienna, and other large cities of the Continent. This does not indicate a growth of religious feeling, however, but a change merely from working to rest-taking and from the plodding to the holiday spirit." "Many more people go picnicking on Sunday now than then, so that the European Sunday is becoming not more a holy day, but more a holiday, in consequence of the laws favoring a day of rest."

And this result must inevitably follow all efforts to make Sunday a holy day by law in the absence of genuine regard for it as such in the hearts of the people. Sunday laws only foster in this country the very thing they are designed to prevent, namely, holidayism.
