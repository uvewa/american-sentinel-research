# Editorial Notes.

[page 208] NEW YORK, JUNE 25, 1891.

Any one having copies of the American Sentinel, without covers and in good condition—"nearly new"—with the purpose and desire to do work for the Lord in this direction, should send these papers to us. These are needed for such purpose, and those who have no further use for them, can do much good by sending them. They must be in good condition. The return, there must have to know that they will be useful to those who may want. If they have none of the papers do not fail to send money.

No Paper Next Week.

---

ACCORDING to our usual custom we shall omit one issue in September of the SENTINEL. The next number published is July; there will be therefore no SENTINEL next week. Number 27 will bear date of July 9.

Tax platforms adopted by the Iowa Prohibitionists at their late convention contains a resolution in favor of the immediate abolition of the internal revenue system on the ground that it tends to encourage the liquor traffic by recognizing it nationally.

"It is believed by most of those who are interested in the Sunday question," says the New York *Observer,* "that to observe the Sabbath is 'only a day' or to put it plainly the Sabbath. This one way and this one truth, the chief aim of those who regard Sunday as the Sabbath is are settled by the question."

The Christians at Work deprecates the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of art on Sunday, and intimates that workingmen and others have not sufficient intelligence to enjoy its privileges afforded them by Sunday opening. It would be well, however, for the Sunday aristocrats to know all that knowledge in this matter is not bound up in their craniums.

are demanded that "would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel,"—and this by men who refuse an infidel, and even an atheist, all who do not keep Sunday. And we already have in every State laws requiring the observance of the "Christian Sabbath." The difference between Russia and some of the States of the American Union as now regards religious laws is in degree and in the fact.

For instance, it has been held by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, that Christianity is the religion of the State; it is also the religion of Russia, only the ornament of Russia gives a little narrower interpretation to the term "Christianity."

On the demand for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the *Mail and Express* says:—

It is significant that even the Seventh-day Baptists are saying now that since the closing of the Fair on Sunday has been settled and in the passed. Now, let us hope from follow citizens me and up for a seven-fold return in works of philanthropy, by which it is practicable in the Christian country.

How the Seventh-day Baptists Explained it, we say by putting it?

The "Post of Days" notes the fact that "the War, Navy and Post Office departments refuse exhaled; Sunday, their offices not to a minimum, yet largely, so far as existing laws and the necessities of the public service will permit." But this is not satisfactory to the "Pearl" and so it follows that the American Sabbath Union demands that "the essentially of the public service" shall be utterly ignored in the interests of Sunday. Such a proposition could properly be called neither religious nor patriotic.

The report of the Committee on "Sabbath Observance," appointed by the late General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, says:—

The Pan Republican Congress Committee at a series of sessions in Washington, D. C., received a marked favor the suggestion of the American Sabbath Union to urge the appointment of delegates to the World's Fair in 1892 for the discussion of the commercial, hygienic, industrial, civil and religious aspects of Sabbath observance. Arrangements will be made by that committee at the coming meeting of the Commission to add the subject to the one held in Paris in 1889.

The "Pearl of Days" says, "the bill introduced in the Fifty-first Congress providing for the changing of the beginning of the presidential term to the 30th day of April will be renewed early in the next Congress. It is possible that a provision may be inserted in this bill to fix the time on the last Wednesday in April, thus avoiding a repetition of the disgraceful Sabbath profanation in Washington that unfortunately accompanied the last inauguration. "It is gratifying," says the "Pearl" "to see this patriotic movement which is based upon historical, economic, sanitary, legislative and other important [page 208] measures, is favored by eminent men of both political parties."

Possibly the other measures might be discovered, but why it would be more "sanitary" to inaugurate a president upon the 30th of April than upon the 4th of March is not apparent; neither is it easy to see why it would be more likely to bring veil upon Sunday than upon Wednesday.

In its late encyclical on the condition of labor, the Pope seeks to justify compulsory observance of Sunday by referring to certain festivals, and says—

No man may with impunity violate that human nature; much less must it be an cessation of that higher life which has reference to what religion demands. Rest from labor; it should be set from that higher command.

This is only putting in other phrase an idea of the old Puritan Sabbatarians; live out and you take the rest out. However we do not see—where "his holiness" of "papal infallibility" makes exactly as much as heard of Mr. Crafts and his "pearl for days" or propounds, the nationalizing of thought is only a family likeness. It is borne in the very atmosphere of both these purposes of Sunday laws is to secure a not concerned or to religion, and yet it is strange that that concept should cross out in chaos, unconstitutional free from both civil Potentat and Papal utterances.

PARKER PILLSBURY, of Concord, New Hampshire, well known as one of the noted anti-slavery agitators has readied in his combative monthly number, works in writing. "Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles." Mr. Pillsbury's power is still sinking and valuable now; it will be more so 30 years to come. True verse adds to the value of accurate records. The author has not only grouped together in this book an imposing array of most interesting facts concerning the anti-slavery agitation, but he has herein the touching of a subject, the energy of the deep conviction which moved him for the important part which he himself took in the struggles for the freedom of the bondman, and from which he is now unable. We trust especially who have those to grow from the race who struck first blows in this conflict from four millions of their fellow-beings, should this book the time-honored veteran, and by its purchase enable the publishers to estimate more easily the value of some of the matters of importance.
