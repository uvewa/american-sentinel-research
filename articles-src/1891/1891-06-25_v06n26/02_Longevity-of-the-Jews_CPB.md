We take the following from the Christian Statesman:—

Attention is being called to the comparative longevity of the Jews. Thus, it is said that in Polish Prussia, in a population of ten thousand, three Christians die for every two Jews, and that in Austria the proportion is about the same. In Saxony, one Jew in fifty-one and one Christian in thirty-three expresses the comparative death rate. At Frankfort, fifty-four per cent. of the Jews reach their seventieth year, against thirty-eight per cent. of the Christians. In Hungary, the chance of life among the Croats is put at twenty years, the Germans at twenty-seven, and the Jews at forty-six. In attempting to determine why the Jew is thus more exempt from disease than others, physicians like Dr. Guencan de Mussey have come to the conclusion that this comparative immunity is due to the wholesome sanitary laws of the Old Testament. Moses, for illustration, forbade as food the flesh of animals especially liable to parasites. He prohibited the use of blood by which infectious diseases are liable to be spread. In some way the inspired lawgiver seems to have had some notion of tuberculosis and bacilli, or else he was so guided that he legislated more wisely than he knew.

We are interested in this item principally because it furnishes a complete refutation of the standard argument for the so-called "civil Sabbath." We are told that a weekly day of rest is absolutely essential to the health of the people, and that in order for a part of the people to rest all must rest; and that as all will not rest without a law compelling them to do so, a Sunday law is a physical necessity. This claim has been urged so long and so confidently that many accept it without question; but that it is not true is shown by Hebrew vital statistics everywhere.

It will of course be urged that the Jews observe a regular weekly rest, and that this is one reason for the low death rate among them. But what then becomes of the assertion that the necessary rest can not be obtained unless all rest upon the same day? Clearly it falls to the ground; for so far as the Jews do rest in the manner insisted upon by the Sunday-law advocates as a physical necessity, they rest upon a day when those around them are engaged in the ordinary pursuits of life; thus utterly refuting the contention of the American Sabbath Union that all must rest or none can.

And not only do the Jews disprove the assertion that needful rest can not be taken by a part of the people while the other part are at work, but the facts quoted from the Statesman also discredit the claim, so confidently made by some, that a stated weekly rest is a physical necessity; for it is a well-known fact that very many Jews, yielding to the greed of gain, keep no day, but do business seven days each week.

Nor are the Jews the only living witnesses against the assumption that a regular weekly rest-day is a physical necessity of mankind. March 11, 1890, the writer heard Bishop Andrews, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who had just returned from China, say that "in that country they have no Sabbath; yet laboring men live to be very old." He said that he did not understand it, but that it was a fact. The Bishop made this statement on the platform of a meeting held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, and he had no intention of discrediting the physical-necessity argument; but facts have always been unkind to falsehood, and so the blow was none the less deadly because given by a friendly hand.
