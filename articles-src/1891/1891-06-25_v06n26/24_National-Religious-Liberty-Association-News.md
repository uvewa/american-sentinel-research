THE midsummer anniversary of the American Sabbath Union will be held at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, July 26, 27.

THE Chicago Inter-Ocean, of June 3, is authority for the statement that Ex-Senator Palmer, President of the Columbian Exposition, says that "the World's Fair will open its doors on Sunday."

THE Society of Christian Endeavor, of Tennessee, closed its State meeting at Nashville on June 7. Among the resolutions passed was one favoring the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.

THE advocates for the enforcement of Sunday observance by civil law held a meeting for organization at Kankakee, Illinois, May 31. All the ministers of the place were in attendance, and the necessity for vigorous action was strongly urged.

THE friends of Sunday legislation have been making a strong effort to secure a stringent Sunday law in Butler, Missouri. The council refused to act in the matter, so a petition has been circulated, and a long list of names secured from Sunday schools, churches, etc., and the effort with the council will be renewed with vigor.

W. F. CRAFTS reports having delivered seventy-one addresses for the Sunday Union in the first sixty days of what he styles his "tenth Sabbath-reform tour," and makes appointments for Atchison, Kansas, June 21-24, immediately followed by addresses at the Chautauqua Assembly, Fremont, Neb.; Kearney and Lincoln, June 28-30; the first part of July in Winnipeg and Fargo; a week following in Southern Illinois; the two Chautauquas at Lakeside, Ohio, and Claion, Penn., the first week in August; Mansfield, Ohio, August 9; Kansas City, Mo., September 13-16; Oberlin, Ohio, October 16; Canajoharie, N. Y., October 20.

THE trial of baseball Captain Kelly for playing a Sunday game in Cincinnati resulted in an acquittal on a technicality. The prosecution rejected to prove that the game was played on the first day of the week as expressly named in the statute. When will a judge and a jury be found willing to meet these questions intelligently on the principles involved?

AT the London Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held at Windsor, Canada, June 9, Rev. J. H. Chant read the report of the Committee on Sabbath Observance. The committee recommended the Conference to memorialize the Provincial and Dominion Legislatures "to secure for our country a better observance of the Lord's day."

THE subject of the Bible in the public schools is being agitated in Galesburg, Illinois. Dr. Sturdevant promounced it a piece of Jesuitium to protest against the Bible in the public schools and then to demounce them as godless. Petitions asking the Board of Education to compet Bible reading in the schools of Galesburg are being circulated.

MRS. FRANCES MILTON TROULOPE (the mother of the great novelist), visited this country in 1837-30, and in her writings bears the following unconscious testimony as to the peculiar methods then employed for enforcing the observance of the "American Sunday." Speaking of the national capital she says:—

The general appearance of Washington on a Sunday is much less puritanical than that of most other American towns; the people walk about, and there are no chutes in the streets, as at Philadelphia, to prevent their riding or driving if they like it.

AT Dayton, Ohio, May 21, a large assembly of Christian women voted to protest with heart and voice and pen against open Sabbath gates at the Columbian Exposition, to be held in Chicago in 1893, as a disgrace to the nation and a sin against God.

CHRISTIANS, who in their hearts believe that Sunday observance is a duty they owe to transferes and their God, will not go to the Fair on that day even if it should be open. Would the "sin against God" be any less in the man who stays at home, intensely longing to be at the Fair, but is deterred because it is closed, than if he should spend the entire day viewing the exhibits. If sin is what those good women want to avoid in the nation they must find something to cleanse the hearts of the people. The gosepil is the only remedy for sin, and the closed gates of the great Fair will not bring it to any one. It must come by individual, personal invitation through the open door of the heart.

ATLANTA, Georgia, has finally secured the enforcement of a strong Sunday law. All places of business are closed except hotels, drug stores, and soda fountains in connection with drug stores. All freight trains are stopped, and no switching is allowed in the yard from twelve o'clock Saturday night for a coste Sunday night.

REV. EDWARD THOMPSON, Secretary of the Ninth and Tenth Districts of the American Sabbath Union, in the course of a report to the "Pearl of Days," gives as the reasons for the repeal of Sunday laws in California eight years ago,

First—The law could not be enforced, it was not supported by public sentiment: the State had been for years without an American Sabbath Union; the State had been for years without an American sanitary occupation; and the people that have como to the surface, we may mention that Santa Anna, the beautiful county seat of Orange County, was the first city of the State to enact a Sunday-closing ordinance. A great battle, lasting over six months in succession, was waged at Lee Angeles, the second city in the State, which resulted in a victory for the Sunday forum. Santa Barbara, one of the most important towns in Southern California, followed with a similar ordinance a month later, and this year of 1891 was opened with a Sunday-closing ordinance passed by the county supervisors of San Bernardino County, and applying to all the towns and cities of that county, the largest county, geographically, in the State. The supervisors of Lee Angeles County have passed a Sunday-closing ordinance for that whole county, the second in population and importance in the State.
