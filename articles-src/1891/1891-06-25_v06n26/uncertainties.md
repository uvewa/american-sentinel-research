# Uncertainties Log - v06n26 (1891-06-25)

## General Notes
This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, though some proper names and specific terms required interpretation.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1 - "Be Careful What You Call It"
- **Location:** Page 1, opening paragraph
- **Issue:** Town name "Millbank, South Dakota" - OCR clear, assumed correct
- **Transcribed as:** "Millbank"
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 2 - Fourth Commandment quotation
- **Location:** Page 2, mid-page
- **Issue:** "maidservant" vs "maid-servant" - original shows hyphenated in first instance, non-hyphenated in discussion
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved exactly as appeared in OCR (hyphenated where it appeared that way)
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 5 - Gladstone quote
- **Location:** Page 5, discussion of tax exemption
- **Issue:** Currency symbols and amounts
- **Transcribed as:** "£2" and "$3,000,000" and "$50,000"
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 6 - Names in news items
- **Location:** Page 6, various news briefs
- **Issue:** "Ex-Senator Palmer" - full name not given in OCR
- **Transcribed as:** "Ex-Senator Palmer"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - title and last name clear

- **Issue:** "W. F. Crafts" vs "W. F. Chapes" - OCR showed "CHAPES" in one location
- **Transcribed as:** "W. F. CRAFTS" (corrected based on known author)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - this is a known figure in Sunday law movement

- **Issue:** Town names - "Claion, Penn." appears to be OCR error for "Clarion"
- **Transcribed as:** "Claion" (preserved OCR as written, possibly should be Clarion)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

- **Issue:** "Mrs. Frances Milton Troulope" - name and dates
- **Transcribed as:** As shown in OCR
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

- **Issue:** "Santa Anna" vs "Santa Ana" - OCR showed "Santa Anna"
- **Transcribed as:** "Santa Anna" (as in OCR, though modern spelling is "Santa Ana")
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

- **Issue:** "Lee Angeles" appears multiple times - OCR error for "Los Angeles"
- **Transcribed as:** "Lee Angeles" (preserved OCR error)
- **Confidence:** LOW - this is almost certainly "Los Angeles" but OCR was consistent

### Page 6 - Garbled text
- **Location:** Page 6, California Sunday law discussion
- **Issue:** Several phrases appear garbled or incomplete in OCR
- **Transcribed as:** Preserved as OCR provided
- **Confidence:** LOW - some passages do not make complete sense

### Page 6 - Author attribution for reprint
- **Location:** "Should the State Contribute to the Support of the Church?"
- **Issue:** Attribution shows "Rev. A. P. McDiarmid" at end with title "Should Church Property be Taxed?"
- **Transcribed as:** Marked as reprint with original_publication "Rev. A. P. McDiarmid"
- **Confidence:** HIGH

## Resolution Actions Taken
1. Corrected obvious OCR error "W. F. CHAPES" to "W. F. CRAFTS"
2. Preserved apparent OCR errors "Lee Angeles" as they appeared consistently
3. Preserved "Claion" as unclear if this is correct or OCR error
4. Preserved "Santa Anna" as OCR showed (modern spelling is "Santa Ana")

## Notes for Future Review
- Several news briefs in Page 6 section have garbled or incomplete sentences that may need verification against original
- "Lee Angeles" should likely be corrected to "Los Angeles" in any future review
- Page 6 contains what appears to be OCR artifacts from advertisements and image descriptions
