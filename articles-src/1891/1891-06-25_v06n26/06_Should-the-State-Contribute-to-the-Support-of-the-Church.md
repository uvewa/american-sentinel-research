We must view the mission and obligation of the Church, if we view it correctly, from the standpoint of Christ. We have largely shifted ground, and are equinting at it from the standpoint of the State. The State has certain ends. It can utilize the Church to accomplish those ends. Then we jump at the conclusion the State ought to pay the Church by at least exempting it from taxation. We reach this conclusion from a false position. Whence came the Christian religion? By whose authorization has it a place in the world? Bringing it into the world, to what institution did He commit it? What laws did He appoint for the preservation and propagation of this religion in the world? Did Christ commit his religion to any institution of the world? He committed it solely to his Church. "My kingdom is not of this world." He gave instruction, too, in the principles that should govern his Church in the support of His religion in the world. These instructions do not permit the employment of force, either within the Church itself, or without it in the State, in the support of His cause.

But has the State nothing to do with the support of religion? We are told that the Government *must* support religion, in the army and navy. By whose authorization has the Government undertaken the support of religion in the army or navy, in the public school, or anywhere else? No one has the power to give the State that authority but Jesus Christ. Has he done it? The State in touching religion at all, is touching that which it has no business to touch. The Church is the only organization on earth authorized to propagate the Christian religion, and that at its own expense. . . . A Western secular paper puts the whole matter tersely in the following sentences:—

The Church is, or ought to be, purely a religious institution, voluntarily supported by those who accept its tenets or belief, or not at all. The State is, or ought to be, purely a secular institution, existing solely to preserve civil and national rights, liberty, equality and justice, and extending equal protection to all, but favors to none.

The principle touching the support and propagation of Christianity in the world, shining bright as a sunbeam on the pages of the New Testament, is voluntaryism simple and solitary. Force is utterly alien to the spirit of the Christian religion. Peter recognized the principle fully when condemning Ananias for lying—"Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold was it not in thine own power?" "Every man so let him give, according as he purposeth in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity," says Paul.

How forceful the presentation of this principle, as the principle of the Christian religion, in God's dealing with the sinner in the matter of personal salvation! Never has he forced a soul to accept salvation. Never has he impressed a soul into his service. Why not? Because he is deficient in the passion to save? Because he lacks the power to compel? Has he, who created the soul no power to force the will? Let Calvary speak of his passion to save. And yet he who "willeth not that any should perish," has never forced a soul into salvation. "Whosoever will come, may come." If the Almighty God, in his omniscient wisdom, has deliberately declined to introduce the element of compulsion into this matter of the salvation of men from sin, shall we, who are charged with his gospel, and are exalted to be "workers together with God," in the support and extension of the kingdom of Christ on earth,—shall we, in our wisdom, consent to the introduction of force in any form or degree into this work of God? The command of our Lord to Peter, "Put up thy sword," has never been countermanded by the Captain of salvation. Is there any reason more cogent for accepting the support of his cause by the sword to-day, than on that midnight hour in Gethsemane? And yet we are receiving for the support of his cause that which, in case of resistance, is wrested from the taxpayer at the point of the sword.

Does any one dispute the thought that exemption from taxation is really a gift bestowed by the State on the Church? Mr. Gladstone puts it simple and straight,—"An exemption is a gift: What the State remits to a man it gives to him." In illustration of this proposition he said: "If a gentleman has carriages and horses he is liable to pay a guinea for each horse, and £2 and upwards for each carriage, and if these sums be levied from his neighbor and not from him, it is the same thing as if, having been levied, they had been given back to him." That is perfectly clear. And so, if a tax is levied on my neighbor's property and not on my church property, it is the same thing as if, having been levied, it had been given back to me. Mr. Gladstone said further: "Exemption from taxation is a positive pecuniary premium or State subvention," adding, "I maintain that an exemption is a grant, and that all property should pay the taxes necessary for the enjoyment of all property." I do not think it possible to successfully dispute Mr. Gladstone's position.

The annual municipal grant to the churches of New York City must be an immense sum (estimated at $3,000,000, the Fifth Avenue Cathedral alone getting $50,000.) Brought out from under cover, would such an appropriation be made year by year to the churches? Who would venture to propose State aid in open form? We Baptists would shout ourselves hoarse in crying out against it. And yet such a method of State aid would be more defensible than that granted under the present disguise. I quote again from Mr. Gladstone: "When there is a public grant from year to year, we see what we are about; we let in the light of day."

It is perfectly manifest that if the property of the Church is exempted from taxation, other property must be additionally taxed to make up the amount exempted. This increase of taxation levied on other property is so levied, that it may be given by the municipality to the Church. It is a gift secured not by voluntary contributions of the people, but by compulsion from the taxpayers. Thus the Church is accepting for its support in part that which, by the machinery of the State, has been forced from property holders—Should Church Property be Taxed?
