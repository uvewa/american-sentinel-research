"A Sunday law of 1781, designed," says the Nottingham Express, "to put a stop to unlicensed preaching was recently invoked by the Lord's Day Observance Society of England, to punish a man for giving an entertainment upon Sunday. The defendant made no defense but appealed to the Home Secretary who remitted both the fine imposed and the costs."
