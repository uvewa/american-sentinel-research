The report of the Committee on "Sabbath Observance," appointed by the late General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, says:—

The Pan-Republican Congress Committee at a late session in Washington, D. C., received with marked favor the suggestion of the American Sabbath Union to reserve a place on its programme at the World's Fair in 1883 for the discussion of the civil, economical, hygienic, industrial, social and moral aspects of the weekly rest-day for all classes. Arrangements will be made by that committee at the proper time for an international Sunday congress similar to the one held in Paris in 1889.
