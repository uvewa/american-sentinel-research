# Sunday Laws.

THERE are a number of classes of citizens who do not believe that the first day of the week, called Sunday, is the Sabbath; since the Lord designated the seventh day as a day for rest and worship. Another class do not believe in any day at all. Still another class can not and do not believe in any day—whether commanded by God, and still another class can not at all about religious obligations.

This State has no authority to make religious laws, and all Sunday laws must necessarily be religious in character. The law can no more make men religious than it can make them unselfish or wise. Laws can restrain, but legal righteousness has ever been temporary . . .

[page 204] Sabbath can never make it so if God did not make it the Sabbath; yet it is less than a month since the Sabbath Reformulated an editorial idea in fact that Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, is really an attack upon American Sabbath-keeping, represented by Sunday rest with a church in its nationality, and every day is now involved not the question of a day, but the Sabbath idea and principle." Now if "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, and if observing it is "Sabbath-keeping," why not adopt the suggestions of the *Post* and call it the Sabbath? If "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, how does it still remain true that it by "the child of progress and of convenience." But be this answered as it may, our fact does remain, namely, that putting this question from the *Recorder* alongside of former utterances of the same paper, the conclusion, though unwelcome is unavoidable, that the paper's opposition to Sunday legislation is not from love of religious liberty in the broad sense, but only for another day, which, were nothing a thing possible, it would like to see enforced by precisely the kind of laws some day is now calling. If this is the view, we would be glad to be corrected.
