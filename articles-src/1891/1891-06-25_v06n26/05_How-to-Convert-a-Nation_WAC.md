It is amazing, to say the least, to hear the National Reformers talk about this being a Christian Nation, sending a memorial to the President calling his attention to the fact that this is pre-eminently a Christian Nation; and then see them turn around and tell that they have inaugurated a move to make this Nation what it ought to be—a Christian Nation. If it be a Christian Nation it doesn't need to be made such; but if it needs to be made a Christian Nation, then it is not one now, and why do National Reformers say it is? Here is a conundrum.

The National Reform idea is this, that this is really a Christian Nation; but that because the *word* God is not in the Constitution, and Christ is not recognized as the official head of this Government, and the people have not voted themselves pious, this is not a Christian Nation. That is to say, that if a man were in Heaven he would not really be there unless he called it Heaven! Must an honest man sound a trumpet, or be dishonest? Must the philanthropist blow a bugle telling of his alms-deeds, or be a misanthrope? "By their fruits," said the great Teacher, "ye shall know them." A word, a vote, is an empty shell. Deeds are living realities, and they are what determine character. If this is a Christian Nation it is because it is Christ-like and has complied with the requirements and regulations which make a Christian, and not because somebody or some political party or some official document calls it such.

But if this be a Christian Nation then we would ask, when was it converted? When did it repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? And when was it baptized? These are some of the Christian requirements. It is all fol-de-rol to talk about this being a Christian Nation. Not one in three holds any connection with a church in this country, and nearly half of these are Catholics. Out of the 64,000,000 population of the United States there are only 21,000,000 church-going people. Several millions of these are not too pious to drink and swear, and yet this is a Christian (?) Nation; 8000,000,000 is spent annually for liquor, and less than 86,000,000 for Christian missions, and yet this is a Christian Nation!

A nation is Christian only in the proportion that its citizens are Christians. And the unchristianized portion are not going to be christianized by a set of religious managers getting up a *furore* throughout the country and voting them Christians. The only way to convert a nation is to convert the citizens of that nation *individually*. The good Book tells us that "with the heart man believeth," not with the government. If these self-styled reformers were really as anxious to convert and save men and women as they pretend to be, they would endeavor to educate the heart, and teach morals by moral suasion and let politics alone. What does it matter whether the Constitution has the word God in it or not? Must the Christian wait until it has before he can worship God? Is that political document his best or-only means of worshiping the Almighty? The National Reformer denounces the Constitution upon this ground; would he likewise reject a five hundred dollar bank draft because perchance it might not have upon its face the name of the Creator?

This calls to mind an expression we once heard a sedate looking Methodist minister make in a meeting of a Ministerial Association, in one of our large Western cities. After that body had listened to a lecture on the subject of National Reform by one of its ardent advocates, he said, "Gentlemen, I want you to understand that when you get the *word* God in the Constitution you have not necessarily got God there." These words we thought were indeed most fitting and appropriate. They embody a truism too cogent to need comment, but one which National Reformers seem loth to comprehend.

The articles of confederation by which human slavery was to be forever perpetuated in this fair land had the word God in them, but God was not with that cause. The Constitution of No Man's Land also recognizes God as "the Supreme Ruler of the universe, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of individuals, communities, States and nations," but a better refuge for banditti and others of the ungodly is perhaps not to be found in North America. What has a name to do with facts?

If National Reformers wish this Nation to be a Christian nation in deed and in truth, let them go to work and Christianize its citizens, not by voting them Christians, or enacting laws to make them act like Christians, but by converting their hearts to the Christian faith. The great commission of Christ to his embassadors is, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations;" not vote or call them Christians whether they are or not.

If the United States Government is already Christian then the work of National Reformers is done, for that is what they professedly started out to make it. But if it is not, then, if they desire to accomplish their avowed design, there is other work for them to do than to be tinkering around legislative halls. To your pulpits, *O ye preachers!*
