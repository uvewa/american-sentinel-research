There are two or more classes of citizens who do not believe that the first day of the week, called Sunday, is the Sabbath, since the Lord designated the seventh day as a day for rest and worship. Another class do not believe in any day of worship commanded by God, and still another class care not at all about religious designations.

The State has no authority to make religious laws, and all Sunday laws must necessarily be religious laws. The law can no more make men religious than it can make them unselfish or wise. Laws can restrain, but legal righteousness has ever been temporary.

As before said by the Graphic, the Church must be in a deplorable condition when it is compelled to depend upon civil law and the police commissioners for support. Religion must live by pure persuasion and not rest on force. Even those who believe that God consecrated the seventh day and set it apart as a day of rest and worship do not believe that he intended to restrict the personal liberty of his people or deprive them of any pleasures. The Decalogue contains no such restrictions. The life of Christ shows no such arbitrary disposition. . . .

The Oakland (Cal.) Times says: "The Sunday law is simply indefensible. It is entirely without the province of the State. The mystic and the supernatural have no part in the affairs of government. The spirit that incites such legislation is a belated survival of medieval intolerance and superstition. The Sunday law is an anachronism. It has no place this side of the Renaissance." This being true, what else may we expect but open revolt against an obnoxious, unconstitutional law?
