# How to Convert a Nation.

IT is essential, or it may be, that the National Reformers talk about what the President of the Nation, calling its attention to the fact that this is pre-eminently a Christian nation; and then ask them then turn around and tell that they have legislated against the Christian religion then what it ought to be—a Christian Nation. If it is a Christian Nation it doesn't need to be made such; if it needs to be made a Christian Nation, then it is not a Christian nation now, and why do National Reformers say it is? Here is a contradiction.

The National Reform idea is this, that this is really a Christian Nation, but that, because the word God is not in the Constitution, and Christ is not recognized as the official head of this Government, that the people have not voted themselves good; this is not a Christian Nation. That is to say, that if a man were in Heaven, he would not really be in the kingdom unless he called it Heaven! Must an experience have a trumpet, or is he not honest? Must the philanthropist blow a bugle of his achievements to be really a benefactor of his fellow-race?

If it is a Christian Nation, as Bryce, the great Teacher, "ye shall know them." Deeds are the real test of Christian profession not talk. The Christianity of a Christian is shown by the fruits. A Nation can only be Christian as its people are Christian: its Christianity must be manifest as are all Christian virtues—not in words, but in deeds.

> It is not a question of majorities. If the for the one; if the many by it to be the standard, then there is no such thing as rights of conscience at all. It is against the predestination and power of majorities that the rights of conscientious men and their lives need to be exercised.—*Colorado* Chronicle.

[page 201] There are no Sabbath laws in California and no recognition of in its statutes of the Sabbath. The citizens of all faiths and of the State. Labor of all faiths can be carried on without hindrance, stores may remain open for the transaction of business as on any other day of the week, places of amusement may be open without interference from the authorities, while noisy demonstrations can go on as usual. But while there is the absence of all Sunday laws yet most of the people have been led on to come to the conclusion that there is no respect paid to the Lord's Day? Precisely opposite to its state the fact that San Francisco is a Sabbath-keeping city. The [page 204]

Sabbath can never make it so if God did not make it the Sabbath; yet it is less than a month since the Sabbath Reformulated an editorial idea in fact that Sunday-closing of the World's Fair, is really an attack upon American Sabbath-keeping, represented by Sunday rest as the basis of legislation. It involves not the question of a day, but the Sabbath idea and principle." Now if "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, and if observing it is "Sabbath-keeping," why not adopt the suggestions of the Post and call it the Sabbath? If "the Sabbath idea and principle" are in Sunday, how does it still remain true as that it by "the child of progress and of convenience." But he this answered as it may, our fact does remain, namely, that putting this question from the *Recorder* alongside of former utterances of the same paper, the conclusion, though unwelcome is unavoidable, that the paper's opposition to Sunday legislation is not from love of religious liberty in the broad sense, but only for another day, which, were nothing a thing possible, it would like to see enforced by precisely the kind of laws some day is now calling. If this is the view, we would be glad to be corrected.

COLONEL SHEPARD is credited with the statement that "this Sunday paper gets its chief patronage from Christian people." Then the Colonel's demand for laws forbidding the publication of Sunday papers is simply a demand for civil laws to compel Christian people to be moral Christians. This reminds us of the demand made by the bishops in the fourth century for the prohibition of shows on Sunday because the people attended them to the neglect of the church.

It is stated that "the most holy-generating creed" of Russia has issued orders to the effect that students of all religious denominations must attend lessons in the catechism, cathedrals, and that all industrial establishments must have an orthodox church within a distance of twenty kilometers. But this is not a matter of surprise since in the United States laws [page 204] we must ask, when was it converted? When did it repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? And when was it baptized? These are some of the Christian requirements. It is all folded to the faith that when he brings a Christian nation he is not on three holds any recognized such a church in its nationality, and every half of them are Catholics. Out of the 63,000,000 of population of the United States there are only 19,000,000 church-attending people. Several millions of these are not pious to drink and swear, and yet this is a Christian (?) Nation, $800,000,000 to $900 annual for liquor, and less than $6,000,000 for Christian missions, and yet this is a Christian Nation (?)!

A nation is Christian only in the proportion that its citizens are Christians. And the unsubstantiated position are not going to be Christianized by a set of religious managers getting up a *force* throughout the country and voting them Christians. The only way to convert a nation is to convert the citizens of that nation *individually.* The great Book tells us to "preach the heart man believeth," with from John, and it says in Romans that "with the heart man believeth," with from the mouth confession is made, etc., and no more men and women as they formerly were truly anxious to convert so to, they would minister to the bodily wants, heart, and touch morals by moral means and not by political means. What does it matter whether the Constitution has the word God in it or not? Must the Christian wait until it has before he can worship freely? Is this political document the creed? Does it verbally or not verbally enough of the Almighty? a National Reformer, touching of the Constitution upon this ground; would he thereby reject a five hundred dollar claim made because perhaps it might not have upon its face the name of the Creator?

This calls to mind an experience we once heard a strike looking Methodist minister make in a meeting of a Minister's Association, in one of our large Western cities. After being asked by all to listen to a lecture on the subject of National Reform one of the several churchmen in it said, "Gentlemen, I want you to understand that when you get the word God into the Constitution you have not necessarily got God there." Those words are thought which indeed merit fitting and real thought. They embody a truism too important to be dismissed from our deliberations.

National Reformers seem loth to compromise.

The action of confederation by which they propose to have the States cooperated in this fact into a State and is the truth, but to it, but God was not with that nation. The Constitution of No Man's Land also recognizes God as "the Supreme Being of the universe, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of individuals, communities, States and nations," but a better refuge for banditry and others of the ungodly is perhaps not to be found in North America. What has a name to do with facts?

If National Reformers with this Nation to be a Christian nation in deed and in faith, let them go to work and Christianize its citizens, not by closing their shops on Sundays, or enacting laws to make them act like Christians, but by converting their hearts to the Christian faith. The great commission says, "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations;" not vote on all them changes whatever they may be.

[page 205] The United States Government as at this Christian than the men of work of National Reformers is done, for what the National Reformers infidel; started out, so it has not. If it is not, then, if they desire to accomplish the conversion of this Government, let them work for them to be tinkering around legislative halls. To your pulpits, my good men.—*Freethought.*
