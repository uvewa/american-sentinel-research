COLONEL SHEPARD is credited with the statement that "the Sunday paper gets its chief patronage from Christian people." Then the Colonel's demand for laws forbidding the publication of Sunday papers is simply a demand for civil laws to compel "Christian people" to be consistent. This reminds us of the demand made by the bishops in the fourth century for the prohibition of shows on Sunday because the people attended them to the neglect of the church.
