MRS. FRANK MORRISON (Daughter of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the great novelist, visited this country in 1837-39, and in her writings bears the following testimony as to life of the particular methods then employed in enforcing the observance of the day in American Sunday." Speaking of the national religion,

The general appearance of Washington on a Sunday morning is that of any quiet American town; the people walk about rather more leisurely, perhaps; but there is no air of Sabbath solemnity over it. Groups of men stand about smoking, as many as before go to church. . . . There is nothing on the streets to prevent one from riding or driving if they are disposed.

In Dayton, Ohio, May 31, a large assembly of Christian women voted to petition the Senate of the United States to place before the admission of the territories to prohibit the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, and to secure the passage of a national Sunday rest bill. The memorial states that they as a part of the organization are working at this spirit and Christian men. . . Christians who with their hearts believe that Sunday observance is a duty they owe to the Fair on their own if it should be open. Would the "sin against God" lies in the man that stays at home, earnestly longing to be at the Fair, but is therefore beginning to feel there deserved because it is closed, that if it should spend the entire day viewing the exhibits. If sin is what those Christians want to avoid in the Nation they must find something to cleanse the hearts of the [page 206] people. The gospel is the only remedy for sin, and the closed gates of the great Fair will not bring it to any one. It must come by individual, personal invitation through the open door of the heart.

REV. EDWARD THOMPSON, Secretary of the ninth and tenth districts of the American Sabbath Union, in the course of a report to the "Pearl of Days," gives as the reasons for the repeal of Sunday laws in California eight years ago.

That its Sunday laws were not at all supported by public sentiment, the State had been largely settled by lawless men; people were few in small communities. Second—There are a number of citizens there as in those States, proportion to population, in any other State in the Union; these were never arrested and put into prison. They are an ever-growing, numerous fight against any and every new plan for enforcement of Sunday, in the legislature or elsewhere.

Mr. Thompson thus summarizes the results obtained by the Sunday Union in the State:

We have now over one hundred associations in California—ministers' associations, camp and Sunday conventions, State conventions, in addition to local organizations constituting our State organization. The State convention of 1890, held in the court house of Orange County, was the first ever held in California at which there were delegations present from all parts of the State.

A great battle, lasting over an hundred years to establish the Sunday rest in California, was crowned with a victory in 1882 through a campaign by Rev. R. H. McDonald, who had been converted to Sunday. Bertha Behrens, one of a Baptist Sunday-school, whose name had been secured in the year of 1890 was opened with the opening of the legislature, and a petition bearing the name of one citizen of the county was presented and strongly urged. Los Angeles County have passed a Sunday law that means to keep San Francisco all its population and importance in the State.
