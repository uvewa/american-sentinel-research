# Longevity of the Jews.

WE take the following from the *Christian at Work*:—

Attention is being called to the comparative longevity of the Jewish race. In Russia, in Prussia, in a population of ten thousand deaths the *Allgemeine fur every one* states that in Austria the proportion is about the same. In Bavaria, one Jew in fifty or one not of Jewish birth, to thirty-five expires the *Rundschau* estimate it, in Prussia, forty per cent. of the Jews reach their sixtieth birthday, their corresponding ages of the Teutonic populations, more than forty per cent. of the corresponding ages of the Germans in general. In Hungary, the German at twenty-seven, and the Jews live longer than the average. In summing up what is known in the most exempt from disease than others. In Russia, Galicia, Romania, and Hungary it is the conclusion that this comparative immunity is due to the obedience which every Jew of the Old Testament. Since no Frailness, or breaks of meat of a country equally fatally to character, since the violations of the laws of cleanliness are liable to spread. In many ways the Jewish law is a sanitary safeguard. It may have of indiscretion and health, or else he was so guided that ancient laws are only now seen as law of health, and their sanction is very plain.

Are we interested in this from purely physical because it furnishes a complete refutation of the standard argument for the so-called "civil Sabbath." We are told that a weekly day of rest is absolutely essential to the health of the people, and [page 201] drift is plainly in that direction. The moral sentiment of the people is largely in its favor, and with *very rare exception* you will find as much order and quiet in the streets as in some of our most favored Eastern cities.—*New York Observer.*

[page 203] that in order for a part of the people to rest all must rest; and that as all will not rest without a law compelling them to do so, "a Sunday law is a physical necessity." This claim has been urged so long and so confidently that many accept it without question; but that it is not true is shown by Hebrew vital statistics everywhere.

It will of course be urged that the Jews observe a regular weekly rest, and that this is one reason for the low death rate among them. But even this becomes lost in the assertion that the necessary rest can not be obtained unless it rest upon the same day? Charity falls to the ground, for as far as the Jews do not rest in the same time instead turn spies of the Sunday-law advocates as a physical necessity, they rest upon a day when those around them are engaged in the ordinary pursuits of life; thus utterly refuting the contention of the American Sabbath Union that all must rest or none can rest.

And not only do the Jews disprove the assertion that needful rest can not be got as a part of the people while the other part are at work, but the facts proved from the observation also disprove the claim, so confidently made by some, that a stated weekly rest is a physical necessity; for it is a well-known fact that very many Jews, who, in addition to the rest, keep to day, but do business seven days in the week.

Nor are the Jews the only living witnesses against the assumption that a regular weekly rest day is a physical necessity of mankind. March 11, 1890, the noted Bishop Ambrose, lately of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who had just returned from China, said that "in that country they have no Sabbath; yet laboring men live to be very old." He said that he did not understand it, but the fact was as he stated it. He made this statement on the platform of a meeting held under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, and he had no intention of discrediting the physical-necessity argument; but facts have always been unkind to falsehood, and so the blow was dealt the Sunday-rest theory by a friendly hand.
