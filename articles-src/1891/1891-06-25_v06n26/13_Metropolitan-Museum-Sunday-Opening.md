The Christian at Work deprecates the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday, and intimates that workmen and clerks have not sufficient intelligence to enjoy the privilege afforded them by Sunday opening. It would be well, however, for the Sunday aristocrats to know that all knowledge and refinement is not bound up in their craniums.
