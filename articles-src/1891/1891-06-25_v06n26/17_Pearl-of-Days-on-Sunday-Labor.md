The "Pearl of Days" notes the fact that "the War, Navy and Post Office departments have reduced Sunday labor, if not to a minimum, yet largely, so far as existing laws and the necessities of the public service will permit." But this is not satisfactory to the "Pearl" and so it follows that the American Sabbath Union demands that "the necessities of the public service" shall be utterly ignored in the interests of Sunday. Some people are too modest (?) by half.
