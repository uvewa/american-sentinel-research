THIS standard work, prepared by Charles F. Hudson, revised and completed by Ezra Abbot, D. D. LL.D., of Harvard University, and published by H. L. Hastings, of Boston, has reached its seventh edition. This edition is a great improvement over the former editions, being published in connection with Green's Greek and English Lexicon to the New Testament. The book itself is an invaluable aid to the Bible student, in that it does for the Greek text what Cruden's Concordance does for the English, and even more. Not only does it give every reference where a given Greek word occurs, but it gives the English word by which it is rendered in each place. It is quite as valuable to the Greek scholar as to the one who possesses but little knowledge of the language.
