THE truth is that the talk about "a godless and therefore necessarily immoral education" loses sight altogether of the end and aim of the public school system. It does not attempt to make Christian men and women. That is left for other agencies, among them the churches. It aims to make men intelligent and independent citizens, to give them such an education as will enable them to exercise their political rights for the general welfare, and as will enable them to keep out of jail and out of the poor-house. In this it has been successful, and has amply vindicated its right to be maintained at the public expense. Whether men behave themselves from right motives or from wrong is a point of vital importance from a religious point of view. From the secular point of view, which is that of the State, it is of no consequence whatever.
