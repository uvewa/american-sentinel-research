The Sunday law is simply indefensible. It is entirely without the province of the State. The mystic and the supernatural have no part in the affairs of government. To enact such a law would be to overstep the bounds of state-craft to endorse a shaky theological hypothesis. It would be as sensible to revive the laws to enforce the observance of Lent. The spirit that incites such legislation is a belated survival of mediaeval intolerance and superstition. The Sunday law is an anachronism. It has no place this side of the Renaissance.

Of course, though, there are examples of the State embracing the supernatural. A number of civilized nations have established churches and legalized and subsidized worship. But these are mouldy heritages of the Dark Ages, and owe their existence, not to their merits or appositiveness, but partly to the phantom of the past, which still lurks in the dark corners of many a mind, and mainly to that blind inertia, innate in human nature, that always favors whatever exists, and is the greatest obstacle to reform and progress. State religions are weakening with the advance of light, and their dissolution is simply a question of time.
