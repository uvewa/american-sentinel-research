## The Intolerableness of Unbelief.

APROPOS of our observation in No 13 of THE SENTINEL, concerning the intolerableness of infidels, is the following contribution to the *Truth Seeker* by one of its regular correspondents, William Allen Smith, of this city:—

The *Twentieth Century* takes Samuel F. Putnam to task for calling the Mexican Government the most liberal government on the face of the earth when it is in league with Catholic priests to save upon churches in that country. Mr. Putnam's

I judge from of the Mexican officials should read that they have shaken off the tyranny of the church, it is necessary at times, to satisfy the discontented with liberal concessions.

These things, let us imagine what it is that is has been the most liberal government on the face of the earth where has been confiscated. Convents are forbidden; the churches are not allowed to wear their official gowns on the streets. They must dress like other folks. They can not perform a legal marriage.

This is what the government has done and it has done much. If bad Government would do the same it would have performed an act of justice and right.

It every one to do. Its pleasure, it that it will not conform to practical conditions. For the reason that we send and political usages by us are made insanely dishonest and licentious as to the natural thought and national notice of those us not in officials with their assertion doctrine. The Church is always ready to make concessions. For this purpose the people have a good right to ask for its abolishment entirely as to public recognition....

The property is the appropriate tax money of the Republic for of clerical crimes, previous to help free themselves. Let it be returned to the people and put to some useful purpose. Mr. Putnam has forgot the strange facts to the minds to the civilization of those dealers in feminine and external fixes. They deserve more of by their flies, and they should be exterminated with a relentless hand, just the same as we do a burglar or road one. Those who the people of a country should tolerate, much less protect, any such treasonable conspiracy of the church. The human mind from its natural liberty of thought to religious proscription it a dangerous foe, one which has first pace the truth of their conviction, then seeks in establishing the result of their reasoning, and continued and cut its disgraceful work. We can find all the religious are today are engaged in a work of sapping of viable nature without preping anybody to replace it.

In our previous, article we remarked, that as a fact, Freethinkerism is in their minds more free themselves nor more liberal towards others than are other men; and certainly the foregoing quotations from the *Truth Seeker* (like the one made three weeks ago from Freethinkers beats us out in this opinion.

We are not sufficiently familiar with the real condition of affairs in Mexico to form a positive opinion upon the merits of the contest between the Mexican Government and the Catholic Church. That church has a very persecuting habit of meddling in politics, on a church, and we are not prepared to say that all the measures taken are not for this reason necessary in Mexico, as they seem to have been at times in other countries. If Mr. Smith represents the spirit and purpose and policy of this kind, "for purely political reasons, we would have no criticism to pass upon his words; but he does not." These things, indeed, he does not enter upon the discussion of that phase of the situation at all; but seeks to justify governmental opposition, not only to the Catholic Church, but to all churches, because, as he assumes, "they" teach error.

"Let them," says the gentleman, "first prove the truth of their contentions, then give them credit." But who is the doubter when they have proved "the truth of their contentions?" Evidently the government must be the judge, that is, it must an adjurer of all religious questions, and must exterminate with a relentless hand all religion that, according to the dictation, do not teach? About how much tolerance is there in this?

We have no word to say in defense of [page 126] Roman Catholicism, but we do maintain that it has the same right to exist as has Protestantism, or as has any other form or "Sect" of religion in the world. If the government is controlled to it in judging upon religious questions, why does the Presbyterian find fault with those departments that have done this in the past? It is only that which this Presbyterianism says governments should do now, namely, which is substantially to extend to that which they adjudged to be error. There are many Christian parents who do not wish to have their children mingled with infidelity; should the State, for this reason, and because infidelity is against Christianity, be modified by law as an armory against the dissemination of Freethinkerism and use it in the support of religion or of those schools? But this is exactly the principle that this Presbyterian paper, the columns of this Presbyterian paper, the *Truth Seeker.* And this it appears again, that the fourteenth is essentially the same, is only a figment of the brain of those who deify human nature, which is essentially the same everywhere.

A disposition of "Freethinkerism" by a system as intolerance as the Prussian was, under some persuasions and, therefore, mere supporters again.
