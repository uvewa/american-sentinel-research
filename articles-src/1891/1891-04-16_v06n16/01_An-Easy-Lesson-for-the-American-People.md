## An "Easy Lesson" for the American People.

IN reading the literature department of the *Independent*, of March 11, 1891, we found the following book notice, and in view of the teaching of this book which it outlines, we print it in full:—

*Easy Lessons in Christian Doctrine, for the Use of Band Schools (Protestant and Easter, Pittsburgh, Penn.)* With the approval of the Rt. Rev. R. Phelan, D. D., Bishop of Pittsburgh, at Marquette, the chaplain at Marquette, published this little manual of fifty pages, which has now been officially approved by the Rt. Rev. Bishop and has entertained of its usefulness. It is not a stickler, but a business, connected system of doctrine, which ought to be accepted by all simply because it is contained in the Scriptures. It follows a broad and truly catholic position, teaching nothing militating against the doctrines of any church that retains faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is simple in language, conservative in arrangement, clear, conclusive, positive as to the Christian religion, and neither goes beyond the Scripture. As the Pennsylvania school contains the fundamental doctrines of faith and morals, and as the authors never go beyond the Scripture. As the Pennsylvania school commission has declared, there can be no sectarian instruction of such a kind. This manual which Bishop Phelan sent to Bishop Phelan, of the diocese of Western Pennsylvania, who, after careful examination, sent it to Mr. J. A. Quay, Superintendent,...

*Query.* Why "Lessons in Christian Doctrine"—the only book of religious instruction that has ever come out or can come out acceptable to both Roman Catholics and Protestants? Because it contains only the doctrines of the Scriptures—the doctrines taught in the public school. In any Catholic public institution where Catholic men can accept all that the book contains, and the important matter is for Protestants to declare whether they can not also accept of the doctrines of the institution to which the book relates.

The Bishop here suggests an important point. The manual, while teaching the fundamental truths of Christianity, can not be met by a complaint by pastors of any church. Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, or Presbyterians will find in the man- [page 122] ual's truths a sequence of truths drawn, each from a Scripture passage, and agreeable to all.

which, if they please, they may build up the destructive disposal of their otiose creeds. The Rev. James Allison, D. D., of Pittsburg, a "pillar of orthodoxy" in the Presbyterian Church, and a defender of Calvinistic doctrine, connected with both the Western University and Seminary, and experienced in this difficult field of labor, writes to us as follows:—

"I am a Presbyterian minister and editor of the *United Presbyterian.* I have also been a member of the Board of Instruction and Discipline of the Pennsylvania Reform School (Morganza) for a long time.... The book cannot be objected to by any sect. The lessons seem to be admirably adapted to be used in reform schools in teaching the fundamental truths of Christianity."

In these days of Church unity and plans for re-uniting the separated fragments of the Christian universal, there is the earnest desire to remove the practical barriers existing between churches that hinder its extension. "The need of unity."

*Easy Lessons in Christian Doctrine,* "is evidence that there is, and that there may always be, a profession and acceptance of the fundamental truth of pure Christianity, separate and apart from all sectarianism, that will be readily endorsed by teachers and heads of families of all persuasions who have decided the Church catechist.... We bespeak for it a careful examination on the part of teachers, and consistent judgment on the part of the press."

As soon as we had read this notice, we sent for a copy of these "easy lessons." It will be noticed that this title is "Easy Lessons in Christian Doctrine," and that these lessons have been designed for the use of mixed schools. As it is the book in use in the Pennsylvania Reform School, the claim seems about to be made, and is strongly hinted at in the foregoing notice of the *Independent*, that it may also be used with propriety in the public schools. And, indeed, why not? Is not the Pennsylvania Reform School a public institution? Is it not supported by taxes of all the people? and if these lessons can be taught there, why not in other public institutions? Why not, therefore, in public schools?

But what right do the managers of this public institution teach Christian doctrine at public expense? And if these managers may do this then if they were succeeded by a Board of atheistic managers who might not that Board with equal right go to the other extreme and teach the children that there is no God,—that this Board of Managers have to do this.

The equity of the case, however, is not the point we want to press just now in THE SENTINEL. It is not that point that we now wish to notice, but rather the character of those "easy lessons" which are so highly recommended by the *Independent*, Bishop Phelan, and the editor of the *Presbyterian Board*.

The book itself is a little pamphlet of fifty-three pages, four by five and one-half inches in size, and is put together in two parts. Part 1, thirty-two pages, sets of sixty-seven lessons in Roman Catholic doctrine, concerning creation, the trinity, the fall, the redemption, the commandments, and on purgatory. Part II is a short history of the Christian religion reaching from creation to the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell upon the disciples of Christ.

Of course, we can not notice each lesson in detail. We have said that the lessons are Roman Catholic doctrine; and this is precisely what they are; and to show to our readers that this is so, is the object of this article. The phraseology throughout betrays a Roman Catholic writer, one who has been educated in Roman Catholic religious books. The phraseology nowhere had come from one who has been instructed from the King James Bible or the Bible in Protestant lines of thought. For instance the word "parlies" is used where the King James version, and Protestantism, always use "righteousness;" "Sem" where there was "Shem;" "Pasch" is here used instead of "Passover."

This will be observed also, as we note the doctrines that are inculcated. The very first lesson of Part I clearly and distinctly sets forth the Roman Catholic doctrine of mortal and venial sin, but here the thing is made "easy" by calling them "grievous offenses" and "small offenses."

> *Question.*—Are all sins equally great?
>
> *Answer.*—No; all sins are not equally great; some are grievous offenses against the law of God, and others are but slight offenses.

> *Ques.*—What are the effects of grievous offenses against the law of God?
>
> *Ans.*—Grievous offenses against the law of God kill the soul, by depriving it of the true spiritual life of grace, and make it liable to eternal punishment.
>
> *Ques.*—What are the effects of small offenses?
>
> *Ans.*—Small offenses against the law of God do not deprive the soul of the spiritual life of grace, but they hurt the soul by lessening its love for God.
>
> *Ques.*—Is it a great misfortune to fall into grievous offense?
>
> *Ans.*—It is the greatest of all misfortunes.

The next thing after this piece of papal doctrine is to find a purgatory for those souls who are hurt by "small" misfortunes of "small offences" against the law of God; and this is done in the following "easy lessons:"—

> *Ques.*—Did Christ's soul descend into the hell of the damned?
>
> *Ans.*—The hell into which Christ's soul descended was not the hell of the damned, but a place of rest called Limbo.
>
> *Ques.*—Who were in this place of rest?
>
> *Ans.*—The souls of the just who died before Christ.
>
> *Ques.*—And what did Christ descend into this place?
>
> *Ans.*—To announce to those spirits that were in prison that they were redeemed.
>
> *Ques.*—When did the souls of the just who died before Christ go to heaven?
>
> *Ans.*—When Christ ascended into heaven.
>
> *Ques.*—And can we know from the Scriptures that limbo is the place of rest?
>
> *Ans.*—In the words the apostles say...

This limbo is an "easy" word for the Latin, *limbus patrum*, and is essentially the Roman Catholic purgatory. This fact is evident from the doctrine stated above. *Query.* How can the *Independent* mistake this "easy lesson," and suggest the authors *New York Tribune,* or theology? It does not seem to us that it can mistakenly do both.

Lesson 11, part of part II, sets forth the Roman Catholic doctrine of Gen. 3:15. It reads as follows:—

> *Ques.*—What did Almighty God in his mercy and pity and love do for them?
>
> *Ans.*—He said the woman and her seed she shall crush thy head.

Now this "easy lesson" easily insinuates the Roman Catholic doctrine in the following way:—

> *Ques.*—How is a Redeemer promised in Gen. 3:15?
>
> *Ans.*—Almighty God, in mercy and love, cursed the serpent which had deceived Eve, contained: I will ever put greater hatred and between thy seed; he and society should exist between the serpent and the woman, but let the women would crush the head of the serpent.

Lesson five, of part II, easily insinuates the "easy lesson" of the Papal "infallibility" on religious matters:—

> *Ques.*—What were the principal religious rites and functions of the Moses' law?
>
> *Ans.*—The principal religious rites under the Moses' law consisted of various kinds of sacrifice, either bloody, in which were offered bodies; or unbloody, in which were offered bread, wine, oil and incense; there were offered rules, and odorous, and unbloomed bread.

It is not surprising that Bishop Phelan can say that Catholics can accept all that this book contains for it is essentially Catholic in every intent and purpose; and that the *Independent* and "a pillar of orthodoxy" the editor of the *Presbyterian Board*, should either of them have allowed its acceptance to general use only shows how far the so-called Protestant profession has become like the Roman Catholic. Yes, it is true; Catholics and Protestants are nothing, but it is the same way that the lion and the lamb unite. It is true they are all becoming one, but the Roman Catholic is the one. Roman Catholicism has not altered one jot her claims nor modified in one iota her doctrine; and the only way it is or can be for the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches ever to unite is by the Protestant churches becoming Roman Catholic. This is what they are [page 122] doing. Roman Catholic forms and ceremonies are adopted, absorbed, and introduced, by those on the board of their Presbyteries. Roman Catholic doctrines are held and introduced by churches calling themselves Protestant. And the statement of the *Independent* that this is "easy" teaching "nothing militating against the doctrines of any church that retains faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ, conservative in arrangement" is but a step toward the great general apostasy.

Yet, upon this THE AMERICAN SENTINEL would have no criticism to make, were that all that is. Any man has the right to be a Roman Catholic if he chooses, and that the Roman Catholic Church teaches her people every Protestant has the right to adopt quotations from Protestantism and become a Roman Catholic. Any person or body of persons, or otherwise, has the right to adopt Roman Catholic forms, institutions, or rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Roman Catholic churches have the right to adopt as many Roman Catholic doctrines and as many Roman Catholic ways as they choose, and teach them in their churches and in their homes and in their places. Therefore we say that if this were all there is of this question there were no question to make.

But this is not all. "Easy Lessons in Christian Doctrine" is a book that is designed for the use of mixed schools. As it is the book in use in the Pennsylvania Reform School, the claim seems about to be made, and is strongly hinted at in the foregoing notice of the *Independent*, that it may also be used with propriety in the public schools. And, indeed, why not? Is not the Pennsylvania Reform School a public institution? Is it not supported by taxes of all the people? and if these lessons can be taught there, why not in other public institutions? Why not, therefore, in public schools?

But what right do the managers of this public institution teach Christian doctrine at public expense? And if these managers may do this then if they were succeeded by a Board of atheistic managers who might not that Board with equal [page 123] right go to the other extreme and teach the children that there is no God,—that this Board of Managers have to do this.

The equity of the case, however, is not the point we want to press just now in THE SENTINEL. It is not that point that we now wish to notice, but rather the character of those "easy lessons" which are so highly recommended by the *Independent*, Bishop Phelan, and the editor of the *Presbyterian Board*.

The book itself is a little pamphlet of fifty-three pages, four by five and one-half inches in size, and is put together in two parts. Part 1, thirty-two pages, sets of sixty-seven lessons in Roman Catholic doctrine, concerning creation, the trinity, the fall, the redemption, the commandments, and on purgatory. Part II is a short history of the Christian religion reaching from creation to the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell upon the disciples of Christ.

Of course, we can not notice each lesson in detail. We have said that the lessons are Roman Catholic doctrine; and this is precisely what they are; and to show to our readers that this is so, is the object of this article. The phraseology throughout betrays a Roman Catholic writer, one who has been educated in Roman Catholic religious books.

The editors of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL are neither infidels nor Spiritualists; we are just as far from both infidelity and spiritualism as it is possible for Christians to be; and THE SENTINEL in the same. Nevertheless, any man has as much right to be an infidel, or a Spiritualist, or both together if he choose, as we have to be Christians or as the believers in themselves "easy lessons" have to be Roman Catholics. Infidels and Spiritualists have just as much right to hold their beliefs unmolested and free officials for the State to be in any positive position as have Christians or Catholics or Calvinized Protestants. The money which is raised by taxation is their money as much as ours; and Freethinkers and Spiritualists alike, the State has no more right to use it in disseminating, through its officials, the beliefs of those Christians, than it has to do the same thing with Infidel beliefs.

Yet all this is precisely what is done by the public officials in the State Reform School, at Morganza, in Pennsylvania; and this is precisely what is proposed by the *Independent* and other believers in these "easy lessons" shall be done in public institutions everywhere. And it is wicked. Let the State and her public officials keep their purely political, noses, and book-keeping forms out of the field of conscience, let them attend to the civil police, the business that belongs alike to all the people, without distinction, and leave entirely alone the religious belief or unbelief of the citizens.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL comes to our from New York every week, and is always every medium. Its arguments are not one-sided. It stands for religion, resting on no form, no State, no law, no test, no persecution alone. That is our position. All the religion that you like, that you can get to man, by fair argument. None that can not stand on that basis.—*Gen. Prcistess Pitclaren Record.*
