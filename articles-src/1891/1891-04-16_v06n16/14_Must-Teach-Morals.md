"PARENTS in the United States must teach religion at home if their children are educated in the public schools," says the *New York Christian Advocate*, and adds:—

A lady of wide experience, noted for caution and truthfulness, one of the superintendents in a large Methodist Sunday school, informs us that in her opinion home teaching, except a few words in a very few cases upon the Sunday-school lesson, is entirely omitted, even in the homes of church members.

We can readily believe this when we remember that only a short time since a Presbyterian pastor in Iowa said:—

Keep the Bible out of the schools and our children are deprived of moral instruction.

This is only putting in another form the statement made by the Methodist lady, referred to by the *Advocate*, for the minister's words are credible only on the supposition that moral training is almost utterly neglected even in so-called Christian homes. Hence on the very face of it the demand for religious instruction in the schools is a confession of parental neglect in the home circle.
