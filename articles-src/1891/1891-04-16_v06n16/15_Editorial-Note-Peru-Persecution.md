With a view to justifying the persecution in Lima, Peru, of a missionary who sold Bibles without first obtaining the consent of the priests, the *Catholic Review* quotes the *Peruvian Mail* as follows:—

Has Penzotti in the exercise of his profession, broken the laws of this country, or not? If he has, it is but just that he should suffer the penalty imposed by those laws. If he has not, he has a claim against his aggressors which every honest man in the country will help him to make good. This question of law is to be decided by the Supreme Court, and we await its decision. So much being admitted, it is manifest that any sympathy for Mr. Penzotti should be withheld until it is proved that he is innocent of the misdemeanor he is being tried for.

This is the argument that has ever been used in justification of persecution for conscience' sake, in all ages in every clime. It is strange that people do not stop and think that laws which make such things possible are all wrong and should be promptly repealed; in the meantime they should be allowed to slumber in innocuous desuetude, and this would be the case were it not for the wicked intolerance that still disgraces the Christian name.
