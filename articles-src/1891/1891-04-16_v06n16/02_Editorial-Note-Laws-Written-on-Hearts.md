ALFRED the Great incorporated the ten commandments and Golden Rule, in the early English Constitution, but they are yet far from being the laws of English industrial and social life. Laws written on tables of stone and printed in statute books, are but the playthings of politicians if they are not written on people's hearts. Laws can not make men unselfish. They can restrain; but all legal righteousness is but temporary. Police righteousness is not divine righteousness.

—Rev. George D. Herron.
