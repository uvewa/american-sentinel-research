These terms are frequently confounded, but there is the greatest difference between them. Rights begin where duties end. The exercise of rights is optional, while the performance of duties is imperative. This is true both in the realm of morals and in that of civics. Anything which is not optional with the individual is not a right, but a duty.

To say then that a person has the right to do a certain thing implies that he also has the right not to do it. If we say he has the moral right to perform the act, we mean that he can do it without bringing himself under the penalty of moral law; but if it is the civil right to which we refer, we mean that he ought not to be subjected to civil pains and penalties for it.

I have said that the exercise of rights is optional. Some may be inclined to dispute this. For example, they may ask, "Is not voting a civil right?" I reply that it is. "And is it not also a civil duty?"—By no means. If it were, then there should be a civil law compelling every one to vote. As all moral duties are covered by moral law, so all civil duties—not always are but—should be covered by civil law.

But a law compelling men to vote would defeat its own purpose. The object of the ballot is to get an expression of the will of the people, but this can never be secured by compulsory voting. To illustrate: Suppose a Republican should, for some reason, refuse to vote. That would please the Democratic party, consequently no one in that party would enforce the law compelling him to vote. If the law were enforced at all, it would have to be by his own party; but as surely as the Republicans compelled him to vote, when he did not want to vote, so surely would he, out of spite, vote the ticket of some other party, even though he might be opposed to the principles of that party. A man may be compelled to be civil toward others, but no one can be forced to be honest with himself. And you can never find out the will of the people by compelling them to vote against their will. The State can never determine whether a man is voting his own principles or not; but if he is neither tempted by bribes nor enraged by compulsion, he is under the most favorable conditions for the free and just exercise of his right.

Voting, therefore, is not a civil duty, and can not be so regarded in our legal system. But it is a right which every citizen may exercise if he wishes to do so.

It is not the duty of government to punish a man for exercising his rights, or for not exercising them. The chief function of government is to protect each citizen in the exercise of his rights. In doing this, it is not necessary for the government to define these rights. The citizen should be protected in doing anything he desires to do, provided it is not uncivil. That is the only limit which the government has the authority to set for him. The government has no more authority to trespass upon the rights of a citizen than the citizen has to trespass upon the rights of the government. The citizen was not made for the government, but the government for the citizen.

The three great dangers to which governments are subject are these: first, that the government will gradually extend the limits of its jurisdiction until it infringes upon the rights of citizens, or the prerogatives of God; second, that it will not even protect the citizens in the exercise of all the rights which it nominally recognizes; and third, that partiality will be used, so that the rich will have better protection than the poor, and the majority be allowed to swallow up the rights of the minority.

Although not so bad as many other countries, all of these errors are dangerously apparent in our own Government to-day; and for their removal there should be pledged the prompt and energetic cooperation of all patriotic citizens.
