## This Accounts for It.

IN a recent meeting in Trenton, Washington, to rejoice over the defeat of a bill practically repealing the Sunday law of that State, one of the speakers, a minister, said:—

The Church depends for its foundations upon the Sabbath. Eliminate the Sabbath and in a short time the question whether the Church would continue to exist.

"This accounts for the great interest taken in the so-called 'civil Sabbath.' It is not to be wondered at that this talk about a civil Sabbath should become so popular in the churches. The Church depends, it is reported, upon the Sabbath and in a short time these lessons have been designed for the use of mixed schools. As it is the book in use in the Pennsylvania Reform School, the claim seems about to be made, and is strongly hinted at in the foregoing notice of the *Independent*, that it may also be used with propriety in the public schools. And, indeed, why not? Is not the Pennsylvania Reform School a public institution?" In this is true of the popular notion Churches, it simply shows at the belief that unlike the early Church, the Church of to-day existed in the greatest poetry and power, not only without a State-enforced Sabbath, but in spite of the most bitter and unrelenting opposition on the part of the secular power. Truly the modern Church is in a sorry state if this is dependent upon the whim of the law makers and the police.

In spite of all metaphysical theorizing, it remains true that the common sense of mankind recognizes no basis of practical ethics except belief in God and in man's obligation to obey him.—*Bostonian.*
