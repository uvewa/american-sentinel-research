## Religious Teaching in Secular Schools.

THAT children should be taught religion, which, while it retains the essential doctrines of Christianity, is a proposition advocated as strenuously by all classes of Protestants as it can be by the Romanists.

The real question is, *How* can this best be done? The public school is not diverted from this main point. *Some* claim that this religious education should be not only co-ordinate with the secular, but interwoven with it in the institutions of education, and should form a part of the school exercises, and must be under the supervision and control of her parents. In other words, that the State must provide for religious teaching as well as secular education. She must do what she never has done—recognize denominational distinctions in her public policy.

Certainly, since so radical a change is demanded, very substantial and convincing reasons should be presented in its favor, the persons, in teaching the religion or educating reasons or prejudices. It should be shown most clearly that such a method of combining the secular religion in the same school, is the complete way of imparting religious truth. And to be modest of this, we require more than philosophical argument. Facts and experience should support argument. Facts are demanded.

We should learn truth, whatever such fact may be, and what have been the results. I propose to show that this experiment has been made under circumstances more favorable to success than any we can inaugurate in this country, and that the result is such as by no means to encourage. The idea which Rome has been working hardest to put, Pennsylvania on a Protestant basis. And the statements I make are based upon a paper read before the Western College Association at Grinnell, Iowa, December 7, 1887, by Prof. Hugh M. Scott, of the Chicago Theological Seminary. It is a paper which well deserves the attention its importance merits.

Let us present the principle. The model educational, the, as is every German school system, is that the nation in Christian its founders, history, and aims, and therefore the plan of instruction to be complete which does not include the thoroughgoing teaching of Christian doctrine and morals. Von Moltke, the ablest of Prussian military directors, said:—

> A school, to educate the German nation in true culture and religion, between each of Church—a union of man in Christi—a Church of State would—be incompatible.

This was proposed in 1848, but dropped because of opposition throughout the country. The Constitution thus says: "Wherever that religious instruction shall not be given from the schools, but in the schools; and that the churches and religious societies shall have a leading influence in giving such instruction. It intends to furnish the confessional (denominational) instructions required as far as possible in the [page 124] schools. We regard religious instruction as an integral part of the entire total of school instruction. . . . The training of teachers is not to be separated from connection with the Church and the Romanists culture.

A *Government circular* announces:—

It is the aim of the religious instruction in schools, in connection with the co-operating influence of the teaching, to help lead the youth to a living knowledge of the truths of Holy Scripture, to bring faith in God, and to evangelical piety.

This is their theory of public schools, and it in defines accordingly the position of the Roman Catholic Church in our country.

Let me now sketch the plan by which this principle is carried into operation. Prussian educational institutions are divided into three classes—the common school, the high school, and the university. In the first, elementary religious instruction is given by the ordinary teacher, preparatory to and in harmony with the more advanced curriculum of the high school. The underlying idea is this: As the Prussian system of teaching religion finds its most important field, and so those we shall restrict ourselves. Omitting much that would be very interesting as to the general methods of these schools, of which there are four grades, space requires that we restrict ourselves to the plan of religious instruction. Religion is regarded as one of the regular studies of the course, and occupies the place of honor at the top of the list. All teachers must pass an examination in religious knowledge. Teachers in the highest classes must stand an examination in the contents of the Bible, the fundamental doctrines of faith and morals, Church history, New Testament Greek, and Hebrew. But these qualifications are not accepted for more than formally, so that in many cases the head of the community must undertake the religious instruction by singing.

In the lowest class, Bible narratives from the Old Testament; to the minor to the kings are taught from a book of Bible stories. The first part of the catechism, viz. Luther's explanation, is learned by heart, the second and third parts being committed to memory without the explanation. A certain selection of texts and hymns is given to be memorized.

In the next class the New Testament narratives are to be learned in the same way; and the general division and order of the books of Scripture, catechism, and hymns are reviewed.

In the next higher class, prominent portions of the Old and New Testaments are read and studied in their connection, also the geography of Palestine. Catechism is reviewed, and the third part learned with Luther's explanations, and practiced. The fourth and fifth part are committed to memory. Hymns are reviewed and new ones learned. As occasion offers, the meaning of Church usages is to be taught.

In the yet higher class a new advanced [page 125] course in biblical instruction is entered upon. In addition to a review of hymns and texts already appoint, apostolic and Church history is begun. In the next class higher class studies are continued, and the history of dogma is entered upon.

The highest class take up even a critical study of the Gospel of John, and the Epistle to the Romans, and especially of Job, Proverbs, and parts of the Corinthians. The fundamental doctrines of faith and morals, in their connection with their basis, are outline of creeds.

The teaching of all these classes is accompanied by proper devotional exercises, at least in form. Times of stated reading of Scriptures, and prayer. This is held every morning with the whole school. Each hour's work in the forenoon is to begin with prayer. The school closes on Saturday at noon, usually with devotional exercises, including a short address by the principal. Teachers are directed to induce their pupils to attend worship at their respective churches, and at proper times to turn their thoughts toward the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. A similar course is followed in the Roman Catholic religion teaching, with such modifications as their doctrines require.

We have now an outline of the religious instruction in the Prussian school system. While this State maintains the completeness of religion, as well as secular, education more closely. It must be admitted that this scheme is wholly effective. One more comprehensiveness and thoroughly can not easily be devised. It leaves no part every requirement of a complete religious education. It includes all the facts of Christianity demanded. The structure of the Church, and as it is designed to be fully complete with, it would fit the Bible school almost to suited the seminary. And now we may well inquire:—

What has been its results? This system has been in operation nearly one hundred years, and during all this period Protestantism has declined, so that the skepticism and rationalism of Germany have become proverbial. In 1886, students of theology left the gymnasiums so ignorant of the Scriptures that they could be his text of shame by children. Teachers even in schools where reputation was on a part of the department of the State. By its whims, religion, as Christian doctrine, Christian history, and the development of the secular, and natural science are exalted, the Christian belief constantly pushed down, down, and ridiculed in the eyes of the pupils. "In most of our high schools the religious instruction is given so badly that it is in danger of the claims of cause for our common natural nature, and the infinity and religious indifference amongst our educated classes."

This system, so admirably arranged, has failed to keep Prussian Christianity except in form. It produced a formalism which made every one a number of the church, but in the opinion of this holy [page 125] Roman Catholicism, but we do maintain that it has the same right to exist as has Protestantism, or as has any other form or "Sect" of religion in the world. If the government to control of its in judging upon religious questions, why does the Presbyterian find fault with those departments that have done this in the past? It is only that which this Presbyterianism says governments should do now, namely, which is substantially the same which they adjudged to be error. There are many Christian parents who do not wish to have their children mingled with infidelity; should the State, for this reason, and because infidelity is against Christianity, be modified by law as an armory against the wholesome the people's agencies? America the dissemination of Freethinkerism and use it in the support of religion or of those schools? But this is exactly the principle that this Presbyterian paper, the columns of this Presbyterian paper, the *Truth Seeker.* And this it appears again, that the fourteenth is essentially the same. This is only a figment of the brain of those who deify human nature, which is essentially the same everywhere.

A disposition of "Freethinkerism" by a system so intolerance as the Prussian was, under some rare persuasions and, therefore, mere supporters again.
