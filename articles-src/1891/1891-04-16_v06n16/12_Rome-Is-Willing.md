"The statement," says the *Catholic Review*, "that the Bible is read in 13,000 out of 21,000 Pennsylvania schools is not strong enough to warrant the assertion that the State schools of the country are Christian. The Bible could be read every day in an agnostic school, or in a school conducted by Mr. Renan, and not make the school Christian; and the fact must be well known to Pennsylvanians, as it is to others, that in many of the schools where a trustee ordinance commands the use of the Scriptures the teachers are not believers in the divinity of these writings, and had as lief read a chapter of the Koran or Carlyle."

To the expression of opinion by the *Christian Statesman*, that Catholic Americans want nothing Christian except what bears the impress of the Pope, the *Catholic Review* responds:—

This is true, but it should not disturb a Protestant. It ought rather to ease his mind, since the very doctrines held by Protestants and Catholics in common all bear the Papal sanction. The dogmas of the Catholic have all been formulated by Rome, and these dogmas are maintained in part by Protestants. The inspiration of the Scriptures, the divinity of Christ, the need of grace, the life to come, and many other tenets of Protestant belief were all made dogmas before Luther's time. For the support of these principles of human action Catholics and Protestants can work in perfect harmony. It is no reflection upon Catholic sincerity that the church considers all other teachings beyond its own dogmas, past or to come, as heretical. The *Statesman* can see at a glance just where Catholics stand by a knowledge of their beliefs, which they do not hide, but delight to profess before men.

And the *Statesman* has more than once expressed a willingness to join hands with Rome upon those things that they hold in common. Rome is willing.
