## Editorial Notes.

NEW YORK, APRIL, 1891.

SINCE receiving THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, several friends in various places, have written recommending that the paper should not be distributed when it advocates the non-observance of Sunday, or advises any one to do more or less than is necessary—be it in necessity may even be done on Sabbath.

WE learn from a Spokane, Washington paper, that Rev. Ben S. Snail is now in reform. He is expected in Spokane, early in May, and the ministers are planning a boom for the Sunday Sabbath. Mr. Snail's visit is, we suppose, sufficient to supply the lack of divine authority for the observance of the day, and also to bolster up in the State of the Sabbath law a somewhat shaky sentiment in favor of "civil" Sunday laws.

ALONZO J. BARREN, a correspondent of the *Sunday Bulletin* (Bloomington, Ill.) is letting a little light fall upon the "Sabbath Question." We republish the article this week the second of his articles upon this subject. It will perhaps surprise some that the writer is an observed seventh day, but to the best of our knowledge such is not the case. He is simply one of the many who recognize the fact that Sunday is not the Sabbath by divine appointment.

For the time of the sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness, the Christian Association of this city, says:—

Manna fell six days out of seven, but not on the seventh day, (Saturday); and the manna that gathered on Saturday, would keep over the Sabbath.

Quail by this let Johnson observe that know that in the wilderness the manna gathered on Saturday? that that day was the Sabbath, and that the manna gathered on Friday was kept over and used upon Saturday. A little more care in discussing the Sabbath question would be recommended.

The epistle to one of this recent contest by name, Joseph Cook, gave, among others "equally good," the following "arguments" against opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday:—

Our army and navy have always rested upon the Sabbath, and the Constitution of the United States allows the President ten days to defer his assent; management of Congress, exclusive of Sunday. It does seem to me that in this last mentioned fact certainly the workingmen should be granted this position as they do in using that clause in the Constitution concerning Sunday. So far as the Constitution allows the President to be rest upon Sunday is concerned, it would be the same if that exception were not in it. The President would not be obliged to work on Sunday, even if the Constitution gave him simply ten days in which to sign a bill, without excepting Sunday. But Mr. Cook's plea that the workingman should likewise be allowed to rest on Sunday, seems to be based upon the idea that it requires ten full days of hard manual labor on the part of the President to sign every bill that comes before him, and that if the Sunday were not excepted from the ten days allowed, the President would be obliged to sign on Sunday in order to get a bill signed. The absurdity of such an idea is simply the absurdity of the entire Sunday argument.

ALL good citizens will rejoice that the bill of the State Legislature providing to make the employment of police matrons mandatory, in cities containing over 10,000 inhabitants. The police authorities have steadily opposed this reform, as they do nearly everything to ameliorate the condition of persons under arrest. The chief injustice, that which is as yet uncorrected until proven guilty, has no weight with the average policeman, with arrested and defaulting officers the persecution is all the other way, especially if the prisoner happens to be a woman. The employment of matrons ought to correct every flagrant abuse alleged in this and other cities in this State.

In an article which has just appeared in the Christian *Statesman* (a little out of season, is it true?) Mrs. Josephine C. Bateham, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, says:—

We are wanting the national Sunday rest bill this winter. The matter is all so short and crowded, there was time to hold preliminary public meetings and let the real test for the District take notice of it before it reached us. *Here after performances only for next winter, that we may be strongly reinforced for our engagement.* For this reason the constituency tell petitions, give special attention to the interest classes, and signify that the citizens who the cities will tell petitions it will be when Congress is convened the laboring men vote for it.

And it is idle to say that no measure will be left unused to convince the public that the laboring men do want it. The friends of liberty should not be idle.

A GREAT number of American law authorities in "Worshiping the Golden Swine-faith." The central figure represents Schwarzhoff, the false divine of Illinois, sitting upon a throne of money bags; around his head is a halo of dollar marks; while a number of worshipers are making liberal additions to the golden throne. At the upper right-hand corner [page 128] of the picture, surrounded by clouds, is seen a strong band labeled, "Law," and bended toward the occupant of the throne, and underneath the whole are the words: "It is about time that the heavens open and put a stop to this blasphemy."

The thought of the artist evidently was that the heavens are about to open to in the form of evil law to put a stop to this infamous claims of that arrest humbug, Schwarzhoff, or, possibly, that as the heavens have thus far failed in what the artist supposes to be their evident duty, the Legislature should do the work by enacting a law to forbid this form of blasphemy.

What a grand thing it is, to be sure, to have people so benevolently desirous of the duty of the heavens, and to supply any lacking on their part in the way of maintaining the honor of Him who, before the advent of the "Reform," ruled the heavens well.

### Hudson's Critical Greek and English Concordance

A Substantial work, prepared by Charles F. Hudson. Revised and completed by Ezra Abbot, D. D., LL.D., of Harvard University, Theological School, Boston, Massachusetts. It in its a great improvement over the version of the English Concordance, indexed in connection with Cruden's, which has been published, we are glad to be able to mention one. The book itself is an invaluable aid to the Bible student, in that it gives the Greek text that which Cruden's Concordance does for the English text only. Not only does it give every reference where a given Greek word occurs, but it gives the English word by which it is resolved in each place. It is of value to the Greekless Bible scholar as to the one who possesses a knowledge of that language.
