## Simply Indefensible.

THE Sunday law is simply indefensible. It is entirely without the province of the State. The mystic and the supernatural have no part in the affairs of legislation. To enact such a law would be to overstep the bounds of state-craft and tread on sheer theological hypothesis. It would be as sensible to revise the laws to enforce the observances of Lent. The spirit that such legislation is a believed survival of medieval intolerance and superstition. The Sunday law is an anachronism. It has no place this side of the Renaissance.

Of course, though, there are examples of the State embracing the supernatural. A number of civilized nations have established churches and legalized and subsidized worship. But these are mostly in the [page 126] nature—wherein neither the animal nor the fanatic in him should have any particular advantages, either over the other. To a certainty there was a matter singularly concurrent with the prohibition of labor, which of itself is of institutions of value to man. But commemoration and worship were evidently the purpose of the institution.

There is nothing after the order of the Old Testament Sabbath in all history. It stands out in the broadest framework of the world as a glorious heavenly border to enlighten the nations of the earth. The Jews will first that day. They are promised the Sabbath faithful to the command of God. No one questions the Jew's authority to observe the seventh day—the only Bible Sabbath.

Christianity has no Bible Sabbath. It has no Sabbath at all by authority of the Old or New Testament. It has a "Sunday." But in so far as it is not after all a Sabbath. It was adopted by our class ancestors and a half-pagan compromise. It was made the first day of the week instead of the seventh day. The earliest Christians had no observed both days. The unusual that can be claimed for it by way of authority, is the absence of any command of God or of Jesus either way.

The first day of the week, or Lord's day, as it is severally called, was without any legal recognition until the fourth century. Then nobody connected it with the State, and the State has been its worst enemy ever since and will continue to be such so long as the all of the State is thought to support or enforce religious institutions. It was, originally, a day of feasting and rejoicing. It grew into an occasion because Christ chanced to be raised from the dead on the first day of the week instead of the seventh day. It was "cleaned" to the natural, because there is no direction demanding the day on which Jesus was to be manifested by his enemies. The third day after death he was to rise from the grave. Had he been raised on the third day from a Monday it would have been raised on a Saturday or seventh day.

The New Commandment does not command a fixed Sunday for a rest day—a worshipful day. Some irresponsible teachers claim that it is the Bible Sabbath, is it true? Jesus, then, who was not an entire, actively read as others, claim that Jesus repeated, or eliminated, the fourth commandment from the Decalogue. He did nothing of the kind. (See Matt. 5:17-18.) There never yet any repealing of moral commandments. The first recommended its the appropriation copies, Sabbath, Lord's day, is based A. D. 400. (See *American Encyclopaedia.*)

If it is to be a religious day, then the State can have nothing to do with establishing or enforcing religious institutions. On the subject of religion the State must be silent, not between citizens of different [page 126] religious beliefs and customs the State must remain neutral. The attempt to force majority notices of religion on the conscience of the minority, is abominable. The American Sabbath Union would do well to modify its purpose.—*Law Register, at Bloomington, Ill.; Josedly, Bodine.*
