## Rome is Willing.

"THE *statesman*," says the *Catholic Review*, "that the Bible is read in 11,000 out of 11,000 Pennsylvania schools is not strong enough to warrant the assertion that the State schools of the country are Christian. The Bible could be read every day in an agnostic school, or in a school conducted by Mr. Besant, and not make the school Christian; and the fact must be well known to Pennsylvanians, so it is to others, that in many of the schools where a trustee ordinance commanded the use of the Scriptures the teachers are not believers in the divinity of these writings, and had no real or read a chapter of the Koran.

Quoting the expression of opinion by the *Christian Statesman*, that Catholic Americans want nothing Christian except what bears the imprimis of the Pope, the *Catholic Review* responds:—

This is true, but it should not disturb a Protestant. It might rather learn him, indeed, since the very words of the Apostles Creed of the Thirty-nine Articles and all that bear the Papal signature. The dogmas of the Catholic faith are of Symbolism by Rome, and those dogmas are manifested in partly to Protestants. The assertions of the Scriptures, the divinity of Christ, the efficacy of the Sacraments, the practice of these principles of human action Catholics and Protestantism would be a perfect harmony, and as a reflection upon Catholic sincerity that the church puts in two or three, to several. The *Statesman* can make an objection, put where Catholics stand, if it has knowledge of their beliefs, which they do not hide, but subject peoples everywhere make known.

And the *Statesman* has more than once expressed a willingness to join hands with Rome upon those things that they hold in common. Rome is willing.
