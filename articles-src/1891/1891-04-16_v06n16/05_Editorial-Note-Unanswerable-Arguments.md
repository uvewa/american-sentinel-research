THE AMERICAN SENTINEL comes to us from New York every week, and is always most welcome. Its arguments are unanswerable. It stands for religion resting on no force, no State, no law, but pure persuasion alone. That is our position. All the religion that you like, that you can win men to, by fair argument. None that can not stand on that basis.
