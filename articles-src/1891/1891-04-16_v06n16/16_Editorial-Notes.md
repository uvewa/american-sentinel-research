We learn from a Spokane, Wash., paper that Rev. Sam Small is now in the Northwest. He is expected in Spokane early in May, and the ministers are planning a boom for the Sunday Sabbath. Mr. Small's wit is, we suppose, expected to supply the lack of divine authority for the observance of the day, and also to bolster up in the State of Washington the somewhat shaky sentiment in favor of "civil" Sunday laws.

"LUX BENIGNA," a correspondent of the *Sunday Bulletin* (Bloomington, Ill.) is letting a little kindly light in upon the "Sabbath Question." We republish this week the second of his articles upon this subject. It might be surmised that the writer is an observer of the seventh day, but to the best of our knowledge such is not the case. He is simply one of the many who recognize the fact that Sunday is not the Sabbath by divine appointment.

OF the time of the sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness, the *Christian Advocate*, of this city, says:—

Manna fell six days out of seven, but not on the seventh, through a long period. That manna, when gathered on Saturday, would keep over the Sabbath.

Can it be that the *Advocate* does not know that in the wilderness no manna was gathered on Saturday? that that day was the Sabbath, and that the manna gathered on Friday was kept over and used upon Saturday? A little more candor in discussing the Sabbath question would be commendable.

IN the prelude to one of his recent lectures, Joseph Cook gave, among others "equally good," the following "argument" against opening the Columbian Exposition on Sunday:—

Our army and navy have always rested upon the Sabbath, and the Constitution of the United States allows the President ten days to affix his name to enactments of Congress, exclusive of Sunday. If the President, then, be allowed to rest on Sunday, certainly the workingman should be granted this privilege.

Nothing could more clearly show the desperate straits to which men are driven to find an excuse for Sunday laws. It seems as though sensible people would soon get tired of exposing their illogical position as they do in using that clause in the Constitution concerning Sunday. So far as the Constitution allowing the President to rest upon Sunday is concerned, it would be the same if that exception were not in it. The President would not be obliged to work on Sunday, even if the Constitution gave him simply ten days in which to sign a bill, without excepting Sunday. But Mr. Cook's plea that the workingman should likewise be allowed to rest on Sunday, seems to be based upon the idea that it requires ten full days of hard manual labor on the part of the President to sign every bill that comes before him, and that if the Sunday were not excepted from the ten days allowed, the President would be obliged to work on Sunday in order to get a bill signed. The absurdity of such an idea is simply the absurdity of the entire Sunday argument.

ALL good citizens will rejoice that the law of this State has been so amended as to make the employment of police matrons mandatory, in cities containing over 25,000 inhabitants. The police authorities have steadily opposed this reform, as they do nearly everything to ameliorate the condition of persons under arrest. The old legal maxim, that a man is to be pressured innocent until proven guilty, has no weight with the average policeman; with arresting and detaining officers the presumption is all the other way, especially if the prisoner happens to be a woman. The employment of matrons ought to correct some very flagrant abuses in this and other cities in this State.

IN an article which has just appeared in the *Christian Statesman* (a little out of season, it is true) Mrs. Josephine C. Batelham, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, says:—

We are not pushing the national Sunday rest bill this winter. The session will be short and crowded, and it seems best to hold petitions till next winter, and let the rest bill for the District take precedence if either can be reached. Have your petitions ready for next winter, that we may be strongly reinforced for congressional work. For both this and the District bill petitions, give especial attention to the laboring classes, and signify this on the petition. When either bill passes it will be when Congress is convinced the laboring men want it.

And it is safe to say that no means will be left unused to convince Congress that the laboring men do want it. The friends of liberty should be on the alert.

A RECENT number of *America* has a cartoon entitled, "Worshiping the Golden Swine-furth." The central figure represents Schweinfurth, the false Christ of Illinois, sitting upon a throne of money bage; around his head is a halo of dollar marks, while a number of worshipers are making liberal additions to the golden throne. At the upper right-hand corner of the picture, surrounded by clouds, is seen a strong hand labeled, "Law," extended toward the occupant of the throne, and underneath the whole are the words: "It is about time that the heavens open and put a stop to this blasphemy."

The thought of the artist evidently was that the heavens are about to open in the form of civil law to put a stop to the blasphemous claims of that arrant humbug, Schweinfurth; or, possibly, that as the heavens have thus far failed in what the artist supposes to be their evident duty, the Legislature should do the work by enacting a law to forbid this form of blasphemy.

What a grand thing it is, to be sure, to have people who feel competent to declare the duty of the heavens, and to supply any lack on their part in the way of maintaining the honor of Him who, before the advent of National Reform, ruled the heavens.
