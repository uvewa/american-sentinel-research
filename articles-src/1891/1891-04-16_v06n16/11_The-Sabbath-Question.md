### For the Bulletin:

In our paper in last Sunday's *Bulletin*, the general purposes of the American Sabbath Union were set forth. In this paper the Sabbath day and its purposes, or purpose, will be set forth. It is generally understood that the word, "Sabbath" means rest. Such meaning carefully examined, is of doubtful reliability. Its clearer meaning is that time, day, era, wherein one act, or series of actions, ends and another begins. It is a word which at its root means time-marking. It means the end of six days and the beginning of the seventh day. The cause or causes given or the signs or statutes authorized, such as cessation of labor, are in no way directly related to the meaning of the word.

Whatever be the particular meaning of the word, there can be no question, if the accustomed claim of inspiration of the Old Testament Scriptures is granted, that God appointed the day—gave it its name and number. It was evidently given to commemorate the great success of creation and completion of man and this earth—a day to mark that era. The prohibition of labor on that day was not an end but a means to an end. The purpose was, without doubt, twofold; that of remembering the Creator, and through that remembrance, on a day set apart especially for it, the divine in man was to be developed. Rest was to afford man an opportunity to possess himself of an evenly balanced nature—one wherein neither the animal nor the fanatic in him should have any particular advantage, either over the other. To a certainty there was a sanitary significance connected with the prohibition of labor, which of itself is of inestimable value to man. But commemoration and worship were evidently the purpose of the seventh day.

There is nothing after the order of the Old Testament Sabbath in all history. It stands out in the moral firmament of the world as a glorious heavenly bonfire to enlighten the nations of the earth. The Jews still keep that day. They are praiseworthy faithful to the command of God. No one questions the Jew's authority to observe the seventh day—the only Bible Sabbath.

Christianity has no Bible Sabbath. It has no Sabbath at all by authority of the Old or New Testament. It has a "Sunday." It is the old dies Solis of Rome. It was adopted by our Saxon ancestors and called "Sunnentag." It comes on the first day of the week instead of the seventh day. The earliest Christian held it in connection with the seventh day. They observed both days. The utmost that can be claimed for it by way of authority, in the absence of any command of God or of Christ, is custom.

The first day of the week, or Lord's day, as it is severally called, was without any legal recognition until the fourth century, A. D. Constantine connected it with the State, and the State has been its worst enemy ever since and will continue to be such as long as the aid of the State is sought to appoint or enforce religious institutions. It was, originally, a day of feasting and rejoicing. It grew into use because Christ chanced to be raised from the dead on the first day of the week instead of the seventh day. I say "chanced" to be raised, because there is no scripture specifying the day on which Jesus was to be murdered by his enemies. The third day after death he was to rise from the grave. Had he been crucified on Thursday he would have been raised on Saturday or seventh day.

Christendom, by common consent, has set apart Sunday for a rest day—a worshipful day. Some irresponsible teachers claim that it is the Bible Sabbath, but it is not. Some also, who are not as extensively read as others, claim that Jesus repealed, or eliminated, the fourth commandment from the Decalogue. He did nothing of the kind. (See Matt. 5:17-18.) There was never any repealing of sacred enactments. The first monumental inscription calling the Sabbath, Lord's day, is dated A. D. 403. (See American Encyclopedia.)

If it is to be a religious day, then the State can have nothing to do with establishing or enforcing religious institutions. On the subject of religion the State must be silent; and between citizens of different religious beliefs and customs the State must remain neutral. The attempt to force majority notions of religion on the conscience of the minority, is abominable. The American Sabbath Union would do well to modify its purpose.
