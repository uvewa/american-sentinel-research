In a recent meeting in Tacoma, Wash., to rejoice over the defeat of a bill practically repealing the Sunday law of that State, one of the speakers, a minister, said:—

The Church depends for its foundation upon the Sabbath. Eliminate the Sabbath and there is a question whether the Church would continue to exist.

This accounts for the great interest which the ministers everywhere take in the so-called "civil Sabbath." It is not true, however, that the Church is dependent upon the Sabbath in any such sense as that indicated by the gentleman whose words we have quoted; and to assert it is simply to say that the Church is dependent for its continued existence upon State support, for it is said that "without Sunday laws the Sabbath can not be maintained." If this be true of the popular modern Church, it simply shows that it is unlike the early Church, for that existed in its greatest purity and power, not only without a State-enforced Sabbath, but in spite of the most bitter and unrelenting opposition on the part of the secular power. Truly the modern Church is in a sorry state if it is thus dependent upon the whim of the law makers and the energy of the police.
