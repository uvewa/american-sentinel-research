APROPOS of our observation in No 13 of THE SENTINEL, concerning the intolerance of infidels, is the following contribution to the *Truth Seeker* by one of its regular correspondents, William Allen Smith, of this city:

The *Twentieth Century* takes Samuel P. Putnam to task for calling the Mexican Government the most liberal government on the face of the earth to-day, in the face of certain restrictions placed upon clericals in that country. Mr. Pentecost says:

I judge from this that if the Mexican officials should drive the church people out of the country, or make it a capital offense to be a Christian, the Mexican Government might be considered still more liberal.

As the Mexican Government has done neither of these things, let us inquire what it is that it has done which would invalidate its title to be "the most liberal government on the face of the earth."

It is reported that a vast amount of church property has been confiscated. Converts are forbidden. The clericals are not allowed to wear their official garb on the streets. They must dress like other folks. They can not perform a legal marriage.

This is what the government has done, and it has done well. If our Government would do the same it would perform but acts of justice and right.

The trouble with Mr. Pentecost's idea of liberty, to let every one do as he pleases, is that it will not conform to present conditions, for the reason that by social and political usages we are made interdependent, and a superstitious Church and its blinded followers are a menace to the natural thought and rational action of those who do not affiliate with them nor wish to have their children imbued with their senseless doctrines. The Church is always seeking converts, is always aggressive. Have not the people as good right to ask for its abolishment as a common nuisance as its adherents have for its continuance?

Its property is the aggregate outcome of the trembling fear of deluded victims powerless to help themselves. Let it be returned to the people and put to some useful purpose. Mr. Pentecost forgets that the average man is no match for the arguments of these dealers in brimstone and eternal fire. They deceive men, they rob them, and they should be exterminated with a relentless hand, just the same as we do a burglar from our homes. The strong must protect the weak. . . . No government or country should tolerate, much less protect, any institution which aims at the subversion of the human mind from its natural liberty of thought to one of base subjection to superstitious beliefs. Let them first prove the truth of their contentions, then give them license. Otherwise let the institution subside and end its disgraceful reign. We can find all the religion necessary at our hand within the realm of visible nature without groping aimlessly on its outside.

In our previous article we remarked, that as a class, Freethinkers are neither more free themselves nor more liberal toward others than are other men; and certainly the foregoing quotation from the *Truth Seeker* (like the one made three weeks ago from *Freethought*) bears us out in this opinion.

We are not sufficiently familiar with the real condition of affairs in Mexico to form a positive opinion upon the merits of the contest between the Mexican Government and the Catholic Church. That church has a very pernicious habit of meddling in politics, as a church, and we are not prepared to say that restrictive measures are not for this reason necessary in Mexico, as they seem to have been at times in other countries. If Mr. Smith had stopped with an attempt to justify a policy of this kind, for purely political reasons, we would have no criticism to pass upon his words; but he does not stop there; indeed, he does not enter upon the discussion of that phase of the question at all; but seeks to justify governmental opposition, not only to the Catholic Church, but to all churches, because, as he assumes, they teach error.

"Let them," says the gentleman, "first prove the truth of their contentions, then give them license." But who is to decide when they have proved "the truth of their contentions"? Evidently the government must be the judge, that is, it must sit as judge of all religious questions, and must exterminate with a relentless hand all religions that, according to its decision, do not teach truth! About how much tolerance is there in this?

We have no word to say in defense of Roman Catholicism, but we do maintain that it has the same right to exist as has Freethought, or as has any other form of belief or of disbelief. If it be the province of government to sit in judgment upon religious questions, why does the Freethinker find fault with those governments that have done this in the past? They did only that which this Freethinker says governments should do now, namely, they sought to exterminate that which they adjudged to be error. There are many Christian parents who do not wish to have their children imbued with infidelity; should the State, for this reason, and because infidelity is aggressive, abolish unbelief by law as a common nuisance? Should the State seize property devoted to the dissemination of Freethought and use it in the support of orphans or to endow schools? But this is exactly the principle that this Freethinker advocates in the columns of this Freethought paper, the *Truth Seeker*. And thus it appears again, that the boasted liberality of Freethought is only a figment of the brain of those who deify human nature, which is essentially intolerant.

A despotism of "Freethought" would be quite as intolerable as a despotism under some less pretentious and, therefore, more appropriate name.
