The point which those interested in a rigid Sunday closing during the World's Fair, and in the enactment and enforcement of strict Sunday laws, State and national, are just now emphasizing with great vehemence, is the so-called "Sunday slavery," of this country which has heretofore been unwittingly called "The land of the free." As one listens to a portrayal of the sufferings endured by these modern slaves, he imagines himself back in the fifties, and needs but to close his eyes to imagine he hears the clanking of the fetters and the crack of the slave-trader's lash, as the midnight chain-gang moves sadly by.

At a Union meeting recently held on the north side of the city of Chicago for a general discussion of the Sunday-closing question, one of the speakers indulged in a passionate portrayal of our present "American slavery," and urged that the slaves be emancipated by the enactment and enforcement of what he was pleased to term a "civil Sunday law," promising in case of such an emancipation, that the Church would undertake to give them the moral and spiritual Sabbath education which they so much needed.

The next speaker introduced was a prominent minister of the city who stated in the preface to his remarks that he was present to corroborate what the speaker had just said regarding Sunday slavery; but he had not expected that this slavery would come so close home as it had. "Only to-day," [Sunday] said the speaker, "my son came home late to dinner from the establishment where he is employed, having worked during the forenoon." And he further declared he had received a call the same day from an old lady whom he stated barely escaped "Sunday slavery" by telling her employer that she would not work on Sunday.

So extremely ridiculous did these examples of Sunday slavery make the previous address appear that one was left in doubt for a moment as to whether the minister was speaking in irony or whether he was in earnest. But as the chairman did not ask him to give place to one who was friendly to the objects of the meeting it was apparent that the speaker was actually in earnest. By this undiplomatic utterance, it leaked out that this awful slavery could be escaped by simply refusing to be a slave,—that the minister's son was still a slave either because he wanted the additional wages which resulted from his Sunday work, or he did not have the moral stamina or the loyalty to principle that the old lady had who escaped from "involuntary servitude" by saying that she valued her loyalty to God more than her Sunday earnings or even a remunerative position.

Ministers' sons are proverbially lax in their loyalty to the principles taught them by their clerical parents, but usually ministers do not take advantage of Union meetings to advertise this unfaithfulness on the part of their children. To say the least, it seems a little inconsistent for ministers to be continually asking for laws to compel their children and members of their congregations to stop work on Sunday. This may seem to some to be an unfair way of stating the matter, but a minister of Englewood recently stated that one of the chief causes of the laxity with which Sunday was observed by the masses was the desecration of the day by the church members themselves. This same divine in the same address advocated the enforcement of a strict Sunday law which, he hoped, would bring about a reform, not only among non-church-going Sabbath-breakers, but on the part of the church members themselves; which reform, by this last statement, he admitted he was unable to bring about by the power of preaching.

A statement of the case which would be acceptable to the advocates of strict Sunday laws would be that they wanted Sunday laws enforced which would compel the employer to close his business that the employes might enjoy their Sabbath rest without sacrificing their positions for their principles. With all due respect to this class of Christians it must be apparent to all, that they lack one of the fundamental principles of Christianity—a willingness to make some sacrifices for their faith,—a lack which no civil law can replace. Ever since Matthew, the publican, lost his position in the Judean custom house to accept of Christianity, Christians have had to sacrifice something for their religion. "This world," says the poet, "is not a friend of grace to help us on to God,"—never was, and never will be. Law can not take the place of moral stamina or Christian principle. The sanctified decision of one old woman will go farther toward building up a Christian character than a volume of Sunday laws.

While it is to be regretted that the greed of gain leads some business corporations to require their employes to toil, day in and day out, refusing to allow them a weekly rest day, answering their request for the same, with the suggestion that they seek employment elsewhere; yet at the same time it must be borne in mind that law can not cure all the ills of life as some would-be reformers of the present day seem to think. Ex-Senator Ingalls, referring in a recent lecture at Glen Echo, to the present tendency toward paternalism, truthfully declared that "the attempt to cure the ills of society by statute would be as futile as the effort to make the mercury stand at zero in July and at boiling point in January."

Again, that this so-called Sunday slavery is not considered a grievance of importance by the workingmen, is evident from the fact that there has not been a strike which has had for its basis Sunday labor. There have been strikes entailing great public inconvenience and personal suffering on the part of laborers and their families for so small a grievance as the employment of a "scab," or non-union man, but we have yet to learn of a strike for emancipation from this so-called Sunday slavery.

It is of course within the province of ministers to urge their communicants, and as many others as they can, to a consistent observance of the Sabbath; but if their exhortations fail, it is inconsistent to attempt a reform by means of a civil law, secured by a sentimental outcry against the so-called Sunday slavery.
