The promoters of legalized Sunday observance in France are feeling their way very gradually. The freight stations of the railway companies have heretofore been kept open until noon, but the Minister of Public Works has lately signed a measure by which they will be closed at ten o'clock in the forenoon. It is thus by almost imperceptible advances this movement is everywhere gaining vantage ground.
