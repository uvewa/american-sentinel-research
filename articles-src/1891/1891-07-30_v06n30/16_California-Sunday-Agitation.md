The "Pearl of Days" publishes the following in regard to California:

> In the eighteen months which closed with the adjournment of the Legislature, Dr. Edward Thompson, District-Secretary, has spoken four hundred times in California on Sabbath observance.

> Archbishop Riordan and other eminent clergymen of various denominations assisted to bring this movement before the people. The guns have opened fire all along the line. Nearly all the towns of the State and many rural localities have been reached either by single night meetings or conventions lasting a whole day or more. Tens of thousands of copies of printed documents have been circulated.

> About one-third of this State has been well aroused and organized. Los Angeles, the second city of the State, Santa Barbara and Santa Ana, the third and fourth cities of Southern California, and the whole county of San Bernardino, are under Sunday laws, enacted by local authorities and because the people demanded it. San Diego and several other towns will soon fall into line.

> A good bill was introduced into both houses of the last California Legislature. A joint hearing was granted by the committee of the two houses in the Senate chamber, in the presence of an immense audience. The strongest enemies of Sunday legislation joined arguments with its friends. A great battle was fought, and the verdict of the audience was for the enactment of the bill. But the Legislature adjourned without action on the bill, leaving it on the files. "Lack of time" was the common excuse. Some of the best men of that body, however, thought that it would not be wise to enact the law because in their judgment, public sentiment would not generally sustain it. They said "work up this sentiment through the State at large, like it is at Los Angeles and other towns, and we will be ready to pass the law."

> The plan is to give two years more to the agitation. The balance of 1891 will be devoted to distributing literature in every town and county. The year of 1892 will be the year of local campaigns and careful effective organization.
