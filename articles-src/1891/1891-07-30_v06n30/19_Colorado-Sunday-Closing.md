COLORADO has fallen into line in the matter of Sunday closing. In Denver especially there has been much opposition to the enforcement of the law, but the authorities are inexorable; now some who have hitherto opposed the law favor a rigid application of it, hoping in that way to make it odious and so secure its repeal. The situation is much the same in other towns in the State.
