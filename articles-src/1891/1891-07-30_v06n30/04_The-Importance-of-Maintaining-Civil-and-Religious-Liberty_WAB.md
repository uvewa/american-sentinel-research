[page 235] One of the best evidences of a politically enlightened nation, of a people who appreciated their liberties, is that they are remembered by a judicious regard for the fundamental principles of liberty for the most widespread application. Patrick Henry's memorable resolution in the Virginia Assembly in 1765, in opposition to the Stamp Act, asserting that the people of Virginia were bound to obey only such laws as were enacted by their own representatives in parliament, was an act of the widest application. Patrick Henry's memorable resolution in the Virginia Assembly in 1765, in opposition to the Stamp Act, asserting that the people of Virginia were not bound to obey any law enacted in disregard of their fundamental principles, will never be forgotten by the American people. It is a fundamental fact, lying at the very foundation of the American political system. It is no indication of high political development to object to governmental taxation when it has grown so far as to destroy our property and endanger our lives, but it is an indication of high development when wrong acts opposed before oppression begins; when evils and abuses are nipped in the bud; when the tyrant first begins to extend his hand. Lawlessness while conscience, his legal bandishments while conscious of his own.

John Fisk aptly states this idea in his work on the American Revolution, just entitled. Speaking of the State of the American mind during the revolutionary period, he says:—

It is the signal characteristic of the progress of the civil liberty in the race that wherever the brute force in a barbarous age is fully equaled by a wise and steadfast people who know their rights and are determined to maintain them, every interference in a more advanced age. The effect which a blow in the face would produce upon a barbarian will be wrought upon a civilized man by an abuse of some far-reaching legal principle, which, [page 236] in only a subtle and almost intangible way prejudices the interests of a law in the fore—Page 38.

This farsightedness, this understanding of the ultimate results of governmental acts (whether such results are direct or indirect) has been a characteristic of our greatest statesmen both in the Revolutionary and Secessionary periods. The great Lincoln in one of his earlier speeches emphasized the importance of every American citizen promising to all that integrity. In his speech on the "Great Southern Mail" contest, he said:

> I admit it as a far-fetched deduction to say what if nothing else was rejected, at a time, and if nothing else was rejected, a natural so far would it be the thought. There is a passage of this prophetic ground of our constitution; and if the American people give fair hearing to all, we have no more from above it. But I have said, and these are words of the Lord. (London, 1863.)

It is "a plague" that the American people must look out for. In our modern religio-political agitation, it is not so much the actual as the act that it may lead to; not so much the evil of a tax for a small sectarian appropriation, and as much as even by evil of a few minutes being taken up in the morning of our schools for religious instruction, not so much the real hardship caused by the first comparatively mild form of Sunday law, as it is the inaugurations of these violations of American principles in more aggravated and more dangerous cases. It is not the material loss, but the loss of all freedoms, political, whether such results could be interpreted as detrimental, no matter what law or what may be gained. No constitutional error wherever a blow is struck.

England thought to reconcile the Americans to the tax by reducing the price of tea. But this plan was a complete failure. What did the colonist care for a few paltry shillings when a principle was in danger! So it is in our present struggle for the maintenance of American principles of freedom. One of the very men engaged in the cause of liberty at that time noted that the stand must be taken, in our opposition to religious legislation. In urging the Virginians to oppose giving a cent of State money for the furtherance of religion he said:

It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest and most distinctive characteristics of the late Revolution of America that did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they repelled the consequences by denying the principle. We reverse this lesson too soon teach us to forget it. We do not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects. That the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?

And it might be added: Who does not see that the same power that can deprive you of one day's time, can deprive you of your time altogether; or the same power that can confiscate what you earn on one day in the week, can confiscate what you earn on every day in the week? The law-makers are no wiser and propose to determine a certain class of Americans (in the case of one-seventh of their time (Sunday)), not to take care of what belongs to them, but to deprive them of the wages earned on that day, is a direct assault at the very first principles of American liberty. And if those measures are left to go unchallenged, our free political system will perish. Just so was the political system destroyed in the days of the Roman Republic, and with it the liberty of every citizen in the territory. In order to properly present the American position on the Sunday Act, let it be stated.

"There could be no sounder political philosophy than was contained in those burning sentences of Pitt. From all the history of the European world since the later days of the Roman Republic, there is no more important lesson to be learned than this—that if for thousands of free people to govern a dependent people despotically, without endangering their own freedom."—*American Revolution*, page 96.

The main danger is hidden behind the Sunday laws. If Sunday-law keepers make an illegitimate use of the power delegated to the Government, by depriving Sabbatarians of a portion of the free use of their time, that violation of liberty will undermine the security of all our liberty, and as a natural consequence, is likely to destroy themselves. In fact, Sunday laws in its truth deprive every single individual in their jurisdiction of their full liberty. Mr. Justice Burnett points out this in his California decision declaring Sunday laws unconstitutional—

> Sunday is said to be the Christian relationship keeping the first day of the week, does not authorize the Legislature to make it a day of enforced rest from ordinary labor. The Legislature cannot compel the citizen to submit to the Constitution for its authority to do or omit it, as his interest. The act violates at once the religious freedom of the Christian and Sabbatarian.

> From the Jewish point of view there can be no higher authority as to living the Christian and as he has the right to object, when the Legislature invades the freedom of religious act of conscience and assumes the power to compel him to do that which he has the right to omit! If the pleasure. The question is the same, whether the act of the Legislature compels to do that which we wish to do or prohibits. If the compulsory power over such a right is unlimited.

"There are reasons that the passage of this Sunday Act should not be so strongly urged in behalf of this sect, unless as are rightly advanced by the friends of the present religio-political agitation. There are some of the reasons why they oppose a Sunday law just as earnestly and just as faithfully when a law has a clause exempting them as when there is no clause. As law is the ultimate change that would not hurt them personally, yet it is just as much a violation of American principles, and therefore calls for all their power in its defense of our established rights."
