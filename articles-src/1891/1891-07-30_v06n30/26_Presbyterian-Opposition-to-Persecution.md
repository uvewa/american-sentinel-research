A SUBSCRIBER in West Sunbury, Pennsylvania, writes:—

> God speed THE SENTINEL in its glorious work! I am too sound a Presbyterian to allow Jews and infidels to assert and prove that true Christianity will persecute. And if laws against Sabbath-breaking and profanity are not persecuting laws, neither was the Spanish Inquisition; nor is the attitude of the Russian Government toward the Jews persecution. We can not afford to allow the "truth as it is in Jesus" to be evil spoken of. Force applied for the propagation of Christianity is antichristian.

All honor to such Presbyterians! The Church and the country need thousands of them.
