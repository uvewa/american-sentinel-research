In face of the unmistakable tendencies in the direction of intolerance, manifested in the clerical clamor for the enactment and enforcement of strict Sunday laws, the too general ministerial indorsement of the persecution of R. M. King, of Tennessee, for quietly plowing his cornfield on Sunday, and the stern application of creeds to men with investigative minds, we see one honest intelligent effort to exercise real Christian charity between men differing in religious doctrines. It is not unusual for pastors of different denominations to exchange pulpits, but in such cases the unwritten law governing the speaker forbids him saying anything which could be interpreted as denominational, no matter how vital he may regard his denominational views. For a pastor to invite his neighboring pastors to come into his pulpit, and with perfect freedom discourse to his congregation, on the distinctive doctrines of their respective denominations, is something so unusual in its freedom from bigotry, as to deserve a favorable notice.

Rev. Daniel Frederick Fox, Pastor of the Adams Street Evangelical Church of Chicago, has instituted a series of six Sunday evening lectures by the representatives of as many neighboring denominations. For example, Bishop Fallows, of the Reformed Episcopal Church, will lecture on the subject, "Why I am a Reformed Episcopalian." A Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Presbyterian, and Christian minister, will speak in a similar manner for their respective denominations. "The object of the series of sermons," according to the printed announcement, "is not controversy, but intelligent information." This brave young pastor certainly deserves credit for this consistent attack on denominational prejudice.
