Owing to the liberal airing given the King case in Obion County, Tennessee, by the press of almost the entire country, public sentiment has so changed in the western part of the State that convictions for ordinary quiet labor on Sunday cannot be secured, and arrests are no longer made. The following letter from a subscriber at Graysville, in southeastern Tennessee, reveals the fact, however, that there is still necessity for educational missionary work in that State, for it is evident that bigotry and intolerance still survive there to some extent:—

### Graysville, Tenn., July 15, 1891.

**Editor American Sentinel:** In a place called the Cove, three or four miles from Dayton, is a small company of Sabbath keepers, who are very conscientious and devout Christians. These not long ago were wicked and profane men. For many years, they with their neighbors and friends, had indulged in all kinds of work and amusements upon Sunday; but recently when some commenced the observance of the Seventh-day Sabbath, immediately things changed. Those who were once their friends now became their foes. So long as they did not keep the seventh day nothing was said about Sunday desecration, no matter how much, or the kind of work which was performed. And that has been the custom in that vicinity for years.

Last week the Deputy Sheriff and two other men were in the Cove watching to catch Saturday keepers at work; and some of their nearest neighbors have been lounging around on Sunday like coyotes in a thicket to catch their innocent prey. These very men who are now trying so hard to bring seventh-day observers before the courts for working on Sunday, have time and again borrowed tools of Seventh-day Adventists to chop wood all day Sunday.

The sheriff referred to lives at Morgantown, one-half mile from Dayton, and one and a half mile from the Cove, his place of attack. Dayton is where the large iron and coal furnaces of the Dayton Coal and Iron Company are situated employing three hundred men running full blast day in and day out, Sundays not excepted, with all its noise and bustle, producing one hundred and twenty tons of iron every Sunday, and that too within speaking distance of two churches, yet nothing is said about that.

Why would the Sheriff leave so grand an opportunity, to catch men at work and go two miles over a mountain and skulk around to find engaged in honest toil some poor farmer who had observed the previous day? Ah! it is not the nature or the amount of work performed, that constitutes the offense so much as the fact that those who do it observe another day. Dayton, Rathburn and Whitwell, are places where large coke ovens are in active operation running all the time and employing hundreds of men on Sunday which is an open violation of the law. The Sunday law of Tennessee is a dead letter until it comes to "Seventh-day observers," then life will spring up in it equal to that of the ancient Inquisition. Tennessee does grant a right to corporations by permitting them to work on Sunday, that she will not to an individual, and such a law, deserves the censure of every citizen and lover of religious liberty. Any one who will think for a moment can see that such a law will only make hypocrites; and the Sunday law has done an effectual work in that line here.

It is almost inconceivable that such a spirit can still survive anywhere in this country, but that it does is evident. It is to be hoped that the Seventh-day Christians of southeastern Tennessee will boldly take up the gauntlet thus thrown down by bigotry and intolerance and bravely do battle for liberty of conscience as it has been done in the western part of the State. At present an enlightened public sentiment will not sustain media-valism, and the best way to enlighten the public upon such subjects is to join issues with bigotry wherever opportunity offers. The friends of religious liberty everywhere expect their brethren in Tennessee to do their duty.
