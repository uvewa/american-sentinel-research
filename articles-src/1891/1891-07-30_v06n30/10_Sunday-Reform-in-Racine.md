On the evening of July 19 a meeting was held in Racine, Wisconsin, to demand of the local authorities the enforcement of Sunday laws, at which, it is said, there were four thousand people present. Five thousand dollars were raised as a fund with which to proceed with the work of "Sunday Reform" in that city.
