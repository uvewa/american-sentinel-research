In an editorial comment on the Sunday crusade which the American Sabbath Union has lately been making in Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, the Syracuse Sunday Times says:

> Such men do more toward driving thinking men from within the fold of the Church than a regiment of Satan's allies, because of their outrageously incorrect statements.

> Mr. McCartney says the Sunday newspaper is an unmitigated evil, and Dr. George asserts that the Sunday newspaper is demoralizing the people. Mr. McCartney holds that all persons who buy and read Sunday newspapers are breaking the rule, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." If Mr. McCartney will take the trouble to study the subject he will find that he has no authority to observe any day but the seventh as the Sabbath day of the Lord his God, if the ten commandments are observed as they read. He and all other bigoted members of the American Sabbath Union propose to compel Tom, Dick and Harry to observe as a day of rest and worship the first day of the week, when Tom, Dick and Harry have good reason, following the mandates of the Decalogue, to observe the seventh day. The members of this Union are not friends of the American Republic and a free country. They believe in such freedom of worship as may suit themselves, and they want laws passed which will compel those who don't agree with them to swallow their dogmas and doctrines and become of their household of faith.
