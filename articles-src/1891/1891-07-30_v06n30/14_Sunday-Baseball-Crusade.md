"He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; but he that seeketh after mischief, it shall comeunto him," is the Biblical text set at the head of the editorial column of the Mail and Express for July 14. In his anxiety to follow the lead thus given him the baseball reporter seeks after mischief and thinks he finds the following:

> The crusade against Sunday ball playing is extending to the West. In Kansas City a well organized movement has been started with a view to compelling the authorities to take cognizance of the law breaking that is indulged in every Sunday. A committee of citizens has been appointed who will devise ways and means whereby the desecration of Sunday might be brought to a speedy and permanent end. The churches have been interested in the movement and money has been pledged to carry on the work and pursue a vigorous prosecution. The committee proposes to employ able counsel and fight the local baseball club for Sunday playing, and the players and the management will be arrested every Sunday afternoon that they appear on the grounds. This is as it should be.

> If concerted action were taken by the owners of property contiguous to the Ridgewood, Long Island, grounds it wouldn't be long before the clubs that infest that spot, and the loafers and rowdies that follow them, would have to find some less conspicuous rendezvous.
