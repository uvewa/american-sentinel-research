AMONG "Foreign Notes" the Sun publishes the following:

> The fashion which has changed even the British Sunday from a day to be observed with punctilious attendance at church, and precise and formal dress into an occasion for lounging in boating and tennis flannels, has been so sweeping that the residents of Brighton are forced to complain against the great number of respectable men who loaf about in flannels with pipes in their mouths and little caps on their heads. The aspect and character of Brighton are radically changed.

This is drawing the line even closer than it has yet been drawn in this country. True, the evident purpose of the various so-called Sabbath unions is to make life outside of the churches insupportable on Sunday; but as yet even Mr. Crafts has not been bold enough to denounce as a civil offense the wearing of flannel suits on that day. It seems not impossible, however, that erelong full dress suits will be required on Sunday—of course merely as a police regulation.
