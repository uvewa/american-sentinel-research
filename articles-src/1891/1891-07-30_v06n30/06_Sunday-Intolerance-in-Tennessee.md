[page 237] Owing to the liberal attitude given the State case in Obion County, Tennessee, by the press of almost the entire country, public sentiment has so changed in the western part of the State that convictions for ordinary quiet labor on Sunday cannot be secured, and arrests are no longer made. The following letter from a subscriber at Graysville, in southeastern Tennessee, reveals the fact, however, that there is still necessity for educational missionary work in that State, for if in a place that bigotry and intolerance still survive there to some extent:—

> Graysville, Tenn., July 15, 1891.

> EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: There is in a valley about the Cove, three or four miles from Dayton, a small company of Sabbath keepers, who are very conscientious and devout Christians. These not long ago were wicked and profane men. For many years, they with their neighbors and friends had indulged in all kinds of work and amusement on Sunday, but recently several of them accepted the observance of the Seventh-day Sabbath, being either Adventists or Seventh-day Baptists. Their friends now became their foes. So long as they all rested on Sunday, they said nothing at all about Sunday desecration; no matter how much was done on that day, it was all right. And that has been the custom in that vicinity for many years.
>
> Last week the Deputy Sheriff and two other men were over from Cove to make arrests. One Sabbath keeper keeps at work; and some of their nearest neighbors have been keeping exercise on Sunday; and this creates or is a thicket to catch their innocent people. There very men who are now trying to bring us here nearly every day observe before the fuss comes at a hearing on Sunday, have times and again been seen at work of Seventh-day Adventists to chop wood for the neighbors.
>
> A brother that came from Dayton says a friend half mile from Dayton, and one and a half mile from the Cove, told him that the leading citizens in the large iron and coal furnaces of the Dayton Company have now been running for the past three hundred men running full that they dig in soil and out, Sundays are an exempts' work, all in all and trade, producing one hundred and seventy tons of coke every Monday, and some of it within speaking distance of two churches, yet nothing is said about it.
>
> Why should the Sheriff have so grand an opportunity to molest, as well as work and go directly over a mountain and strike fourth to find supposed offenders and some poor farmer who wished to clear a little of the acreage of work performed, that constitutes the means of bread for the sustaining or even of another another day. Yet, Dayton, Burleson and elsewhere, are places here might hear on matters in active operation running all the time and rest when possible or by these are not arrested for violations of the law. The Sunday law is wanted only to a those that befitted sense of "Seventh-day observers!" does life will spring to resist to the rest of the seventh delight in time. Tennessee does grant a right to compensation by permitting them to work on Sunday, this also will not as individual, and make us discover every of every citizen and leave it free to be our Sovereign to select time and conscientious can see that such a law will only make happiness, and the Sabbath or the law on that work it in that law here.

It is almost inconceivable that such a spirit can still survive anywhere in this country, but that it does is evident. It is to be hoped that the Seventh-day Christians of southeastern Tennessee will boldly take up the gauntlet thus thrown down by bigotry and intolerance and bravely do battle for liberty of conscience as it has been done in the western part of the State.

At present an enlightened public sentiment will not sustain Sunday-law enforcement, yet still stands manifestly unfair in the best way to enlighten the public upon these subjects is to get the literature of liberty before them, and we trust that every friend of religious liberty every where will exert their brethren in Tennessee to do their duty.
