[page 238] NATIONAL
Religious Liberty Association.

THE Mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, has notified the saloon keepers of that place that hereafter the Sunday-closing law will be rigidly enforced against them. Why not enforce the law impartially? If the saloons are all property open during the remainder of the week, why especially discriminate against them on the first day?

The playing of baseball on the grounds of the Athletic Club at Albany, New Jersey, has been the subject of an editorial notice given that on Sunday baseball will be allowed in the township, Sunday baseball and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair seem to be the two subjects which occupy the minds of National Reformers at present.

JAMES A. BRADLEY, President of the Board of Commissioners of Asbury Park is in a quandary. He has issued orders for businesses to be suspended on Sunday, and against public excursions to that place, following an old statute. It has been pointed out to him, however, that the statute is not in effect on all offences. It has been pointed out to him that the law provides that no person found on that day, and has rendered himself unable to arrest him in own order. The Commissioner is not fondly engaged in trying to dodge his own boomerang.

At Asbury Park have been instituted cases against W. E. Frankel, Frederick Colonias, and Harry Williams, of gaming Sunday, and the police patting. Under orders from the Board of Commissioners are keeping close watch upon all business places suspected of doing any business. However much New Jersey may over-act, this distinction it can not hold first place in the attempted enforcement of Sunday laws; Arkansas, Tennessee are still in advance.

"He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor; but he that seeketh after mischief, it shall come unto him." the following text at the hand of the editorial comments of the *Mail and Express* for July 11. In his anxiety to follow the lead that given him the baseball reporter seeks after mischief and thinks he finds it every Sunday.

The crusade against Sunday ball playing is extending to the West. In Kansas City a well organized movement has been started, with a view to compelling the authorities to take cognizance of the law-breaking that is indulged in every Sunday. A committee of citizens has been appointed who will go before the courts and insist whenever the desecration of Sunday might be brought to a properly and permanently end. The churches have taken hold in earnest in the movement and money has been pledged to carry on the work and points a vigorous prosecuting. The fight over the baseball club bill for Sunday recreation has only the begun. A citizen has been appointed to be served every Sunday afternoon that they appear on the grounds. This is a is settled.

If concerted action was taken by the owners of property contiguous to the Ridgewood, farm, it held, grounds it wouldn't be long before the rule that infest that track and life, one that may the follow them, would have to find some less conspicuous.

In an editorial comment on the Sunday "crusade" which the American Sabbath Union has lately been making in Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica, the *Syracuse Sunday Times* says:—

> Each scene in has caused drinking houses came from within the fold of the Church than a regimen of music allies, "because of their subsequently incorrect statements."

Mr. McCartney says the Sunday newspaper is an assimilating evil, and Dr. George asserts that the present Sunday newspapers are wronging the people. Mr. McCartney holds that all persons who buy and read Sunday newspapers are breaking the rule. "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."

Mr. McCartney! Will he take the trouble to satisfy the community of his own members that they remember any day but the seventh as the Sabbath day, the seventh day of the week, it was that they so observed as they read. He and all other ministers who make such assertions should propose to consult Tom, Dick and Harry to observe a lot of rest on all worship the first of the these a week, when Tom, Dick and Harry have good reason, following the mandates of the keeping that they observe the seventh day. The members of this Union are not friends of the American Republic and a free country. They believe in such freedom with a frown against those who conscientiously do not keep that which will corrupt those who don't agree that them to restore their dignities and institutions and become of their household of faith.

The "Pearl of Days" publishes the following in regard to California:—

> In the eighteen months which closed with the adjournment of the Legislature, Dr. Stewart Sheldon, District Secretary, has spoken in some twenty towns in California on Sabbath observance; Ellen Stanford and others counted that acts of various denominations seemed to bring them together by pressing upon them the greatest evil an along the line. Nearly all to know of the cities and many more filled from personal to reached either by single night meetings or courses of lectures beginning on the other. Three or more or four seats of copies of printed documents have been sought and sent out to be used wherever they seemed needed.

> The work of organization is now becoming well aroused and organized. Los Angeles, the second city in the State, first organized with a committee of the third and fourth cities of Southern California, and the whole county of the Sacramento, or entire district of the Bay country, was exercised by local authorities and became the people demanded it. San Francisco and other cities will soon fall into line.

> A good bill was introduced into both houses of the State Legislature at the last session, and it was pursued by the committees of the two houses into a union commission which then gave it a generous audience. The strongest enemies of Sunday legislation appeared with personal arguments, a great battle was fought, and the verdict of the advisers for our the enactment of the bill, the Legislature adjourned without action on it, but leaving it on its file—that "it lack of time" was our inability of the direct defeat of the measure. The daily, however, thought that it would not be a good public sentiment to hear them the right of the public sentiment would not graciously submit to this. Part "I work up this sentiment through the heart at large, like it is at Los Angeles and other men; as we will be every to participate in the."

The plan is to get 7000 men to sign for the support of the Sunday bill in the Legislature. The year of 1892 will be a year for the year of California in the year of 1892 will be the year for the year of 1902 will be the year of local organization and central organization.
