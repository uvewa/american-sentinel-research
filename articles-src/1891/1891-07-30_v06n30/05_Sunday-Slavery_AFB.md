[page 236] The point which those interested in right Sunday closing during the World's Fair, put in the statements and in the argument of strict Sunday laws, State and National, are just now emphasizing with great vehemence, is the so-called "Sunday slavery," of this country which has heretofore been soothingly called "The land of the free." As one listens to a portrayal of the sufferings endured by these modern slaves, he imagines himself back in the fifties, and needs but to close his eyes to imagine he hears the cracking of the fetters and the crack of the slave trader's lash, as the midnight train moves sadly by.

At a Union meeting recently held on the north side of the city of Chicago for a general discussion of the Sunday-closing question, one of the speakers indulged in a passionate portrayal of our present "American slavery," and urged that the slaves be emancipated by the enactment and enforcement of what he was pleased to term a "civil Sunday law," promising to care for and educate them and that the Church would undertake to give them the moral and spiritual Sabbath education which they so much needed.

The next speaker introduced, was a prominent minister of the city who said in the preface to his remarks that he was pressed to contribute what the speaker had just said regarding Sunday slavery, but he had not expected that this slavery would be worse or come so close home. "Only to-day," (Sunday) said the speaker, my pay came home from his late work at the establishment where he is employed, Sunday worked during the forenoon; and today other declared he had received notice that the same pay from the mill at which he stated lately escaped "Sunday slavery" by telling for her company they would not work on Sunday.

So vigorously ridiculous did some of the friends of Sunday slavery make this presentation address appear that we had left for dead a moment the so called "Waiter for a foremost as to whether" the minister was speaking in irony or whether he was in earnest. But his clarification made it all that he gives to those to care for said directly to the objects of the meeting that appeared. But the speaker was actually in earnest. By this manipulation alternatively, it looked that only the Sunday could be escaped by simply refusing to be a slave by refusing to minister at all—a slave is a slave whether or not he has the additional wages which enrolled only. In Sunday work, or he did not then the stated standing to this principle to principle that the old lady the whip escaped from "involuntary servitude" by saying that she wanted her lash by told not from the Sunday labor yet on Sunday servings or even a remember.

Ministers' sons are powerfully by an their loyalty to the principle of Sunday. By their own Christian churches, but themselves do not take advantage of Union in advance to deliver such information on the part of their children. The "The amount of noise these ministers are making to stand on Sundays will not measure itself, it seems a little inconsistent for ministers to be continually asking for laws to compel churches and the children and the congregations to stop work on Sunday. This may seem to some to be an unfair way of making the matter, but a minister of Eggleston recently stated that one of the chief causes of the laxity with which Sunday was observed in this time was the desecration of the day by the church members themselves.

That same divine in the same address urged the enforcement of a strict Sunday law, which, he hoped, would bring about a reform, not in only among some

[page 237] church-going Sabbath-breakers, but on the part of the church members themselves, which reform, by this last stating of the case, he admitted he was unable to bring about by the power of preaching.

A statement of the case which would be acceptable to the advocates of strict Sunday laws would be that they wanted Sunday laws so that officers would compel the employer to close his business that the employees might enjoy their Sabbath rest without sacrificing their positions for their principles. With all due respect to this class of Christians it must be apparent to all, that they lack one of the fundamental principles of Christianity—a willingness to make some sacrifices for their faith,—a lack which no civil law can replace. Even since Matthew, the publican, lost his position in the Judean custom house because of his refusal to let his work and accountments infringe upon the requirements of God. And such a failure to accept Christianity, Christians have made some sacrifices for their religion. "Wait works!" says Rev. post; "we are not a friend of grace to help or to on God's truth. Neither the Constitution nor Law can not take the place of moral stamina or Christian principle." The masterful devotion of one old woman will go farther toward building up a Christian character than a volume of Sunday laws.

While it is to be regretted that the greed of gain from some heartless employers have compelled their employees to toil, day in and day out, refusing to allow them a weekly day of rest, answering their request for the same, with the suggestion that they seek employment elsewhere, and yet at the same time it must be borne in mind that two can not live on the life of life as some would-be reformers of the laws. Having to do on our Sunday may not deprive equal rather than have the decisions to suffer by the working of these followed by the law enforces Sunday.

Again, that his so-called Sunday slavery is not confined to a grievance of employees by their workmen, is evident from the fact that there has not been a strike which has had for its basis Sunday labor. There have been strikes entailing great public inconvenience and personal suffering on the part of laborers and their families for so small a grievance on the employer of a "scab," or non-union man, but we have yet to learn of a strike for emancipation from this so-called Sunday slavery.

It is of course within the province of ministers to urge their communicants, and as many others as they see, to a constant observance of the Sabbath. But to their exhortation fall, it is inconsistent to attempt a reform by means of a civil law, secured by a sentimental outcry against the so-called Sunday slavery.
