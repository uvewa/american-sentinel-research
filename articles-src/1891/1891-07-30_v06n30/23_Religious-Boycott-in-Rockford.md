ROCKFORD, Illinois, has been the first to systematically adopt the "religious boycott," in reference to Sunday parks, ball playing, excursions and transportation. Rockford is also the home of false Messiah Sweinfurth, and although the two facts may have no visible or actual connection still they are of the same color and are either feathers from the same bird, or from birds of the same plumage, and show where the carcass is and which way the wind is blowing.
