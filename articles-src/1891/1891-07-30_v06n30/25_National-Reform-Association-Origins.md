The "s editorial notes the Independent, c. ' y 16, mentions some facts in reference to the National Reform Association with the legitimate deductions therefrom, which ought to have a wide circulation and receive consideration wherever the especial views of this Association and its first-born offshoot the Sabbath Union are taught. The Independent says:—

> As our readers know, there is a National Reform Association, whose object it is to have God recognized in the Constitution of the United States; but it is not so well known that this Association, which has scores of distinguished names loosely attached to it and printed in its list of officers, originated in the Reformed Presbyterian or Scotch Covenanter Church, or rather, a branch of it, one of the smallest of all the "split Ps." and growing daily smaller, now that it is busily engaged in expelling all its ministers who think its members should not be forbidden to exercise the right of the ballot. It is the special and peculiar principle of this denomination that the State is a personality, and has the same duty to recognize and worship God and Jesus Christ as has an individual, and that so long as the State refuses to do it voting is a sin. The seven young men who were lately expelled suffered because they expressed the opinion that the law expelling members from the Church for voting should be modified. Now the working members of the National Reform Association all belong to this Covenanter Church, and it is interesting to see what position they took in the expulsion of these seven young men. D. McAllister, D.D., and R. J. George, D.D., are both secretaries of the Association, and were both prosecutors of these young men. Dr. McAllister was moderator of the presbytery which condemned them, and then represented presbytery as prosecutor before the Synod. The Association has two newspaper organs, the Christian Statesman of Philadelphia, and the Christian Nation, of this city. Both papers have opposed the young men and endorsed their expulsion, and the Christian Nation has given page after page to attacks upon them. Mr. R. C. Wylie, Traveling Secretary of the Association, has written article after article against them. We mention these facts to open the eyes of good men of other denominations, like Felix R. Brunot, President, and others, who give their names to the Association, but few of whom are ever seen on its platform. The whole active efficiency of the Association is Covenanter, and most of the money comes from that source; and what it would do if it could have its way and rule the State after its ideas may be judged from its persecution of its young ministers who are not willing to forbid everybody to vote.
