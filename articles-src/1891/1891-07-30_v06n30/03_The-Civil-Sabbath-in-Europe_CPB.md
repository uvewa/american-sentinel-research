[page 235] THE Sunday agitation is not confined to this country. Indeed, it is almost world-wide; but outside our own country and Canada, it has recently received most attention in France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain. In all these countries Sunday has been the subject of legislative action.

Official action in these several countries has not been uniform, but the first three named agreed substantially that all employees should be entitled to one day in seven for rest. In France and Hungary the selection of the day is left to the employer; it is simply required that the hours in his employ one day each week; in Germany the enactment is that Sunday shall be the stated day. The French Deputies are still pending in Spain, but the issue in that great Catholic country is not doubtful, and Sunday will be named in the bill as it is in Germany.

The French Chamber of Deputies a strong effort was made to designate Sunday as the rest day, but some of the deputies insisted that for physical rest one day is just as good as another, and that the Government could not properly be influenced by religious considerations. The friends of Sunday in France did not

however seem discouraged. Like their fellows in this country they are willing to take what they can get in the direction of Sunday, hoping for more presently. "We may hope," wrote the late Père Didon, shortly before his death, "that the final victory will not be long delayed."

And from certain indications it would seem that he was not so much in error. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Paris has recently established a publication which he calls "The Sunday Crusade," in which he takes strong ground in favor of distinct governmental recognition of Sunday.

In Europe as in this country the friends of a "civil Sabbath" demand a general day of rest for the workingman; but that has been secured on a purely civil basis as in France and Hungary, they are not satisfied, and demand as they are doing in both those countries that Sunday be designated as the day. The fact is, that the whole movement in religion; the civil covering is only a mask to hide its real distinctive character, from the union of those combinations forming a new one between Church and State. They may call it what they will, but it is the same thing, whether in Europe or America, is a movement to enforce by civil power the observance of a religious day.
