THE Independent Patriot says that "those who think there is no religious intolerance connected with the agitation now progressing in favor of Sunday laws, Bible in public schools, and the enactment of laws in favor of the Christian as against the Mohammedan, the Buddhist or the infidel, will do well to note the action of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in casting out certain young ministers for asserting that it is not a sin to vote under the Constitution as it is."
