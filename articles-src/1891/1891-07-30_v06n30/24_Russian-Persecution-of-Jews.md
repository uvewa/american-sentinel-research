THE persecution of Jews in Russia has, it is said, been somewhat relaxed. The decree for their expulsion from St. Petersburg has been indefinitely postponed, and renewed orders have been sent to the press to refrain from publishing articles likely to excite animosity against the Hebrews. The change is supposed to be due to public opinion throughout the civilized world. Certain it is that public opinion is an almost irresistible power, but the letter from the South published in another column shows that it still has something to do in this country. Let us hope that it will speedily accomplish a good work not only in Russia but in the mountains of southeastern Tennessee.
