The following is an editorial article from the Boston Daily Globe, of July 1:

"When governments purporting to be wholly secular attempt to legislate in behalf of morality those who are appointed to execute the law are frequently all at sea. The Legislature of Ohio has passed a law prohibiting the playing of baseball on Sundays, but as it requires nine innings to constitute such a game, one of the courts has decided that the game can not be interfered with until the last inning is completed. The law therefore proves to be a farce.

"Rhode Island has no special law prescribing particular games which are forbidden on Sunday, but many people have supposed that baseball must certainly fall within the scope of general Sunday laws. As soon, therefore, as the great games opened at Rocky Point this summer, the law and order organizations went to the sheriff of Kent County and demanded that he should suppress these Sunday games. He positively refused to do so, affirming that as between one athletic diversion and another it was not his province to decide which was the more or less immoral, and that he had nothing to do whatever with the manner in which people should develop their health and muscles, provided the games were considered to be moral on any other day. His sole and only province within these limits was to keep the peace and preserve good order.

"The position of Sheriff Sprague is that there are no logical standards upon which to base the exercise of authority, as seen in the various athletic diversions which are freely permitted, as against those which certain good people would have suppressed. He, therefore, assures that if baseball is not immoral on Monday it is not on Sunday. Until it can be shown, therefore, that it disturbs the peace of other citizens, not sentimentally, but actually and physically, he declines to interfere.

"As Sunday is a day set apart for rest, people have a right to demand that they should not be disturbed by noisy and boisterous games. But as between diversions that are equally noiseless and equally moral on week days the logic of prohibiting one and freely permitting the other on Sundays is not quite apparent.

"The amount of noise that people are willing to stand on Sundays will take care of itself. But to chain up the flying wooden horses upon which the children gaze so wishfully out at Franklin Park, for example, while the park roads and public streets are covered with adult riders, and while the iron horse goes thundering over the country carrying crowds of pleasure seekers, seems to be ludicrously illogical. And there are many other equally inconsistent features in the catalogue of our Sunday permissions and prohibitions."
