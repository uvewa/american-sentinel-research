The opponents of Sunday baseball in Missouri have forced the question to a test under the State laws in the courts at Kansas City. When the courts in the different States have been brought to give decisions upholding Sunday laws in such cases as liquor selling, and playing baseball, which appear to the majority to carry no religious significance, then, established upon a sure basis, these laws will be used for open religious persecution. The results of the subversion of a religious principle are always in the end disastrous.
