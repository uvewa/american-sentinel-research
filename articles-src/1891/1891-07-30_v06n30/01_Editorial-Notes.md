THE opponents of Sunday baseball in Missouri have forced the question to a test under the State law in the courts at Kansas City. When the courts in the different States have been brought to give decisions upholding Sunday laws in such cases as liquor selling, and playing baseball, which appear to the majority to carry no religious significance, then, established upon a sure basis, these laws will be used for open religious persecution. The results of the selections of a religious principle are always in the end religious.

A SCENE in Austria illustrates the beauty of permitting ecclesiastical control to mold the legislation of a country. In it a Roman Catholic priest abandoned the Catholic faith and became an Evangelical. In 1879 he married and lived happily, but a year or two ago his marriages had to be legally tested, and a separation was pronounced invalid. He appealed, but now the highest court announces that the greatest means of legislation does not permit a man who has vowed celibacy to be freed from that vow. Austria is a good country—try not to live in.

AMONG "Foreign Notes" the Sun publishes the following:—

> The fashion which has changed even the Sunday of Brighton from a day to be observed with puritanical strictness—a church and coronal and formal dress into an *orgie* for lounging in boating and tennis flannel, is here in everything except the residence of Brighton, men are forced to complain against the great scandal of respectables who stroll on the esplanade with pipes in their mouths and little caps on their heads. The aspect and character of Brighton are radically changed.

This is drawing the line even closer than it has yet been drawn in this country. True, the evident purpose of the various so-called Sabbath unions to make life outside of the churches insupportable on Sunday; but as yet even Mr. Crafts has not been bold enough to denounce as a civil offence the wearing of formal suits on that day. It seems not impossible, however, that evening full dress suits will be required on Sunday—of course merely as a police regulation.
