The playing of baseball on the grounds of the Athletic Club at Kearney, New Jersey, has been stopped by the authorities and notice given that no Sunday baseball will be allowed in the township. Sunday baseball and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair seem to be the two objects which occupy the minds of National Reformers at present.
