[page 240] IT is stated that at least twenty-five thousand men, women, and children enjoyed the pure air and balmy breezes in Central Park this week on a recent Sunday. Could these tired people have gone had the Park been closed as some would have it on Sunday for all time?

COLORADO has fallen into line in the matter of Sunday closing. In Denver especially there has been much opposition to the enforcement of the Sunday law; the authorities are inexorable; now some who have taken a different opinion, or have a new view of rigid enforcement of it, hoping in that way to make it to obtain and so secure its repeal. The experiment is much the same in other towns in the State.

THE promoters of legitimate Sunday observance in France are feeling their way very gradually. The freight stations on the railway companies have heretofore been kept open noon, but the Ministers of Public Works has lately signed a measure which in this manner. We claim to be much in the forearm. It is to leave the force at everything of gaining vantage and advantage this moving.

REV. O. K. MURRAY, National Reformer of the Methodist Church, Chicago, is earning a reputation as an enemy to all substantial indifference to governmental affairs. Rev. Murray in the President of the National Reform Association. This Association was originally formed for the purpose of maintaining and enforcing the distinctive idea of anti-place Church and State Government. The attitude which the church of Rome maintains toward this principle no doubt gave birth to this organization, but this its president is trying to be consistent, is shown by his opposition to his church receiving appropriations from the Government to aid in maintaining their Indian mission schools.

Referring to the six thousand dollars that the Methodist Church receives from the Government in common with the Roman Catholic and other church organizations, Mr. Murray said, "The only stain which rests on the fair face of Methodism, that I know of, is the receiving of six

thousand dollars from the Government to aid in carrying on her Indian mission schools." The speaker named four bishops who were opposed to receiving the appropriation, and promised that the church would very soon wash her garments of this iniquity. It is hoped that the eloquent young pastor will walk in the light in the extent of combating laws compelling Sabbath observance.

The *Independent Patriot* says that "those who think there is no religion intolerance connected with the agitation now progressing in favor of Sunday laws, Bible in public schools, and the enactment of laws in favor of the Christian and against the Mohammedan, the Buddhist or the infidel, will do well to note the action of the Reformed Presbyterian Church for the suppression by political means, asserting that it is not a sin to vote under the Constitution as it is."

Rockford, Illinois, has been the first to systematically adopt the "religious boycott," in reference to its Sunday parks, ball playing, excursions and transportation. Rockford is also the home of John Sweden, Sweinfurth, and although the two may have no visible or active the distinction is still the same color and section still they are of the same color and are other feathers from the same bird, or from birds of the same plumage, and show where the carcass is and which way the wind is blowing.

The persecution of Jews in Russia has, it is said, been somewhat relaxed. The decree for their expulsion from St. Petersburg has been indefinitely postponed, and measured orders have been sent to the press to refrain from publishing articles likely to excite animosity against the Hebrews. It is to be hoped that the Russian Government is beginning to sense the weight of to opinion throughout the civilized world. Certain it is that public opinion is an asset most tremendous power, but the letter from the South published in another column shows that it still has something to do in this country. Let us hope that it will speedily accomplish a good work not only in Russia but in the mountains of southeastern Tennessee.

\* A "v editorial" notes the *Independent*, "# 15," mention some facts in reference, is the National Reform Association which has Sabbath morning for denominations which ought to have a wide circulation and receive consideration wherever the upwards views of this Association and its first-born offshoot the Sabbath Union are taught. The *Independent* says:

As our readers know, there is a National Reform Association, whose object is to insure that total regard is stood in the Constitution of the United States, but it is not so well known now that Association, which has scores of distinguished names loosely attached to it and printed in its list of officers, organized in
