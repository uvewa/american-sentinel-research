James A. Bradley, President of the Board of Commissioners of Asbury Park, is in a quandary; he has issued orders for all business to be suspended on Sunday, and given explicit directions to the police to arrest all offenders. It has been pointed out to him that he rented his bath houses on that day, and has rendered himself liable to arrest under his own order. The Commissioner is now busily engaged in trying to dodge his own boomerang.

At Asbury Park suits have been instituted against W. W. Ward, Frederick Coleman, and Henry Williams, for selling cigars on Sunday, and the police acting under orders from the Board of Commissioners are keeping close watch upon all business places suspected of doing any Sunday selling. However much New Jersey may covet the distinction it can not hold first place in the attempted enforcement of religious laws; Arkansas, Tennessee, and Georgia are still in advance.
