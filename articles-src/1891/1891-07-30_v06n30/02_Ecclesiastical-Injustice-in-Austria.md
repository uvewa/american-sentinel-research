A RECENT case in Austria illustrates the beastly injustice of permitting ecclesiastics to mold the legislation of a country. In 1870 a Roman Catholic priest abandoned the Catholic faith and became an Evangelical. In 1879 he married and lived happily, but a year or two ago his marriage had to be legally tested, and it was pronounced invalid. He appealed, but now the highest court announces that the present state of legislation does not permit a man who has vowed celibacy to be freed from his vow. Austria is a good country not to live in.
