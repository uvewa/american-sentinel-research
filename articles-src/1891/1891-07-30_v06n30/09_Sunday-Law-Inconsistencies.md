[page 238] The following is an editorial article from the *Boston Daily Globe,* of recent date:—

"When governments purporting to be wholly secular attempt to legislate in behalf of morality those who are appointed to execute the law are frequently at all at a loss. The Legislature of this law has made a law prohibiting the playing of baseball on Sundays, but as it requires nine innings to constitute such a game, once of the courts has decided that the game can not be interfered with until the last inning is in progress. The law therefore proves to be ineffective.

"Rhode Island has no special law asserting particular games which are forbidden on Sunday, but many people have supposed that baseball must certainly fall within the scope of general Sunday law. A case, accordingly, at the present time, comes disposed at Rocky Point as to whether the law and order organizations want to Park of Kent County and demanded that he should suppress these Sunday games. He positively refused to do so, affirming that as between one accidental version and another it was not in his province to decide which was the more or less immoral, and that he had nothing to do with the decisions, and in regard to what the courts shall develop health and muscle, but provided the games every where convenient to be moral on any other day. His side not only provides within these limits was to keep the peace and preserve good order.

"The position of Sheriff Sprague is that there are no legal Sunday law games, and it is to base the exercising of authority, as seen in the various different conclusions to which the finely permitted is, against as which certain good people would have construed. He, therefore, has concluded that his baseball is not immoral on Monday it is not on Sunday. Until it can be shown, therefore, that it disturbs the peace of other people, that it interrupts the traffic of others and physically, he declines to interfere.

"As Sunday is a day set apart for rest, perhaps have a right to demand that it should not be disturbed by noisy and boisterous games. But as between diversions that are equally innocuous whether practiced on week days the legal or of prohibiting one and freely permitting the other seems logically doubtful."
