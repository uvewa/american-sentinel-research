REV. O. E. MURRAY, Pastor of the Wabash Avenue Methodist Church, Chicago, is earning a reputation as an enemy to all ecclesiastical interference in governmental affairs. Rev. Murray is the President of the National American Patriotic Union. This organization was recently formed for the purpose of maintaining and enforcing the American kita of complete Church and State divorcement. The attitude which the church of Rome maintains toward this principle no doubt gave birth to this organization, but that its president is trying to be consistent, is shown by his opposition to his church receiving appropriations from the Government to aid in maintaining their Indian mission schools.

Referring to the six thousand dollars that the Methodist Church receives from the Government in common with the Roman Catholic and other church organizations, Mr. Murray said, "The only stain which rests on the fair face of Methodism, that I know of, is the receiving of six thousand dollars from the Government to aid in carrying on her Indian mission schools." The speaker named four bishops who were opposed to receiving the appropriation, and promised that the church would very soon wash her garments of this iniquity. It is hoped that the eloquent young pastor will walk in the light to the extent of condemning laws compelling Sabbath observance.
