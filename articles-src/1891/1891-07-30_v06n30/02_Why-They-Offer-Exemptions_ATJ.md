[page 233] Last week we showed by the official record that the Sunday-law workers know full well, and Mrs. Bateham in particular, in a way that she can never forget, that the exemptions which they propose in their national Sunday-law scheme in favor of those who observe another day, will defeat any effective enforcement of Sunday. And yet that, therefore, in order to carry out their intent in the law, one of the earliest things that they will have to do is to secure the repeal of the exemption. Why is it, then, that in the face of the record, and in the face of their knowledge of the record, they still persist in offering the proposed exemption? It is "why" of this thing is well known, and it is well known to themselves. They know it, and we know it; and they know that we know it; and they know that we know that they know it; and not only is it so with us, but with many others. This is also a matter of official record. They were told it in the presence of the House Committee on the District of Columbia and a large audience besides, February 18, 1890, and here is the record of that part of the Sunday-law story:—

*Mr. Jones*:—I read from the bill the exemption that is proposed. This act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest.

Now why is that clause put in the bill? The intention of the law-maker in the law, is harmony. But can you find out why this was inserted, for we can know what the object of it is because in the past year Mr. Crafts has advertised all over this country from Boston to San Francisco, and back again, and has repeated it to this committee this morning, that the Seventh-day Adventists and the Seventh-day Baptists are the strongest opponents of Sunday laws; that they are doing more than all others combined to destroy respect for Sunday observance. All this, and yet these are the very persons whom he proposes to exempt from the provisions of the law, which is expressly to secure the "due observance of Sunday."

Why, then, does he propose to exempt these? Is it out of respect for them, or a desire to help them to their good work? Not much. It is hoped by this to check their opposition until Congress is committed to the legislation.

Then they admit this—"We know it by their own words. The lady who spoke here this morning as the representative of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Mrs. Catlin, said in this city, "We have given them an exemption clause, and that, we think, will take the wind out of their sails; will take the wind out of their opposition." Quietly legislative enactment does not need to be limited to political matters, such as this might take the wind out of these. But so far as the [page 234] actly what they want. I am not talking at random here. I have the proof of what I am saying. They expect a return for this exemption. It is not extended as a guaranteed right, but is a favor that the price of we will only pay then their Elliott here (Rev. George) condemns "the complete silence of the New Testament," so far as any explicit command for the page 235 sabbath, and declare ruin for their churches, are concerned." Many others speak to the same effect. Have we not as much right to tell this to the people as they have? They do not agree among themselves upon the obligation of Sabbathkeeping; nor upon the basis of Sunday keeping. In every case of their conventions three ones say one way and another in another and confiscate every way. Have we not as much right to disagree with them? Why is it, that they want to stop our speaking these things, unless it is that we tell the truth?

The tendency of legislative and executive officials who claim to keep a "Sabbath" is to over-balance rather than to use it.

And in the convention held in this city only about three weeks ago, January 5, Mr. Crafts said that this exemption "it guarantees a fault," and that "if there is any fault in the bill, it is in being too generous" to the Seventh-day Adventists and Seventh-day Baptists. But read.

For instance, the laws of Rhode Island allow the members, by special provision, to carry on public industries on the first day of the week in Hopkinton and Westerly, in each of which towns Seventh-day Baptists form a considerable element. This local option method of Sabbath legislation, generally adopted, would make not only each particular State, but each city or locality in the State a Sabbath-law unto its own. Without such privilege as at Westerly, without having to depend on Sabbath as at New York to the ever confusions and injury of innumerable commerce and events of local industry. Politically this form is determined by the social policy, the only constitutional security of free exercise. And this points to a compromise, one of the laws of one race in a kindred, whose religious convictions require them to rest on manifest relation works of a civil process much as the law of being to do on Saturday the things that are done on Sunday may be equal rather than have the decisions that to suffer by the working of these followed by the law that enforces Sunday.

And then, do they offer this "proposed exemption?" Why do they voluntarily do that which they themselves know places their possible constitutional near sensible S—It is exactly what I say. It is right.

Again I read, and here is the letter in proof I wish especially to the attention of the committee. It shows the thing indeed we shall pay for the exemption which they so overgenerous offer.

Instead of reciprocating the generosity shown towards seventh-day Christians expect a very large part of their energy in antagonism with Sunday observance, and the free distribution of tracts and papers, in order to antagonize each and the institution.

Exactly! That is the prize which we are expected to pay for the generous exemption. We are to stop the distribution of tracts and papers which antagonize Sunday laws. We are also spending our energy in opposition to their efforts to promote Sunday observance. We are to stop telling the people that the Bible says "the seventh day is the Sabbath," and that Sunday is not the Sabbath.

But have we not the right to teach the people that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," "even as the Bible says, and that only the keeping of that day is the keeping of the Sabbath according to the commandment?" Have we not the

right to do this? Have we not the right to tell this people that these are not rightful authority for keeping Sunday, the first day of the week? Why, some of these gentlemen themselves say that Mr. Elliott here (Rev. George) condemns "the complete silence of the New Testament," so far as any explicit command for the sabbath, declare ruin for their churches, are concerned." Many others speak to the same effect. Have we not as much right to tell this to the people as they have? They do not agree among themselves upon the obligation of Sabbathkeeping; nor upon the basis of Sunday keeping. In every case of their conventions three ones say one way and another in another and confiscate every way. Have we not as much right to disagree with them? Why is it, that they want to stop our speaking these things, unless it is that we tell the truth?

More than this, have we not the constitutional right to do it? We do. And it is also freely to distribute tracts and papers in opposition to Sunday laws and Sunday sacredness. Does not the Constitution declare that "the freedom of speech, or of the press," "shall not be abridged?" Then when these men propose that we shall not, is not that a motive for that exemption, they do propose an invasion of the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of speech and of the press. Why, gentlemen, this question of Sunday laws is a deal larger question than all this sect ever dreamed of.

Note by some that I am not drawing this point too fine, I wish to read a brief editorial from a doctor of divinity in California. With reference to this specific point:—

> Most of the States make provision for the ease of the peculiar tenets of belief which are entertained by the Adventists. They go worship Saturday, and call it the Sabbath if they choose. That is their privilege.

They, indeed, seem by this to be generous to us, but do you not see that we are already keeping the Sabbath to continue to do so while we live, but letter this privileges are not. We are not to be allowed to speak or distribute papers or tracts to find fault or objections to keep us, gentlemen of the committee, do you not see that they propose by this law to deprive us of all our rights both of conscience and of citizenship? Gentlemen, I have come to you to plead for protection. We do not ask you to protect us by legislation. We do not ask you to legislate in favor of Saturday—not even to the extent of an exemption clause. We ask you to protect us by refusing to give to these men their desired power to invade our rights. We appeal to you for protection in our constitutional rights as well as our rights of conscience.

"There let their privileges end!" If [page 235] there is this allowance in only constitutional

And the condition in the churches as the present day that laid down by Mr. Crafts, namely, that we shall stop every phase of opposition to Sunday observance. Here is this minister's own works, not spoken the least and heavy of debate, but deliberately written and printed as follows, in the Western Christian Union, March, 1890:—

Instead of thankfully making one of conscientious observers of the seventh day as an instrument upon their own occasions, or their own right, they have seized upon this as a weapon to defeat the purpose of their benefactors. None of us need go further than the Adventists to see and appreciate the fact, they say roll down opposition towards a measure of public welfare and that legislation embarrassing to them must be stopped.

There, gentlemen, you have it from the very man who proposes this exemption of that proposed exemption. I. It is intended to take the wind out of our sails—to take our opposition to their scheme as to Sunday observance in general.

All I do is not to "appreciate the generosity" by adopting an "opposition to their scheme as to Sunday observance, then legislation 'embarrassing'" to us we must be expected to resist.

Gentlemen, do you wonder that we ask for a respectful and merciful hearing, or respectably such generosity? If we can not have what we ask as Americans these can claim that we are entitled to all that, that however "embarrassing" that might be, we continue it; and we ask nothing further for ourselves, nor do we intend to reciprocate such generosity so that, in any way wish as a fetter upon our rights.

There is one more point on this point well worthy to be read. It turns out the whole matter in such a way as to be a rebuke to every Sunday-law advocate and marks. This is from Rev. M. A. Gault, of the American Sabbath Union, formerly Mr. A. Gault Union. Mr. Crafts, who is the American Sabbath Union, personally appeared his secretary of nearly all church of these hearings. Mr. Gaull wrote thus to Edson J. S. Washburn sent it to the SENTINEL, and Mr. Washburn sent it in. I read:—

There is one sentence that we have seen in the literature that Mr. Crafts says we do not say that Seventh-day Adventists should not stop distributing; and I am convinced that these men will do all but one, or else who proposes the Crafts to give us the law to stake and get the more important one for us.

Exactly! "There let it be this one of the stakes," and the exemption clause is one of the stakes, and that it is only to check our opposition—that it is only to check opposition until Congress is committed to the legislation, and that they may be taken up the easier.

"We must let it be this one of the 'stakes,'" and the exemption clause is one of the stakes of the clerical gentlemen who demand that the Government shall "set up the moral law and recognize it's authority's exhibit and then lay by hand on any religion that does not conform to it.

[page 235] dition of Congress. They trump up this District bill with the hope of getting those committed to the legislation with less difficulty than by the national bill, because the attention of the people is not so much turned to it. Then having by the District bill got Congress committed to such legislation, they intend to rally every influence to secure the passage of the national bill; and then they propose to go on insist by "wiping out" except that they have turned the Nation into a Government of God, with themselves as the repositories of his.

*Mr. Hoard*:—Is there any reference to that intent in that book from which you have been reading?

*Mr. Jones*:—No. I pasted it on the margin of this book merely for convenience of reference along with the "generous" proposition of his "Brother Crafts."

All this shows that the intent of the makers and promoters of this bill is to subvert the constitutional rights of the people. The intent of the law-maker in the law. As, therefore, by their own choice, the intent of this District Sunday clause is to stop all effort to teach or to persuade people to keep the Sabbath instead of Sunday as the intent of the body of the bill is to compel all to keep Sunday who do not keep the Sabbath, and as the intent of both together is to "scoop in all" and "make sure work," it follows certainly, and my proposition is demonstrated, that the promoters of the legislation do distinctly contemplate the taking away of the right to observe the Sabbath in this Nation, and to allow the keeping of Sunday only.
