One of the best evidences of a politically enlightened nation, of a people who appreciate their liberties, is that they are characterized by a jealous regard for the fundamental principles of liberty in their very widest application. Patrick Henry's memorable resolution in the Virginia Assembly in 1765, in opposition to the Stamp Act, asserting that the people of Virginia were not bound to obey any law enacted in disregard of their fundamental principles, will never be forgotten by the American people. It is a fundamental idea, lying at the very foundation of our American political system. It is no indication of high political development to object to governmentalism when it has gone so far as to destroy our property and endanger our lives; but it is an indication of high development when wrongs are opposed before oppression begins; when evils and abuses are nipped in the bud; when the tyrant (figuratively speaking) is handicapped while concocting his schemes.

John Fisk aptly states this idea in his work on the American Revolution, just published. Speaking of the State of the American mind during the revolutionary period, he says:—

> It is one signal characteristic of the progress of political civilization that the part played by sheer brute force in a barbarous age is fully equalled by the part played by the mere covert threat of injustice in a more advanced age. The effect which a blow in the face would produce upon a barbarian will be wrought upon a civilized man by an assertion of some far-reaching legal principle, which only in a subtle and ultimate analysis includes the possibility of a blow in the face.—Page 71.

This farsightedness, this understanding of the ultimate results of governmental acts (whether such results are direct or merely incidental) has been a characteristic of our greatest statesmen both in the Revolutionary and Secessionary periods. The great Lincoln in one of his earlier speeches emphasized the importance of maintaining American principles in all their integrity. In his speech on the "Great Southern Mail" contract, he said:

> I admit it [a claim for a few dollars] is very small; and if nothing else were involved, it would not be worth the dispute. But there is a principle involved. . . . If I had no apprehensions that the ghost of this yielding would rise and appear in various distant places, I would say, Pay the money and let us have no more fuss about it. But I have such apprehensions.—Barrett's Life and Speeches of Lincoln (1865), page 88.

It is the "ghosts" that the American people must look out for. In our modern religio-political agitations, it is not so much the actual harm that would be done by a tax for a small sectarian appropriation, not so much the possible evil of a few minutes being taken up in the morning in our schools for religious instruction, not so much the real hardship caused by the first comparatively mild form of Sunday law, as it is the reappearance of these violations of American principles in more numerous and more aggravated cases. It is not the material loss, but the danger to our liberties—more valuable than all the world beside—for which we must be on the constant lookout. It is hard for some people to understand this. If Sabbatarian Christians and Jews are not immediately thrown into prison as a result of Sunday legislation, Sunday advocates can not understand why they should oppose Sunday laws; or if a furor is not immediately caused by, and objection raised against public prayer in our free schools, some good intentioned people can not see why it is not all right to have public praying there (and this lack of perception is seen in some, too, who hold that it is wrong in principle, and should only be tolerated when no objection is made).

It was hard for the English Government in the Revolutionary period to see that it was their violations of principle, not the actual hardship imposed upon the Americans, that caused the war of independence. The Americans tried hard enough to impress that fact upon the British mind, but all in vain. In reference to the Stamp Act, John Fisk says:—

> It marks the inferiority of the mother country to the Colonies in political development, at that time, that the only solicitude as yet entertained by the British official mind, with regard to this measure, seems to have been concerned with the question how far the Americans would be willing to part with their money. With the Americans it was as far as possible from being a question of pounds, shillings, and pence; but this was by no means correctly understood in England.—American Revolution, page 16.

England thought to reconcile the Americans to the tax by reducing the price of tea. But the plan was a complete failure. What did the colonist care for a few paltry cents when a principle was in danger? So it is in our present struggles for the maintenance of American principles. Madison, one of the very men engaged in the cause of liberty at that time declared that the same stand must be taken, in our opposition to religious legislation. In urging the Virginians to oppose giving a cent of State money for the furtherance of religion he said:—

> It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of the noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other sects? that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute *three pence only* of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?

And it might be added: Who does not see that the same power that can deprive you of one day's time, can deprive you of your time altogether; or the same power that can confiscate what you earn on one day in the week, can confiscate what you earn on every day in the week? The laws now existing and proposed, to deprive a certain class of American citizens of one-seventh of their time (Sunday), or in case of violations of the law to deprive them of the wages earned on that day, are a direct assault at the very first principles of American liberty. And if these measures are left to go unchallenged, our free political system is endangered. Just so was the political system of England endangered in the last century. In order to properly present the American position on the Stamp Act to Parliament, "Pitt hastened from a sick bed to the House of Commons," says Fisk, "and delivered those speeches, in which he avowed that he rejoiced in the resistance of the Americans, and declared that, had they submitted tamely to the measures of Grenville, they would have shown themselves only fit to be slaves. He pointed out distinctly that the Americans were upholding those eternal principles of political justice which should be to all Englishmen most dear, and that a victory over the Colonies would be of ill-omen for English liberty, whether in the Old World or in the New. Beware, he said, how you persist in this ill-considered policy. 'In such a cause your success would be hazardous. America, if she fell, would fall like the strong man with his arms around the pillars of the Constitution.'

"There could be no sounder political philosophy than was contained in these burning sentences of Pitt. From all the history of the European world since the later days of the Roman Republic, there is no more important lesson to be learned than this—that it is impossible for a free people to govern a dependent people despotically without endangering its own freedom."—American Revolution, page 26.

The same danger is hidden behind the Sunday laws. If Sunday-keepers make an illegitimate use of the power delegated to the Government, by depriving Sabbatarians or agnostics of the free use of their time, that violation of liberty will endanger the security of all our liberty, and as a natural consequence, is likely to injure themselves. In fact, Sunday laws do in truth deprive every single individual in their jurisdiction of their full liberty. Mr. Justice Burnett points this out in his California decision declaring Sunday laws unconstitutional:—

> The fact that the Christian voluntarily keeps holy the first day of the week, does not authorize the Legislature to make that observance compulsory. The Legislature cannot compel the citizen to do that which the Constitution leaves him free to do or omit, at his election. The act violates as much the religious freedom of the Christian as of the law. Because the conscientious views of the Christian compel him to keep Sunday as a Sabbath, he has the right to object, when the Legislature invades his freedom of religious worship, and assumes the power to compel him to do that which he has the right to equit if he pleases. The principle is the same, whether the act of the Legislature compels us to do that which we wish to do or not to do. The compulsory power does not exist in either case.

These are some of the reasons why Sabbatarians are so much alive to the dangers of the present religio-political agitations. These are some of the reasons why they oppose a Sunday law just as earnestly and just as faithfully when it has a clause exempting them as when it does not. A law with a clause exempting them would not hurt them personally, but it is just as much a violation of American principles, and therefore calls forth all their power in defense of our established institutions.
