The Sunset Club, of Chicago, an organization of professional, business, and literary men, which dines every Thursday evening at the Grand Pacific Hotel, and regularly serves at its banquets a final course of wit, reason, and eloquence, took as the subject for discussion in its meeting of Thursday, October 22, the question of "Sunday at the World's Fair." The Chicago Tribune reports Judge McConnell as presenting substantially the following argument:—

The principal difficulty which has embarrassed me in the consideration of this question has been to divest myself of purely personal views. I thoroughly recognize that because I do certain things on Sunday I should not immediately conclude that everybody else ought to do the same thing. Or that, if I want to attend the Exposition on that day, my desire, in itself, ought not in any manner to influence me in determining what I ought to advocate as the proper policy for the managers of the Exposition to adopt.

I hope I have succeeded in getting rid of the purely personal bias I have in the premises. While engaged in this struggle with myself, the thought has occasionally occurred to me that perhaps the advocates of Sunday closing might also be considering the proposition through minds largely affected by their personal practices and beliefs.

I take it for granted that we must determine this question on much broader grounds than ought to be proposed by a man who is always willing to do anything Sunday not wrong Monday or Tuesday; or that might be urged by another who believed that Sunday he ought to go to church in the morning and remain grave and quiet during the afternoon and evening.

The broad question is: Shall all the citizens of Chicago, and all the visitors within our gates during the six months of the Exposition, no matter what they believe about Sunday, be obliged to submit to what a portion of us think our religious duty that day requires us not to do? In other words, Shall that great enterprise, designed for instruction and delight, be closed one day in seven to the thousands who might that day, perhaps on no other, avail themselves of all the treasures of profit and entertainment afforded by the Exposition, because a good many other people think it wrong to open the gates Sunday?

Is it not the same old fight which has been waged so long in the world—the fight to make one set of men think, or at least do, as another set of men think they ought to think or do? Is there any room in the world for a question of that kind any longer? Have we not grown so much that it seems strange that such a question is even debatable? Is not the controversy in the main a religious one? And might we not just as well be discussing whether some of us should be made to go to some particular church as to be discussing whether some of us should be prevented from doing Sunday something that some others think they ought not to do Sunday?

It is a religious question, and I think we are beyond using coercive measures in making conversions to our religious beliefs, or even enforcing the observance of matters which are a part of our religious beliefs.

I picked up, however, a few days ago, the resolutions adopted by the Methodist Ecumenical Council, recently in session at Washington, against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. In the main these resolutions proceed on the theory that, as the members of this Council believe in Sunday keeping, therefore the Exposition should be closed on Sunday, even as against those who are entirely convinced that they have a right to attend the Exposition that day.

It is true the resolutions go a little further, and charge that the attempt to keep the Fair open Sunday is a mercenary scheme, and would benefit the stockholders only. That part of the resolutions, however, I do not consider as involved in the present discussion.

I think the resolutions fairly confirm what I said—that the question is a religious one, with most of those who advocate Sunday closing; and, as I intimated before, I think the world too wise and too tolerant now to make me and others refrain from doing what the Ecumenical Council of the Methodists think I ought not to do. In brief, I do not think that question debatable in 1891. I do not suppose that any employee will be overworked because of the Sunday opening; and I feel certain that any one of them desiring to devote the day or any part of it to worship will be accorded an opportunity to do so.

If the Fair prove as much of a success as its projectors anticipate, we shall have in Chicago, every Sunday of the six months from May to November, from 100,000 to 300,000 visitors. What will you do with them? The churches will not accommodate or attract them. Will the day be better observed by having them thrown on their own resources, in a strange city, to find such entertainment as they can? I could predict, I believe, with absolute certainty, that there would be less of the worshipful spirit in that crowd, surging through the city, than if it were allowed to find its way to the Exposition grounds.

I believe if the problem were alone confined to the question, What shall we do with our visitors Sunday, so as in the least to disturb the ordinary occupations of that day? the answer would necessarily be that they should be sent to the Fair. There they could innocently spend the day studying and learning the lessons afforded by the exhibits.

I am inclined to look at the whole matter from a practical point of view, and I trust the Exposition managers will consider it in no other way.

I ask that the Exposition be open on Sunday, for the benefit of all; but principally for those tired men who work eight and ten hours of every week-day, and who, with the slender margin of savings that always stands between them and want, can hardly afford to sacrifice any weekday for recreation or instruction. Of all our citizens, they need to see this great exhibition of the results of labor. Many men working in the narrow lines, in the smoke and turmoil and noise of the factories, are seldom enabled to see the achievements of united labor. They work and sweat, and sometimes wonder for what, perhaps feeling that merely to live after so much work, is not much of an achievement. They fail to appreciate their relation and their usefulness to the rest of the world. But here, on this blessed Sunday, for such it shall be, the workman shall come, with his wife and children, and he shall feel great and they proud when they view what he, with other men, can create. Perhaps, too, he can get there, better than from sermons which he does not go to hear, the high philosophy that shall reconcile him to his hard labor and his lowly lot.

I can easily believe that true religion itself will be helped by the lessons of the exhibits, and that the men employed at the Exposition Sunday may truly feel that they are performing a sacred and religious duty.
