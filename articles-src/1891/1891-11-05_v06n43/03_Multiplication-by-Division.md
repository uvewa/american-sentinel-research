The division in the American Sabbath Union has resulted in increasing and distributing the work of the organization and materially aiding its progress. The Sabbath Union, under the leadership of Col. Elliott F. Shepard and Rev. J. H. Knowles, with The American Sabbath as its official organ, devotes itself more particularly to the sentiment and theory of Sunday laws and their enforcement, from the point of view rather of an aristocratic estheticism and dilettanteism of religion, while Rev. W. F. Crafts, with his organ, Sabbath Reform, is devoting himself to the practical business of organizing Law and Order Leagues; Sabbath Committees; Sabbath Associations, local, State and National; and Rest Day leagues, in which a secret inquisition is instituted by direction of their Constitution, in which the secretary is instructed to "appoint an investigating committee of four or more known only to themselves, some of whom on each Sabbath shall, by personal observation, ascertain what violations of the law of the State and humanity are in progress, and report fully in writing to the secretary, as a basis of reports from him to the board, to guide its work, and to the public by the press and platform, and to civil officers as an urgent incentive to fidelity on their part."

Thus Mr. Crafts is taking active measures to utilize that "sword of the law" which he has boasted is ready sharpened and with hilt turned to his grasp. The evidence of this has already been seen in some southern cities, especially in Atlanta, where Judge Maddox has found it necessary to instruct the Grand Jury that they are the only "Law and Order League" necessary or proper in an organized American municipality. But the organization of these associations which will eventually become religious Ku Klux and White Cappers, goes steadily on and when the time comes they will be ready to be the unseen hand to do the will of the Sabbath Union, which, itself, is too exalted in intellect, wealth and social position, and of too high an order of ideality, to carry out its decrees with its own hand or even look at the logical results of its teachings.

Some members of the National Reform Association feel that this organization, also, should be doubled in its activity and effectiveness by the same process of division which has taken place in the Sabbath Union. Interesting testimony to this fact may be found in the following article to the United Presbyterian from a Pittsburg correspondent:—

"A number of the subscribers of the United Presbyterian have been for years members of and contributors to the National Reform Association. In not a few homes can be seen, neatly framed, hanging on the wall, certificates of life membership. For a long time some have felt that the movement was conducted on too narrow a scale. The whole management was entrusted to a few persons, and these, with a few exceptions, members of the Covenanter Church. The recent troubles in the Reformed Presbyterian Church have completely alienated some of the best friends of the reform. The New York Independent, in a late issue, called attention to the fact that the managers of it, those who control its policy and expend its funds, were the leaders in the prosecution of the ministers in the trials last spring in this city, and also that National Reform as at present conducted was simply a disguised effort to carry out the views of the Covenanters. Outside of that body, not many persons are willing to accept the latter or to be led in any reform by Messrs. McAllister, Wilson, and George.

"Now it is a pity that what is commendable in the National Reform platform should be overlooked. A prominent Methodist brother remarked a short time ago that he was absolutely sure that any movement wisely inaugurated and conducted, based upon the fact that this is a Christian Nation, and intended to preserve its Christian features and give clearer expression wherever needed, would receive the hearty indorsement of that church. There is scarcely a doubt it would meet with the approval of four-fifths of the Christian people of this land. Why cannot this be done? Who will take the initiative? Cannot a few of our influential citizens, representing different denominations, be called together and inaugurate such a movement? Now is the time to act.

"National Reform as conducted now is something very different. It is based upon the theory that this is a Christless and Godless Nation. The conclusion is, Do not recognize it, testify against it, stand aloof from it, till this feature is removed. No wonder that only Covenanters can engage in it. Conducted on a broader platform all could unite in its advocacy, and untold good would result."
