THE Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Pennsylvania, reported at the State Convention of the Union, lately held at Bradford, Pa., that thirty-nine counties of the State were organized for "Sabbath observance," with County Superintendents; that 96,933 pages of literature had been distributed; 200 sermons had been preached by request, on the subject; 26 special prayer meetings had been held; 38 public meetings; 7 Bible readings given; 11 articles furnished by Superintendents for local papers; 8,549 signatures obtained to petition for closing the World's Fair,—by the endorsement, through formal vote, of fifteen churches and the assistance of twenty-five churches in the circulation of the petition for signature; and at the request of the Department thirty business men had written letters to the World's Fair Commissioners protesting against the opening of the Exposition on Sunday.

A Bible reading in support of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair or teaching the legal enforcement of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, or in favor of civil laws compelling obedience to the commandment "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," would be an anomaly indeed. It is not at all surprising that no more than seven of them were given.
