SAM JONES and Sam Small have organized a Law and Order League in Rome, Georgia, the purpose of which is to secure the legal and moral renovation of that city. This gratuitous interference by the evangelists and their friends with the regular course of legal procedure has met with a well-merited rebuke from the Circuit Judge. At the next session of the court after the establishment of this extra-judicial organization, Judge Maddox charged the Grand Jury, saying:—

> It has been charged by two ministers of the gospel that certain specific crimes were openly committed here; and, as a consequence, a law and order club has been organized. So long as this court exists there is no need of such a club. You, gentlemen of the Grand Jury, are the only law and order club necessary.

This is the first time that these Law and Order Leagues which are being organized, not only throughout the United States, but throughout the world, as active aids to the Sunday Union Societies, have met with the slightest criticism. There will be an awakening before long to the fact that there is throughout the world, in the International Law and Order League, a strong and systematic organization, ready to be the right hand and swing the sword for the International Federation of Lord's Day Societies.
