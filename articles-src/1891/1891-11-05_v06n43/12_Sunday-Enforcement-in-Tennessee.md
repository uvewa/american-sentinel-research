## Sunday Enforcement in Tennessee.

THE following is from Richmond, Tenn.— The jury in the case of Mr. John Todd, Justice of the Peace, charged with selling a bottle of Paisley water on Sunday, brought in a verdict of guilty and fined him twenty dollars with costs of the case. The case excited quite a great deal of interest, and the defense did their very best to assist justice. Mr. Todd was the very first man fined for the Sunday law in Richmond, and is the third conviction. He was fined twenty dollars for selling a pint of whisky and a bottle of soda water on Sunday.

It is difficult to understand that such a prophecy, an idea, refers to indications in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and still more that it arrives in conversations in the United States, where it has long been supposed that it was not the business of the State to enforce religious observances, that long sacred that this is not the twelfth century; and Texas is in the Union States, the paragraph next succeeding the foregoing one gives a fair illustration that the spirit of religious liberty is dead and that there is a movement in progress to establish church authority a supremacy over the State.
