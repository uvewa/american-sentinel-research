There is great dissatisfaction in the minds of those who have charge of the petitioning for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair at the failure to roll up a monster petition in that behalf, and they do not hesitate to openly express their chagrin.

Of the Sunday Leagues and other Sunday societies, which Mr. Crafts has recently fathered, not more than one in twenty-five have sent in their petitions,—and the Sabbath Union officers are saying, "there has been a wonderful failure to send in petitions. Where lies the difficulty?"

The difficulty is not far to see. There is no sound principle expressed in the demands of the Sabbath Union and their kindred, and self-interest and prejudice have not yet been sufficiently appealed to, and aroused, to obtain any overwhelming expression in their favor.
