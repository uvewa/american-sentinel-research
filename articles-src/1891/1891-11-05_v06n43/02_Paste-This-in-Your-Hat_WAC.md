REFERRING to that part of Judge Hammond's decision in the King case in which it is stated that "malice, religious or otherwise, may dictate a prosecution," and if man has by law set Sunday apart for rest, "it must be obeyed as man's law if not as God's law," the Michigan Christian Advocate, of August 22, 1891, says:—

> We respectfully advise our Adventist friends in Michigan, especially those who are unusually noisy on Sunday, to paste the above statement in some conspicuous place where they can see it often. The Sabbath law must be obeyed. People are free to proclaim doctrine in opposition to law, and thereby seek to have the law repealed, but while the law stands it must be respected and obeyed. The Michigan law does not compel any one to observe Sunday as the Sabbath, but it does restrain them from interfering with others who wish to observe it. No more disturbance of Sunday worship, if you please.

We would suggest to all who think the spirit of religious bigotry and intolerance dead in this country, that they cut out and paste the above statement of the Methodist Michigan Christian Advocate in some conspicuous place. The editor of the Advocate knows that it needs no Sunday law to restrain Adventists, or anybody else from disturbing worshipers on Sunday, any more than it needs a Thursday night law to restrain the like when prayer-meetings are generally held. And further, this editor knows, if he knows anything about the matter, that neither Mr. King nor any of his Adventist friends in Michigan have been guilty, knowingly at least, of disturbing any Sunday worship with their noise. They are not noted for being a noisy people, and plowing corn is by no means the noisiest kind of work. We have known of whole neighborhoods being disturbed by "shouting Methodists," and no prosecution being instituted over it either. It is not the noise made by Adventists that is disturbing the editor of the Michigan Christian Advocate and his colleagues, but their observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath instead of the first, which Methodists say is the Sabbath. Their attempts at enforcing Sunday laws upon the observers of the seventh day is simply an effort to close the mouths of the latter from saying that which the Lord himself has said, that "the seventh day is the Sabbath." Many a battle has been fought out on this line in the past, but the invariable rule has been that though the persecuted were sawn in sunder, their works followed them, their words echoed round the world, and their persecutors were found in the end to be in error, though in killing them they may have thought they were doing God service. Reader! the rule still holds good.
