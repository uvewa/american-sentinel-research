SPEAKING of the observers of the first and seventh days of the week, Mr. W. F. Crafts says:—

> The fourth commandment can be observed by keeping either day, but society cannot wisely encourage or protect but one of them.—Watertown (S. D.) Public Opinion, July 28, 1890.

Observations: 1. Let it not be forgotten that this apostle of Sunday laws admits that these who keep the seventh day obey the fourth commandment. He can never consistently charge them with violating God's law in this respect.

2. Society can afford to encourage and protect the inalienable rights of the people composing it, one of which is the right of the individual to observe any day as the Sabbath he may choose, and to labor on every other day. It cannot afford to trample upon one such right in one of its members. As is stated in the Bill of Rights in Kentucky, "absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty, and property of free men exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority."

3. It is not some day, or other religious rite or ceremony, that needs the encouragement and protection of the Government, but the people. Civil governments were not instituted to protect religious rites and ceremonies, but to guard men and women in the exercise of their rights, and to protect them from the wicked and ambitious designs of those who in their thirst for position, or craving for power, would lord it over the souls and bodies of men.
