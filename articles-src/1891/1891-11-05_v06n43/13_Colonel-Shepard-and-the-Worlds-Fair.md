## Colonel Shepard and the World's Fair.

COLONEL SHEPARD made the solemn prophecy that unless some great World's Columbian Exposition is close on Sunday Fair that unless one great Exposition is closed on Sunday, Chicago will be visited with long-continued earthquakes, great floods, cyclones, and grasshoppers. Had it in placed of this prediction, suggested a scale of notes, during the Fair, it at the American Hotel. Perhaps, if the putting of things together, the problem would loop up about this; the Colonel must be daze on this point; for with him we would not have the ecclesiastical work, as proceedings in the Dark Ages. But lest anyone think that Col. Shepard thinks the Chicago Adulterous storm and earthquakes will be the result of the Fair being opened, he will view the majesty of the awful storm as an indication of what may come. In answer to the question, something in which he has but every fiveminute at that. One thing we believe as may be a more answer that the World's Fair will actually be closed on Sundays. It is an and intended to be no countenance toward this remarkable.
