The Christian Union deplores the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Virginia, that the law of that State forbidding the running of railroad trains on Sunday is unconstitutional because it interferes with interstate commerce. It says:—

> If the Federal Supreme Court sustains this decision, then those States which are most advanced in the matter of restricting Sunday labor on railroads have their hands tied, not only until a majority of the States are bent upon like restrictions, but until public sentiment in them is so great that a majority of both houses of Congress shall be compelled to act in accordance with that sentiment, instead of in accordance with the interests of the railroad corporations.

It is thus that a question, which only a few years ago was purely local, has now become one of the very foremost national questions.
