THE AMERICAN SABBATH thus summarizes the progress of "National Reform" in foreign countries during the last five years:—

Austria.—A Labor Law protects women and minors from Sunday work, and makes the fiat of a Minister of the Government necessary for any manufacturing operations on the day of rest. Postal deliveries are now limited to one. Sunday evening and Monday morning newspapers are prohibited, because of the Sunday work necessary for their production. Many shops are now closed.

Belgium.—A Labor Law has been passed to diminish Sunday work in factories. Work on the State railways has been very greatly reduced. The influence of the Protestant congregations has secured Sunday rest largely in iron, coal, and glass industries.

Denmark.—A Sunday rest Law has been passed. Shops are closed at 9 a. M. for the day. Factories and workshops may not work between 9 a. M. and midnight. All employes have at least alternate Sundays off. Postal work is limited to one delivery. Transcar work is considerably lessened.

France.—The work of the French League for Sunday rest, which was founded at the International Paris Congress of 1889, has spread with great rapidity in many parts of the country. The closing of shops becomes more and more common. Railway, goods, and parcels offices have been closed at 10 a. M. or at noon, instead of at later hours. In the annual meeting of six railway companies further installments of rest have been demanded, and in some cases secured. A Labor Law has passed, securing one day's rest in seven, but the Lord's day is not necessarily the day for rest.

Germany.—A Labor Law protecting the Lord's day has been passed. The second delivery of letters has been suppressed throughout the whole Empire. Goods traffic is limited. Shops are now closed largely in Berlin and other cities and towns, and none may remain open more than five hours. Work is prohibited in mines, quarries, salt-pits, collieries, foundries, timber-yards, tile-yards, and factories of all kinds. Sunday race-meetings have incurred the displeasure of the Emperor, and are dying out.

Holland.—One of the most influential newspapers has closed its offices on Sunday, in agreement with the general movement for Sunday rest. Goods trains do not run, and parcels and goods are delivered only early in the morning. A law has been passed securing rest for women and minors in factories and workshops.

Hungary.—A law has been passed, generally the same as for Austria, both making the rest longer, i.e., from 6 P. M. on Saturday till midnight on Sunday.

Norway.—The hitherto unbroken toll on tramways has been reduced, and a larger proportion of men rest. Labor in factories and workshops is greatly diminished, and women and children are protected.

Russia.—Here no marked progress has been made, but from all parts of the Empire petitions have been addressed to the Holy Synod, asking for the closing of all shops and factories on Sunday.

Sweden.—Movements here are of the same kind as in Norway and Denmark. Count A. Moltke, from Copenhagen, makes the same hopeful reports for the three countries.

Switzerland comes last only alphabetically, for in actual progress this country is well to the front, as indeed it should be, for it is the headquarters of the Lord's Day Federation, has enjoyed the services and support of the great-hearted Alexander Lombard, and is now served by noble Christians such as Pastor Roehrich, Pastor Ehni, Count St. Georges, and the steadfast and faithful Monsieur Delux. By a law which came into force Dec. 1st, 1890, "Every servant of railway, steamer, tramway, and other locomotive companies, and the employes of the post-office, will have fifty-two days of rest in the year, of which seventeen must be Sundays. The day's work cannot be lengthened merely by the will of the employer, and in no case may exceed twelve hours, and at least one hour's rest must divide the work. No wage is to be deducted for the rest-day. Any breach of the law is to be visited with a penalty of from fr. 500 to fr. 1000.

This law is supplementary to others which secure to the workmen in factories, mills, and workshops, their complete liberty on the Lord's day, except in certain cases, for which the authorization of the Federal Council is needed, and even then one Sunday in two must be free.

A railway is in course of construction, which connects Yverdon and St. Croix, in the Canton Vaud, which by its Constitution is to be free from all Sunday traffic for at least twenty-five years. To obtain this privilege the promoters have cheerfully sacrificed all the money subventions to which they had a claim from the various parishes, the Canton, and the State.
