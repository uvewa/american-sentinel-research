## A Prototype.

THERE seems to be almost no way of estimating the amount and the power of colonial Massachusetts, and the colonial and State of National Reform.

National Reform admit and all its activities in this present, as well as in its past the prospect, was indeed a colonial Massachusetts in exactly every detail. Ridpath says:—

"At a session of the General Court of the Colony in 1631, it was voted restricting the right of suffrage. It was enacted that none but church members should be admitted to vote at the colonial elections."

And further: "National Reformers admit and claim that all dissenters aside from the three classes, 'Jews, infidels and atheists.' They say, according to the statement of Mr. Coleman, are working to secure an amendment to the Constitution that will in effect disfranchise all who may 'logically be classed' 'differ with them.'"

Ridpath further adds—"Taxes were levied for the support of the gospel."

A Baptist writer, speaking of the town of Ashfield, Mass., in 1763, says:—

> The General Court passed a new law granting the parishes the privilege of taxing all the estates of the town, including those of the Baptists, for the house, and if they refused, power was granted to sell their estates.—*Hovey's Life and Times of Isaac Backus*, pp. 167, 168.

We sent a petition to the General Court to be eased from the tax. We represented our case, as well as we could. We presented our petition for relief of a tax of £60 which had been raised for a minister of the town, and we proved that persons had sold our land to make it all good.

They recommend selling our land to make it all satisfy.

What do National Reformers say? I distinctly recall Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster in defining the duties of a nation according to their views, mentions the following:—

"By providing (we cite the church) funds from the public treasury for carrying on its agencies at home as in the foreign field."

Six years ago, a citizen of Washington County, Pennsylvania,—a stronghold of the National Reform,—told us that a short time before he fell in company with some ministers that were on their way to attend a convention, and one of their number stated that he was looking forward to the time when those who "refused their salaries from the treasury, the same as Government officials."

When their desires are fulfilled, when they have influenced the Government, by force in their behalf, if they also should demand, in the name of the national religion they would have their property sold to satisfy the demands of the members of the law, requiring taxation in their behalf?

Ridpath further says:—"None but church members were citizens." Of the subject, Dr. F. Morse says the reigning Mediator requires of the nation—"A constitutional provision of moral and religious qualifications for their offices."

To require a "religious qualification" for an official would tend to congregate the charmed class. The State, having politicians about these men, and not actuated by selfish motives would join the Church, and then the Church would be heavily laden with hypocrisy, and nothing can be more effective in corrupting a State than a corrupt Church wedded to the State.

Dr. Adam Clarke says—"When political matters are brought into the Church both are ruined. The Church has more than once ruined the State, the State has often corrupted the Church."

What was in force in Massachusetts in the days when they destroyed witches, hung Quakers, banished Baptists and sold their property to pay the priest, and this is the demand of National Reformers today.

E. T. RUSSELL.
