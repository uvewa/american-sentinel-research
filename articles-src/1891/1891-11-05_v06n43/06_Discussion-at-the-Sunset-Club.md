## Discussion at the Sunset Club.

THE Sunset Club, of Chicago, an organization of professional, business, and literary men, which dines every Thursday evening at the Grand Pacific Hotel, and regularly serves at its banquets a feast course of wit, reason, and eloquence, took up the subject for deliberation in its meeting of Thursday, October 22, the question of "Sunday at the World's Fair." The *Tribune* Professor reports Judge McDonald as presenting substantially the following views:

The principal difficulty which has embarrassed me in the consideration of this question has been to divest myself of certain personal views. I thoroughly recognize them because I do certainly think on Sunday it should be our main unsearchable duty, that everybody else ought to do the same. Or that, if I want to attend the Exposition on that day, no other, by its nature, ought not in any manner to influence me in determining what I would do to serve as at the proper place for the managers of the Exposition to adopt.

I hope I have succeeded in getting out of the purely personal idea I have in the premises. While engaged in this struggle with myself, the thought has frequently occurred to me that perhaps the advantages of Sunday closing might also be considered, in the proposition, through single minds largely affected by their personal practices and prepossessions.

I take it for granted that we the most determined of us, discussions on main trunk lines, are compelled to agree that no man greater than ought to be proposed by a man who is always willing to do anything, Sunday not wrong Monday or Tuesday; so that to be equal in its might equal through much in the morning and remain given and quiet during the afternoons and evenings.

The broad question is: Shall all the citizens of Chicago, and all the visitors who come during the fair as guests of the Exposition, no matter what they believe in to a certain point, no matter what has to a portion of it as think our religious shall say it requires our rest to be it not so? In other words, Shall that great enterprise, designed for amusement and delight, be one day in seven, to the thousands who might that day, perhaps no to other, having availed of all the treasures and cost of entertainment afforded by the Exposition, because a good many other people think it wrong to open the gates certainly?

It is not the same old fight which has been raging as long as the world's old fight to make one set of men think, or at least, to ascertain or not men think they ought to think or do? Is there any force in the world for a question of that kind any longer? Have we not grown so much broader than our forefathers that the idea is even debatable? Is not the controversy in the main a religious one? And might we not just as well be discussing whether some of us should be made to go to some particular church every Sunday? If such a wonder some of us should be prevented from doing Sunday something that some others think they ought not to do Sundays?

It is a religious question, and I think we are beyond using coercive measures in making concessions to our religious beliefs, or even enforcing the observance of our religion with your religion of our religious beliefs.

I also know, however, a few days ago, the resolutions adopted by the Methodist Ecumenical Council, recently in session at Washington, against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. In the main these resolutions are proper enough in order that, as the members of this Council be convinced they themselves therefore the Exposition should be closed on Sunday, in the right, as agreed them, as are well and fully convinced that they have a right to attend the Exposition that day.

If the resolutions go a little further, and charge that the directors to keep the Fair open find open is a monstrous scheme, and would benefit the stockholders only. That part of the resolutions, however, I do not consider as involved in the broad question I would discuss.

I think the resolutions fairly describe two classes of persons, and divide the issues one, with most and who hold that Sunday closing, and, and I intimate between the full, that the world now we told and not tolerant too to make the one set the other determinant to do anything, and in doing that what the Ecumenical Council of the Methodists think I ought to, to their belief, if not I do not think that question debatable in 1891. I do not suppose that anybody in the land would close the doors of the Exposition because of the Sunday feeling that I and others of my class may have of that institution.

I think the day or any part of its closing day or any part of it or any closing day shall be accorded an opportunity to rest.

If the Fair proves as much of a success as its projectors, we should have a visit to Chicago, every Sunday of the six months from May to November of from 10,000 to 500,000 visitors. The Commercial element of the visitors will far outnumber those attracted to attend either. Will these people stand being cheated by having their time, on their own resources, in a strange city, at their own expense, all on account of or partly on account of some feeling of others?

I probably most, I believe, with all other certainly, all this, there would be less of the worshipful in that crowd, surging through the city, than if it were allowed to its way by the Exposition grounds.

If the problems of the problem were alone confined to the question, What shall we do with our restless Sunday, so as is the least to disturb the ordinary occupations of that day? there would be no great difficulty why they should be sent to the Fair. There they could innocently spend the day studying and learning the lessons afforded by the exhibits.

I am inclined to look at the whole matter from a practical point of view, and I trust the Exposition managers will consider it in no other way.

I ask that the Exposition be open on Sunday, for the benefit of all, but principally for those tired men who work eight and ten hours of every week-day, and who, with the slender margin of savings that always stands between them and want, may not have an opportunity besides any working day for recreation or instruction. Of all our citizens, they need to see this great exhibition of the results of labor. Many men working in the narrow lines, in the smoke and turmoil and noise of the factories, are seldom enabled to see the achievements of united labor. They work and sweat, and sometimes wonder for what, perhaps feeling that merely to live and eat so much every day is not much of an achievement. They fail to appreciate their relations and their usefulness to the rest of the world. But here, on this one Sunday, for such it shall be, the workman shall come, with his wife and children, and he shall feel great and shall feel more than they know what he, with all other men, can create. Perhaps, too, he can get there, better than from any religion which he does not go to hear, the high philosophy that shall reconcile him to the necessity of struggle and him and his life.

I am but lowly of the belief that the industrial side will be helped by the lessons of the exhibits, and that the men employed at the Exposition Sunday may truly feel that they are performing a sacred and religious duty.

should also be made to understand that the atrocious code of blue laws and cruel and outrageous repute of Cotton Mather, are inapplicable to this age.

Sunday is strictly a religious institution, and cannot the rightfully enforced as to persons having no respect for it as a holy day. The Roman Catholic Church has the same legal right to enforce attendance from natal setting on Friday, as have Protestant Christians to enforce observance of Sunday.—*Ex-Senator Warren.*
