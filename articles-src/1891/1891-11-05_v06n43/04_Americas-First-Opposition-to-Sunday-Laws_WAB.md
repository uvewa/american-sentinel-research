HARDLY had the liberty-loving Anglo-Saxons stepped their feet on the American shores and made a home in the wilds of New England, before the irrepressible spirit of liberty which has ever been a characteristic of these peoples, was destined to raise its voice in opposition to the Church-and-State Sunday laws which have descended to us from the Dark Ages. The pilgrim fathers landed in 1620; and before a score of years had passed the rightfulness of Sunday laws was one of the leading questions of debate in America. Roger Williams, who has justly been styled "the first American," was the champion against Sunday laws, and the Puritan clergy and Government were their defenders. "Roger Williams," says Bancroft, "was the first person in modern Christendom to assert in its plenitude the doctrine of the liberty of conscience, the equality of opinions before the law."

"A few weeks after his arrival" (February 5, 1631), says his biographer, "Mr. Williams was invited by the church at Salem to become assistant to their pastor, the Reverend Mr. Skelton; but the magistrates of the Colony had heard of his opinions, and immediately interposed their remonstrances with the people of Salem to prevent his settlement." One reason of this interference on the part of the authorities, as alleged in the letter, which they addressed to the church at Salem, was that he "had declared his opinion that the magistrate might not punish a breach of the Sabbath, nor any other offense that was a breach of the first table." (See Winthrop, 1, 52, where he makes such record in his journal of April 12, 1631.)

This charge, it will be seen, relates to his declaration of the great doctrine, to the vindication and elucidation of which he was to devote his life. "His doctrine," continues his biographer, "was in direct conflict with both the opinions and the practices of the Colony of Massachusetts, whose counselors and elders considered themselves the appointed guardians of the orthodoxy of the people; and in that age they could conceive of no other mode of executing their trust, than by inflicting civil penalties upon every one who ventured to dissent even in the most unimportant particulars from the prevailing faith.

"The opinion of Roger Williams, which was then urged in proof of his unsuitableness to become a minister of the gospel, has long since become the common sentiment of the American people." —William Gammell, in Sparks's Library of American Biography.

Four years later (summoned to appear before the General Court May 10, 1635) in the charges which were the groundwork of his final trial and banishment, the charge of 1631 was repeated, and given first place in order, being thus recorded by Governor Winthrop:—

> It was laid to his [Williams's] charge that, being under question before the magistracy and churches for divers dangerous opinions, viz.: (1) That the magistrate ought not to punish the breach of the first table, otherwise than in such cases as did disturb the civil peace. . . . Much debate was about these things. The said opinions were adjudged by all, magistrates and ministers (who were desired to be present), to be erroneous and very dangerous, and the calling of him to office at that time [while under general condemnation for these alleged errors] was adjudged a great contempt for authority."—Winthrop, vol. 1, page 162.

Williams thus exhibited his persistence, and showed how deep-rooted were his "sublime principles," as Bancroft designates them.

It was fortunate for the anti-Sunday-law cause—the cause of liberty—that it had such a man as Roger Williams to lead out in the agitation for religious freedom. He was a noble man; a minister "lovely in his carriage," "godly and zealous, having precious gifts"—expressions of Winslow and Winthrop; gentle, temperate, and forbearing; beloved by all—even by those with whom he was in constant antagonism, who could but admire his patience and magnanimity; he was logical and scholarly; an intense lover of liberty; a student of law, tutored by Coke, that "strenuous asserter of liberty on the principles of ancient laws;"—on the whole, being a man wonderfully qualified for the work before him.

Although written in no especially friendly spirit, Mr. Ellis in the "Puritan Age," thus describes the character of Williams:—

> Alike for the noble qualities and for the petty infirmities singularly blended with them, he is to us an admirable and a picturesquely engaging person. He was wholly free of guile, open, sincere, and of a most generous disposition, with traits of a childlike simplicity and tenderness. The resolute front which he presented to those who opposed him in his opinions or his actions had in it nothing of ugliness or perversity. He was forbearing and magnanimous. . . . Though all the powers of State and Church were engaged against him in Massachusetts, with many fretting altercations and the final infliction—yet not without forbearance on the part of the authorities—Williams never had there a single personal enemy." —Ellis's Puritan Age and Rule in the Colony of Massachusetts Rep. Page 263.

The intensity of Williams's feelings, the clearness of his views, the boldness of his actions, and the logicalness of his theories are thus set forth by Scott, in the "Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America":

> Roger Williams's whole being was possessed by the one great principle that the soul should be free, and he was wont to express his heart's aspiration by the term "soul-liberty." He boldly threw down the gauntlet to the world, by announcing that soul-liberty was of God, that conscience was by nature free, and that it was the duty of human society to preserve intact that freedom, whereof the least violation was invariably but the first step to soul bondage. The conscience, the soul of man, being free, no limits bounded that freedom but those set by the Creator. Of a consequence, any limitation imposed on the conscience of one man by another, was an interference between the Creator and the created; it was intolerance, a thing altogether abhorred by God and unjust to man. Religion being a relation that existed solely between the Creator and the created, God was the only judge of the latter. No religious organization, then, had a shadow of right to dictate what one should think or what one should do in matters religious. As a necessary deduction from this conclusion, no such right existing, there was no need of agents to enforce the observance of faith, nor any right to use them. Consequently, the use of the civil jurisdiction by the ecclesiastical, and the subordination of the former to the latter, had no justification, and was, in fact, a monstrous perversion of truth, which called for immediate reformation.

Thus at one blow, Williams would have cloven Church and State asunder, and sponged from the statute-roll the very mention of conformity or nonconformity. Heresy, with him, had no existence, and, carrying his doctrine to its conclusion, he fearlessly asserted that compulsory worship of God was an abomination; that, where the spirit was not a willing one, worship compelled was an offense to the Deity; that if one would not worship, he should not be made to do so, that no man should be compelled to support any religion whatever, least of all one in which he had no faith.

This doctrine overturned the intolerance whereby the civil power is made the agent of the ecclesiastical in the prescription of faith and the extirpation of heresy, and left error at the mercy of the only power that can combat it—truth. It was the sentence of divorce between Church and State, and it ordained that neither should have anything to do with the other, further than extending the protection under which the latter is bound to shelter every element of society; yet this protection was to be given, not so much to the institution, as to the worshipers, in whom lay the natural right to freedom of conscience, and, consequently, the inherent right to freedom of worship.

No man ever had a clearer view of the true relations existing between the civil and the ecclesiastical powers. The civil magistrate, he says, may not intermeddle even to stop a church from apostasy and heresy.

The following from Bancroft shows how advanced he was in his views, and the light in which a man who stands up for principle, even though in opposition to all the ministers of the land, will be regarded by posterity, who can look with an unprejudiced eye and view actions in their real—not in their apparent—aspects:

> At a time when Germany was the battle field for all Europe in the implacable wars of religion; when even Holland was bleeding with the anger of vengeful factions; when France was still to go through the fearful struggle with bigotry; when England was gasping under the despotism of intolerance; almost half a century before William Penn became an American proprietary; and two years before Descartes founded philosophy on the method of free reflection—Roger Williams asserted the great doctrine of intellectual liberty. It became his glory to found a State upon that principle, and to stamp himself upon its rising institutions, in characters so deep that the impress has remained to the present day, and, can never be evaded without the total destruction of the work.

Would that we had in our land to-day more ministers like Roger Williams.
