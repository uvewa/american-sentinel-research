## Consistency.

WHILE the ministers are clamoring for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, it seems they can't agree on Sunday observance between themselves. The Cumberland Presbyterian Synod has been in session in San Antonio, and at a late hour on the night of final adjournment, a resolution was offered, censuring ministers who had gone home on a Sunday. A little debate resulted, the disposition fell on, one minister suggesting that those who rode on the street cars ought to be included in its censures. The resolution as offered, which reads as follows, was finally adopted:

*Resolved*, That this body deplores the seeming or actual disrespect for and the irreverence for the sanctity of the Sabbath by returning to their homes or to public conveyances on the Sabbath, and that it is the mind of this body that such conduct is disbecoming to God, and should be corrected in the future.

It is difficult to understand why the resolution should designate "public" conveyances. Where is the distinction, between hitting a hack and driving your own horse? In one case some one else does the labor and in the other case labor yourself. These repudiators of other people have queer ideas of consistency.—*Deacon (Thomas) Gauntier.*
