COLONEL SHEPARD made the solemn prophecy before the National Commissioners of the World's Fair that unless that great Exposition is closed on Sunday, Chicago will be visited with tempests, direful earthquakes, great floods, cyclones, and general disaster. It is further reported that he has engaged a suite of rooms, during the Fair, in the Auditorium Hotel, for $25,000. Putting these two things together, the problem would foot up about like this: the Colonel either does not believe his own prophecy, and is just trying the old-fashioned ecclesiastical scare, so common in the Dark Ages, on the Commissioners; or, if he does believe it, he thinks the Chicago Auditorium storm and earthquake proof when it has him for an occupant; and so he will view the majesty of the awful scene from that standpoint; or, to take another view of the question, something in which he has twenty-five thousand dollars worth of faith gives him the assurance that the World's Fair will actually be closed on Sundays. It is not intended to be the courteous toward this remarkable prophecy, but the human mind will reflect.
