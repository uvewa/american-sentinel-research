THE following letter, received at this office, will be of interest to the person who is sending THE SENTINEL to the address given. Such a letter is so rare that it is inserted in full, as a curiosity, but out of consideration for the correspondent his name is suppressed.

> 406 PIONEER PRESS BLDG., ST. PAUL, MINN., Oct. 17, 1891.

> Editor AMERICAN SENTINEL—Sir: Some one is at the expense of sending me your paper, for which I do not thank them.

> I have n't time to waste in reading it; and, comparing it with the teaching of Jesus, the less it is read the better.

> Your energies might better be given to something that will tend to lift up humanity from evil, than in tilting against windmills.

> Very truly yours,

It is evident that as our friend has not had time to read THE SENTINEL, neither has he taken time to study the "teaching of Jesus" upon the questions of which THE SENTINEL treats; nor the Revelation of God, sufficiently to know who is the Don Quixote of the age "tilting against windmills."
