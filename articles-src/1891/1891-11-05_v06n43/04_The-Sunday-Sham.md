## The Sunday Sham.

NOT connected with the plans going on at the different attending of church on Sunday, representatives of the American Sabbath Union have appeared before the World's Fair Commission with vehement pleas for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. Since there is so agitation going on for having the compelling attendance at support of religious services on Sunday, what is closing at the World's Fair on a Sunday, or on a first day of the week, to do with the religious institution? Can they not find enough to do at once to come out in the following his own conscience in the matter, whether religious or otherwise? The very man who professes a platitude in this line had barely any more than may have to do at the Fair on a Sunday, than have to do with the enforcing of exhausting labors on a Saturday or on a Tuesday or on any other day. At all events from a religious standpoint in approaching the question, it looks as if their motives are only to force others to follow their wishes. On behalf of the Sabbath God does not care to enforce obedience to his law lest men shall go all to.—*Western Recorder.*
