## Sunday in Foreign Countries.

THE *American Sabbath* thus summarizes the progress of "Sabbath Reform" in foreign countries during the last few years:—

*Canada.*—A recently passed act exempts from Sunday work, and makes the list of a large number of occupations that do not require manufacturing operations on the day of rest. Postal and telegraphic employments on Sunday are reduced to a minimum. In some of the provinces one Sunday work necessary for their industries is permitted, such as running the cheese factories and creameries during the period of diminished Sunday work in factories. Work on the Welland Canal was stopped. Sunday excursions ceased Sunday rest largely in iron, coal, and glass works.

*Denmark.*—A Sunday rest law has been passed which provides that handicraftsmen shall rest on Sunday with certain enumerated exceptions. All employees have at least alternate Sundays off, and young persons under eighteen, every Sunday.

*France.*—The work of the French League for Sunday rest has been phenomenal. Public opinion in favor of weekly rest day has been created rapidly in many parts of the country. The closing of public offices, the law courts, stock exchanges, etc., goods, and parcels offices have been closed at noon on Sundays. Sunday work in many institutions of rest have been demanded, and in some places effected; the working-men's labor Congress asked the enforcement of a weekly rest, in accordance with the day for rest.

*Germany.*—The act of June 1 enforcing the Lord's Day rest to factory operatives and clerks in business has been supplemented throughout the whole German Empire by the recent police regulations, applied largely in Berlin and other cities and towns, in accordance with the provisions of Article 105 of the "Gewerbeordnung." These regulations reach Cashiers, Swindlers, timber mile, textile, and other industries. A commission in Berlin is sitting, considering various labor questions in connection with the general movement for Sunday rest, and the report of the commission is expected to be delivered only early in the morning. A law has been passed in Alsace-Lorraine, requiring Sunday rest in factories and workshops.

*Hungary.*—A law has been passed, generally the same as that of Germany. The Sunday rest is only partial, however.

*Norway.*—The bilberry unloaders toil on trans-port rest. Labor in factories and workshops is restricted to certain hours on Sunday.

*Holland.*—Here no marked progress has been made in Sunday rest legislation, although reports have been addressed to the Holy Synod, asking for the closing of Sunday markets, etc. It gives an idea of the advance on this question in such countries as Norway and Denmark. Grant A. Noble, from Copenhagen, addressed National Sabbath Reform.

*Switzerland* comes last only alphabetically, for the general Sunday rest act, as indeed it should, for it is the missionary of the Lord's Day Federations. She enjoyed the services

distributed 200 sermons had been preached by request on the subject; 66 special prayer meetings had been held; 30 public meetings; 7 Bible readings given; 21 articles furnished for perpetuated serials for local papers; 3,549 signatures obtained to petitions for closing the World's Fair,—by its distributors, and by other members of the firm, and the assistance of twenty-five churches in the immediate vicinity. Since October the annual report of the department thirty business men had written letters to World's Fair Commissioners protesting against the opening of the Exposition on Sunday.

A little reading in support of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair or touching the legal enforcement of the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, or a rest day for all, whether or not due to the circumstances of each case. In his sermon upon the Sabbath of the Lord thy God would be an especial blessing to the people just now, and not more than seven of these were given.
