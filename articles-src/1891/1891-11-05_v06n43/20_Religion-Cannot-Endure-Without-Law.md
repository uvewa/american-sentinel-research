The leading "civil Sabbath law" advocate of the country says:—

> A republic cannot endure without morality, nor morality without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without law.

It follows that religion cannot endure without law! That the assertion is utterly false is proved by all history. The true religion has existed not only without law but in opposition to law. So true is this that the saying "the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church," has become a proverb. No greater slander could be uttered against Christianity than the statement that it cannot exist without civil law. A minister engaged in such work

> Is like a villain with a smiling cheek;
> A goodly apple rotten at the heart;
> O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath.
