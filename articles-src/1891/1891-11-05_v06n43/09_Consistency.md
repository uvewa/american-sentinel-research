While the ministers are clamoring for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, it seems they can't agree on Sunday observance between themselves. The Cumberland Presbyterian Synod has been in session in San Antonio, and at a late hour on the night of final adjournment, a resolution was offered, censuring ministers who had gone home on a Sunday train. A bitter debate resulted, the dispatches tell us, one minister suggesting that those who rode on the street cars ought to be included in the censure. The resolution as offered, which reads as follows, was finally adopted:

> Resolved, That this body deplores the seeming or real necessity of any of its members violating the sanctity of the Sabbath by returning to their homes by public conveyance on the Sabbath, and that it is the mind of this body that such conduct is dishonoring to God, and should in every way be discouraged.

It is difficult to understand why the resolution should designate "public" conveyance. Where is the distinction, for instance, between hiring a hack and driving your own horse? In one case some one else does the labor and in the other you labor yourself. These regulators of other people have queer ideas of consistency.
