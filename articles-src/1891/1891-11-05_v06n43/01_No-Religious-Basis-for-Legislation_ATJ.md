In an editorial on the Sunday question, the *Daily Northwestern* inquires: "Who is to decide for the whole community what each individual's rest shall consist of? And is it possible to establish one standard and quality of rest for all men as engaged in such a multiplicity of avocations? Would it be national, right or just to insist upon exactly the same kind of rest for everybody regardless of nature's demands or of different dispositions and attainments and even day employments of individuals?"

The conclusion reached by the Northwestern is that "the more the matter is discussed, the more it seems that a simple standard can never be adopted or enforced in regard to the one great day of rest which mankind reveres. This is all the more certain when the religious element is taken out of the question. With the religious element in the question, then, according to the principles of our Constitution, the civil code hasn't jurisdiction in the matter."

## No Religious Basis for Legislation.

Of Sunday observances enforced by law, a Judge and Barrister has said that:—

The fact that religious belief is one of the foundations of the custom of Sunday observance is no objection to it, as long as the individual is not compelled to observe the religious ceremonies which others choose to observe in connection with their Sunday rest.

This argument has been made before, by members of the Supreme Court of the United States, but it is as destitute of force as is any other attempt to sustain the Sunday institution. If the argument be legitimate, it is legitimate in its application to all religious institutions. If the argument be legitimate that that could not be enforced by law upon all the people, simply by the observance of the institutions exercising control of legislation. Certain people believe in and practice a certain religious observance, and have sufficient influence to control legislation, and enforce it in that way for all. That this custom is a part of the law, and as the law we are told is presumably for the public good, is then but a short and very easy step to the position that the laws enforcing such observances are for the public good and are particularly to favor religion; and that, therefore, though religious belief be the foundation of the custom, and though the observance be in itself religious, this cannot be suffered to be any objection to it, so long as the individual is not compelled to observe other religious ceremonies that have not yet been put in the law.

Yes, this is all very possible, and it seems always to have been eminently satisfactory to those who make the argument, for it is not by any means new or peculiar to this day or generation. It is as old as the contest for the right of the freedom of religious belief. It is the very position occupied by Rome when the disciples of Christ were sent into the world to preach religious freedom to all mankind. Religious observances were enforced by the law. The Christians asserted and maintained the right to dissent from all such observances, in fact, from every one of the religious observances of Rome, and to believe religiously for themselves, though, in so doing, they really disregarded the laws, which, on the part of the empire, were considered as essential to the population. Then it was held that though religious belief was the foundation of the custom, yet this was no objection to it, because it had become a part of the legal system of the government, and was enforced by the State for its own good. But Christianity then refused to recognize any validity in any such argument.

When Paganism was supplanted by the Papacy, in the Roman Empire, the same argument was brought forward to sustain the Papal observances, which were enforced by imperial laws, and then through the period of Papal supremacy, Christianity still refused to recognize any validity whatever in the argument.

Under the Calvinistic theocracy of Geneva, the same argument was again used in behalf of religious oppression. In England the same argument was used against the Puritans, and other dissenters, in behalf of religious oppression there. In New England, under the Puritans themselves, the same argument was used in behalf of religious oppression, and to justify the Congregationalists, who had control of legislation, in compelling the Baptists and the Quakers, under penalty of banishment, and even of death, to conform to the religious observances of the Congregationality always refused to recognize in the argument, and it always will.

The case of Massachusetts put the Quakers to death, but they came back and back and back again, "not because of their religious tenets, but because of their intolerance of the civil power." That is the language in the publications which they piled up, and it was the line they held with candor. Remember that not only was it "whenever there is not a union of Church and State, heresy and heretical practices are not amenable to civil authority, but when such has passed no longer as errors in religion, but as crimes against the State, and were prosecuted, not by the inquisition laws always against apostasy, by justifications of civil and ecclesiastical law in the punishment infernal."—*Baird's "Religion in America," p. 91.*

The truth of the matter is, that the fact that religious belief is one of the foundations of the customs is the strongest possible objection that could be made to its being recognized and enforced by the civil power. This is demonstrated by several distinct considerations.

Jesus Christ has commanded, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." In this the Lord has distinctly and positively separated that which pertains to Caesar from that which pertains to God. Things religious, are due to God only; things civil, are due to Caesar. When the civil power—Caesar—enacts that which is due to God, then it puts itself in the place of God, and so far as this enaction is recognized it is idolatrous; civil and religious things are confounded; the distinction which Christ has made is practically thrown aside; and the things which he separated are joined together. Upon no subject whatever, be it moral or spiritual or any other, has the right of the civil power been declared. "What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." And upon this subject, it may be declared with equal force,—what God has separated, let not man join together. When the civil power legally adopts a religious institution, or a religious custom, or an observance thereof, it does put itself in the place of God. But no one has power to put it, itself in the place of God. Therefore, no civil power can of right ever legally adopt and enforce any religious custom or religious observance. And whatever such a thing is done, he who regards God the most will respect such action the least.

The history of more than eighteen centuries demonstrates that the very worst thing a government is for religion—or for religion is to have control of the civil power. The legal recognition and enforcing of religious customs, or of customs of which religion is the foundation, is to give religious control of the civil power just to that extent. And the doing of the thing is to compel and fasten the doing of it on every conceivable extent. It was the that reached Christianized Christians to death under Pagan Rome, and in later centuries under Papal Rome. It was this that burnt John Huss at Constance, and Servetus at Geneva, and that whipped and banished the Baptists, and banished and hanged the Quakers, in New England.

the fathers of the American Republic, leaving before them the whole of this dreadful history, proposed that the people of this Nation should be profited by the fearful example, and should be forever free from any such thing. They therefore completely separated the national Government from any connection whatever with religion, either in recognition in legislation. And in this they set to the States the perfect example of human government, which example was closely followed in the Constitutions of the States, and by none more thoroughly than by Tennessee.

Yet, it has never been the hardest thing to get the control of the State to recognize the principle, though distinctly declared in the State Constitution. And here, in the very first instance in which a United States Court had opportunity to apply to it, instead of the principle being recognized, it is revolutionized. And instead of the American doctrine of the sixteenth century, the Roman doctrine of the third century is substituted.

1. We have proved by the express words of Christ, the divine right of dissent from all religious things; that any man has the divine right to dissent from any and all religious doctrines or observance of any body on earth; to live, to go along in his own way, keeps his place, and requires of him only those things which pertain to Caesar; things civil, so long there can be neither direct nor disagreement, but peace only, between the Government and all Christians—Dissenter or syllogist. But just as soon as civil government makes that it has portions of a religious party, and most itself up as a champion of religious observance, then so soon the right of dissent in religious things is extended to the authority of the Government, is or far as that authority is in the exercise. And all this is the responsibility to dissent on the part of every Christian man.

Sunday observance is in itself religious, and religious only. The institution is wholly ecclesiastical. The institution of its observance was for religious purposes simply. The first act of government enforcing its observance was enacted with religious intent only, and has been so characterized. The Sunday law that ever was made; and not the character in rearrangement to it by the attempt at bar in the decision under discussion. The Sunday institution is of ecclesiastical origin only, and its observance is religious only. It is the divine right of every man simply to ignore the institution; to disregard the observance; and to dissent from the authority which instituted or enjoins it. And when any State or civil government makes that the pretension of the ecclesiastical body which instituted it, and the champion of the ecclesiastical authority which enjoins it, and makes laws to compel men to respect it, and observe it, this divine right of dissent is then extended to the authority of the Government, so far as it is thus concerned.

The fact that religious belief is the foundation of the custom, is the one case as valid an objection to its observance by any law of any government on earth. And as for the Government of the United States, or of the several States, as entirely is this the case; and so certainly and firmly does the principle hold, there can be no act which might be suffered to be deemed expedient or valid unless as a municipal regulation, would be permitted or justified by the Constitution, if it forbade or enjoined any religious observance; that is, if it infringed the freedom of religious belief as it has been finally stated by the Supreme Court of California, in all its reach.

That the act been so framed as to show that it was intended by these who made it to apply to a recognized institution, yet if it is, it is now covered by religious freedom as to it, we should not have been confronted with the difficulty now under consideration.

Therefore, the simple truth is, that that which the Judge pronounces as the law is in itself the strongest possible objection. "The fact that religious belief is one of the foundation of the customs" is precisely this fact is the strongest possible objection that can ever be made to it. It annihilates every pretense of right, and absolutely forbids that any law shall ever be made in favor of any Sunday closing, or enforcing any religious observance. Constitutions guard against any religious legislation upon any whatever in the argument.
