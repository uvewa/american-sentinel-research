THERE seems to be almost an exact agreement between the theocratical laws of colonial Massachusetts, and the demands of National Reformers.

To prove such a statement correct, a few historical extracts will be sufficient when coupled with the demands of the "reformers."

Ridpath says:—"At a session of the General Court of the Colony held in 1631, a law was passed restricting the right of suffrage. It was enacted that none but members of the church should be permitted to vote at the colonial elections. . . . Nearly three-fourths of the people were excluded from their rights as freemen."

National Reformers admit if their idea of government is carried out it will disfranchise dissenters. Rev. W. J. Coleman says:—"The classes who would object to the amendment are,—Jews, infidels, atheists, et al. These classes are perfectly satisfied with the Constitution as it is. How would they stand toward it if it recognized the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ? . . . To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel."

The "et al" [and others] can but mean all dissenters aside from the three classes, "Jews, infidels and atheists." Thus they, according to the statement of Mr. Coleman, are working to secure an amendment to the Constitution that will in effect disfranchise all who may "logically or consistently" differ with them.

Ridpath further adds:—"Taxes were levied for the support of the gospel."

A Baptist writer, speaking of the town of Ashfield, Mass., in 1763, says:—

> The General Court passed a law granting the pedo-baptists the privilege of taxing all the land in town to pay their ministers and build their meeting houses, and if they refused, power was granted to sell their lands to cancel the debt.

> We sent a petition to the General Court for relief but were refused. We immediately agreed not to pay the tax, and in the month of April, 1770, they presented a tax of £507 which had been raised for the support of their minister, and erection of their meeting house.

> They commenced selling our land and in all sold about four hundred acres.—Religious Denominations in the United States.—Belcher.

What do National Reformers say? District Secretary Rev. J. M. Foster in defining the duties of nations according to their views, mentions the following:—"By providing her (the church) funds out of the public treasury for carrying on her aggressive work at home and in the foreign field."

Six years ago, a citizen of Washington County, Pennsylvania,—a stronghold of National Reformism—told me that a few months before he fell in company with some ministers that were on their way to attend a convention, and one of their number stated that he was looking forward to the time when they would "draw their salaries from the treasury, the same as Government officials."

When their desires are fulfilled, when they have influenced the Government to legislate in their behalf, if any one should refuse to pay tax to support the national religion they would have their property sold by the Government to meet the demands of the law, requiring taxation to support the church.

Ridpath further says:—"None but church members were eligible to office."

Rev. J. M. Foster says the reigning Mediator requires of the nations:—"A constitutional provision of moral and religious qualifications for their officers."

To require a "religious qualification" for an official would tend to corrupt both the Church and the State. Scheming politicians would be wonderfully pious about election time, and men actuated by selfish motives would join the Church, and thus the Church would be heavily laden with hypocrisy, and nothing can be more effectual in corrupting a State than a corrupt Church wedded to the State.

Dr. Adam Clarke says:—"When political matters are brought into the Church both are ruined. The Church has more than once ruined the State, the State has often corrupted the Church."

What was in force in Massachusetts in the days when they destroyed witches, hung Quakers, banished Baptists and sold their property, is in part, if not wholly, the demand of National Reformers to-day.
