# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, November 5, 1891 (v06n43)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from 8 scanned page images (/tmp/as1891n43-1.png through /tmp/as1891n43-8.png). The scans are of moderate quality with very small typeface in narrow columns. Many passages present significant challenges due to print quality, tight column spacing, and occasional blurring. Numerous word-level and phrase-level uncertainties remain throughout the transcription.

## Page 3-4, Article 03: "America's First Opposition to Sunday Legislation" (W.A.B.)

- **Location:** Throughout the article, spanning pages 3-4

## Layout Note

The column flow across pages 1-4 is complex. The "No Religious Basis for Legislation" article spans pages 1-2 in a non-standard column flow. "Multiplication by Division" begins on page 2 and continues through page 3. "America's First Opposition to Sunday Legislation" begins on page 3 right column and continues through page 4 left column. The right column of page 4 contains shorter items. This made it challenging to determine article boundaries and text flow.
