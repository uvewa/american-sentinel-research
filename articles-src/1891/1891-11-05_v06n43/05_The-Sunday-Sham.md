Nor content with the privilege they enjoy of attending church on Sunday, representatives of the American Sabbath Union have appeared before the World's Fair Commissioners with vehement appeals for Sunday closing of the Fair. Since there is no agitation going on favoring the compulsory attendance of anybody at the World's Fair on a Sunday, or on a Monday, or on any other day, why their solicitude? Can they not feel easy-minded if some one else is following his own conscience in the matter, whether religious or otherwise? The very men who profess a pathetic interest in the hard work some men may have to do at the Fair on a Sunday have no tears to shed over their equally exhausting labors on a Saturday or on a Monday. Indeed, shorn of the sham of pretense, it looks as if their motives could be summed up as a writer in the Open Court expresses it, that "as we, the members of the Sabbath Union do not care to go, therefore we demand that nobody else shall go."
