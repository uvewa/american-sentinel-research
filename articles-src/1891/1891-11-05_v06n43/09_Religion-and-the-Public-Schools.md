## Religion and the Public Schools.

REFERENCE to the "contract" school—sectarian schools among the Indians that receive money support from the United States Government, the Canadian *Baptist* says:—

The contract school system of the United States is, like our own, a wrong one, and it is not unlikely that the disclosures recently from some keen examination of the truth before many years. The course of the United States Government will be followed by the policy pursued by the friend of the Indian in Canada, where for the same reason against the idea of Roman schools, supported by Government grants, though our Government has not yet as far as that is concerned cut them off. The great objection to the propriety education and civilization is not based on complaints of insufficient work, but after long years of cruel neglect and unfaithfulness of the avowed objective.

Evidences are not lacking to indicate that the Government of the United States is already convinced that it has made a mistake in its paying money to denominational schools; but finds, however, that having once adopted this plan, it is exceedingly difficult to make a change. The churches have too strong a "pull."
