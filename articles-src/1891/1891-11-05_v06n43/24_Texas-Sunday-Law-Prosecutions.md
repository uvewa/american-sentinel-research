The following is from Richmond, Texas:—

> The jury in the case of Rev. John Todd, Justice of the Peace, charged with selling a bottle of Florida water on Sunday, brought in a verdict of guilty, and assessed his punishment at twenty dollars and costs. The case excited quite a great deal of interest, and the defense had three of our ablest attorneys employed. This decides the fate of the Sunday-law in Richmond, and is the third conviction. Liverwich, a merchant, was fined twenty dollars for selling a five-cent fan. W. B. Parrott was fined twenty dollars for selling a pint of whisky. All convictions under the Sunday law.

It is difficult to understand that such a paragraph as this refers to incidents in the last decade of the nineteenth century; and still more that it narrates occurrences in the United States, where it has long been supposed that it was not the business of the State to enforce religious observances; but being assured that this is not the twelfth century, and Texas is in the United States, the paragraph must be passed to the consideration of those who tell us that the spirit of religious bigotry is dead and that there need be no fear that the church will ever attain a supremacy over the State.
