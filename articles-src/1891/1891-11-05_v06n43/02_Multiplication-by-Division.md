## Multiplication by Division.

THE Division in the American Sabbath Union has resulted in its increased and disturbing the work of the organization and materially aiding its progress. The Sabbath Union, under the leadership of Col. Elliot F. Shepard and Rev. J. H. Knowles, with The American Sabbath and its auxiliaries, devotes itself more completely to the sentiment and theory of Sunday laws and their enforcement, from the point of view rather of an aristocratic combination and distribution of religion, while Mr. W. F. Crafts, with his organ, *Sabbath Reform*, is devoting himself to the practical business of organizing Law and Order Leagues; Sabbath Reform associations, and National; and Rest Day Leagues, in various localities to carry into effect this direction of their Constitution, in which the society is instructed to "organize investigating committees of four or more persons in each locality to determine those of whom it is desirable to discover all violations on each Sunday shall, by personal observation, ascertain what violations of the law of the State and municipality are in progress, and report fully in writing to the secretary, as a board of reports from him to the board, to guide the work, and to the public by the press and platform, and to direct officers as an urgent incentive to do duty in their post."

Mr. Crafts is taking active measures to utilize that "sword of the law" which has been loosed in ready sharpened and with hilt turned to his grasp. The severity of this matter can be seen in some Southern cities, especially in Atlanta, where Judge Maddox has found it necessary to instruct the Grand Jury that they are the only "Law and Order Leagues" necessary to protect in so organized American municipality. But the organizations of these religious men—Knights Religious Kex Kings and Vigilantes, rapidly go on and when the time comes they will be ready to be the unseen hand to suppress every pretended violation. The power is too easily established in intolerant, and social position, and of too high an order of integrity, to carry out this scheme with the own hand or even look at the logical results of its teachings.

anything about the matter, that neither Mr. King nor any of his Adventist friends in Michigan laws have been guilty, at least, of disturbing any Sunday worshippers with their noise. They are not noted for being a noisy people, and driving them out is by no means the noisiest kind of work. We have heard of whole neighborhoods being disturbed by "chanting" religious "calls" and so on, preaching being insisted over it either. It is not the noise by Adventists that is disturbing the life either of the Michigan Christian Advocate and his colleagues, but their observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath instead of the first, which Methodists say is the Sabbath. Their attempt at enforcing Sunday laws upon the observers of the seventh day is simply an effort to force them under the latter form saying that which the Lord himself has said, "the seventh day is the Sabbath." Many a battle has been fought on this line in the past, but the invariable rule has been that though the persecuted were few in number their works echoed round the world, and their persecutors were found in the end to be in error, though it killing them many times. God lives! Reader! the rule still holds true.

Some members of the National Reform Association feel that this organization, also, should be doubled in its activity and effectiveness by the same means of division which has taken place in the Sabbath field. A proof of this can be found in the following article to the United Presbyterian from a Pittsburgh correspondent:—

A member of the membership of the United Presbyterian Church have been for years members of and contributors to the National Reform Association. In not a few homes can be seen, neatly framed, hanging on the wall, certificates of life membership. For a long time some have felt that the movement was conducted on too narrow a scale. The whole management was sustained to a few persons, and these, with a few exceptions, members of the Covenanter Church. The recent troubles in the Reformed Presbyterian Church have incidentally alienated some of the best friends of the reform. The New York *Independent*, in a late issue, called attention to the fact that in the management of it, those who control its policy and expend its funds, have become dissatisfied from the decisions of minorities in the trials last spring in this city, and also that National Reform as at present conducted was simply a disguised effort to carry out the views of the Covenanter. Outside of that body, not many persons are willing to accept the latter or to be led in any reform by Messrs. McAllister, Wilson, and George.

"this or that we regard as true or tenable in the National Reform platform should be vigorously advocated." Methodist brethren remarked a short time ago that it was also absolutely certain that any movement wisely inaugurated and conducted, based upon the fact that this is a Christian Nation, and intended to preserve its Christian features and give clever expression wherever needed, would receive the hearty indorsement of that church. There is scarcely a doubt it would meet with the approval of four-fifths of the Christian people of this land. Why can't this be done? Who will do the honor? Initiate! Convene a few of our law-abiding citizens, representative different denominations, be called together and inaugurate such a movement? Now is the time to act.

National Reform as described now and something very different. It is based upon the theory that this is a Christian and Godless Nation. The conclusion: Do not recognize it, loftily saying, stand above and stand alone from it, all this fashion is removed. No wonder that only Covenanters can engage in it. Conducted on a broader platform all could unite in its advocacy, and much would it avail.
