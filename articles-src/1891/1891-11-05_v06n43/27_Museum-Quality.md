In discussing the question as to whether the Metropolitan Museum of Art shall be opened on Sundays, after January 1, the Observer says, quoting from a previous article in the *Evening Post*, that it is feared that the character of the Sunday attendance has sent the Museum to the level of the dime species, and that "though the attendance has diminished in August and September, it is said to have improved in quality; and yet the evils so flagrant during the first two months still exist, but in greatly diminished extent; probably in proportion to the diminution in attendance." If the Museum exists only for the benefit of persons of a certain "improved quality," and this desirable class of visitors is obtained only "in proportion to the diminution in attendance," then it would be well to subject all applicants for admission to an examination such as will restrict the number admitted to that desirable few of the proper "quality." However the public at large, for whom the Metropolitan Museum was instituted, have had a very different idea of the purpose of this public school of object lessons. It was not established for the sole use of any esthetic and aristocratic few, but for the benefit as well, of the sons and daughters of men whose lives were spent in laying bricks and carrying mortar, every brick and every hod of which is now worth to this city more than the expense of a few days' pleasure and profit in the Museum for the heirs in equity, though not in law, of the wealth of this great city, even if they have not soft white hands or refined manners.
