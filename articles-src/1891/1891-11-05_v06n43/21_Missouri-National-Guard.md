A correspondent of the United Presbyterian complained to that paper some weeks ago that—

> the National Guard of the State of Missouri was ordered into encampment, near St. Joseph, and in nearly every case the various regiments left their homes or traveled on the Sabbath [Sunday]. These are the men to whom we are to look for protection in time of sudden danger; and yet, on this occasion, without the least necessity, they defiantly trample under foot the law of God, and the law of the State which they themselves have sworn to uphold. Many of these are Christian young men, members of our churches, and are thus forced to violate their conscientious convictions by their superior officers. It is said the colonel of this regiment is a member in good standing in a prominent church. I heard of but a single member of the regiment with sufficient conscience and courage to disobey his commanding officer, rather than prove disobedient to his Lord and Master Jesus Christ.

In this the National Guard of the State of Missouri only followed the example of very many ministers. Not long since a considerable number of ministers did a very similar thing in Texas; and less than a year ago, if we mistake not, many of the delegates to a religious gathering in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, returned to their homes on Sunday. These physicians ought to heal themselves and their fellow doctors before attempting to reform others.
