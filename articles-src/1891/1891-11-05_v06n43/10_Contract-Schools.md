REFERRING to the "contract schools" (sectarian schools among the Indians that receive money support from the United States Government), the Canadian Baptist says:

> The contract school system of the United States is, like our own, a wrong one, and it is not unlikely that the Government may become convinced of the truth before many years. The course of the United States Government will be followed with interest by the friend of the Indian in Canada, where we have the same unsound system of sectarian schools, supported by Government grants, though our Government has not yet so fully and effectually grappled with the question of providing for the compulsory education and civilization of all Indians, as the United States has at length done, after long years of cruel neglect and maltreatment of the wretched aborigines.

Evidences are not lacking to indicate that the Government of the United States is already convinced that it has made a mistake in paying money to denominational schools; but finds, however, that having once adopted this plan it is exceedingly difficult to make a change. The churches have too strong a "pull."
