In questions of public controversy, all sides should be heard. Our republican form of government anticipates the broadest range of individual liberty comfortable with the well-being of society.

Honest religious opinions are as widely diversified as the physical, intellectual and moral constitutions of men are different, hence every man and woman, should be guaranteed by law, the full and free enjoyment and practice of his opinions, provided the same do not interfere with the rights of others.

On account of some necessary work recently done on our streets in Atlanta, Georgia, during Sunday, the clergy, in the pulpit, and through the columns of our daily papers, made a bitter and unwarranted attack on those who instigated this Sunday work. This attack revealed the existence in our midst, of a class of narrow-minded beings who speak and act as though governments were instituted, and laws enacted, for their own exclusive benefit. It is about time that this class was authoritatively informed that we live in a Republic, and not a theocracy. They should also be made to understand that the atrocious code of blue laws and cruel and outrageous regime of Cotton Mather, are inapplicable to this age.

Sunday is strictly a religious institution, and cannot be rightfully enforced on persons having no respect for it as a holy day. The Roman Catholic Church has the same legal right to enforce abstinence from meat eating on Friday, as have Protestant Christians to enforce observance of Sunday.
