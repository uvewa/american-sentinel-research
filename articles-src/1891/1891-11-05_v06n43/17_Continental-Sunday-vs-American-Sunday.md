Alexander Bacon, of Brooklyn, President of the King's County Sunday Association, has stated the missionary problem of the world as it now presents itself to the American Sabbath Union and all its adherents. At the hearing before the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, he said:—

> I have a classmate in Japan, a missionary, who tells me that the conflict is no longer between Christianity and idolatry,—that it is between the continental Sunday and the American Sunday.

There is a far-reaching truth in this statement, beyond anything that Mr. Bacon thought. In these days, the contest between the traditions of men obscures the truth as to the Sabbath of God and the gospel of eternal salvation. This is according to the plan of the great enemy of mankind, which is now progressing to its fulfillment, as foretold in the word of God.
