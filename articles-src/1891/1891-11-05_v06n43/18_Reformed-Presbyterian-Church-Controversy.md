The New York Presbytery of the Reformed Presbyterian Church met on October 28, to consider the charges brought against Rev. J. C. K. Milligan and Rev. J. F. Carson, that they had violated the canons of the church in advocating the right of suffrage, and in publishing what has become known as the "East End Platform." The Presbytery refused to put the reverend gentlemen on trial for heresy, and passed a resolution which really amounted to a declaration of "no cause of action." The end is not yet, however, for notice was given that the case would be taken to the Synod on other counts.

The whole difficulty in the minds of the Presbytery seemed to be in the question, "What is Political Dissent?"—and the absence of definite interpretation of that doctrine by any supreme church authority. To an unprejudiced observer the uncertainty seemed to lie in a commendable hesitation on the part of many present, and of the Covenanter Church at large, to declare themselves political aliens, unreservedly, and accept all the necessary results of that declaration.

The meeting was, however, a Covenanter school of political dissent, and no doubt strengthened the Presbyterians present in the theory, if not in the practical application, of that doctrine, which one of the ministers present declared to be "the heart and soul of their denominational life."
