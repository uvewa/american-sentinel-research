## Editorial Notes.

THE Christian Statesman quotes a saying of Confucius,—"He who persecutes a good man makes war against himself and all mankind." The decisions against M. King in the Justice Court, Church Court, and Supreme Court, of Tennessee, and the Church Court of the United States, in each of which he was reminded of that fact; is all, in probability what the Statesman had in mind in publishing the quote.

ALEXANDER Bready, of Brooklyn, President of the King's County Sunday Association, has the missionary privilege of the world as it now governs itself to the American Sabbath Union and all its adherents. At the hearing before the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, he said:—

"There is a far-reaching truth in this statement, beyond anything that Mr. Baron thought. In these days, the contest between the traditions of men; observers the truth as to the Sabbath of God and the gospel of eternal salvation. This is according to the plan of the great enemy of mankind, which is now progressing to its fulfillment, as foretold in the word of God."

THE New York Presbytery of the Reformed Presbyterian Church met on October, to consider the charges brought against Rev. C. K. Milligan and Rev. J. F. Cowan, that they had violated the testimony of the Church in advocating the right of suffrage, and in publishing what has become known as the "East End Platform." The Presbytery refused to take up the protest, declared it out of harmony, and passed a resolution which really amounted to a declaration that "this is a cause of action." The end is not yet, however, for notice was given that the case would be taken to the Synod on other grounds.

The whole difficulty in the minds of the Presbytery seemed to be in the question, "What is Political Dissent?" and the absence of definite interpretation of that doctrine by any supreme church authority. To an unprejudiced observer the uncertainty seemed to be in a commendable hesitation on the part of many present, and of the Covenanter Church at large, to declare themselves political aliens, unreservedly, and accept all the necessary reforms of their denomination.

The meeting was, however, a Covenanter school of political dissent, and no doubt strengthened the Presbyterian's present in the theory, if not in the practical application, of that doctrine which one of the ministers present declared to be "the meat and evil of their denominational being."

There is great dissatisfaction in the ranks of those who have charge of the petitioning for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair at the failure to roll up a monster petition in that behalf, and they do not hesitate to openly express their displeasure.

---

Of the Sunday Leagues and other Sunday sections, which Mr. Crafts has certainly fathered, not more than one in twenty-five have made in their petitions; and the Sabbath Union offices are worse. "There has been a wonderful failure to respond, in petitions. Where the first difficulty is not far to see. There is no moral principle expressed in the demands of the Sabbath Union and their kindred, and self-interest and prejudice have not yet been sufficiently approached to, and aroused, to obtain any overwhelming expression in their favor."

---

THIS leading "civil Sabbath law" advocate:—

A republic cannot endure without morality; nor morality without religion; nor religion without God; ergo, the Sabbath without law.

If this carries forward, what shall endure without law? That the assertion is utterly false is proved by all history. The true religion, has existed on only without but against law in its opposition to law. So true is this that the saying "the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church," has become a proverb. No greater insult could be uttered against Christianity than the statement that it cannot exist without civil law. A minister engaged in such

is a libeler with a sinking check— what a guilty contrite falsehood bath.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *United Presbyterian* complained to that paper some time ago, that the National Guard of the State of Missouri was turned into encampment, near St. Joseph, and of nearly every case the various regiments left their homes or barracks on the Sabbath (Sunday). These are the men to whom we are to look for protection in times of sudden danger, and yet on the Sabbath, without the least hesitation, their organizations mustered under the law of God, and the law of the State, and with great demonstrations were held. Many of these are Christian young men.

---

They naturally invite all who observe God's commandments of our members, and are also moved by similar feeling of their communications received in their respective cities. It is and the extent of this regiment is a reminder, in good standing, in a prominent church, with sufficient moral consciousness and moral courage to stand before his fellow-soldiers and his superiors, with sufficient moral conscience and courage to disobey the orders and submit to whatever punishment, rather than dishonor his Lord and Master Jesus Christ.

---

In this the National Guard of the State of Missouri only followed the example of very many ministers. Not long since a considerable number of ministers did a very similar thing in Texas; and less than a year ago, if we mistake not, many of the delegates to a religious gathering in Pittsburgh left that city on Sunday for their homes on Sunday. These physicians ought to heal themselves and their fellow professors before attempting to reform others.

---

THE Christians under certain Supreme Court decision of Virginia find that the law of that State forbidding the running of railroad trains on Sunday is unconstitutional because it is religious legislation.

---

THE Federal Supreme Court sustains the decision, for them these which are sent under a rule, the entire of maintaining their rest rule and roads have their hands tied, not only sent a bill that puts imprisonment rather in the course it is great that no railroad should run its trains on Sunday out of control or act in accordance with that sentiment.

It is thus that a question, which only a few years ago was purely local, has now become national in its importance.

---

The Chicago conference on the subject descriptive of the institution lately accredited Sunday law, National Reform Association, Sabbath Union, National Reform Association, etc., before the Commissioners of the World's Fair, with reference to the Sunday, closed a memorable convention on Sabbath observance, the most significant that has ever been held in the country.

In a fact that there is a significance in the attempt to close the World's Fair on Sunday by law or by force of law is itself, in the breadth of purpose of the National Reform Sabbath, and in the dates on those forcefully extravagant representative exhibitions from all the world.
