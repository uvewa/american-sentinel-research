Some slight jealousy arose at the Methodist Ecumenical Conference, in Washington, over the invidious reflection upon the "English Sunday" contained in the term "American Sunday," used in the memorial to the World's Fair Commissioners, presented to the Conference. However, the resolutions were adopted without changing the epithet to "Anglo-American Sunday," as might have seemed courteous. Still, as the biblical day, and the biblical name, and the biblical commandment, and the biblical application of it, are all laid aside, it might just as well be called "American Sunday" as English Sunday, French Sunday, German Sunday, Chinese Sunday, or any other local Sunday.
