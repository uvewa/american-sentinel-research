The Chicago correspondent of the New York Observer finishes a column article descriptive of the hearing lately accorded the representatives of the American Sabbath Union, National Reform Association, etc., before the Commissioners of the World's Fair, with the sentence—"and so closed a memorable convention on Sabbath observance; the most significant that has ever been held in this country."

It is a fact that there is a significance in the attempt to close the World's Fair on Sunday by law which is lacking even in the breadth of purpose of the National Sunday law, and that is the desire to thus forcibly evangelize representatives exhibitors from all the world.
