## National Religious Liberty Association

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and in the right and strict enforcement of civil law in connection with criminal offenses.

We believe that the Constitution does not, and ought not to make anything, whether religious or otherwise, an essential legal qualification of any citizen; that there may be religious tests for religious societies, but that the application of any religious test to civil affairs would be subversive of both human and divine rights.

We believe that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We believe that the civil powers have no right and no authority to enforce religion, whether on Sunday or on any other day, inasmuch as religion is a matter between man and God alone.

We believe that all Sunday legislation is an infringement of the divine prerogative and of the natural right of every citizen, and that such legislation has ever resulted and must ever result in persecution.

We believe that the means of Christianity are persuasion and love, and not force and compulsion; and that therefore any union of Church and State, in fact or in principle, is a subversion of the principles of both true Christianity and good government.

We believe that any National Conference or other meeting which shall be opened by asking the Government to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday and its purposes toward government enforcement of religious observance on Sunday upon the people of this country.

Contributions of funds for the defense of persecuted observers of the Seventh-day Sabbath, under the existing and the enforcement of Sunday laws, as well as the free distribution of religious liberty literature, are earnestly solicited. Address, National Religious Liberty Association, 267 West Main St., Battle Creek, Michigan, or 43 Bond St., New York City.
