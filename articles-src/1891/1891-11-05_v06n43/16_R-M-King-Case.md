The Christian Statesman quotes a saying of Confucius,—"He who persecutes a good man makes war against himself and all mankind." The decisions against R. M. King in the Justice Court, Circuit Court, and Supreme Court, of Tennessee, and the Circuit Court of the United States, in each of which he was remanded back to jail, is probably what the Statesman had in mind in publishing the quotation.
