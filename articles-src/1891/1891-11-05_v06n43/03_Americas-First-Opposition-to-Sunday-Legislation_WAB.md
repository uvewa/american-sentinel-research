## America's First Opposition to Sunday Legislation.

HARDLY had the Congregational Church Sorcerers slipped their feet on the American shores and gotten a home in the State of New England, before the freedom and the spirit of liberty which that area had been characteristic of these peoples, was demonstrated by the opposition to the early Church-and-State Sunday laws which laws descended to us from its Dark Age Correspondence.

The pilgrim fathers landed in 1620, and before a score of years had passed the question of Sunday laws was one of the leading questions of debate in America. Roger Williams, who has justly been styled the "first American," was the champion of religious liberty, and when that partisan clergy and Government were their first persecutors.

Roger Williams, who was born probably in 1600, says his biographer, "was the most charming minister of the gospel, and was the first person in modern Christendom to assert in its plenitude the doctrine of the liberty of conscience, the equality of opinions before the law."

"A few years after his arrival" (Probably 1631), says his biographer, Williams was invited by the majority of Salem to become assistant to their pastor. But the Magistrates held but the first intolerance of the Colony had heard of his representations with the people of Salem to prevent his settlement." One reason of this interference was that he denied the authority, as alleged in the patent, the authorities, as alleged by the Salem, was that he "declared not the opinion that the magistrate might not punish a breach of the Sabbath, nor any other offense that was a breach of the first table." (See Winthrop, I, 54; also compare *Knowles*, p. 56, and note, *Elton's Life of Williams*, April 15, 1631.)

Thackeray, with the reason he refers to of the discretion, of the great doctrine, to the vindication and elucidation of all that he was to devote his life. "His doctrine," continues his biographer, "was in direct conflict with both the professions and the practices of the Colony of Massachusetts whose counselors and elders considered themselves the appointed guardians of the orthodoxy of the people; and in that age they could conceive of no other means of securing their trust, than by inflicting civil penalties upon every one who ventured to dissent even in the most unim-

portant participant from the prevailing faith.

"The opinion of Roger Williams, which was then urged in proof of his unfitness to become a minister of the gospel, has long since become the common sentiment of the American people."—*William Gammell, in Sparks's Library of American Biography.*

Four years before his banishment, and before the General Court May 10, 1635, in the charges which were the groundwork of his final trial and banishment, the charge of 1631 was repeated, and given first place in order, being thus recorded by Governor Winthrop:—

It was laid in the Pilliams's charge as being under question before the magistracy and elective for diverse dangerous opinions, viz.: 1, that the magistrates ought not to punish the breach of the first table, otherwise than as the breach did disturb the civil peace. Much debate about these things. The said opinions were adjudged by all, magistry and ministry, as erroneous and very dangerous, and the calling of him to office, at that time, was counted a great contempt of authority. So, in the return of it, they were desired to be present; to be erroneous and very dangerous; and the calling of him. . . . Not only was the opinion condemned, but after the time (while under general condemnation for these among others) were adjured a great contempt of authority.—*Winthrop, vol. I, page 154.*

From this matter can be seen the feelings that prevailed and showed how deep-rooted was his "mistaken principles," as Bancroft designates them.

It was fortunate for the anti-Sunday law cause—the cause of liberty—that it had such a man as Roger Williams to lead out in the battle for freedom of conscience. He was a noble man—a natural lover "blest in his character," "godly and zealous, having precious gifts," "a preacher of Mr. Wilson's congregation," "gentle, temperate, and forbearing;" he was in constant communion with his own thoughts, and of his own mind which he was in constant antagonism, who loved him in whatever his patience and magnanimity; he was logical and scholarly; an intense lover of liberty; a student of law, tutored by Coke, that "tremendous asserter of," "the student who knew how to sit persistently on the principles of ancient laws;" of commanding personality, and eminently qualified for the work before him.

Additional writings to this same personality, spirit Mr. Ellis in the *Puritan Age* thus describes the character of Williams:—

After the noble qualities and rare acquirements and intrepidness supplied with him, he is a man by no means to be passed in any department of human reflection. He was wholly free of guile, open, simple, pure in soul and body. He had the traits of a childlike simplicity and tenderness. The resolves from which he refused to swerve who opposed him in his opinions or his actions had in nothing of opinion or of mean-spiritedness or forebodings and meanspirited ones. Though settling him in Massachusetts with most friendly sentiments and the final infliction of banishment was preceded by many endeavors to convert him to their views, "Williams never hurt there a single person living."—*Ellis, see also ditto in the Cottage Memoralist Rev., Page VI.*

The intensity of Williams's feelings, the clearness of his views, the boldness of his actions, and the logicalness of his theories are thus set forth by Scott, in the "Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America."

Roger Williams—while being wise possessed of one great principal that the soul should be free, and he was able to express his heart's aspirations by the term "soul liberty." He boldly threw down the gauntlet in its world's assumption, and that liberty was of God, that conscience was to answer him, and that it was the duty of human government to protect it. . . . His scheme for the best solution was invariably but the first step toward the discovery of the absolute truth. Being free, so he instils freedom but freedom felt down so far in the Count. Of a nameless age of inspiration impressed on the conscience of one man in a fashion; no war manifested between the creature and the created in its imminence, a thing altogether inherent by God and to-give to man. Religion being a relation that existed and exists between the Creator and the created, God alone, being the author of it, had the supreme control of it, hence, too, had a shadow of right to dictate what form it should assume in its relation to the intelligence. As a necessary deduction from this position, on the one right only—there was absolutely no ground to use legislative enactment as a means of support to enforce the observance of faith, and urged as its right. Consequently, the eradication of first jurisdiction by the ecclesiastical, and the independence of the former in its claims and its justification, and, on it, fact, it accumulates perhaps the utmost of result, until for incalculable ages an influence.

Thus we see how; Williams would have taken down from the statute books and from the courts and held by the very mention of conformity or non-conformity to be a most absurd proposition. But, and, carrying his doctrine to its conclusion, he logically asserted that compulsory worship, like civil was an abomination; that, where the spirit was a willing one worship, worship compelled was an offense to the Deity; that if one could not and is declared to be unable to do so, that it was not only absurd but blasphemous. It was a great duty, at least of all men in which he had as first president the very essence of the purest liberties,— the civil power is made the agent of the ecclesiastical in the persecution of faith, and for an imposition of heresy, and left serve at the mercy of the civil powers then came civil liberties so far as the assurance of divorce between Church and State. Now it is reduced that neither should have anything to do with the other. Neither being allowed to take its own in the field, its order being in a bound it must pass by, it does not and will not be allowed to its own to be given, not so much to the institution, the greatest and freest writer, but the single one truest to freedom of conscience, and, consequently truest to freedom of conscience, and freedom.

No man ever had a clearer view of the true relation existing between the civil and the ecclesiastical powers. The civil magistrate, he says, may well be rightly said to be ordained of God.

The following from Bancroft shows how advanced he was in his views, and the light in which it was when set, as a beacon for principle, even though in opposition to all the estimates of the mind he will by regarded by posterity, who can look with an unjaundiced eye, and view his actions in their real—not in their apparent—aspect. . . . Roger Williams asserted the great doctrine of intellectual liberty. It has become his glory to found a State upon that principle; and to stamp himself upon its rising institutions, in characters so deep that the impress has remained to the present day, and can never be erased without the total destruction of the work. . . . At a time when Germany was the victim of the thirty years' religious wars, and France was still to go through the fearful struggles of religious fanaticism when England was gasping under the despotism of intolerance, almost half a century before William Penn became an American proprietary and two years before Descartes founded philosophy on the method of free reflection—Roger Williams as-

serted the great doctrine of intellectual liberty. It has become his glory to found a State upon that principle, and to stamp himself on its rising institutions, in characters so deep that the impress be remained to the present day; and can never be erased without the total destruction of the work.

Would that we had in our land to-day more ministers like Roger Williams.
