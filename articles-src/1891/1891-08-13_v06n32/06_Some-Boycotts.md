At the annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union at Ocean Grove, July 27, the World's Columbian Commission was memorialized as follows:

> "We do most earnestly protest against the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in 1893, on the Lord's day, in the name of the Sabbath-keeping people of the United States.
>
> We do this in the interest of public morals, in the maintenance of many millions of our fellow citizens and the observance, consistent memorial of our Redeemer, and in deference to the letter and the spirit of the laws of the land, which protect the rights of all classes of our population to the enjoyment of Sunday rest.
>
> "We moreover appeal to the divine authority of the Sabbath—the immovable and imperishable foundation of the Decalogue and of all the structured and material welfare of the Nation, and to the Word of God that guard the institution of the day for the benefit of individual, community, and nations: we entreat the Local Directory of the exhibit, the Commissioners and the great multitudes of the Christian people of the United States who would gladly manifest their presence and patronage, which will certainly be withheld if their convictions on this subject are ignored.
>
> "We also appeal to the Local Directory and the Commissioners to give due weight to the moral and religious considerations which should govern the nation in this matter and upon this testimony. No amount of Sunday gate money can compensate for the loss of the physical, industrial character and moral prestige that will fall upon the Exposition and the city of Chicago during the half year of the Exposition.
>
> "For these as well as other reasons that might be added we pray the authorities that have the matters in charge to settle by convention this Sunday question, and for the observance of the Sabbath laws made through the great Columbian Exposition."

Although this is couched in this form of a memorial it will be seen that the gist of the whole resolution is contained in the [page 252] sentiments of the past have gone out of just this idea, which Mr. Bellamy endorses, that an "intelligent public opinion," has the right to all-embracing, and the growth of human civilization bears them in the direction of the more and the intellectual life responsive to the most.

And it appears for the major part, that if ... "intelligent public opinion" leads ...

These are timely and well-deserved criticisms. The truth is that those we say these assertions in the last named organized for what, in the end, can be no other that the destruction of the safeguards of civil and religious liberty found in our national Constitution, even of every form of liberty which they will not only plead for the maintenance of but the guarantees shall be their protection.

This sufficiency of that statement from the three great "fathers" of America—the father of the Declaration of Independence, the father of the Constitution, and the father of the country—is in exclusive evidence that Christianity is not, was not, and was ever intended to be, in any sense, the recognized religion of America; but that every man of whatever belief was to be on an absolute equality in the eyes of the American Government.

Any other view is diametrically opposed to the American political system and every effort to reinstate enforced religious observances whether they be the weekly Sabbath or other Church dogma laid into governmental policy is directly opposed to the dictum on that question made by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.
