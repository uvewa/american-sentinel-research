THE criminal docket of the Boone County, Arkansas, Circuit Court gives the names of James Walker, Jule Killebrew, and Sam Mitchell as being indicted for "Sabbath breaking." The court, which convened on July 20, has continued the case of James Walker, and fined the other two men $25.00 each.

The Sunday law of Arkansas imposes a fine on any person who shall labor or compel his employees to labor on that day; forbids the opening of any kind of business, including the saloon, on Sunday; prohibits Sunday horse-racing, card-playing, hunting, and baseball games; and if any minor commits any of these offenses and it "shall be made to appear that the offense was committed by or with the consent or approbation of the parent or guardian of said minor," then the parent or guardian will have to pay the fine. Nearly everything is included in this law for which any National Reformer could ask.

The advocates of these Sunday laws keep ringing it in our ears, and if we could only have Sunday laws, and well enforced in every State the world would be converted right off. That Arkansas has the Sunday law no one can doubt. She has made herself notorious by executing that law.

Now for the conclusion. Arkansas has of course entered upon the millennial reign. And while it cannot be strictly true that Sates is bound, for his nefarious workings are to be seen in other parts of the country, yet it must be that there is an impassible barrier around the borders of Arkansas, and when his Satanic majesty, in his roaming about seeking whom he may devour, reaches the border line of this favored spot he is required to contest himself with viewing in maddened rage these walls too solid to break through and too high to scale. No such good things have been heard about Arkansas, yet if the theory of Sunday laws be true that State ought to contain all these millennial blessings.

To those who are not blind to facts, Arkansas alone presents enough evidence to overthrow the whole civil Sunday law millennial theory. Men in Arkansas are given to all the wickedness common to humanity in other States, notwithstanding the fact that she is so well provided with Sunday laws and is so zealous in enforcing them.
