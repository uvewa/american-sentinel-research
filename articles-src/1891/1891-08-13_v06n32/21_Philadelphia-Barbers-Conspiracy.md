PRIVATE detectives, it is said, have been employed by the Barbers' Association of Philadelphia, to gather evidence against the barbers who have been planning to keep open on Sunday and pay from a general fund all fines and costs which might ensue.

Ten have been arrested charged with conspiring to defeat the operation of the Pennsylvania Act of Assembly of 1794, which requires all worldly business to be suspended on Sunday. Others are to be arrested and all the cases prosecuted unless there is a general submission to Sunday closing.

The Hair-dressed Association of Dundee has taken quite a different method to attain the same end. Outsiders having opened shops on Sunday, sixteen members of the Association volunteered to serve customers who desired Sunday shaving, gratuitously, thus depriving competitors of their profits and all incentive for Sunday opening.

There is a strong contrast between the methods of the barbarous barber of Philadelphia and the merciful hair-dresser of Dundee, but comparisons of course are invidious.
