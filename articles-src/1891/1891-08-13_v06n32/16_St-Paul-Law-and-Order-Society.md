A DISPATCH from St. Paul, Minnesota, dated July 25, published in the Inter-Ocean, states that "War is to be declared at once on the Sunday saloon, Sunday amusements, houses of ill-fame, and all other vices, by the new Law and Order Society." One citizen states in this connection, "We shall begin next spring's campaign on Monday next, and will not cease until victory has crowned our efforts."
