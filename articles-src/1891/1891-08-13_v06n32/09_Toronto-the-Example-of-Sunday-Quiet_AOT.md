TORONTO has often been cited as an illustrious example of a city where the Sunday laws were strictly enforced. Again and again has the picture been drawn, telling of the bliss of living in such a city. But a great change has just come over the "Sabbath hush" of that place. Certain ones have been using Queen's Park as a place for giving expression to some thoughts, very abusive and offensive to some of the religious customs and beliefs of her Majesty's subjects. Accordingly the City Council passed an ordinance forbidding such speeches in any of the parks or public squares of the city, and limited its application to Sunday. Sunday, July 28, was the first day to try its workings. The Toronto Mail says that about sixty thousand people visited the park during the day to see how the law would work. In an editorial it says:—

> The excited, and in some instances, disorderly crowd, which assembled in Queen's Park yesterday was probably more the result of a widespread curiosity as to what would be the outcome of the recently passed park by law, than of concerted action. It may be taken therefore as a spontaneous expression of public opinion of a very deep and determined character against the regulations in question. It is deeply to be regretted that it degenerated into violence, and the contemning of law and order.
>
> The proceedings yesterday appear to have been of a sufficiently turbulent character to justify the reading of the Riot Act. They comprised various assaults upon persons, the booting of the Chief Magistrate out of the park, and the tearing down of the placards containing the regulations of the obnoxious by-law.

The foregoing sentences would lead any one to think that Sunday laws had not raised Toronto above the average city. And when a by-law is passed that crosses the track of the "masses" in Toronto they raise a mob and howl about it, very much the same as they do in Chicago, New York, or any other large city. But the strangest part of it all is that such a thing could happen in Toronto on Sunday, and that, too, over a Sunday by-law. It might be supposed from what has been heard that Toronto's Sunday ordinances had completely transformed its citizens into devout observers of the day. Mr. Crafts, in his "Sabbath for Man," says of Toronto that it is "the most perfect specimen of city Sabbath keeping that the world affords." He further adds:—

> My own feeling was that Toronto—where I at least did not observe a single open shop, where the streets were still and quiet, save where reverent multitudes were going to the house of God, showing a city whose stalwart and beautiful sons and daughters were enjoying a Sabbath rest—might well put our Scottish cities in these latter days to shame.

But oh, Toronto! What have you done? Your fair name is tarnished, your record is gone.

There is no wish to convey the idea that the riotous actions of the mob are aimed directly at the Sunday by-law as such. What they are objecting to is the abridgment of their freedom of speech. But just one little episode like this is enough to show very clearly that Sunday is not much more thoroughly in the hearts of the people in Toronto than elsewhere, and such highly praised Sunday laws have not yet turned all in that city into saints. It is a forcible illustration of the fact that civil law, even enforced so strictly as in Toronto, at the time when Mr. Crafts wrote about it, will not put religious dogmas, no matter whether such dogma is right or wrong, into the hearts of the people. And one of the gravest questions of the day is the idea that some ministers are even leaving their pulpits to advocate in extended lecture tours the idea of securing civil law to enforce religious dogmas. It is true they claim only to desire law in favor of the civil side of such doctrine, but anything that is wholly religious has no civil side to it. And such is the character, when held up to plain view, of the institutions and ideas which these would-be reformers are seeking to enforce. With all the history of the past before us, we might regard such advocates of compulsory religion, if they were isolated individuals, as relics fit only for a museum of antiquities; but when Protestant ministers will seriously, and in large numbers, advocate the doctrine that the State should aid the Church in carrying out its designs, which was the motto of the Papacy while at the midnight of its reign of persecution, it is time for somebody to speak out.

This Toronto by-law was first framed so as to apply to all the days of the week alike, but certain councilmen who were not educated sufficiently in statesmanship to enable them to see that if anything was a public nuisance on Sunday it would be the same on any other day, secured an amendment confining the ordinance to Sunday. Failing to appreciate this important point in law they so framed the ordinance as also to seriously interfere with the freedom of speech. There was a respectable minority in the council, however, who favored making the law touch all days of the week, and also to have it restricted to the particular form of nuisance in question. But they were overruled, and a law was made to which many of the best citizens are much opposed. The interference of the civil law with religious questions always opens the way for oppression on the one hand or mob violence on the other.
