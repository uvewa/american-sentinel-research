FORGETTING for the moment that the Protestant churches, under the leadership of the American Sabbath Union and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, have virtually gone into politics, the Christian Advocate says:—

> Churches make bad work for the cause of Christ when they go into politics. The Catholic Review strenuously advocates the formation of a Catholic party to operate in political affairs in the interests of that denomination. What argument can be produced in favor of a Catholic party which might not also be used in favor of a Methodist party? The church which can afford to organize its members for political purposes has low aims, and is likely to reach them.

This is just what THE SENTINEL has been saying for years, but the organization for political purposes has gone on just the same in all the great Protestant bodies of this country, and even bloodshed is threatened in case the legislation of the country is not modeled according to the demands of the great party of "Christian voters."
