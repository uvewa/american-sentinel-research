At the annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union at Ocean Grove, July 27, the World's Columbian Commission was memorialized as follows:

> The American Sabbath Union and affiliating Sabbath associations in convention assembled in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, July 27, 1891, respectfully present the following memorial:
>
> "We do most earnestly protest against the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in 1893, on the Lord's day, in the name of the Sabbath keeping people of the United States. We do this in the interest of public morale; in harmony with the convictions, memorials and remonstrances of many millions of our fellow-countrymen, and in obedience to the letter and the spirit of the laws of the land, which protect the rights of all classes of our population to the enjoyment of their weekly rest day.
>
> "With supreme regard to the divine authority and perpetual obligation of the fourth commandment of the Decalogue and of all the statutes and ordinances, promises and threatenings, of the Word of God that guard the institution of the Sabbath for the benefit of individuals, communities and nations, we entreat the Local Directory and the National Commissioners not to alienate great multitudes of the Christian people of the United States who would gladly sustain the Exposition by their presence and patronage, which will certainly be withheld if their convictions on this subject are ignored and overridden.
>
> "We also appeal to the Local Directory and the National Commission not to subordinate the high moral and religious considerations which should decide this question to the financial needs of the treasury. No amount of Sunday gain money can compensate this country for the loss of our national character and moral prestige that will follow the continuous desecration of the Lord's day during the half year of the Exposition.
>
> "For these as well as other reasons that might be added we pray the authorities that have this matter in charge to settle this question without needless delay, and for the observance of the Sabbath rest throughout the great international Exposition."

Although this is couched in the form of a memorial it will be seen that the pith of the whole resolution is contained in the threat that the presence and patronage of great multitudes of the Christian people of the United States will certainly be withheld if their convictions on this subject are ignored.

This is a boycott. In commenting upon these resolutions Sam Small said in that inimitable way so peculiar to himself that he had "discussed this question with four Congressmen from Georgia and they will stand and rot on their feet before they will vote any more money from Congress until this question of Sunday closing is settled." This is the financial boycott to which Sam Small pledges the Congressmen from his State.

He also pledged himself, on pain of being "run off the Ocean Grove camp ground" if he failed, that the next Georgia Legislature would "instruct their delegation to declare Georgia out of the Exposition unless it is closed on Sunday." This is Sam Small's legislative boycott.

Further, referring to the decision of the Sunday-closing question being left to the Local Directory, composed entirely of citizens of the city of Chicago, he said,

> Leave this question to be decided by those dirty rascals in Chicago and there isn't a yellow dog in Georgia that would go to the Exposition!

This is Sam Small's boycott for the whole State of Georgia. No one could possibly have expected, when the boycott was first introduced in this country as a persuasive measure in the settlement of differences of opinion between capital and labor, that it was destined, in the hands of the American Sabbath Union, to become one of the greatest missionary forces of the age, possibly one of the chief factors in converting this Nation to a National Reform Christianity.

But, as a stream can rise no higher than its source, the efforts of the "boycott" as an evangelist will result in conversion to the unrighteousness of Mammon rather than the righteousness of God.
