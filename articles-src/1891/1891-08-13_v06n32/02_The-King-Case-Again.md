As briefly noted on the last page of this paper last week, Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, having dismissed the *habeas corpus* proceeding in behalf of R. M. King, of Obion County, Tennessee, and remanded him to the custody of the State authorities, the King case will now probably go up to the Supreme Court of the United States. King's plea was for relief from conviction on the charge of plowing corn on Sunday, after having observed the seventh day according to the fourth commandment. And the ground of his appeal to the Federal courts is that he is, by the Tennessee Sunday law, deprived of rights guaranteed to citizens of the United States by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.

If the First Amendment to the Constitution stood alone, there would be no ground of appeal on this point, because it is worded to forbid Congress to make any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; but in that amendment there is no inhibition upon the States. The State was not forbidden to do what Congress is there forbidden to do. [page 250] The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people, and so that amendment does not forbid the State to do thus, that power may be exercised by the State to any extent. So far as this amendment goes in itself, any State in the Union might establish any religion and forbid the exercise of any religion but that. But this amendment, taken in connection with the Fourteenth, assures perfect religious liberty to every citizen of the United States.

The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States established a new order of things under this Government. Before this amendment was adopted, there was primarily no such thing as a citizen of the United States. Every person was a citizen of a State first, and a citizen of the United States only because he was a citizen of a State; but the adoption of that amendment made all persons born or naturalized within the United States, citizens of the United States, and of the several States in which they reside, so that now every person is a citizen of the United States first of all, and after that he is a citizen of whatever State it may be in which he resides. The Fourteenth Amendment further says that "no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." Manifestly the Constitution of the United States defines the forts, and the rights, privileges, and immunities of persons as such, under this Constitution, are guaranteed by the Constitution against the encroachment of the powers of the States. Under the First Amendment there is secured to all citizens of the United States perfect freedom from any form of oppression on account of religious convictions; because the power of the United States is positively forbidden to be exercised in any such way. And as, by this amendment, every citizen has permanently and positively secured to him the free exercise of his religious convictions, and as by this amendment every State is absolutely prohibited from either making or enforcing any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, it therefore follows, legally and justly, that no State can make any law, or enforce any law that is already made, which will subject the worshiper with the right of an observer of the seventh day, or any other, to be free from any subjection whatsoever to the religious rites or observance of any who choose the others.

Legislation and laws in behalf of Sunday, being religious legislative acts, are clearly prohibited to Congress by the First Amendment to the Constitution. It therefore follows that as far as the power of the United States is concerned, every citizen of the United States has perfect immunity from any such legislation. And as the Fourteenth Amendment makes all persons born or naturalized in the United States citizens of the United States first of all, and then positively prevents any State from making or enforcing any law abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; it follows that properly and logically the Constitution of the United States absolutely prohibits any State from making or enforcing any Sunday law. And much more does it prohibit the enforcement of the observance of Sunday upon those who religiously observe another day.

We know that this point has never before been raised under the Constitution, and that the United States Supreme Court has never yet passed upon this important question. But that this is the logic of the Constitution upon this point seems clear, even in the face of the adverse opinion of Judge Hammond; and that we have excellent authority for saying that this is the proper construction of the law, the situation is equally clear. Hon. James G. Blaine was in Congress when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. He played a leading part in all the movements which secured the adoption of this and the other amendments that form a part of the Constitution. His opinion of the meaning of this clause of the amendment is therefore of great weight. In his work, "Twenty Years of Congress," Mr. Blaine discusses this value and importance of the Fourteenth Amendment, and on page 413 are the following words: The language of the Fourteenth Amendment is authoritative and mandatory: "No State shall make or pass any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Under the force of these weighty inhibitions, the citizens of foreign birth cannot be persecuted by discriminating legislation, nor can the decision of dark complexion be denied rights which are enjoyed in common by the white man. Nor can the Catholic, or the Protestant, or the Jew be placed under ban, or subjected to any deprivation of personal or religious right. No creed or church is to be in any way diminished in its advantages, and no citizen is to be debarred on account of race, color, or previous condition from any advantage, and sweeps away at once every form of aggressive discrimination that injustice and tyranny had heretofore maintained.

This clearly touches the point at issue in the case which is proposed to be carried to the Supreme Court.

This is a question of the deepest interest and of the greatest importance to every citizen of the United States. We are glad that the question is to be brought to the test. The Constitution, the law, the justice, are all on the side of Mr. King and the Religious Liberty Association, which has espoused his cause. Whether the law will be put there also, remains to be seen; for that depends not upon the law but the United States Supreme Court.
