AN ordinance was introduced in the council of the city of Toronto, on July 20, which reads, "No person shall in any public park, garden or place for exhibition in the city of Toronto, publicly preach, lecture or declaim." The bill was amended so as to apply only to Sundays, and to include public squares, and passed.

The ordinance is aimed at certain persons who have taken occasion to speak very disgracefully in the parks, against some of the established ideas of religion, to those congregating there on Sundays.

Why confine such legislation to Sunday? If it is a public nuisance for a man to thus speak disgracefully on Sunday, why would it not equally apply to other days of the week?
