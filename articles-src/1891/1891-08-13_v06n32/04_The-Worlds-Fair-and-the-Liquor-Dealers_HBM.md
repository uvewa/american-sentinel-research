I have watched the Columbian Sunday closing movement with much interest, and am surprised to find that thus far there have been no indications of an alliance between the liquor dealers and the ministers in bringing about the desired result. It surely would be much to the liquor dealers' interest to have the Exposition closed on Sunday. Whether it be closed or opened on that day will make no difference to such as have a predilection for church services; such would attend church in either case. It would make a difference whether the Fair be closed or opened, to the other class, but this difference if it be closed would be entirely in the saloon keepers' favor. Thousands will be in Chicago during the Fair who do not care for religious institutions, or who are indifferent toward them. He who conscientiously observes Sunday will not be kept from church should the Exposition be opened on that day, and hence if it be closed it will effect the religiously indifferent and the unbeliever. It will alienate from Christianity the man who may have an indifferent leaning toward it, because if he be a just man he will be embittered by anything that is coercive. Thus, religion will be the loser and that from among the very class whom the Sunday closing movement is designed to effect. Besides this negative result there will be a positive result. The injustice and coercion of this movement will drive the religiously indifferent man, who might have attended church regularly during his stay in Chicago if left to exercise the free will God has given him, over to the positively irreligious ranks, so far as Sunday observance is concerned, during the Fair, if indeed it does not render him entirely antagonistic to all religious institutions at all times. Having now joined the two classes, this fanatical Sunday closing movement will not stop there, for with no clean, healthful and elevating exhibition to go to, and with no desire to mingle with the Christians who thus have curtailed God-given liberties, it is easy to see who will receive these people and to whom the Sunday fanatics have driven them. A missionary approached a crowd of boys in one of our city slums, "Boys," he began, "when mother and father forsake you, who will take you up?" "Der perlice, sir, der perlice!" was the response. So, if you shut the doors of the World's Fair, who stands ready to receive those who are turned away?—Why the liquor dealer and saloon keeper of course. And does not the liquor dealer see this?—To be sure he does. How fanaticism will blind men! These zealots fail to see that religion has nothing to gain by their zeal, and the liquor interests will be far from losing by the success of the movement to close the Fair on Sunday.

There must be some reason why the saloon keeper has not joined hands with the Sunday advocate. It certainly cannot be because he is afraid that his offer of assistance will be spurned, since everybody ought to know that the advocate of the coercive measures to bring about a stricter observance of Sunday will pool issues with anybody. Liquor dealers ought not to be discouraged in attempts to bring about such an alliance, when it is well known that most of the Sunday-law advocates regard papists as the foes of all that is good, and concerning whom they read awful judgments in the Scriptures, and yet, when it comes to an alliance for the preservation of Sunday they are cordially welcomed. In one breath these reformers denounce Catholics as the Lord's enemies, and in the next they welcome them as helpers in support of the "Lord's day," so-called. The saloon keeper, it is safe to assume, knows, that, outside of the Sunday question, Catholics are objects of Protestant hatred, and yet, when this institution of Sunday observance needs help, the Catholic is a welcomed ally. So he may reason, that, although otherwise an object of attack, he would be welcomed as an aid to close the Fair on Sunday. He has also other reasons for believing that his help would be welcome. The Sunday reformer has his physical interests at heart. He has plead the saloon keepers' cause, by asserting that they need a rest day also. That saloons should be closed on Sunday to give the wasted energies of barkeepers a chance to recuperate. He does not use this as an argument, yet it is one, namely, that if the barkeeper and saloon keeper have their Sunday rest, they can better ply their traffic the other six days. Therefore, to sum up, since it is in the saloon keeper's interest to have the Fair closed on Sundays, since he would be welcomed as an ally, and since the "Sabbath" reformers have manifested solicitude for his physical welfare, why has he not joined the Columbian Sunday closing movement?
