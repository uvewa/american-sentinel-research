CHIEF JUSTICE CHASE once said: "The wicked men are not in the penitentiaries; they are in the churches." And indeed it does seem so when we stop to consider the spirit manifested by some of the leading spirits in some of the so-called moral reforms of the day. With National Reformers and Woman's Christian Temperance Union speakers, and American Sabbath Union orators breathing out cruelty and threatening bloodshed if their demands are not speedily crystallized into law, it does seem that the modern Church has apostatized from Christ, and has become, as foretold in Rev. 18:2, "the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Certain it is that the spirit of National Reform and American Sabbath Unionism is the very opposite of the spirit of Jesus Christ, for it is the spirit of force while his is the spirit of love and persuasion.
