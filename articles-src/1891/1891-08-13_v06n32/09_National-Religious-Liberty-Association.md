Rev. W. F. Crafts has found another name for the sheep of the flock. In those States where lay fathers have organized to secure Sunday closing legislation, he calls them, on Sunday he dropped it quick, and it will be stopped for all something ...

Already the American Sabbath Union is talking about the prospects for securing national Sunday legislation for the District of Columbia, at the next session of Congress.

The Supreme Court of Virginia has declared that the Virginia law forbidding the running of Sunday freight trains is unconstitutional because it falls from this within state limitations.

At the beginning of the baseball season the city council of Irondeqouit, New York, threatened Sunday ball players with arrest, and frowns and horrors of the name of Sunday games. They have hardly been counted out, the American Sunday Union has taken the notion with the expressed determination of baseball playing above the enforcement of the Sunday law in reference to ball playing.

A dispatch from St. Paul, Minnesota, dated July 18, published in the *Saber Oerner*, states that: "War is to be declared at once on the Sunday Sabbath. Sunday amusements, houses of ill fame, and all other vices by the law on the Minnesota statutes. One citizen states in this connection, "We shall begin most spirited campaigns on Monday next and will not cease until victory has crowned our efforts."

The Waterloo, (Wisconsin) Republicans of July 4, contains a list of fifty-three business firms who have agreed together to close their stores on Sunday. It is the inalienable right of these gentlemen to close at any time they choose, and if every business man in the United States would voluntarily close his place of business on Sunday, that it is as submissive of all the correct principles of existing civil to compel any by statute to do on Sunday, or any other day.

The Grand Jury has made a pronouncement touching the excise laws of New York. The Press quotes Major Crane at length as saying:

"A law should be passed which can be enforced. ...The present law is dead. ...There is no law that can force a manager which permitted miles in certain conditions."

Thus is the issue of temperance lost—intemperance, not Sunday. In every sense, we in right equality, the enforcement of a religious formation.

The *Grand Republic* and the *Overland Gleaner* are two excursion boats which carry seven thousand passengers, and more, to and from Rockaway beach every pleasant Sunday during the heated term, and are principally owned by influential Brooklyn congregations.

These congregations have used their Sundays as pleasure-seekers; they have been not too liberal and Masonious and slightly their deep religious beliefs from the right to the most. And I have at the same time pocketing the Sunday revenues freely.

That they have discovered just the way to get complain this a delusion by what official of one of the boats said to a reporter of the times: "Our ties in this the Methodist, Presbyterian ...

... will only support that party which it will show favors to his particular church, or to his particular religion.

Nor is this tendency confined to the Roman Catholic Church. Protestants are adopting the same tactics, and are threatening with political death every man in public life who refuses to the bidding of certain organizations which have assumed to themselves the responsibility of dictating the morals of their neighbors.
