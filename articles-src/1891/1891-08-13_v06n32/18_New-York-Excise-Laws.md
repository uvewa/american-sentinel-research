THE Grand Jury has made a presentment touching the excise laws of New York. The Press quotes Mayor Grant as saying upon the subject:

> "A law should be passed which can be enforced. The present law the people do not indorse and do not believe in. I have drafted no bill, but I would favor a measure which permitted sales in certain hours on Sunday."

Thus is the cause of temperance lost—treasonably sold out—to further, even in so slight a degree, the enforcement of a religious formalism.
