Under the heading, "Sabbath Observance by Law," the *Herald, Morristown,* publishes the following also:—

> One might reasonably infer from the number of petitions which are being sent up to Parliament, praying for a law to better the better observance of the Lord's day, that these petitioners consider the members of Parliament to be possessed of complaisance; that their office qualifies them to dictate in matters spiritual as well as temporal. In our simplicity we had supposed that the members of Parliament were statesmen, not ecclesiastical M. P's, not B. D's or D. D's. Appeal to Parliament for to secure better Sabbath observance indeed! Why not appeal to them for a law prescribing the number and kind of pill to be taken in case of headache, or the kind of plaster? Because that isn't their business. They are not doctors of medicine, nor ministers of the gospel. They are simply statesmen, and their powers of office are limited to statesmanship—to things temporal, not spiritual. But Sabbath keeping is spiritual.

"We had supposed that the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is 'the power of God unto salvation,' is the only cure for sin; the vessel to which an appeal should be made for salvation from sin, and that God is the only being to whom we should pray to take to order his power. But these petitioners appear to have confounded the temporal and human government with the spiritual and divine government of God. What has the Dominion Parliament to do with the divine law of God, which takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart? What power has this legislative body to determine what the Sabbath day is, or what it should be? The Sabbath is a divine institution, and its observance or non-observance is a matter that should rest wholly between the individual and his God. It is a religious practice performed for the purpose of showing the performer's religious belief; but what has the Dominion Government to do with a man's religious belief? It is not the object of any earthly government to make men religious, nor to make them act as if they were religious. The object of a government is [page 254] that we can do for the Christian religion, and therefore all that has its right to do.

"Nor 'the field of the legislated' is acted, and though 'he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,' and though Sabbath breaking is a very great evil, it is that kind of an evil which he has no power to remedy. It is an evil to be sick, but one does not go to a banker for a prescription. Who are instrumental in securing and enforcing Sunday civil laws, be they ever so valuable and in case of financial difficulty, but in sickness he is as powerless as the strongest, and possibly more so. We would hardly think of taking our watches to the blacksmith for repairs. He isn't qualified to do such work; it is too fine for him. So if the statesman, he is not qualified to administer in spiritual matters, he has not the credentials.

"If it is desired to secure better Sabbath observance? And it is very desirable, such, measures as ours should be used as are lawful; but the only lawful means that can be used to secure better Sabbath observance, is a direct appeal to the power of God as shown in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and when that power fails to secure the needed result, everything fails; for there is no power greater than the power of God. God himself does not compel belief of the gospel. He sends the gospel himself, with those over-reaching destruction and these with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord who do not obey the gospel of Christ, but he leaves it entirely to the individual to decide whether he will obey or not. An angel might indeed be made to the civil power for assistance to secure the desired result, but what amount of Sabbath observance would be secured by such means? Would it be in each Sabbath observance as is contemplated in the command: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy?" Nothing short of holy Sabbath observance can meet the requirements of this commandment. You cannot make a man to keep the Sabbath holy by a civil law! The commandment does not say to apply to all the days of the week but it is only to one. To secure Sabbath observance from each and therefore, each Sabbath observance are would be a legal impossibility and such a law would be a sin in itself, because it was prompted by the love of God, but by the fear of man. One who asked the Sabbath for its obedience because the law does it, not because God says, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,' but because he is afraid that some man will lay violent hands on him if he does not do it, and he has his efforts ...

"These petitioning ministers pray to man to have the fear of man put into the heart of man, instead of praying to God to have his love put in their hearts. All enlightened minds agree to what the Bible positively and what reason clearly and conclusively without argument, that love of God is essential for every act of religious duty. To tender obedience or homage to God, while we have no love for him in our hearts, would be dishonorable to the Maker, and doing violence to our own nature. But Sabbath observance is a religious duty, and therefore in closing a civil law for Sabbath observance, one is sinning not only against his Maker, but he is sinning against himself. And all those who are instrumental in securing and enforcing Sunday civil laws, be they ever so sincere themselves above God, for first, they laid upon themselves to stifle the love of the people the form of religions worthily held, they shall otherwise and secondly they gravitate the punishment which shall be inflicted upon them for a failure to keep that practice. But both these things belong above the civil.

"And, further, the Sabbath observance which is secured by such a law as one transmitted by those petitioners, is not observing Sabbath in the truest of being in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is directly opposed to it; for Christ himself said, 'Thus would the worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve.' And it is true that those who are instrumental in securing from the so-called 'exalt thus of God' by directing to themselves that worship which belongs alone to God.

"The forms and practice of the Christian religion were not instituted by the aid of civil power, but in spite of it, and in direct opposition to it. The Author of our religion was rejected by the civil power, and all his disciples save one was put to death by civil power. But the persecutions, the gospel prevailed, and won its way into the hearts of the people. But in its exaltation by its greatest disciples, the discernment of an ambitious monarch saw the power which the new religion was exerting in the earth, and with the object of strengthening himself by possessing it, he made Christianity the religion of the State, enforcing its forms and ceremonies by the pains and penalties of civil law. Oh, the might it brought! As well might he have thought to aid the Almighty in causing the sun to bring forth light and warmth and autumn sunshine, as to think of rendering assistance by civil power to the propagation of the gospel in the hearts of man. But in spite of this withering curse that caused the pall of darkness to settle over the age that had kissed; in spite of the rivers of blood which this unhallowed union caused to [page 254] flow from millions of bleeding martyrs in spite of the clouds of smoke that ascended to heaven from myriad consuming bodies of saints, the gospel prevailed, and to-day a happy people—can enjoy the liberty which the gospel has secured to them, thus showing that the power of God is mightier than the mightiest combinations of earth, and that it is by power, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts. There is no power in this world that can save a soul from sin only the power of God.

"But instead of profiting by these fearful lessons of the past, instead of directing their powers to God for more of his spirit and power to convert sinners, we find thousands of the professed ministers of Christ in this fair Dominion putting up petitions to Parliament instead of to God, for a law to save themselves and the rest of the people from the sin of Sabbath breaking convictions; because the power is positively forbidden to be exercised in any such way. And as, by this amendment, every citizen has permanently and positively secured to him the free exercise of his religious convictions, and as by this amendment every State is absolutely prohibited from either making or enforcing any law..."
