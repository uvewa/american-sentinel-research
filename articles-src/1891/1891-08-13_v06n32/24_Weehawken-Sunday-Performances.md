"FEARFUL strides toward the overthrow of the last vestiges of regard for the Sabbath are being made before our eyes," says the Christian Advocate of this city. "At Weehawken a great Sunday performance is conspicuously advertised in the New York papers, and thousands go to see it. It is in direct violation of law. There is no solid reason why theaters should not be open on Sunday if such a performance as this can be allowed. Will the Christian citizens of New Jersey permit it? We appeal to our ministers and members in the vicinity. Look closely into the law; ascertain what methods to take to put a stop to it; move courageously. The Sabbath-breakers will be against you; the management who care nothing for God's day, but are simply after money, will cry, 'Pharisees,' but there is still law in the State. Talking will do nothing; that is for an hour, while these daughters of the horse-leech cry 'Give, give,' continually. Other violations of law in the same direction are going on. If some of the cream of New York and Philadelphia settles upon the territory of New Jersey, the scum in great billows rolls across the Hudson and the Delaware every Sabbath, and the residents must contend earnestly or their fair heritage will become as bad as the slums of the cities."

It is thus that in every quarter Christians are looking to the civil law to preserve the "Christian Sabbath."
