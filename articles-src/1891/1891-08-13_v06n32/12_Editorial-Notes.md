It is said that reports from "Sabbatical cheerfulness" manifest in France and Italy show a change in the conduct of English men in respect to Sabbath observance. They are expecting to adopt the law Continental customs, and to regard all the ... characteristics the character and values of the Institution.

"Governments must be liberal-minded..." Judge Zane, "to tolerate all religions." The Judge forgets that "what other nations call religious tolerance we have nothing to do tolerating religion. That governments should merely tolerate them is that ... may governments should merely tolerate their ... Governments should keep their people. Governments should not be free of any religion because of it land that people ... have nothing whatever to do with it."

The following from the Catholic *Columbian*:

Commissioner Morgan has an exceedingly small chance to make himself disagreeable to the Catholic body in America ... The question is, will he ... it will be with the Indians whom the commission ...  quite so arrogant ... of this. At the banquet which the Catholic dignitaries ... were certainly Republicanism ... the political ... of religion, then the Republicans ... one their ... voices at the Church door openly ...

The new Spanish labor bill provides that all contracts for labor must be made not to contain prohibitions of work but not only on Sundays, but on all feast days as well. This makes about ninety holidays a year. The bill provides penalties for employers and employees alike for violations of the law. Exemptions are however provided for persons declaring that they do not belong to the State religion, as the framers must have been studying the Blair Sunday Rest Bill. Their provisions are quite similar.

Chief Justice Chase once said, "The wicked man are set in the penitentiaries; they are in the churches." And indeed it does seem so when we stop to consider the spirit manifested by some of the leading forms of the so-called worthy moral and religious men of the day. With National Reformers and Woman's Christian Temperance Union speakers, and American Sabbath Union representatives everywhere going out and threatening bloodshed if their demands are not speedily crystalized into law, it does seem that the modern Church has apostatized from Christ, and has become, as foretold in Isa. 14:17, "the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Certain it is that the spirit of National Reform and American Sabbathism Union is the very opposite of the spirit of Jesus Christ, for it is the spirit of force while his is the spirit of love and persuasion.

The *Christian Advocate,* of this city, in common with most of the religious press, expresses great indignation at the persecution of R. M. King, by most of the injustice Sunday law of Tennessee. But instead of coming out boldly and denouncing the outrages, the *Advocate* says: King, a Seventh-day Adventist, unmistakable played on Sunday, in Tennessee. He was arrested.

This is unworthy of the *Advocate*. The fact is that King's only work was done as quietly and as privately as it was possible to do it, and all the circumstances surrounding the case show that it was a case of religious persecution pure and simple. King's offense was not that he plowed on Sunday, but that he did not plow or do any work on Saturday. She [page 256] moves other persons in the same neighborhood have always worked on Sunday when they chose so to do, and nothing has ever been said or done about it; nor was King molested until he commenced to observe another day. The *Advocate* should have respect unto the ninth commandment and not add to the injury already done Mr. King by bearing false witness against him for the purpose of defending the institution of the synagogue which is ...

Footnotes: for the moment that the Protestant churches, under the leadership of the American Sabbath Union and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, virtually gone into politics, the *Christian Advocate* says—

Churches have made for the cause of Christ when they entered into political combinations ...  which strenuously advocates the formation of a Catholic political party, and, not surprisingly, after reflection of that denomination. What argument can be ... the Methodist Episcopal Church not also be used in favor of a Methodist party? Let every religious sect have its political combination, it is not supposed that purpose has any aims, and ...

This is just what the *Advocate* has been saying. For ages the agitation and controversy for political purposes has gone on for the cause in all the great Protestant bodies of this country, and even bloodshed is threatened in case the legislation of the country is not modeled after the religious demands of the great part of "Christian" America.

It is remarkable now in rare cases ... says the *Sun*, "that the British Museum or Westminster Conference had passed in a law at honor in praying for the conversion of the Prince of Wales. Among all the criticism, and one or two of the latest of the Prince, this is the criticism that he will be likely to feel the most keenly." That which shows all things one takes he remarkable is the fact that this is nothing but a fact's life, which did already happen ten or twelve score and ten years, between the Prince of ... the husbandry of two great Protestant England and Scotland. But such incongruities are inherent in Church and State.
