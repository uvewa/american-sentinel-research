Recently, the California *Christian Advocate* published the following upon the subject:

Oh, Advocate, now you've done it! We have been sad and almost spiteful this pleasant day while giving a text which might pick fleas for a Sunday law in California. The American Sabbath Union has planned a four years' crusade in behalf of "the only State in the Union without a Sunday law." One of the main plans is that Sunday desecration is greatly demoralizing the people of the State. And prominent ministers of the leading denominations have gone up the stairs, endeavoring to create the impression that Sunday laws form the great moral protectors of the country. Four states and corners the wail about the State's lost condition. All because that has no Sunday law.

Are we continually pointed to the good "example of the Sunday laws of other States until any one who should only hear but that side would naturally infer that Sunday in the East is one grand feast of sanctity. But here comes the *Advocate,*—the Pacific Coast organ of the very church to whom the infant American Sabbath Union has been confided, and whose ministers are on its housebreaking California's located and defining a Sunday law,—the *Advocate*, mind, it comes right out and says that even the ministers from those Sunday-law States come out here and set a very bad example in the matter of Sunday observance.

Just think of it; a minister from a Sunday-law State! begin from preaching in one place to go on horseback or in company on a grand excursion to the mountains! Now the Sabbath! Union will have to find a new plan for its pet scheme, and the Sunday-law ministers will have to whoa-see-haw some new theory for improved Sunday observance. Evidently the Sunday law is a failure in the other States, writes the ministers come from under its influence to this Coast to "demoralize and disarm and disgust the Church" where there is no Sunday law.
