RECENTLY, the California Christian Advocate published the following upon this subject:—

> In most cases it is done out of entire indifference to the claims of the Sabbath. For Christians to travel on Sundays except on clear cases of necessity or mercy, is inexcusable. The Church in the West has often been disgraced by the worst kind of examples of Sabbath-breaking by ministers from the East. They come into towns on Sunday, or go on excursions on that holy day. In one case a minister came into a town on Saturday night, and was cordially invited to preach. He begged off from the morning service, but agreed to preach at night. All day Sunday he was out with a miscellaneous company on a grand excursion to the mountains. Such acts demoralize and disarm and disgust the Church. We plead for the sanctity of the Sabbath in vain when we desecrate it ourselves. It is a shame and a disgrace for Christians to violate the law of the Sabbath.

Oh, Advocate, now you've done it! You have gone and almost spoiled the last ditch plea for a Sunday law in California. The American Sabbath Union has planned a two years' crusade in behalf of "the only State in the Union without a Sunday law." One of its main pleas is that Sunday desecration is greatly demoralizing the people of the State. And prominent ministers of the leading denominations have taken up the strain, endeavoring to create the impression that Sunday laws form the great moral protectorate of the country. Ever and anon comes the wail about the State's lost condition, all because it has no Sunday law.

We are continually pointed to the good effect of the Sunday laws of other States, until any one who should only hear that side would naturally infer that Sunday in the East is one grand feast of morality. But here comes the Advocate,—the Pacific Coast organ of the very church in whose arms the infant American Sabbath Union was nursed, and whose ministers are loud in bemoaning California's isolated and deplorable condition—and upsets the kettle. It comes right out and says that even the ministers from those Sunday-law States come out here and set a very bad example in the matter of Sunday observance.

Just think of it; a minister from a Sunday-law State begs off from preaching in order to go "with a miscellaneous company on a grand excursion to the mountains." Now the Sabbath Union will have to find a new plea for its pet scheme, and the Sunday-law ministers will have to advance some new theory for improved Sunday observance. Evidently the Sunday law is a failure in the other States, when even the ministers come from under its influence to this Coast to "demoralize and disarm and disgust the Church" where there is no Sunday law.
