THE Christian Advocate, of this city, in common with most of the religious press of the country, is ashamed of the persecution of R. M. King, by means of the iniquitous Sunday law of Tennessee; but instead of coming out boldly and denouncing the outrage, the Advocate says: King, a Seventh-day Adventist, ostentatiously plowed on Sunday, in Tennessee. He was convicted of Sabbath-breaking.

This is unworthy of the Advocate. The fact is that King's Sunday work was done as quietly and as privately as it was possible to do it, and all the circumstances surrounding the case show that it was a case of religious persecution pure and simple. King's offense was not that he plowed on Sunday, but that he did not plow or do any work on Saturday. Numerous other persons in the same neighborhood have always worked on Sunday when they chose so to do, and nothing has ever been said or done about it; nor was King molested until he commenced to observe another day. The Advocate should have respect unto the ninth commandment and not add to the injury already done Mr. King by bearing false witness against him for the purpose of depriving him of the sympathy which is justly his.
