THE new Spanish labor bill provides that all contracts for labor must be understood to contain prohibition of work not only on Sundays, but on all feast days as well. This makes about ninety holidays a year. The bill provides penalties for employers and employees alike for violations of the law. Exemptions are however provided for persons declaring that they do not belong to the State religion. Its framers must have been studying the Blair Sunday rest bill. Their provisions are quite similar.
