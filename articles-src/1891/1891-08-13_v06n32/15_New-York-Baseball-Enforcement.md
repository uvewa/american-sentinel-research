AT the beginning of the baseball season the citizens of Irondopuoit, New York, threatened Sunday ball players with arrest, and forced the discontinuance of Sunday games. They have lately been resumed, and the Monroe County Sunday Union has begun action with the expressed determination of bringing about a strict enforcement of the Sunday law in reference to ball playing.
