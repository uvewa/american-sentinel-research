SUNDAY, July 26, has come to be known in newspaper headings as the "Blue Sunday in Hartford," from the measure of success attained on that day in enforcing the Connecticut laws on the observance of Sunday.

Section 1569 of the Connecticut Statutes reads:

> "Every person who shall do any secular business or labor, except works of necessity or mercy, or keep open any shop, warehouse, or manufacturing or mechanical establishment, or expose any property for sale, or engage in any sport or recreation on Sunday, between sunrise and sunset, shall be fined not more than four dollars nor less than one dollar."

It seems that the movement for the enforcement of this law began by a petition to the authorities to close the Italian fruit stands. The Italians retaliated with another petition for the enforcement of the law against all business on Sunday. The Chief of Police complied, but exercised his own discretion in permitting the sale of soda water and Sunday newspapers as necessities.

A combination is threatened which will compel the authorities to close all stores, drug stores included, and deny the people of Hartford livery and street-car service on Sunday.

The vendetta of the Italian seems to be the strongest and most immediately effective that Mr. Crafts has yet succeeded in joining to himself in his crusade for the religio-civil Sunday.
