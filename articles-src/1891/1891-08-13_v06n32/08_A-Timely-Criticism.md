REV. MINOT J. SAVAGE, in the Boston Arena for August, criticises a paper which appeared in the July number of that magazine, written by Rev. Francis Bellamy, in which were advanced ideas favoring paternalism in government. In the course of his criticisms, Mr. Savage says:—

> Whatever may be in the future, when men get to be something different from what they are, so far in the history of the world it has been true that all kinds of governments have oppressed the individual. And, so far, the only safety of the individual has been such guarantees of personal rights and liberties as have limited the governmental power. And until some one can give the world assurance that human nature is to be transformed, it will be just as well to maintain the guarantees, instead of putting still more power into the hands of the Government—whether it be called one thing or another. While even one wolf is abroad, the wise shepherd will not get rid of his dog.

Further along he says:—

> The plain fact of the matter is, that all the persecutions of the past have grown out of just this idea, which Mr. Bellamy endorses, that an "intelligent public opinion" has the right to tell certain individuals what they shall believe and teach. And all the growth of human civilization thus far has been in the direction of the rise of the individual as over against the claim of the majority to control. And there is no safety for the individual, and no sure and swift promise of human advance, until "intelligent public opinion" is taught to mind its own business.

These are timely and well-deserved criticisms. In view of the fact that there are associations in the land organised for what, in the end, can be no other than the destruction of the safeguards of civil and religious liberty found in our national Constitution, every lover of such liberty may well not only plead for the maintenance of the guarantees to such liberty, but that these guarantees shall be cherished and respected.
