MAXIMS and traditional phrases are one of the safeguards of liberty. Trite sayings, in course of time gather unto themselves all the force of law. Take for instance the colonists who asserted the time-honored Anglican principle that "taxation without representation is tyranny." The patriotic colonists would no more hear a denial of that principle than they would hear to a decree making them slaves; in fact, they considered that a submission to any kind of tax by Parliament was a submission to slavery. Hence, the Revolution, and American liberty.

There is another political idea which the American mind holds just as dear—holds with just as great reverence—as it does the foregoing maxim; and that is the separation of "Church and State."

Knowing this to be true, and knowing that any one who would presume to agitate openly for any such thing, would not stand any chance whatever of success, some modern "reformers" who hold identically the same opinions, are working for identically the same kind of laws and form of government, and applauding identically the same acts—now assert that though they do not want "Church and State," are "totally opposed to Church and State," etc., yet they want a religious State, or a Christian State.

This is a specimen of Jesuitical casuistry, that American people, who for a century have enjoyed the unparalleled blessings of religious liberty, should see the absurdity of at once. They most assuredly will do so, and act accordingly, too, if they still have the spirit of liberty in them that was in the American people a century ago. The English Government attempted a similar deception upon the colonists by taxing them under another name. But the plan did not succeed then. Will it succeed now?

It is a mistake to suppose that the American revolt of the last century was against the term "Church and State;" in fact that term was comparatively little used; it was against the institution, against Government and religion being connected in any way or having anything to do with each other.

To show that the great American movement was to preserve religion in its purity and integrity, and to confine the State to civil affairs alone, and not simply to object to what some people call "Church and State," I have collected a few terms used by one of the early American statesmen—James Madison—the "father of the American Constitution." These are simply gathered-at random, and I do not suppose they begin to represent all of the terms of Madison himself, much less all of those of that most interesting period of our country's history.

Some of Madison's expressions are: "The veteran error of entwining the civil and ecclesiastical polity;" "distinction between what is due to Caesar and what is due to God;" "mutual independence of the religious and civil polity;" "religious establishments;" "ecclesiastical establishments;" "established Christianity" (not established sects); "religion and politics;" "hierarchy;" "combination of the civil and ecclesiastical polity," etc. Fully as many terms were used in reference to our religious equality; such as, "enjoyment of the freedom of religious opinions and worship," "perfect equality of rights which it [the American secular political system] secures to every religious sect," etc.

Washington, Madison, and Jefferson declined as plainly as words could declare, that Christianity as a religion had no more claims whatever upon the Government than any other religion.

Washington's treaty with Tripoli declares: "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;" and asserted further that "it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity of Mussulmans."

And Madison in his speech in the Virginia Assembly against the establishment of Christianity pointedly asked:

"What is Christianity?"

And then answering his own question he declared to the listening Assembly—"The courts of law will have to decide."

And then again he asked,

"Is it trinitarianism, arianism, or socinianism?" etc., etc., etc.

And then he added—"It ends in what is orthodoxy? what heresy?"

This is what Madison was opposed to. "Who does not see," he subsequently wrote, "that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, to the exclusion of all other sects?"

And Jefferson, who wrote the celebrated Virginia "Act for establishing religious freedom," tells how the Assembly supported him in his views, proving that in their eyes as well as his, "its protection was meant to be universal." "Where the preamble" says he "declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the word 'Jesus Christ,' so that it should read, 'a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy Author of our religion;' the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohammedan, the Hindoo, and infidel, of every denomination." See "Works of Thomas Jefferson," volume I, page 45.

This uniformity of statement from the three great "fathers" of America—the father of the Declaration of Independence, the father of the Constitution, and the father of his country—is conclusive evidence that Christianity is not, nor was it ever intended to be, in any sense, the recognized religion of America; but that every man of whatever belief was to be on an absolute equality in the eyes of the American Government.

Any other view is diametrically opposed to the American political system, and any effort to reinstate enforced religious observances (whether they be the weekly Sabbath or other Church dogmas) into our governmental policy is directly opposed to the efforts on that question made by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison.
