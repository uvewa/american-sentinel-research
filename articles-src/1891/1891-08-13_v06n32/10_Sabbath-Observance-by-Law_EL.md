"One might reasonably infer from the number of petitions which are being sent up to Parliament, praying for a law to secure the better observance of the Lord's day, that these petitioners consider the members of Parliament to be possessed of omnipotence; that their office qualifies them to dictate in matters spiritual as well as temporal. In our simplicity we had supposed that the members of Parliament were statesmen, not ecclesiastics; M. P's, not D. D.'s or M. D.'s. Appeal to Parliament for a law to secure better Sabbath observance indeed! Why not appeal to them for a law prescribing the number and kind of pill to be taken in case of a bilious attack? Why not?—Because that isn't their business. They are not doctors of medicine, nor ministers of the gospel. They are simply statesmen, and their powers of office are limited to statesmanship—to things temporal, not spiritual. But Sabbath keeping is spiritual worship; Sabbath breaking is sin.

"We had supposed that the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is 'the power of God unto salvation,' is the only power in this world to which an appeal should be made for salvation from sin; and that God is the only being to whom we should pray in order to secure this power. But these petitioners appear to have confounded the temporal and human government with the spiritual and divine government of God. What has the Dominion Parliament to do with the divine law of God, which takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart? What power has this legislative body to determine whether the Sabbath day is observed as it should be? The Sabbath is a divine institution, and its observance or non-observance is a matter that should rest wholly between the individual and his God. It is a religious practice performed for the purpose of showing the performer's religious belief; but what has the Dominion Government to do with a man's religious belief? It is not the object of any earthly government to make men religious, nor to make them act as if they were religious. The object of government is to make men civil; but Sabbath breaking is not uncivil, it is irreligious. Sabbath keeping is an act of religious worship, nothing else; and a law to secure better Sabbath observance would simply be a law to secure better religious worship.

"But we ask again, What has the Dominion Parliament to do with an individual's religious worship? The Parliament itself is composed of men who are as diverse in their religious practices and beliefs as it is possible for men to be. Now is it reasonable that they should enact laws to enforce upon one another, and upon the people at large, the forms and practices by which they show their religious belief?

"It seems to be a settled conviction of those who are petitioning for this law that a man can be made a good Christian, as well as a good citizen, by an Act of Parliament; for the only reason why any one should keep the Sabbath day is that he may be a good Christian. It may be objected that the intention of the proposed law is to regard the day as a civil institution; but even in that case, civil employment should not be prohibited, because civil employment on a civil day can never, by any process of sound reasoning, be made to appear as an incivility. But the Sabbath is not a civil institution in any sense of the word. It is religious, and wholly such. It is an institution that belongs entirely to the government of God, and no earthly government has any right whatever to say how, or when, it shall be observed, or whether it shall be observed at all or not. The Dominion Parliament has about as much right to pass a law to secure the better observance of the Lord's day as it has to pass a law with reference to the manner in which the Americans should observe the Fourth of July. It is an institution that is altogether and entirely outside of its jurisdiction.

"These petitioners appear to think that the field of the legislator is unlimited, and that for every evil that exists under the sun, a remedy must be sought by an appeal to civil authority. But this is a serious mistake. It is this mistake that instituted the Inquisition with all its horrid instruments of torture. It is this mistake that erected the altar of human sacrifice among the heathen nations of the earth. It is the mistake among civilized nations which murdered philosophers, and crucified the Son of God;—the mistake of permitting the legislator to invade the realm of conscience. And after all this experience, shall this mistake be made again? Shall the legislator be permitted to dictate to us the forms and practices of religious worship which we shall observe? God forbid! Let the legislator keep within the bounds of statesmanship, leaving religion and religious practices of every kind to the individual, the family, and the Church, and he will be doing all that he can do for the Christian religion, and therefore all that he ought to do.

"No; the field of the legislator is limited, and though 'he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,' and though Sabbath breaking is a very great evil, it is that kind of an evil which he has no power to remedy. It is an evil to be sick, but one does not go to a banker for a prescription. The banker may indeed be able to render valuable aid in case of financial difficulty, but in sickness he is as powerless as the poorest, and possibly more so. We would hardly think of taking our watches to the blacksmith for repairs. He isn't qualified to do such work; it is too fine for him. So of the statesman; he is not qualified to administer in spiritual matters; he has not the credentials.

"If it is desired to secure better Sabbath observance," (and it is very desirable), such means only should be used as are lawful; but the only lawful means that can be used to secure better Sabbath observance is a direct appeal to the power of God as shown in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and when that power fails to secure the desired result, everything fails; for there is no power greater than the power of God. Even God himself does not compel belief of the gospel. He does indeed threaten those with everlasting destruction that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, but he leaves it entirely to the individual to decide whether he will obey or not. An appeal may indeed be made to the civil power for assistance to secure the desired end, but what kind of Sabbath observance would be secured by such means? Would it be such Sabbath observance as is contemplated in the commandment, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy'? Nothing short of holy Sabbath observance can meet the requirements of this commandment. Now can one be made to keep the Sabbath holy by a civil law? The commandment does not say, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it civilly.' But the Sabbath can not be kept holy unless its observance is prompted by the love of God, and, therefore, such Sabbath observance as would be secured by a civil law would be a sin in itself, because it is not prompted by the love of God, but by the fear of man. One who observes the Sabbath in obedience to a civil law does it, not because God says, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,' but because he is afraid that some man will lay violent hands on him if he does not do it, and so he acts the hypocrite.

"Thus these petitioners pray to man to have the fear of man put into the heart of man, instead of praying to God to have his love put in their hearts. 'All enlightened minds agree to what the Bible confirms, and what reason can clearly perceive without argument, that love for God is essential for every act of religious duty. To tender obedience or homage to God, while we have no love for him in our hearts, would be dishonorable to the Maker, and doing violence to our own nature.' But Sabbath observance is a religious duty, and therefore in obeying a civil law for Sabbath observance, one is sinning not only against his Maker, but he is sinning against himself. And those who are instrumental in securing and enforcing such a law are guilty, not simply of sinning against God, but of exalting themselves above God. For, first, they take upon themselves to dictate for the people the form of religious worship which they shall observe; and secondly they prescribe the punishment which shall be inflicted upon them for a failure to conform to that practice. But both these things belong alone to God.

"And, further, the Sabbath observance which is secured by such a law as is contemplated by these petitioners, is not directed to God at all, but to man instead; because, 'his servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,' and obedience is the highest form of worship. And therefore this law, instead of securing better Sabbath observance, would establish idolatry; for it does require the worship of a creature instead of the Creator. Instead of securing better observance of the fourth commandment, it requires a direct violation of the first. Instead of being in harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ, it is directly opposed to it; for Christ himself said, 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve.' Hence it is true that thoes who are instrumental in securing this law do indeed 'exalt themselves above God' by directing to themselves that worship which belongs alone to God.

"The forms and practices of the Christian religion were not instituted by the aid of civil power, but in spite of it, and in direct opposition to it. The Author of this religion was crucified by the civil power, and all his disciples save one was persecuted to the death; yet in spite of all this persecution, the gospel prevailed, and won its way into the hearts of the people. But in its exaltation lay its greatest danger; for the discernment of an ambitious monarch saw the power which this new religion was exerting in the earth, and with the object of strengthening his own power, he made Christianity the religion of the State, enforcing its forms and ceremonies by the pains and penalties of civil law. Oh, the blight it brought! As well might he have thought to aid the Almighty in causing the earth to bring forth grass and herbs and animate creatures, as to think of rendering assistance by civil power to the propagation of the gospel in the hearts of men. But in spite of this withering curse that caused the pall of darkness to settle over the age that followed; in spite of the rivers of blood which this unhallowed union caused to flow from millions of bleeding martyrs; in spite of the clouds of smoke that ascended to heaven from myriad consuming bodies of saints, the gospel prevailed, and to-day—a happy people—we enjoy the liberty which the gospel has secured to us; thus showing that the power of God is mightier than the mightiest power of earth, and that it is to prevail, 'not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts,' and that is the only power in this world that can save a human soul from sin.

"But instead of profiting by these fearful lessons of the past, instead of directing their prayers to God for more of his spirit and power to convert sinners, we find thousands of the professed ministers of Christ in this fair Dominion putting up their petitions to Parliament instead of to God, for a law to save themselves and the rest of the people from the sin of Sabbath breaking! Seeking the assistance of the civil power to enforce the principles of Christianity! In the name of all that is good, has the gospel of Jesus Christ lost its saving power? or have these petitioners lost the power of the gospel? When any form of religious worship has been so sadly neglected that it is about to die a natural death, it can never be brought to life by the power of civil law. 'Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord, weep between the porch and the altar!' Let them cry mightily to God for salvation from the sin of Sabbath breaking! Let them be clothed with the righteousness of Christ and armed with the weapons of spiritual warfare; and with the law of God for their guide, and the gospel of Christ for their salvation, they would go forth conquering and to conquer. And the cowardly call for assistance from civil authority would give place to thanksgiving, and honer, and power, and might, unto our God forever and ever. Amen."
