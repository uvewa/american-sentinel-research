"It is remarkable news in our cable dispatch," says the Sun, "that the British Wesleyan Conference had passed a full hour in praying for the conversion of the Prince of Wales. Among all the criticisms that have yet been made upon the Prince, this is the criticism that he will be likely to feel the most keenly." That which above all things else makes this remarkable is the fact that there is nothing but a life, which already exceeds the three score and ten years, between the Prince of Wales and the throne of Great Britain and the headship of two great Protestant churches, namely, the established Churches of England and Scotland. But such incongruities are inherent in Church and State unions.
