"The bishop and the rector of the Latin school at Viborg, Jutland," says the Recorder, "are calling each other names and setting a bad example. The bishop intimates that the rector is a heathen, while the rector retorts in effect that the distinguished divine is a Pharisee and a nincompoop. It is all about the school gymnasium, which the rector had allowed a club of young men to use for two hours on Sunday forenoons. This, says the bishop, is paganism; according to the rector, it is simple justice to the young men, who are clerks with no other holiday, and, if not allowed the use of the dumb-bells, would certainly prefer the public bars to the bishop's pulpit as by far the more exhilarating. The bishop appeals to the king, and the rector is sat upon. In his turn he publishes the whole correspondence, and public sentiment reviles the bishop and provides for the shut-out clerks a private gymnasium."
