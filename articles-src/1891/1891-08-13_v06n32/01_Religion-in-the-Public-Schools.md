In view of the demand that the State shall teach religion in the public schools, it is a pertinent question to ask, What kind of a religion? This question is not always fairly answered by those who make the proposition. It is generally answered in a vague and indefinite way that leaves the question as much unanswered as before. It is sometimes answered, "The Christian Religion." But then the question still recurs, What kind of Christian religion? Shall it be the Presbyterian Christian religion? or the Methodist Christian religion? or the Lutheran Christian religion? or the Roman Catholic Christian religion? Which of them is it that shall be taught in the public schools?

It is a genuine fact that the moment theology allies itself with the State and commands its power, it becomes persecuting in respect to all who dissent from it, and that, too, whether it be pagan or Christian, Catholic or Protestant. History paints this fact in lurid colors.

Nor is there anything strange or unnatural in such a fact. It results from the very nature of the case. The theology of the State is a part of its organic of state-law, and, of course, it should be sustained by its authority and power. Heresy is, therefore, a crime or really a murder, and as such it should be punished. So the State reasons, and that, too, correctly, provided we accept the doctrines of State theology. [page 249] That all States and Protestant States have reasoned in this way. What we call religious persecution is the State's punishment to prevent crime. What we call religious liberty it calls a dangerous exercise of private judgment. Saul of Tarsus was a conscientious persecutor, regarding himself as doing God service, and it is but just to say that State theologies have generally been conscientious in their deeds of murder and blood. They have not looked upon themselves as ruffians and outlaws, but rather as the conservators of the divine honor and the true interests of wells. The thoughts of an after and a wiser age were not their thoughts when they trampled the religious rights of men into the dust and shocked heaven, if not earth, with their cruelties. Religious and military is a terrible passion; and all State theologies, when administered by bigots, are sure to have this mal.—*Rev. Dr. Spear.*
