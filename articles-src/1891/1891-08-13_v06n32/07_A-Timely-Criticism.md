Rev. Minot J. Savage, in the Boston *Arena* for August, criticises a paper which appeared in the *July* number of that magazine, written by Rev. Francis Bellamy, in which was advocated a larger measure of paternalism in government. In the course of his article, Mr. Savage says:—

Whatever may be in the future, when men get wiser and better, all the past experience and fact in the history of the world it has been true that the rights of the individual are most vital. And so far, the only safety of the individual has been in limiting the power of government. And liberties we have limited the governmental power. And I am not sure we need the warning that whenever human nature is to be transferred, it will be just as well to maintain its degradation; instead of putting still more power into the hands of the Government—whether it be monarchy or a republic. While even one will is abroad, the personality will not get out of despotism.

Further along he says—

> The foregoing sentiments would lead any to think that Sunday laws had not. ... in the shape of a "law" ..."to be a Sunday by-law. It might be supposed from what has been ...

These are timely and well-deserved criticisms. The truth is that those who say these are assertions in the last named organized for what, in the end, can be no other than the destruction of the safeguards of civil and religious liberty found in our national Constitution, even of every form of liberty.
