"GOVERNMENTS must be liberal enough," says Judge Zane, "to tolerate all religions." The Judge forgets that "what other nations call religious toleration we call religious rights." Government has nothing to do in tolerating religion. That which government merely tolerates it may prohibit. Governments should keep their hands off religion because of the fact that they can properly have nothing whatever to do with it.
