THE Grand Republic and the General Slocum are two excursion boats which carry seven thousand persons, and more, to and from Rockaway Beach every pleasant Sunday during the heated term, and are principally owned by influential Brooklyn church members.

These conscientious men have used their Sunday leisure in devising some plan by which to serve God and Mammon and signify their deep religious reverence for Sunday as a sacred institution while at the same time pocketing the Sunday revenues from their boats.

That they have discovered just the way to accomplish this is shown by what an official of one of the boats said to a reporter of the Sun: "You can bet that Sabbath-breaking on these boats will never be permitted! It was only three weeks ago that one of our best directors heard that dancing was permitted on the Grand Republic and the General Slocum, on Sunday. He stopped it pretty quick, and it will be stopped for all summer."

Both of these boats have a bar, and liquors are sold on Sundays as well as other days, so the service of Mammon is not in the least interfered with. If the wise man were alive now he would number another class among those whose ways were past finding out—the Sunday reformers.
