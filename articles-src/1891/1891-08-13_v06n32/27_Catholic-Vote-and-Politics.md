THE following from the Catholic Review is significant:—

> Commissioner Morgan has so successfully fought Catholic public opinion during the last two years as to feel strong enough to break openly with the Catholic body in America. His refusal to deal with the Indian bureau can be taken this way. President Harrison and his party are no doubt prepared to suffer the odium which this commissioner's policy has won for them among Catholics; still we are not certain of this. At the banquet tendered to Mr. Clarkson a few days ago, that gentleman spoke with enthusiasm of the Irish-Americans who were naturally Republicans, and of the necessity of bringing them into the Republican fold. Mr. Clarkson will find Morgan in his way. No Catholic vote should be placed for an administration and a party which put Morgan and Dorchester in office, and so favored the bigotry of these two worthies as to let their anti-Catholic policy not only have a beginning, but reach a sort of maturity. We can understand the difficulty which the President might have in completely extinguishing these worthy evangelical officials; but we can not see what difficulty he meets in restraining their ardor and snuffing out their bigoted policy. And, by the way, where have been all this time the worthy Catholics of Republican politics, who are always so eager to show that their party is not hostile to Catholicity? Perhaps the great Archbishop of St Paul can tell us.

Just how the Catholic vote will relate itself to the present administration or to the party now in power, is a matter of small moment. The words of the Review are significant because they reveal a growing disposition to unite religion and politics, and that not in the sense that the Christian voter should act honestly because he is a Christian, but in the sense that he will support only that party which will show favors to his particular church, or to his particular religion.

Nor is this tendency confined to the Roman Catholic Church. Protestants are adopting the same tactics, and are threatening with political death every man in public life who refuses to do the bidding of certain organizations which have assumed to themselves the responsibility of dictating the morals of their neighbors.
