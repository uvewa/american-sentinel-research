I have watched the Columbian Sunday closing movement with much interest, and am surprised to find that thus far there has been no indication of an alliance between the liquor dealers and the ministry in bringing about the desired result. It only needs to be said, to the liquor dealers' interest to have the Exposition closed on Sunday. Whether it be closed or opened on that day will make no difference to such as have a predilection for church services; such would attend church in either case. It would make a difference whether the Fair be closed or open, to the other class, but this difference of it will be wholly favorable to the close. It is altogether favor. Thousands will be in Chicago during the Fair who do not care for religious institutions or who can indifferently attend them. Who inconveniently observe Sunday will not be kept from church should the Exposition be opened on that day, and know if it be closed it will effect the religiously indifferent and the unbelieving. It will alienate from Christianity the man who already has an indifferent leaning toward it, because if he is not just man he will be unsatisfied by anything that is coercion. This, religion will be the loser and that from accepting every chance when the Sunday closing movement is in the ascendancy. But upon this the liquor result there will be a positive result. The injustice and coercion of this movement will drive the religiously indifferent man, who might have attended church regularly during his stay in Chicago, if [page 251] left to exercise the free will God has given him, over to the positively irreligious ranks, as far as Sunday observance is concerned, during the Fair, if indeed it does not order him entirely antagonistic to all religious institutions at all times. Having now joined the two companies, the Sunday closing movement will not stop there, for with a clean, healthful and absorbing exhibition to go to, and with no saloon, thousands of these very ones who thus have curtailed God-given liberties, in hopes to save will receive them cheerfully to show to whom the Sunday-keepers have driven them. A missionary apparently earned a reward of love is one our can perfectly enjoy.

There must be some reason why the saloon keepers have not joined hands with the Sunday advocate. It certainly cannot be for lack of persuasion by the latter, as much is to be pursued, also, since every body ought to know that the advocate of the country's law is bearing about in coming to border territories Sunday will still not find any suitable anybody. Lodge their complete ... Before the closure movement, there can be no doubt, the saloon keeper's interest is well be served by the Fair, and the liquor interests will be far from losing by the success of the movement to close the Fair on Sunday.

There must be some reason why the saloon keeper has not joined hands with the Sunday advocate. It certainly cannot be for lack of persuasion. It is true the Sunday closing movement after all is to be pursued, also, since everybody ought to know that the advocate of the country is bearing about in coming border territories; Sunday will still not be enough ... their traffic the other six days. Therefore, to turn up, since it is in the saloon keeper's interest to have the Fair closed on Sundays, since he would be welcomed as an ally, and since the "Sabbath" reformers have manifested solicitude for his spiritual welfare, why has he not joined the Columbian Sunday closing movement?
