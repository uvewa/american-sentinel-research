Maxims and traditional phrases are one of the safeguards of liberty. This is true, in common of these rather passive safeguards all the force of law. Take for instance the colonists who asserted the time-honored American principle that "taxation without representation is tyranny." This particular colonists would not carry hear a denial of that principle than they would to have a decrease taken place under; in fact, they considered that a submission to any act of tax by Parliament was a submission to slavery. Hence, the Revolution, and American liberty.

There is another political idea which the American mind holds just as dearly,—which just as great a reverence, and as does the foregoing maxim; and that is the idea of "Church and State."

Knowing this to be true, and knowing that any one who would presume to agitate openly for any such thing, would not stand any chance whatever of success, modern and so "reformers," who hold precisely the same opinions, are working for precisely the same thing under the name of law and force of government, and applicable denominational ideas. In the name they act,—not assent that "Church and State," say, are "totally opposed to Church and State," and yet are working to make this a Christian State.

It is a specimen of *Jesuitical* chicanery that American people, who for a century have enjoyed the unparalleled blessings of religious liberty, should not see the subtilty of at once. They most assuredly will see it, and most assuredly will, if they still have the spirit of liberty in them that was in the American people a century ago. The English Government attempted a similar deception upon the colonists by taking them under another name. But the plan did not succeed then. Will it succeed now?

It is a mistake to suppose that the American idea of separation of Church and State is expressed by the term "Church and State;" in fact that term was comparatively little used; but as against the consolidation, against the atonement and religion being connected in any way or having anything to do with each other.

Now that the great American Government was to preserve religion in its purity and integrity, and to confine the State to civil affairs, and not simply to object to what some people call "Church and State," I have collected a few terms and by one of the early American statesmen, James Madison—the "father of the Amer- [page 252] ican Constitution." Those are simply gathered at random, and I do not suppose the begin to represent all of the terms in the writings. Himself, most lines of that of that most interesting period of our country's history.

So of Madison's expressed views:

"The veteran error of entailing the civil and ecclesiastical polity;" "distinct forever what is due to Caesar and what is due to God;" "established precedence of the religious and civil polity;" "religious establishments;" "ecclesiastical establishments;" "established Christianity" (not established need); "religion (not established need); "religion blindness;" "union of the civil and ecclesiastical polity."

Fully as many and various terms in reference to our religious equality: such as these: "equal right of every sect;" "religious opinions and worship;" "religious equality of rights which it [the American Constitution] regards all sects [or every sect] as entitled."

Washington, Madison, and Jefferson declared as plainly as words could express, and did Christianity or religion of any kind more claims whatever upon the Government than any other religion.

Washington's treaty with Tripoli declares: "The Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;" and asserted further that it was "in its institution a character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility of Mussulmans."

And Madison in his speech in the Virginia Assembly against the establishment of religion said:—

"What is Christianity?

Has not this established ... courts of law will define it ...

And then again he asked,

"Is it frustration, stratification, and so we say, etc., etc."

And then he added:— "I rule in what ..." .

This is what Madison feared with regard to a "Christian Nation" ...

"That the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other religions, may establish, with the same ease, any particular sect of Christians, to the exclusion of all other sects."

And Jefferson, who wrote the celebrated Declaration and was entitled the "apostle of freedom," tells how the Assembly supposed him in his views, giving his statement: "... that ... a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy Author of our religion ... that they ... ought to mount a ground of ... in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its ..."

... threat that the presence and patronage of great multitudes of the Christian people of the United States will certainly be withheld if their convictions on this subject are ignored.

This is a boycott. In commenting upon the boycott, Representative Sam Small said in that inimitable way so peculiar to himself that he had "threatened his opponents with four Congressmen from Georgia and they still would not and on the other hand that they will vote any more money from Congress worst this question of Sunday closing is settled." This is the financial boycott of which Sam Small pledges the Congressmen from his State.

He also pledged himself, on pain of being used, boycott! "given closer ground" if he failed, that the next Georgia Legislature would "instruct their delegates to declare Georgia out of the Exposition unless it is closed on Sunday." This is Sam Small's legislative boycott.

Further, referring to the decision of the Sunday-closing party or petitioners, the Local Directory, composed entirely of citizens of the city of Chicago, he said,

Leave this question to be decided by those thirty men in Chicago and there isn't a yelps of Georgia... were not directed to ...

This is Sam Small's boycott for the whole State of Georgia. No one could possibly have expected, when the boycott was put first introduced, that its ugly and persuasive measures is the settlement of differences of opinion between capital and labor, that it was destined, in the hands of the American Sabbath Union, to become one of the greatest missionary forces of the age, possibly one of the chief factors in connecting this Nation to a National Reform Christianity.
