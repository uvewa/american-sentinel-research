THE Watertown, (Wisconsin) Republican, of July 8, contains a list of fifty-three business men who have agreed together to close their business places on Sundays, on and after August 16, 1891. It is the undeniable right of these gentlemen to close their business, and no one could object if every business man in the United States would decide of his own choice to discontinue work on Sunday. But it is subversive of all the correct principles of civil law to compel men by statute to rest on Sunday, or any other day.
