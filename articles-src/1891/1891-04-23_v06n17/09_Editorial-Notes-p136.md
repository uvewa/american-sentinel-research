SAMUEL T. SPEAR, M. D., D. D., LL.D., and author of several books, is dead. Of his work on "Religion and the State," the *Independent* says: "This volume is the last exponent of the doctrine, which was boldly maintained in his oral and written dissertations and in his orations, that Church and State should be absolutely separated, that Church property should be taxed, and that the Bible should not be required to be read in the public schools."

AN appeal to the ten commandments sent through the Union Commercial Chronicle, recently failed. It appears that in his testimony before a committee, Deacon Richard Smith, of the *Commercial Gazette*, testified that he believed that the ten commandments could not be passed by the Common Council without bribery. This made some of the constituents angry, and consequently one of them introduced in the committee the motion recorded above, passed under the suspension of the rules. The chairman ruled the motion out of order, and so the commandments were dropped.

A WORTHY paper complains that in the name and behalf of Pennsylvania "no provision is made in favor of those Jews and seventh-day Christians, who observe Saturday instead of Sunday." It also argues that "the latter especially have been persecuted on several cases for prosecution or persecution." We believe that both these statements are true, the former certainly, but the world the better, so long as its kind not only in degrees, if it made is exempted in favor of seventh-day Christians. Such laws are wrong in principle, and all exemptions are really a confession of that wrong.

**The Catholic Review** is calling for the formation of a Catholic party in the United States similar to the Catholic party in Germany. In urging this, it says:— "Organization upon this basis would be a very good start in America. It is the—or we would fain it we see the formation of a solid Catholic political party, to do the legislator's work which the sects have failed to do; such a party would have to greater strength than its numbers on its real organization its sincerity, and its need now would care for it. It could unite with any party at the reaching of Christian legislation, a process now going on everywhere."

This is simply saying that Catholics would unite with Protestants in securing legislation favorable to those features of Christianity common to Romanist and Protestant alike; that is, those great bodies would, as the National Reformers long since proposed, simply sink their bonds in insisting what they are pleased to call "political alliance," which is simply a logical and consistent divorce of Church and State. Those who trust to the differences between papists and Protestants to preserve religious liberty may awake by and by to the fact that they have trusted to a broken reed.

The *Oddfellow*, of Victoria, British Columbia, comes to us containing an article boldly challenging the authority of Sunday as a sacred day, and asserting that it is not the Sabbath by divine appointment. This is one effect of the demand for more stringent Sunday laws, and one rather uncalled for by its friends, for the raising of this question does not seem to embarrass the Sunday law advocates in the least. It is true that it is a point that will not bear too close scrutiny, but the absence of divine law means only to make them the more anxious to secure human laws; as while the demand for Sunday laws stimulates this wholesome inquiry into the claims, the inquiry disturbs them in the slightest.

We have been severely critical of everything that came from New England, and the Puritan character, but did not burn persons accused of witchcraft. We are, however, confident that the statements are true. A patient and careful search of the best histories to be found in the libraries of this city has failed to reveal even a hint of any mode of execution of witches in this country, other than hanging; and we are supported in this conclusion by the well-known writer, W. S. Nevins, of Salem, Massachusetts, in which he says: "There was never a witch burned in New England." Mr. Nevins is engaged in writing a history of Salem witchcraft, and his ability as a writer, and his facilities for observation, give assurance that his work will be the best ever written.

Lee & Shepard, Boston, will bring this book out in May, and we shall embrace the earliest opportunity to give our readers further information concerning it.

APRIL 3, Rev. H. E. Mott, of Dubuque, Iowa, delivered a sermon upon the subject, "Shall the World's Fair Be Opened on Sunday?" "The church was crowded," says the *Herald*, "and among the congregation was Senator William B. Allison." The preacher took strong ground against the opening of the Exposition on Sunday, stating that it could only accommodate the residents of Chicago who only could visit the Fair as often as they desired on week days.

At the close of the sermon Mr. Mott asked all those in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday to rise. Almost the entire congregation rose, but Senator Allison kept his seat. Various interpretations are put on his action, but it is generally considered to be intended to signify his opposition to the preacher's position.

FIRMLY rooted, convictions, on the truths of Christianity, and acknowledging with gratitude the usages of religion, we disclaim the right and the desire to impose our views on any of our subjects. We declare it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any way molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observances, but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and it is strictly charged upon and enjoined, that they abide in any mutiny in order that they devote all interfere with or disturb the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects, on pain of our highest displeasure.—*Queen's Quarto.*

We have received Volume 5, Number 1, of the *Quarterly Register of Current History*, published by the *Evening News* Association, of Detroit, Michigan. It designs in its make by the publishers, bringing together at intervals of three months, in neat and substantial form, the acknowledged matter of its text and the work in the everyday research, and the *Quarterly Register* is not a publication to be read through and thrown away. It is really a classified work of facts too valuable to miss. To them, and for us to be books of a book library which will have a more direct interest to every generation as it with time further removes every one's recollection. The want of some such publication has long been felt. It makes no claim to be an original work. As nearly all the State papers are too bulky for preservation, and being otherwise unobtainable from the nature of things, these have, on the whole field of history, a special value not readily to be estimated. The result is that recent history, while the most instructive, by reason of its important facts, is the most difficult to find any convenient and classified form. The subscription price is $1.50 per year.

The design is a good one, and the first number promises well. Its ultimate success is certainly well worth the effort of the publishers to bring it about.
