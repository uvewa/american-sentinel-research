WRITING of Sunday laws, and of exemption clauses in favor of those who observe another day, a correspondent of the New Era, a Prohibition organ, says:

>"As Americans who prize the principles of liberty, we do not want any law which must exempt from its operation any person because of his conscientious convictions. The State has no business to pass any law which, in its general and equal application to all, would interfere with any person's religious rights. As a matter of fact, "such principles of (mis)government" have always been "disputed." Is it not perfectly plain that the ground assigned for exemptions in such laws is a prima facie admission that the spirit of the law is religiously intolerant?

>And is it not equally evident that any person who prefers to observe a different day than the majority, with all its attendant business inconveniences, does it from conscientious motives? And yet does any freedom of conscience "exist practically" when a man whose conscientious convictions are stronger than his "preferences" for a good job, is compelled by law to lose another day besides his Sabbath, and that on the pretense that another man may suffer no pecuniary loss from following his conscience?"
