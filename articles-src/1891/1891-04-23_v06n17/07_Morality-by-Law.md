Don't leave moral work to be done by the law. We do not want to see our ministers acting as searchers and informers. Others can do that. They have a work which others can not do. It is theirs to do the work which their great Example did. He saved men from their sins, but not with the sword of Caesar.—*Iowa State Register*.

If moral work was left to be done by law it would never be done, because it is not the province of law to make men moral. It is away beyond the power of law to implant morality in the heart, or even to beget in the heart the desire to be moral. Anything short of the gospel of Christ can have nothing to do with implanting moral principles and moral impulses in the human breast, and whenever anybody talks about legislating morality into man he talks about an impossible thing. Morality is conformity to the moral law, and no man and no woman has ever in this world conformed to the moral law without divine help, because the law is spiritual and reaches to the thoughts and intents of the heart. And whenever we hear people talk about Sunday laws in the interest of morality, we set it down that such persons know but little about morality, or that they want laws that will lay down what a person shall think, and laws that will map out what a person shall believe and what he shall not believe. But this would involve the Inquisition, for how can it be known what a person's thoughts are if he does not choose to divulge them, except they be wrung from him by the rack and the thumbscrew, and by similar persuasive measures?

The work of the minister of Christ is truly, as the *Register* says, "to do the work which their great Example did." If they do this they will preach his gospel and cease to wire-work legislatures in the interests of morality and of the Church. The minister of Christ should never engage in any political work—not even to vote—as a minister, and not even as a Christian. If he feels he must take part in civil affairs, let him do it as a man, as a citizen merely, and not as a religionist. Our Government is a civil Government and is for the citizen, for the good of man in this life, and it has nothing to do with the other life, and for a man even to vote with the intention of fashioning legislation in the interest of any church creed, or of any religious tenet, would be using the franchise in an unlawful way.
