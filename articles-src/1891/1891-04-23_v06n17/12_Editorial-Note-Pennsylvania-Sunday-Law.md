A WESTERN paper complains that in the Sunday law of Pennsylvania "no exemption is made in favor of those Jews and seventh-day Christians, who observe Saturday as their Sabbath," and remarks that "the latter especially have been singled out in several cases for prosecution or persecution." We believe that both these statements are true, the former certainly is, but the law would be better, not in kind but only in degree, if it made an exemption in favor of seventh-day Christians. Such laws are wrong in principle, and exemptions are really a confession of this fact.
