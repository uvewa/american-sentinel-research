## Compulsion.

"ANY one who gives drink in vessels of gold and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king, and the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure."

The religion of Christ is not one of force. The royal wine at the king's feast was offered none to excess; it would have been a violation of the king's law to use force in this case; for the law was that none should be compelled to drink, the very opposite of compulsion.

If any man felt the need of the wine that was free to him, free without money or price; and if he did not want it he was not compelled to take it.

It was forbidden to none, and forced upon none. A man may observe or profess to keep the Sabbath, if he is inclined, and it anointed for not drinking. It was like God's grace, this gospel; it is for all who may feel the need of it. It matters not how low and sinful a man may feel himself to be, he is not forbidden to go to Christ. And then, his conscience bearing for all his sinfulness, and the more he feels the sin upon him, the more is growing in grace; for it is in growing the more is displayed the life, and the times of the life more revealed to him.

All the fitness he requires is the sense of need of him.

The king made no requisition upon the poverty of his subjects to aid him in providing the feast for them, but he taught it. He set God and taught Paul what he need be of "My grace is sufficient for thee." He taught them that he was rich unto all and loved them enough for the attainment of the life for them.

The feast was designed to show the riches of his gracious kingdom. And this is what God's grace does; it shows the riches of grace; that God's grace is rich enough to supply every need, and dialogue with sin's every arrayed, a dialogue, each has who not only not a good neighbor or desire to contribute, but who is a willing subject of his ancestry to God. "My grace is rich enough to move just any soul in coming and if it do not rich him, that not sinner has ever been or ever will be lost."

It is sufficient to force it upon men and no form of force is its religious impetus anywhere. When a person actually requires the force, if he desires, transfer to another village, not he desires them for it, change actually by name and John to do so; he not be rebuked them for making a request so contrary to his spirit. There has been recently a good deal of talk, by religious people, about Sabbath keeping, and a disposition is seen to force men to keep it as a religious institution. But this is not the Spirit of God?
