## Establishment of Religious Liberty in Virginia.

THE cause for the celebrated memorial of James Madison, which appeared in a late SENTINEL, was the introduction in the Virginia Legislature of "a bill making a provision for the 'teachers of the Christian religion.'" In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, dated at Richmond, January 9, 1785, Madison gave the following account of its origin:—

> A motion for a legal provision for the "teachers of the Christian religion" had for its origin a resolution proposed by Mr. Henry, and, in spite of the opposition that could be mustered, carried by forty votes against twenty-five votes. Many lessons from those since the Blair Bill began to be heard; and through several from the Pendleton family favored it was a version in a country, the clergy of that sect favored. In the other country of the papers, they have not favored them. A week before it was called for, after the Episcopal General Council, it was taken up, and on the third reading ordered, as also the bill for petition for permission. The bill, in its present form, has a list of all sects, and a blank as for all taxable property, for support of teachers of the Christian religion. After the word "Christian" a motion was lost, to name the society to which he dedicates it, and to make of what he offered it, so that he was to join the maintenance of a school of the country. He still stood for some time, the application in general, and has now become again a passage in committee. In a committee of the whole it was defeated by a majority, but by a plurality the word "Christian" should be exchanged for the word "religious" in the report of this. The result and of the late Governor Harrison gained in the legislative effort; the understanding of whether the bill pass into a law in the present form, it may and in the next be made. It is also not in committee on account of its dishonorable principle and dangerous tendency.—*Writings of James Madison.*

One of the noblest characteristics of our early statesmen and patriots, as Madison said, was their jealous regard for our liberty. The least step toward infringement aroused the patriotism of Americans everywhere; and as a result of this spirit

Henry's bill providing for the teachers of the Christian religion raised opposition in every part of the State, and a petition went up from the patriots of Virginia that Henry's bill would soon down forever, and in its stead Jefferson's act for establishing religious freedom was brought forward. It still remains in the statute books of Virginia as an everlasting monument to the worthy of Madison, Jefferson, and his co-workers; Jefferson's, bill, in which he ever took a just pride, and whose will inform written among the first row of our country, is as follows:

### AN ACT FOR ESTABLISHING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

[page 133]

WELL AWARE that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time;

No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, ministry, or place whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.

It required more than nine years of effort on the part of Jefferson, Madison, and their liberal friends, to bring Virginia to accept the wisdom of the religious liberty problem, in its simplicity and comprehensiveness.—*Parker's Life of Jefferson.*

But, thanks to their tolerant efforts, the principles of entire religious liberty, the absolute separation of church and state, were fully adopted, and a century of unparalleled progress had been the result thereof. The duty of the American citizen to-day is to see that this liberty is secured to every citizen, and that the institutions of these great men shall not be thwarted.
