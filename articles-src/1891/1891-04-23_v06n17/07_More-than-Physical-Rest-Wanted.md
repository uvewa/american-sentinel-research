## More than Physical Rest Wanted.

First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

It is a notable fact that for all that is said about a Sunday rest being so much needed for the poor laboring man, for the laboring men are putting forth earnest claims to obtain it, if they are indeed so claiming. As Religious workers we would urge them not from the claims of some, in indeed earnest strongings that their cities and crimes strongings should not be issued. About the only ones who are found championing a compulsory Sunday law are ministers.

Let no surprise, the complete, naturally arises as to whether this is not, after all, merely a religious scheme gotten up in the interests of the Church. But we are assured that this is not the case; that the Sunday is not intended, by being compelled everyday to be religious, but that it is simply in the interest of the laboring man,—to give him a day of physical rest, and make Sunday simply a civil rest.

This looks plausible, and to quite an extent always captivates. But still there remains just a lingering query why it is always the minister who are interested in this religious affair, and as Sunday is a church celebration, here is it that these drones are to be laboring for it only in the interests of man's physical nature. Indeed, it looks like quite a fresh in human nature.

But let us compare those ideas with a quotation from some of the authorities and documents and representative workers in this movement and see if this is the closest point in this movement. First, the

American Sabbath Union in its Constitution thus declares its object:—

> The object of the American Sabbath Union is to preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

> — The Blair Sunday rest bill of the Fifty-fifth Congress closed thus:—

> The new shall be construed to far as possible to review to the whole people rest, but during the first day of the week, their moral and intellectual, and the religious and observance of that Sabbath day.

Rev. W. F. Crafts, before the Knights of Labor, in Chicago, November 29, 1888, said:—

> A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land except on a basis of religious obligation. Take the religion out and you take the rest day out.

Joseph Cook, in one of his Monday morning lectures, said:—

> The experience of centuries shows that you will in vain endeavor to preserve Sunday as a day of rest unless you preserve it as a day of worship.

And Mrs. J. C. J. Bateham, Superintendent of the Sabbath observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in the *Christian Statesman*, of April 11, 1889, said:—

> We want it for the purpose for which God designed it—when he made it purely for, not for travel or rest in this world conformed to the moral duty and amusement, or for sleep and idleness, but for the Sunday for-script, with the desecration of the way that would give spiritual improvement, including the word of God, and for corporate worship.

This puts a rather different face on the question. In the light of these statements all this pulpit about a civil Sabbath, and wanting a Sunday law simply that the poor laboring man may have his physical rest vanishes into the air. It reminds us of the transaction whispering and at thus ingenuously addressed the landlady: "Madam, would you please let me be able to get me a drink of water, for I'm so hungry I don't know where I'm going to sleep to-night." So with this conserving the Sunday. They want a civil Sunday law because thus the religious observance of the day is so small they do not know what they are going to offer for churches.

The whole policy of this movement appears to be that of the man who advertised to give, a minister in San Diego, California.

> In this thing you must ask not for too much at first. Just put what public sentiment will leave and that you can take will not be thrown out.

> It is manifestly attracted by which side was got control of the civil power that it may be used as a tool to play into the hands of the Church. First watch a law compelling a man to rest. But this only paves the way to compel for religion him to go to church and worship— with his pockets book at least. It is as the plan of the Western farmer who wanted more money to buy more land to raise more corn to feed more hogs to get more money to buy more land to raise more corn, etc. So these Sunday law advocates want a compulsory Sunday law to

make more people keep Sunday to get more to attend church to get more money to pay more preachers to get more laws to make more Sunday-keepers, etc. They want the whole thing.
