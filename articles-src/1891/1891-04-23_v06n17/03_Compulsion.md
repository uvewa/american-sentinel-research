"AND they gave them drink in vessels of gold, and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king, and the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so had the king appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure.—Esther 1.

The religion of Christ is not one of force. The royal wine at the king's feast was forced upon none; it would have been a violation of the king's law to force it upon any; for the law was that every man should drink it according to his pleasure. If any man felt the need of it the wine was free to him, free without money or price; and if he did not want it he was not compelled to drink it.

It was forbidden to none, and forced upon none. A man deserved no praise for drinking it, and merited no censure for not drinking it. It was like God's grace in the gospel, that is for all who may feel the need of it. It matters not how vile and sinful the man may feel himself to be, he is not forbidden to go to Christ. And indeed, the more conscious he is of his sinfulness, and the more he feels the need of the royal wine, the more he appreciates the king's grace in providing it for him; and the more is displayed in him the riches of the glorious kingdom of grace.

>All the fitness he requireth
>Is to feel your need of him.
>This he gives.

The king made no requisition upon the poverty of his subjects to aid him in providing the feast for them, but he taught them as God taught Paul when he said to him, "My grace is sufficient for thee."—He taught them that he was rich enough and loved them enough to bear all the expense of it for them.

The feast was designed to show the riches of his glorious kingdom. And that is what God's grace does; it shows the riches of grace; that God's grace is rich enough to save a sinner, a dead, helpless, bankrupt and impoverished sinner, one who has not only not a good thought or desire to contribute, but who is a willing subject of sin and an enemy to God. God's grace is rich enough to save just such a sinner; and if it is not that rich, then not one sinner has ever been or ever will be saved.

It is antichrist to force it upon any. Christ did not force himself or his religion upon anybody. When a certain Samaritan village would not receive him, he went with his disciples to another village; nor would he destroy them for it, though solicited by James and John to do so; but he rebuked them for making a request so contrary to his spirit. There has been recently a good deal of talk, by religious people, about Sabbath keeping, and a disposition is seen to force men to keep it as a religious institution. Now is that of the Spirit of God?

Rev. M. A. Gault, of Blanchard, Iowa, has said:—

>Whether the Constitution [of the United States] will be set right upon the question of the moral supremacy of God's law in the Government, without a bloody revolution, or not, depends upon the strength and resistance of the forces of antichrist.

He calls opposition to the religion of force antichrist, when the truth is, that the religion of force is antichrist.

He further said,

>Don't think that we are advocating war, but if we are not successful in the use of other means, as it was with the anti-slavery question after they had agitated, and petitioned, and used the ballot, they drew the sword; so shall we as a last resort, be compelled to use the sword and the bullet.

The plea is that this is a Christian Government, but that is not true, for there is but one Christian Government, and that is the government of that kingdom that is not of this world. This is a civil and not a religious Government, a Government of all sorts of people—black and white, Jew and Christian, believer and unbeliever—one in which the rights of the Jew are secured as well as the rights of the Christian, the unbeliever as well as the believer, and in which they are each and all members of the same civil body, and equals before the law.

It is one of the chief glories of our Government that it is one in which religion is free; and it becomes every citizen of the country, whether religious or irreligious, to see that it is kept free, and that there shall be under no form, even the semblance of a union of Church and State.

It will not do to give undue influence and power to any religious denomination, whether Protestant or Catholic. "It is good," said the eminent historian J. L. Motley, in his Dutch Republic, "that the world should not forget, how much wrong has been endured in the sacred name of God. It is good that these crimes should be remembered and freshly pondered."

The Roman Catholics, when they controlled the religion of the world, let no mode escape them, in which human beings have ever caused their fellow creatures to suffer. Men, women, and children, old and young, nobles and paupers, opulent burghers, hospital patients, lunatics, dead bodies, all were indiscriminately made to furnish food for the scaffold and the stake.

A poor Anabaptist guilty of no crime but his fellowship with a persecuted sect, had been condemned to death. He had made his escape, closely pursued by an officer across a frozen lake. It was late in the winter, and the ice had become unsound; it trembled and creaked beneath his foot-steps but he reached the shore in safety. The officer was not so fortunate, the ice gave way beneath him, and he sank into the lake uttering a cry for succor. There was none to hear except the fugitive he had been hunting. Dirk Williamson, for so the Anabaptist was called, instantly obeying the dictates of a generous nature, returned, crossed the dangerous and quaking ice, at the peril of his life, extended his hand to his enemy and saved him from certain death. Unfortunately for human nature, it can not be added that the generosity of the action was met by a corresponding heroism. The officer was desirous, it is true, of avoiding the responsibility of sacrificing the preserver of his life, but the burgomaster sternly reminded him to remember his oath. He accordingly arrested the fugitive who, on the 16th of May following, was burned to death under the most lingering tortures.—See Motley's Dutch Republic.

Motley was not a religious historian, and may therefore be credited as free from religious bias. These results follow in the wake of religion that is forced upon men. It grows up slowly and insidiously at first, but eventually gets control of men and governments; and then in the name of Christ, persecutes, oppresses, and murders all who do not bow the knee to it.
