"My kingdom is not of this world." "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the thing that are God's," and other New Testament texts in the same trend set forth principles, fidelity to which requires the severance of religious from civil matters. Any departure from such principles must therefore be antichristian, as is also any religious doctrine or practice that has ever been enforced or maintained by civil law, since whatever is Christian must be supported by Christian means. As baptismal civil legislation has in all probability seen its last days, and Catholics and quasi-Catholics probably can not again, or will not, by man's menances and laws, force those to discard their scriptural baptism or have their children sprinkled, who have in such matters taken God's law as their guide, no further discussion of that phase of the subject is necessary, save to call attention to the fact that these things bear the stamp of error upon them, because they have been heretofore enforced by civil legislation; truth needs no such support. But with Sunday observance the case is different. The power of civil law is still invoked in its favor. Papists, by their agencies, and Protestants, through the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, the third party, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, are all uniting to enforce the observance of Sunday by civil law. The former are repeating their tactics of the ante-Reformation era when they supplanted the Sabbath of Jehovah, honored by Christ and the primitive Christians, by a festival taken from the pagan sun-worshipers. The first Sunday law was that of the pagan Emperor Constantine, who, to save his tottering empire, introduced Christianity as a State religion.

This law given March 7, A. D. 321, began thus: "Let no work be done on the venerable day of the sun," etc. Enforced idleness in those days, as in ours, was no gain to the Church and community since it produced more of crime and debauchery on Sunday than on any other day. The next step, therefore, was to compel the religious observance of Sunday, and a theory was already extant to meet the exigencies, for the great Catholic Father Augustine wrote: "Many must be brought back to the Lord, like wicked servants, by the rod of temporal suffering." (Schaff's Church History.) Of this theory Neander says: "It was by Augustine, then, that a theory was founded . . . which introduced the germ of that whole system of spiritual despotism, . . . which ended in the . . . Inquisition." The enforcement of Sunday laws by the Church, through the agency of the State, was the beginning of those awful persecutions and atrocious crimes which blackened the historical annals of Europe, while American history is also besmirched by persecutions and hardships arising from Sunday laws, as these have been enforced under the Protestant regime.

The history of the Augustine age is now repeating itself, with this difference: then pagan and papist formed an alliance, now it is Protestant and papist. The results of those alliances then will be the results now, a European Sabbathlessness. To enforce idleness is one thing; and to take rest voluntarily and in obedience to God's command is quite another; the former may be secured by law, but the more consistently such law is enforced, the blacker will Sunday become as a day of crime; the latter has even a better chance of succeeding by gospel methods, if evangelical energy will take the place of ecclesiastical inertia, if ministers, with faith in God and in the regenerating power of his gospel, will persuade men instead of trying to coerce them, then Sabbath observance will stand on its own merits as it did before Constantine's time. It can and must be secured through education and persuasion only, and not by coercion. The gospel persuades men to reverence sacred things from motives of love, and does not compel them by force, therefore to do by law what ought to be done by the gospel is antichristian.

One great weakness about this civil Sabbath observance movement is, that to be consistent with American sentiment and to conciliate those from whom opposition will come, attempts are made to remove from the "Sabbath Reform" movement all religious features, and to seek the enforcement of Sunday on utilitarian, sanitarian, and civil grounds. This is but an entering wedge like Constantine's edict, which to reconcile the pagans, did not contain a single Christian sentiment; and Sunday observance, which then had its start, to conciliate the Christian afterward, was fancifully and gratuitously associated with our Lord's resurrection. In the words of President Lincoln: "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all the people all of the time;" so some of the people may believe that no religious legislation is sought, yet there are some who can not be misled. The meetings of the various societies back of this organized effort are held in churches; its literature is decidedly religious; its personnel consists of ministers and church members, and its leading organization has the following in the Constitution:—

>The basis of this Union is the divine authority and universal and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath—as manifested in the constitution of nature; declared in the revealed will of God; formulated in the fourth commandment of the moral law; interpreted and applied by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; transferred to the Christian Sabbath or Lord's Day by Christ and his apostles; and approved by its beneficial influence upon national life.

There are many difficulties attendant upon religious legislation, while history is replete with accounts of suffering and misery which such legislation has caused, and whatever religious practice or doctrine stands in need of it it is to be condemned as an error by the principles of justice, liberty, and the Bible.
