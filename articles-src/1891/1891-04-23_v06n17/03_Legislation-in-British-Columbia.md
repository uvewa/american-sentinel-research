## Legislation in British Columbia.

A CORRESPONDENT of the *Colonist*, a paper published in Victoria, British Columbia, published in that paper as follows, concerning the proposal to adopt a Sunday law in the Colony:—

> I would like to call attention to the most absurd of this whole business of introducing Sunday laws, and trying to foist strictest observance of the Colonist. To begin with, I would suggest that it is just not possible that the larger number of persons who reside in British Columbia Province would be decidedly averse to anything and manifest freedom of all classes of our people. But apart from that, it seems to be a case obverse served by all men of intelligence, that no majority has any right, either in state or of this balance, to coerce the minority, or to injure in any measure, the freedom of any member of any community. For instance, is it proper for legislators to make laws having in view the carrying out of certain death. Unfortunately for human nature, it can not be added that the generosity of the nation was not by a corresponding harvest. The experience is divisible, it is true, of availing the ability of sacrificing the preserver of his truth, but the long-experienced only reminded him to remember his oath. He accordingly arrested the fugitive who, on the trail of May following, was sentenced to death under the most lingering tortures.—*Murray's Dutch Republic.*

Morley was not a religious historian, and may therefore be credited a free from religious bias. These results follow in the train of religious bigotry, wherever it gets first. It goes slowly and insidiously at first, but eventually gets control of men and governments and then in the name of Christ, persecutes, oppresses, and murders all who do not bow the knee to it.—*N. Y. Gospel Messenger, Primitive Baptist.*
