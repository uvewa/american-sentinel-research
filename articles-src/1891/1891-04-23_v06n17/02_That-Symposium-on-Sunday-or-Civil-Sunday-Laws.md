## That Symposium on Sunday or "Civil" Sunday Laws.

IT was the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church that took the first official step toward the organization of the American Sabbath Union. The Secretary of the Union is first in the list of "representative members" appointed by the General Conference, for the four years, from 1888 to 1892. Besides this there are twenty other representative members appointed from the Methodist Episcopal Church. This gives the Methodist Episcopal Church an important constitutional connection with the organization, the sole purpose of existence of the American Sabbath Union, is to secure and enforce Sunday Sacredness. For this reason, therefore, what comes from official Methodist sources on this subject is worthy of note, and for this reason we notice some articles in the *Methodist Review* for March and April, 1891.

In this number of the *Review* there is a symposium on "The Christian Sabbath," by Rev. I. R. Fiske, D. D., President of the Albion College, Decatur, Michigan; another by Rev. J. M. Durrell, D. D., Manchester, New Hampshire; and a third by Rev. J. W. Clotz, D. D., Agent Sunday School Union, Washington, Iowa.

Dr. Fiske's article is upon "The Divine Origin of the Christian Sabbath." He makes some sound statements relative to the purpose of the Sabbath which in themselves show the utter futility of legislation upon the subject. He says:—

> The supreme purpose of the Sabbath is spiritual. Something more than rest physical or mental—was contemplated by its Author. Spiritual uses were not to be supplanted by the mere makeshifts, in which the initial purposes shall ever hold a place far above those that were lower. The great question in the divine government over man was this: How can the human race be brought into the nearest likeness of God, practically be the most perfect moral agent, appreciate that which is highest, and love that which is best, act in the most benevolent manner—most optimized? It is very plain to every thoughtful mind that the Sabbath was ordained as a beneficent aid for this immortal purpose.

This is in harmony with the scriptural idea of the Sabbath, that is, that it is for worship and moral and spiritual elevation; and that it in the connecting link between God and man, by which he is held in remembrance. It shows that the Sabbath is wholly religious; and therefore that whenever the State presumes to legislate upon the question it is simply interfering with man's relationship to God where the State never can rightly have any place. "Every one of us shall give some account of himself to God." As to how a man observes the Sabbath, or whether he observes it at all, or not, are questions for himself and God alone; and are not of the things of which he is responsible alone to God. Therefore, the State never can touch upon that question without entering the field of religion and conscience.

Another most excellent statement of Dr. Fiske, and one which knocks higher than the proverbial kite, the "civil" the "health," theory of the "civil Sabbath."

> If the Sabbath were only a holiday, consisting of mere cessation from toil, it would be a sentimental tot; it would provide an occasion for a sort of frolic, for sport, for fun.

A day is not made sacred by idleness, but by a presence of spiritual influence. It is not [page 130] resting, but an every observing character that should the real spiritual purpose of the Sabbath largely fall into sacred view for more harmful than would be produced were the day given to labor. The office of the Sabbath is spiritual, and precisely as it makes it here, or other than so, it—so accords to it.

This has been the position of THE SENTINEL always. It is absolute truth, and by it the additional truth is maintained that Sunday laws must enforce the religious observance of the day or else stand condemned as the lacquey of a terrible denominalism. But for the State to attempt to enforce the religious observance of the day is to work a yet more terrible demoralization, as history proves. Therefore, this truth demonstrates the fact, that Sunday laws are in themselves essential evil, and tend only to the demoralization of society and the State. Such is the work in which the American Sabbath Union is engaged, and in which, from its connection with that Union, the Methodist Church is no small part engaged.

Dr. Fiske closes his article with the following excellent statement to the same effect as the two already quoted:—

> In substance this God bequeathed to man with the purpose of making history through the centuries from grander and more perfect things as the years go by, and of promoting the largest healthy of the observance to the interests of the relation between the supreme and was the perfection of man's supreme religious welfare.

Dr. Burrell's article is upon "The Thing that Threatens the Christian Sabbath," and in an argument to prove that this is a Christian Nation, that we have a national religion, that the observance of the Christian Sabbath is a part of national religion, it is a part of the national religion, and that, therefore, there should be laws to enforce the religious observance of the day.

He seeks to prove that this is a Christian Nation by saying that "the mother country was, in form at least, a Christian," and thus implying whether the daughter was trained to be best as to show whether she was or not matters nothing, because the form of Christianity without the power, is worse than no pretension to it and is Christianity. The Scriptures distinctly denounce the form of godliness without the power, and from such exactly all Christians are commanded to turn away. Yet all that any State can ever do, in any such connection, is to make the form, increasing hypocrisy, and multiplying sin.

From the fact that the Declaration of Independence refers to "nature's God," to "a Creator" to "supreme Judge of the world," and "divine Providence;" because the concluding resolution of the original articles of confederation recognized "the Great Governor of the world;" and because the Constitution requires that all executive and judicial officers of the United States, and of the several States, shall be bound by oath of confirmation to so support the Constitution, he gathers the conclusion that "we have by the fundamental law of the land a national religion, and that religion is Christianity."

That is a very large conclusion from small premises. In not one of the things which he has marshaled is there anything said about Christ or the Christian religion; say more than about the religion of the Deist or the Jew. And so far as the oath which is required by the Constitution of the United States is concerned, any atheist can take that just as well as any Christian. To deduce from these considerations a national religion for the United States is a large contract. But when this is not only done but that religion is declared to be Christianity, then the depth of the genius that could discover it, is something marvelous. In fact, any mind which can deduce such a conclusion from such premises, is perfectly able to create conclusions without any premises at all.

Next, and upon all that has been said before, he declares that the observance of the Sabbath is a part of our religious system recognized by law. And this is how he makes the observance of the Sabbath a part of the national religion of the United States. Having thus established his national religion, and the observance of the Sabbath as a part of it, he notes some of the dangers that threaten it. He maintains the mail service, the Sunday paper, Sunday trains, briefly, prevents more, and indifference on the part of the Church. In order to do away with these he in turn says, "the membership of evangelical churches of the country, constitute at least twenty per cent. of the population, and church-goers number more than half of the population of the United States;" and upon this he declares:

> We are strong enough to effect a reform if we only go about our work in the round. If we will in a body follow up our public prayers by conscientious work at the caucus and ballot-box, politicians will treat us in a very becoming and respectful manner. It is time that God's people should be making themselves a power.

Yes, religious reform is a fine thing to carry at the caucus and the ballot-box. And such work by the clergy always has very beneficial consequences—and so has the work of the Inquisition. When the churches put their dependence in politics, they will get what political religionists ever could wish to get, and what no one ever could be without it. Have they the faith in God, that they must appeal to politics?

Another danger which he mentions and which he barely "gives" a glance at is, "The very thing to make the Sabbath a day of rest so greatly serves as religious." This is another stroke that lifts hard a goodly number of the props from beneath the Sunday-law platform, at least in their public speeches. But the greatest danger is in this danger, and is stated in the following observation; and by the assertion, the consensus of the Christians see that the sanctity of the Sabbath rests on religious obligation, and that not should be enforced by the State, on the grounds of public and general utility," has made more Christians doubtful as to the wisdom of placing the observance of the day in a civil enactment.

Is it worth while for the "civil" Sunday law workers to study these passages. They do not deny that their contemporary, sophisticated, "civil Sabbath" arguments is a sword that cuts both ways. They had better stop that method of working and stand with Dr. Burrell openly for the enforcement of Sunday observance upon religious grounds. The Doctor closes his article with this admonition:—

> But the State and the Church are separate in our polity, and can never come into organic union as did the State and Christianity were married in 1578. Never, therefore; God hath joined neither let man set asunder.

Yes, it is a very nicely planned scheme, that the State and the Church are separate in our connection, but the State and Christianity are not. It is preceded the showing that was made by the bishops in Constantinople at the pit of intolerance and bigotry where Christianity was a distinct thing from the Church, and as a matter of fact this very plea, but not in the sense in which they meant it. And upon this showing Constantine formed a union between the State and Christianity as it was represented by the Church. But as soon as the union had been formed then it was made to appear that the union was with Christianity of which Christianity was represented. And what Constantine and the bishops had joined together has been the curse of States to nations to ever bathed in, then to put asunder.

Dr. Clotz's article proposes "Grounds for Sabbath Decline." The first remedy which he proposes is to "form a public opinion" and "draw the lines accurately," that is, "distinguish more sharply between the Christian Sabbath and the day which is the imitation between the obligation of civil enactment made under civil law and that which is the obligation of divine law." Just so. And how does he do this?

> The task to conserve the Christian Sabbath is rooted primarily in the divine revelation of duty to God toward him. But we must get at the roots and supply divine revelation of need in human nature. While we refuse to substitute the dictum of human law to permit the sanctity of the Christian Sabbath.

Yes, and it is this same "law unto themselves" that constitutes the power of the Church alone, which seeks, and has always sought through the medium of the State. For to conserve the Christian Sabbath by aiming to secure the integrity of the "civil Sabbath."

That is, they claim to have a Sunday law made or enforced except in behalf of the Christian Sabbath. This assertion of the Doctor's in this connection is further illustrated by his own paragraphs, in which he discusses the remedy is proved which is, that they have moral courage. He declares:—

> Of course he appealed to the religious conscience of the people. There was no other motive to which he could appeal. And so Dr. Burrell and Dr. Fiske in their articles plainly show, there is no other motive to

[page 131]

which appeal can ever rightly be made. The government in which Nehemiah was an officer was a theocracy, a religious government. The Church and the State were one. And whenever Solomon's example is cited, it can be done only upon the basis of a religious government—a union of Church and State. It is logical, therefore, that Dr. Cox should urge, as he next rightly, "the vigorous enforcement of righteousness laws," because if this be that this is a Christian Nation, and it should subvert the pulpit to "lead in this new crusade for the recovery of the holy day."

We wish a long exhortation to all who strongly urge the impression of "civil enactment" upon the basis of "the word of God" because the Bible has higher law by England," because the "statutes of King Alfred" enforced the "Ten Commandments and equally other holy law of Moses." At a moral darkness," because "these laws have never been repealed," "America is the home of common law, the inheritor of the law and ecclesiastic, and spirit," and "finally because the acts of our national life run back to good Alfred's realm [reign ?], and laws are through to its birth."

For the establishing religious institutions, principles of which had, to a certain degree, been searched before, it had drawn to it all the families of reason and right. It did not with equanimity; but with more assiduities in the practice it was distinctly passed; and a singular proposition belonging to practices of equitable was soon or then led entirely upon the departure. It was such a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, as the resemblance was typified by reference to the words "Jesus Christ," as "that it should read, in America on the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy Author of our religion;" the insertion was to be comprehended within the maxim of the postulation of law and the Jewish, the Christian and Mohammedan, the Hindu, and infidel of every denomination actually, without reference to a great American endeavored to effect this discrimination a decade before. Speaking of the General Assembly of 1776, Patron writes:

> Petition for the repeal of statutes concerning the said form and acknowledgment of allegiance to the Assembly from the first day of the session. These being referred to the Committee of the Whole, led to the severest and longest struggle of the session.

"Dangerous enemies, as different records, "continued almost daily from the eleventh of October to the fifth of December. He desired to sweep away the whole system of national and secular constitutions, and establish perfect liberty of religion, by a sample constitution of half a dozen sentences.
