AN attempt to pass the ten commandments through the Common Council of Cincinnati, recently failed. It appears that in his testimony before a committee, Deacon Richard Smith, of the Commercial Gazette, testified that he believed that the ten commandments could not be passed by the Common Council without bribery. This made some of the councilmen angry, and subsequently one of them introduced the ten commandments, and moved they be passed under the suspension of the rules. The chairman ruled the motion out of order, and so the commandments remained unpassed.
