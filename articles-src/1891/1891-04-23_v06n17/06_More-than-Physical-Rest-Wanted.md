First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. Mark 4: 28.

It is a notable fact that for all that is said about a Sunday rest being so much needed for the poor laboring man, but few laboring men are putting forth exertions to obtain it, or are heard in the lecture field championing it. If they are undergoing an Egyptian bondage as would appear from the claims of some, it indeed seems strange that their cries and groanings should not be heard. About the only men who are heard championing a compulsory Sunday law are ministers.

This being the case, suspicion naturally arises as to whether this is not, after all, simply a religious scheme gotten up in the interests of the Church. But we are calmly assured that this is not the case; that the Sunday law is not intended to compel anybody to be religious, but that it is simply in the interests of the poor laboring man,—to give him a day of physical rest, and make Sunday simply a civil Sabbath.

This looks plausible, and to quite an extent allays suspicion. But still there remains just a lingering query why it is only the *religious* who are interested in this civil affair, and as Sunday is a *church institution*, how it is that these divines can be laboring for it only in the interests of man's physical nature. Indeed, it looks like quite a freak in human nature.

But let us compare these ideas with a few quotations from some of the authentic documents and representative workers in this movement and see if this is the objective point in this movement. First, the American Sabbath Union in its Constitution thus declares its object:—

>The object of the American Sabbath Union is to preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

The Blair Sunday rest bill of the Fiftieth Congress closed thus:—

>The same shall be construed so far as possible to secure to the whole people rest from toil during the first day of the week, their mental and moral culture, and the *religious* observance of the Sabbath day.

Rev. W. F. Crafts, before the Knights of Labor, in Chicago, November 29, 1888, said:—

>A weekly day of rest has never been permanently secured in any land except on the basis of religious obligation. Take the *religion* out and you take the rest out.

Joseph Cook, in one of his Monday morning lectures, said:—

>The experience of centuries shows that you will in vain endeavor to preserve Sunday as a day of rest unless you preserve it as a day of worship.

And Mrs. J. C. Bateham, Superintendent of the Sabbath observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in the *Christian Statesman*, of April 11, 1889, said:—

>We want it for the purpose for which God designed it when he bade us keep it holy, not for frivolity and amusement, not for sleep and idleness, not for the Sunday newspaper, with its demoralizing literature, but for reading which is elevating and improving, including the word of God, and for attendance upon church services.

This puts a rather different face on the question. In the light of these statements all this palaver about a civil Sabbath, and wanting a Sunday law simply that the poor laboring man may have physical rest vanishes into thin air. It reminds us of the tramp who stopped at a house and thus ingeniously addressed the landlady: "Madam, would you please be so kind as to give me a drink of water, for I'm so hungry I don't know where I'm going to sleep to-night." So with the clamorers for Sunday laws. They want a civil Sunday law because the *religious* observance of the day is so small they do not know how they are going to fill their churches.

The whole policy of this movement appears to be in the line of the advice given by a minister in San Diego, California. He said:—

>In this thing you must not ask for too much at first. Ask just what public sentiment will bear, and when you get that, ask for more.

It is manifestly actuated by selfish aims—to get control of the civil power that it may be used as a tool to play into the hands of the Church. First, they want a law compelling a man to rest. But this only paves the way to coddle (or cudgel) him up to go to church and worship—with his pocket book at least. It is on the plan of the Western farmer who wanted more money to buy more land to raise more corn to feed more hogs to get more money to buy more land to raise more corn, etc. So these Sunday-law advocates want a compulsory Sunday law to make more people keep Sunday to get more to attend church to get more money to pay more preachers to get more laws to make more Sunday-keepers, etc. They want the whole earth—by law.
