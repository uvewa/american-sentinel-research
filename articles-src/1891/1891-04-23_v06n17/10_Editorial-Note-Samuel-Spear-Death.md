SAMUEL T. SPEAR, M. D., D. D., LL.D., one of the editors of the Independent, and author of several books, is dead. Of his work on "Religion and the State," the Independent says: "This volume is the best exponent of the doctrine, which was earnestly his and ours, that Church and State should be absolutely separated, that Church property should be taxed, and that the Bible should not be required to be read in the public schools."
