THE Colonist, of Victoria, British Columbia, comes to us containing an article boldly challenging the authority of Sunday as a sacred day, and asserting that it is not the Sabbath by divine appointment. This is one effect of the demand for more stringent Sunday laws, and one rather unlooked for by its friends. But the raising of this question does not seem to discourage the Sunday-law advocates in the least. It is true that it is a point that will not bear too close scrutiny, but the absence of divine law seems only to make them the more anxious to secure human laws; so while the demand for Sunday laws stimulates this wholesome inquiry as to its claims, the inquiry increases the demand.
