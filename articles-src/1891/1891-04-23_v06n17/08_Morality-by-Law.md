## Morality by Law.

Don't leave moral work to be done by the law. Take hold and do it yourselves. They are not doing it when they say to legislators: "You make a law about it, and that will do it." It won't! Morality is not the product of law. You can't legislate morality. The law hasn't anything to do with making people moral. If moral work was left to be done by law it would never be done, because it is not the province of law to make men moral. It is away beyond the power of law to implant morality in the heart, or even to beget in the heart the desire to be moral. Anything short of the gospel of Christ can have nothing to do with instilling moral principles and moral integrity in the human breast, and whosoever actually talks about legislating morality into men may be taken about an impossible thing. Morality is conformity to the moral law, and no man and no woman ever in this world conformed to the moral law without divine help, because there is a spiritual and creative impulse to the thoughts and intents of the heart. And whosoever we hear to-day prattle about the day laws in the interest of morality, we don't want to hear him prattle about it much more; or that they know well that they will lay down what they shall think, and tire out that will map out what a person shall believe and what he shall not believe. But this world would not be the Inquisition, for how can it be known for it has proved and how does it prove it not choose to divine them, except they choose to be compelled to conform to their belief, and by similar persecution.—*Ram's Horn.*
