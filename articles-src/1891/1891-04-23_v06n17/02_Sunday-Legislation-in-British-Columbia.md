A CORRESPONDENT of the *Colonist*, a paper published in Victoria, British Columbia, writes to that paper as follows concerning the proposal to adopt a Sunday law in that Colony:—

>I would like to call attention to the most serious aspect of this whole business of introducing Sunday laws, and trying to enforce the same in British Columbia. To begin with, I would suggest that it may just be possible that the larger number of voters throughout this city and throughout the Province would be decidedly averse to anything that would tend in the least measure to hinder the entire and unrestricted freedom of all classes of our people. But apart from that, it seems to be a conclusion arrived at by all men of intelligence, that no majority has any right, either in or out of Parliament, to coerce the minority, or to impair in any measure the freedom of any member of any community. For instance, it is proper for legislatures to make laws having in view the maintenance of order, the keeping of the peace, or defense from invasion; because all parties are alike interested and concerned in the enforcement of these laws. It would perhaps also be in keeping with good government to insist that all days should be held to be sacred, that no intoxicating liquors shall be sold or exposed for sale, on either day of the week; that falsehood shall at all times be accounted perjury; that cheating in any way shall be considered to be fraud; that gambling of any kind (even to playing marbles for keeps), shall be punishable; but to enact laws that have for their mission the intentional attempt to force even a minority of the peaceable people into observing any certain day of the week in a manner entirely inconsistent with their own ideas of right and wrong is merely a subversion of freedom, a tampering with the rights of an intelligent people; and has the full peculiar flavor of a dish that has been prepared, cooked, and served up as a portion of the menu of an intolerant church.

>Such laws are not only unreasonable, ungenerous, obnoxious, and absurd, but their tendency and effect are alike harmful and would do more to stir up strife and ill-will and hatred among the sovereign people, and to pollute and defile the free air of our lovely Province, and toward the desecration and defilement of our hearths and homes, and the de-threnement of what is indeed and in truth the truest kind of religious liberty, than all the combinations of evil influences that ever beset any community of people. In such a matter let each be a law unto himself.

>Let us maintain order, keep the peace, defend our homes, be loving and kind and honest and good and true on the Sunday, and let us maintain order, keep the peace, defend our homes, and be loving and kind and honest and good and true on every other day of the week as well.

>Let the air be so free that the sounds of innocent joy that strike over hills from our holiday pleasure haunts shall echo to other lands the full, free, lofty name of LIBERTY.

Another gentleman writes to the same paper thus:—

>Sunday is not the Sabbath. Therefore the commandment of the Decalogue does not apply to Sunday. Believing this I can not comprehend on what grounds "Nemo" justifies the Hon. Mr. Robson's Sunday law. If Sunday is an institution of a church, its observance is binding only on the members of that church. One might just as reasonably ask the Legislature to enact a law compelling every one to attend his church and to accept his church's service, as add to the statute book a law forcing them to observe the day his church has set apart for worship. Does he not see that when he admits that Sunday is not the Sabbath day, he completely "gives away" the case of the Sabbatarians. He makes the observance of the Lord's day a matter of liberty and not a matter of law. The day was when those who advocate Sunday laws were logical. They passed laws compelling men not only to observe the day, but to attend the church, by law established. The world has outgrown laws binding men's consciences in these matters.

This man apparently admits that if Sunday were the Sabbath it would be right to enforce it by civil law; but that is a mistake. The seventh day is the divinely appointed Sabbath, but it would be monstrously wicked to make a law requiring everybody to keep it as such. God has nowhere committed such power to men.
