[page 129]

ABSOLUTE duties are such as pertain and belong to particular men merely as individuals and single persons. With regard to absolute duties which man is bound to perform as a mere individual, it is not to be expected that any human municipal law should at all explain or enforce them.—*Blackstone.*

A GOVERNMENT, to be acceptable, must have no religious claim to perform, no religious rites to observe, no religious classes to administer to, no eternal law to enforce, and no eternal judgment to render. In its educational work it must deal solely with those things which it fit for general instruction and absolutely with nothing else.

WRITERS of Sunday laws, and of sumptuous letters in favor of those who enforce another day, as a correspondent of the New Era, a Prohibition organ, reminds us:—

> Whatever we who prize the principles of liberty, we do not want any law which must exempt from its operation any persons, because of conscientious religious convictions. The State has no business to pass any law which, in its general and equal application to all, would interfere with any person's religious rights. As a matter of fact, "such principles of total government" have always been "discarded." It is not perfectly plain that the ground assigned for exemptions is not a religious one, as a primary admission that the basis of the law is religiously interference.

And is it not equally evident that any person who prefers to observe a different day than the majority, with all the attendant business inconveniences, does it from conscientious motives? And yet does any freedom of conscience "exist practically" when a man whose conscientious motives are stronger than his "preferences" for a good job, is compelled by law to lose another day besides the Sabbath, and that on the pretense that another man may suffer no pecuniary loss from following his convictions?
