WE have received Volume 1, Number 1, of the Quarterly Register of Current History, published by the Evening News Company, of Detroit, Michigan. Its design is thus stated by the publishers:—

>The purpose of the Quarterly Register is the bringing together at intervals of three months, of such matter appearing in the daily newspapers as may be valuable for permanent preservation. The Quarterly Register is not a publication to be read and thrown aside, but one to be carefully preserved and periodically bound up into volumes. In this form there will be few books in the family library which will have a more direct interest to every member, as it will deal with matters familiar in every one's recollection. The want of some such publication has been, no doubt, widely felt. Newspapers are too bulky for preservation, and being necessarily ill-digested, and rarely indexed, are, even when bound, almost useless for reference. The result is that recent history, while the most interesting to the generation which has participated in it, is the most difficult to find any convenient record of. Henceforth it is hoped this want will be supplied in the Quarterly Register.

The design is a good one, and the first number promises well. The Quarterly Register is certainly well worth the subscription price, one dollar per year.
