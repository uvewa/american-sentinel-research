The cause for the celebrated memorial of James Madison, which appeared in a late SENTINEL, was the introduction in the Virginia Legislature of a bill making a provision for the "teachers of the Christian religion." In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, dated at Richmond, January 9, 1785, Madison gave the following account of the bill:

>A resolution for a legal provision for the "teachers of the Christian religion" had early in the session been proposed by Mr. Henry, and, in spite of all the opposition that could be mustered, carried by forty-seven against thirty-two votes. Many petitioners from below the Blue Ridge had prayed for such a law; and though several from the Presbyterian laity beyond it were in a contrary style, the clergy of that sect favored it. The other sects seemed to be passive. The resolution lay some weeks before a bill was brought in, and the bill some weeks before it was called for; after the passage of the incorporating act [incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church], it was taken up, and, on the third reading, ordered by a small majority to be printed for consideration. The bill, in its present dress, proposes a tax of blank per cent on all taxable property, for support of teachers of the Christian religion. Each person when he pays his tax, is to name the society to which he dedicates it, and in case of refusal to do so, the tax is to be applied to the maintenance of a school in the county. As the bill stood for some time, the application in such cases was to be made by the Legislature to pious uses. In a committee of the whole it was determined, by a majority of seven or eight, that the word "Christian" should be exchanged for the word "religious." On the report to the House, the pathetic seal of the late Governor Harrison gained a like majority for re-instating discrimination. Should the bill pass into a law in its present form, it may and will be easily eluded. It is chiefly obnoxious on account of its dishonorable principle and dangerous tendency.—Writings of James Madison, volume 1, pages 130, 131.

One of the noblest characteristics of our early statesmen and patriots, as Madison said, was their jealous regard for our liberty. The least step toward infringement aroused the protests of Americans everywhere; and as a result of this spirit Henry's bill providing for the teachers of the Christian religion raised opposition in every part of the State, and such a protest went up from the patriots of Virginia that Henry's bill went down forever, and in its stead Jefferson's act for establishing religious freedom was passed, and still remains on the statute books of Virginia an everlasting monument to the liberality of Jefferson, Madison, and their co-workers. Jefferson's bill, in which he ever took a just pride, and which will always remain among the first of our early State papers, is as follows:

AN ACT FOR ESTABLISHING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

Well aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporal rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labors for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that, therefore, the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to the offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though, indeed, these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles, on the supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt actions against peace and good order; and, finally, that truth is great, and will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.

Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever; nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods; nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion; and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or effect their civil capacities.

And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, has no power to restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable, would be of no effect in law, yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.

Jefferson took more pride in this "Act for Establishing Religious Freedom" than anything else he ever wrote, except the Declaration of Independence. The following is a portion of an interesting letter written to his warm friend, James Madison, dated at Paris, December 16, 1786:—

>The Virginia act for religious freedom has been received with infinite approbation in Europe, and promulgated with enthusiasm. I do not mean by the governments, but by the individuals who compose them. It has been translated into French and Italian, has been sent to most of the courts of Europe, and has been the best evidence of the falsehood of those reports which stated us to be in anarchy. It is inserted in the new Encyclopedia, and is appearing in most of the publications respecting America.—Works of Thomas Jefferson, volume II, pages 55, 56.

An incident occurred during the adoption of this report that illustrates the breadth of views of the founders of our political system, and shows the extent of the religious liberty that we enjoy in this country. In his "Autobiography," Jefferson says:—

>The bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but, with some mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy Author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the words "Jesus Christ," so that it should read, "A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy Author of our religion;" the insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohammedan, the Hindoo, and infidel of every denomination.—Works of Jefferson, volume I, page 45.

Jefferson endeavored to effect this disestablishment a decade before. Speaking of the General Assembly of 1776, Parton says:—

>Petitions for the repeal of statutes oppressive of the conscience of dissenters came pouring in upon the Assembly from the first day of the session. These being referred to the Committee of the Whole, led to the severest and longest struggle of the session. "Desperate contests," as Jefferson records, "continued almost daily from the eleventh of October to the fifth of December." He desired to sweep away the whole system of restraint and monopoly, and establish perfect liberty of conscience and opinion, by a simple enactment of half a dozen lines:

>"No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religion worship, ministry, or place whatsoever; nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods; nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion; and the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or effect their civil capacities."

>It required more than nine years of effort on the part of Jefferson, Madison, and their liberal friends, to bring Virginia to accept this solution of the religious problem, in its simplicity and completeness.—Porton's "Life of Jefferson," page 230.

But, thanks to their earnest efforts, the principles of entire religious liberty were adopted, and a century of unparalleled progress both to religion and Government has resulted. The duty of the American citizen to-day is to see that this liberty is secured to every citizen, and that the intentions of these great men shall not be thwarted.
