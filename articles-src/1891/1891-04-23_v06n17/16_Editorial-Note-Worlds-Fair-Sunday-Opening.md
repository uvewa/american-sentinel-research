APRIL 5, Rev. H. E. Mott, of Dubuque, Iowa, delivered a sermon upon the subject, "Shall the World's Fair Be Opened on Sunday?" "The church was crowded," says the World, "and among the congregation was Senator William B. Allison. The preacher took strong ground against the opening of the Exposition on Sunday, stating that it could only accommodate the residents of Chicago who could visit the Fair as often as they desired on week days.

"At the close of the sermon Mr. Mott asked all those in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday to rise. Almost the entire congregation rose, but Senator Allison kept his seat. Various interpretations are put on his action, but it is generally considered that he intended to signify his opposition to the preacher's position."
