WE have been severely criticised for the statement made some weeks ago that "the Puritans hanged, but did not burn, persons accused of witchcraft." We are, however, confident that the statement is true. A patient and careful search of the best histories to be found in the libraries of this city has failed to reveal even a hint of any mode of execution of witches in this country, other than hanging; and we are also in receipt of a letter from the well-known writer, W. S. Nevins, of Salem, Massachusetts, in which he says: "There was never a witch burned in New England." Mr. Nevins is engaged in writing a history of Salem witchcraft, and his ability as a writer, and his facilities for research, give assurance that this work will be the best ever written.

Lee & Shepard, Boston, will bring this book out in May, and we shall embrace the earliest opportunity to give our readers definite information concerning it.
