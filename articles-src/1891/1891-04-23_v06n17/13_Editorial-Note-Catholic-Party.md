THE Catholic Review is calling for the formation of a Catholic party in the United States similar to the Catholic party in Germany. In urging this, it says:—

>As far as law-making is concerned, Christianity is a very dead affair in America. It is for this reason we would like to see the formation of a strictly Catholic political party, to do the legislative work which the sects have failed to do. Such a party would have no greater strength than its numbers, its careful organization, its sincerity, and its usefulness would earn for it. It could unite with any party in the enacting of Christian laws, and it certainly would arrest the rooting out of Christianity, a process now going on successfully.

This is simply saying that Catholics would unite with Protestants in securing legislation favorable to those features of Christianity common to Romanist and Protestant alike; that is, these great bodies would, as the National Reformers long since proposed, simply join hands in resisting what they are pleased to call "political atheism," which is simply a logical and consistent divorce of Church and State. Those who trust to the differences between papists and Protestants to preserve religious liberty may awake by and by to the fact that they have trusted to a broken reed.
