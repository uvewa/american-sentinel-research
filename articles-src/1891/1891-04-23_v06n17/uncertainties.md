# Uncertainties Log: v06n17 (1891-04-23)

## General OCR Notes

The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. Below are specific items flagged for review:

### Article 1: "That Symposium on Sunday and 'Civil' Sunday Laws"

- **Location:** Page 3, first paragraph
- **Text:** "good Alfred's realm [reign?]"
- **Issue:** OCR shows "realm" but context suggests "reign" may be correct
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - "realm" is readable in scan but "reign" fits context better
- **Resolution needed:** Check original scan to verify

### Article 5: "What and Whither?"

- **Author attribution:** "H. B. Maurer" at end of article
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clearly marked with initials
- **Note:** This is a new author not previously in the known authors list

### Miscellaneous

- Some advertisement text was partially garbled by OCR (e.g., "ANIMATING PRICE" likely should be different)
- These advertisements were not transcribed as per instructions
- Page headers and running titles ("THE AMERICAN SENTINEL") were correctly excluded
