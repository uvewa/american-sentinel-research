### Page 134, Right Column, "Morality by Law."

- **Obstruction:** Low scan resolution / ink spread on newsprint
- **Second pass completed:** Yes (multiple passes)

1. **First word of article**
   - **Transcribed as:** "Don't leave moral work to be done by the law."
   - **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The first word after "Don't" is unclear; could be "leave," "hoot," or "boot." "Leave" chosen as it makes the best contextual sense ("Don't leave moral work to be done by law — take hold and do it yourselves").
   - **Reason:** Letter shapes are ambiguous at this resolution.

2. **Final paragraph (starting "And whosoever we hear to-day...")**
   - **Transcribed as:** "we don't want to hear him prattle about it much more; or that they know well that they will lay down what they shall think, and tire out that will map out what a person shall believe and what he shall not believe. But this world would not be the Inquisition, for how can it be known for it has proved and how does it prove it not choose to divine them, except they choose to be compelled to conform to their belief, and by similar persecution."
   - **Confidence:** LOW — This passage is very difficult to read. Multiple words appear garbled or unclear. The sentence structure does not fully parse, suggesting either archaic/colloquial phrasing from the *Ram's Horn* source, or persistent misreadings. Several phrases like "tire out that will map out" and "how can it be known for it has proved and how does it prove it not choose to divine them" are suspect.
   - **Reason:** The print quality in the bottom-right of page 134 is poor, with ink bleeding and small type. The *Ram's Horn* was a popular religious paper and may have used informal/colloquial language.

### Page 136, Left Column, Samuel T. Spear item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "last exponent of the doctrine, which was boldly maintained in his oral and written dissertations and in his orations"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — "exponent" is fairly clear; "dissertations" less so (could be "discussions" or "instructions").
- **Reason:** Context supports "exponent" (he was a proponent of the doctrine). "Dissertations" fits the academic context of a D.D., LL.D.

### Page 136, Left Column, Ten Commandments item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "AN appeal to the ten commandments sent through the Union Commercial Chronicle, recently failed..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The overall narrative is clear (an attempt to pass the ten commandments through a legislative body failed due to bribery allegations), but some specific words in the middle of the paragraph are uncertain.
- **Reason:** Small type and poor print quality.

### Page 136, Left Column, "Worthy paper" item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "A WORTHY paper complains that in the name and behalf of Pennsylvania 'no provision is made in favor of those Jews and seventh-day Christians...'"
- **Confidence:** LOW — Several words in this item are very difficult to read. The phrase "name and behalf" is uncertain (could be "name and lack"). The second half of the paragraph ("the world the better, so long as its kind not only in degrees, if it made is exempted") does not fully parse and likely contains misreadings.
- **Reason:** Very small type and poor ink quality. The argument seems to be about Sunday law exemptions for Sabbath-keepers being insufficient — the laws themselves are wrong in principle.

### Page 136, Left Column, Catholic Review quotation

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Organization upon this basis would be a very good start in America..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — Most of the quoted text is legible, but a few phrases in the middle are uncertain ("we would fain it we see the formation" may not be exact).
- **Reason:** Small type within quotation marks.

### Page 136, Middle Column, Oddfellow item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "...the inquiry disturbs them in the slightest."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The final sentence "as while the demand for Sunday laws stimulates this wholesome inquiry into the claims, the inquiry disturbs them in the slightest" reads awkwardly. May contain misreadings.
- **Reason:** Bottom of column, small type.

### Page 136, Middle Column, Puritan/Witchcraft item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "We have been severely critical of everything that came from New England, and the Puritan character, but did not burn persons accused of witchcraft."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The opening sentence was particularly difficult. Initial reading was garbled ("hangout has did not bad"). After second pass, "character, but did not burn" makes much better sense in context with the article's thesis about witch execution methods.
- **Reason:** Poor print quality in first two lines; rest of item is much clearer.

### Page 136, Right Column, Queen's Quarto quotation

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "FIRMLY rooted, convictions, on the truths of Christianity..."
- **Confidence:** LOW — Several phrases in this quotation are uncertain: "they abide in any mutiny in order that they devote all interfere with" does not parse correctly. This appears to be a royal proclamation about religious tolerance, but the exact wording of several phrases is unclear. The source "Queen's Quarto" is also uncertain (could be "Queen's Gazette" or similar).
- **Reason:** Small type and the ornate language of a royal proclamation makes it hard to distinguish between misreadings and archaic phrasing.

### Page 136, Right Column, Quarterly Register item

- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "It designs in its make by the publishers, bringing together at intervals of three months..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The description is lengthy and while the general meaning is clear (it's a positive review of a new quarterly historical publication), several phrases read awkwardly and may contain word-level errors. "It designs in its make" likely should be something like "It is designed in its plan" or similar.
- **Reason:** Dense paragraph with small type; general sense is clear but exact wording uncertain in places.
