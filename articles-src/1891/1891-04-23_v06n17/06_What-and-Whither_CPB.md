## What and Whither!

"RENDER therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's," and other New Testament texts in the same tone set forth principally, fidelity to which requires the severance of religion from civil matters. Any departure from this principle is more likely to be antichristian, as is also any religion or practice of practice that has ever been enforced or maintained by civil law, since whatever in Christian must be expected by Christian reason. As baptismal civil legislation has in all probability seen its last days, and California and possibly other states probably can not again, or will not, to much nuisance and open law, force anyone to discard their scriptural baptism or have their children sprinkled, who have in such matters made God's law not served as to further clearance of that phase of religion it is necessary, in any, to call attention to the fact that those things bear the stamp of error upon them, because they have been heretofore enforced by civil legislation, virtually tends to set apart Sunday. But with Sunday observance the case is different. The religious element is deeply involved in its favor. Papists, by their agents and Protestants, through the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, the third party, and the W.C.T.U., Christian Temperance, are all uniting to enforce the observance of Sunday by civil law. The former are repeating their tactics of the ante-Reformation when they supplanted the Sabbath of Jehovah, honored by Christ and the primitive Christians, by a festival taken from the pagan sun-worship. The first Sunday law was that of the pagan Emperor Constantine, who, to save his tottering empire, introduced Christianity as a State religion.

This law was given March, A. D. 321, began thus: "Let us work to be close on the venerable day of the sun," etc. Enforced

idleness in those days, as in ours, was no gain to the Church and community observed; imposing more of crime and debauchery on Sunday than on any other day. To those who honestly wish to compel the religious observance of Sunday, and a forcey was already stated to every thinker upon the face of the great Catholic Father Augustine: "Many must be brought to the Lord, the wicked servant, by the end of temporal suffering."—(Smith's Church History, p. 61) Others said of earlier date, "It was by Augustus, then, that the theory was matured and the seed was planted, which has since germinated into the germ of that whole system of enforced observance."

Inquisition. The enforcement of Sunday laws by the Church, the agency of the State, was the beginning of those awful persecutions and crimes which blackened the ecclesiastical annals of Europe, which American history as also ecclesiastical history, repudiates and hardship arising from Sunday laws.

The history of the Augustines are in this they are in this difference; then projected and papal form an alliance, no one from it in Protestant and Pope. The results of those alliances then will be the results; force idleness is one thing; and to take rest voluntarily and in obedience to God is another; the former may be secured by law, but the law, the Congress cannot reach the latter. Sunday will become as a bad day of crime; the latter law enters a better chance of being received by gospel methods, if evangelical force, and only will take its place for practical inertia, if ministers, with faith in its God and in the regenerating power of his Word, will persuade men instead of trying to force them, then Sabbath observance will come. It can and must be secured through salvation and must be done voluntarily, and not by coercion. The gospel persuasion is invincible to everyone who is not a friend of force and love, and does not fear what ought to be done by the gospel of antichristian.

Our great weakness about this civil Sabbath observance movement, that is to constitute with American Baptists of America and to constitute those from whom expectations will come, although we stands no more to remove from the "Sabbath Reform" advocates. The enforcement of Sunday on militarians, and salvation, and civil grounds. But an ordering wedge like Constantine's edict, which to reconcile the pagan, did not come single a Christian settlement, and Sunday observance, which then had last its start, to constitutional Christians afterward, was forcefully and gratuitously ensconced with our Lord's veneration. In the word of President Lincoln: "You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you can't fool all the people all of the time;" so some of the people may believe that no religious legislation is sought, yet there are some who can not be misled. The meetings of the various sections held of this organization effort are held in churches. Its literature is distinctly religious; its personnel consist of ministers and church members, and its leading organization has the following as its Constitution:—

> The basis of this Union is the divine authority and the natural and perpetual obligation of the Sabbath, as contained in the constitution of nature; declared in the fourth commandment of the moralist; interpreted in the writings and usages of the Saviour, and to be taught in the Christian Sabbath or Lord's Day that the said the apostles and approved of natural influences upon natural life.

There are many difficulties attendant upon sabbath legislation, which history is replete with accounts of suffering and misery which such legislation has caused, and whatever religious practice whatever stands in need of it is to be condemned as an error by the principles of justice, as well as by the standard of righteousness.
