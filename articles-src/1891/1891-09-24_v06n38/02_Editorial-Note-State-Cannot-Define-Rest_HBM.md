I DENY the right of the law of the land to define how much, or just when, a man shall rest. I deny that it should say I shall and must rest one day in seven because it is good for me, as I would deny its right to say that I must bathe once a day, or once in every seven days; or that I should refrain from eating pork, or mixing pickles with my ice-cream, because thus to bathe or thus to refrain is good for me. I prefer to receive such instruction from my physician, and not from Congress nor the American Sabbath Union.
