A CALIFORNIA minister, who seems to see in a Sunday law all the elements of necessary reform, is reported as saying:—

We do not wish to invoke any civil law to say that you shall worship here or that you shall worship there, or worship at all; but we do want to be able to invoke the civil law to say that this shall be a non-secular day.

"That," says a Pacific Coast paper, "is simply asking for a civil law that will assume the prerogative of God. The Creator of days has never said Sunday shall be a non-secular day, and he only can legitimately give character to a day. These Sunday-law preachers always boast that they do not want to say what men shall do on Sunday; but they are forward in demanding what they shall not do. Where is the difference in principle? Let them really succeed in getting the power to prescribe the acts of their fellows to the extent of limiting them, and the success will but whet the appetite for further power. The more of human power they acquire, the more they will depend upon that, and 'deny the power of godliness.' Then determining what men shall do, will follow as a natural consequence."
