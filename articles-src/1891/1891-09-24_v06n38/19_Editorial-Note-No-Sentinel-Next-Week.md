In order to give those employed on THE AMERICAN SENTINEL an opportunity to attend an important camp-meeting, at Mount Holly, New Jersey, September 24 to October 4, there will be no paper issued from this office next week. Number 39 of THE SENTINEL will therefore be issued October 8, instead of October 1. Our subscribers will lose nothing by this omission, as there will still remain thirteen publication days in which to issue the twelve papers necessary to complete the volume of fifty numbers.
