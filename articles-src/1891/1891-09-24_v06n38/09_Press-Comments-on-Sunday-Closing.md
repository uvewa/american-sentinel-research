# Press Comments on Sunday Closing of the Columbian Exposition.

The following is a brief list of extracts from newspapers all over the United States, on the subject of Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Most of these were evidently called out by a vote of fifty-six of the Lady Managers of the Fair, by a vote of fifty-six to nothing, to an their influence against Sunday closing.

*Louisville Times.* The Board of Lady Managers of the Chicago World's Fair has adopted resolutions indorsing the Rev. Mr. Patton's indorsing resolution. It is likely to strike a good many people as rather an extraordinary proceeding for ladies of that kind. Fortunately, in this one instance, the ladies have no authority.

*Lawrence Journal.* The Board of Lady Managers of the World's Fair voted for opening on Sundays. The American Sunday is safe in the hands of the ladies.

*St. Joseph Herald.* The day of fanaticism is past. The intelligence of the present age will not tolerate any attempt by any body of men or women to say that the fair is not to be open on Sundays as well as week days. Every attraction is to be considered the hallmark and advantage of civilization.

Just such an effort to dragoon us all into an enforced abstinence from useful or educational labor and harmless amusement on Sunday is to be made here, the Lady Managers seem to be considerate the hallmark of civilization; and when the only day of the week when the great institutions of the world are open on Sunday it is the only day that most wage earners are free to visit them, and that will defeat it. If the Fair is not to be open on Sunday the majority of wage earners will be excluded.

*Kansas City Star.* Col. Elliot F. Shepard and the rest of the people who hold that on Sunday the Lord will send a curse upon Chicago, and he is going to do it at once, if the prophecy of any rest as it is in compliance to remain in that city.

*Washington Post.* Perhaps the World's Fair managers will consider the suggestion that by a deal Dr. Mc Glynn will agree to remain closed the other six days.

*Terre Haute Express.* The workingmen of Chicago are opposed to Sunday closing. They are able to figure out for themselves the loss of substance and loss of wages that would be the consequence.

*Knoxville Journal.* The Journal believes that every intelligent person will agree that if there is any exhibition to promote the interests of progress and civilization, the world over, ought to be open every day of the week. The hard working and laboring poor can attend and gather a benefit of instruction therefrom, which they cannot on other days.

*Portland Oregonian.* There will doubtless be many thousands of visitors to the Fair, to whom those who prefer to attend them on the Sabbath, and those who will prefer to rest and enjoy themselves. There are others who will desire the privilege of visiting the Fair on Sunday because they cannot otherwise have the privilege of being there.

As far as the question as to the Sunday opening of the Fair were put to popular vote, it would be opened so. Monday is to be the rest day. It is reasonable to assume that on Sunday more visitors will enter than on any other day.

*Kansas City Journal.* More harm would be done by closing the gates on Sunday than by keeping them open. People who are compelled to keep them out of mischief, and crowds without the restraint of home to keep them nicely, present [page 302] find worse places than the Fair in which to spend their day.

*San Francisco Examiner.* It is only proper that the World's Fair managers should give respectful consideration to the earnest demand of those who have asked them to close the Fair Sunday. The request is practically to ask the full attention of a National Commission to take up and consider the Sentinel as soon as it shall properly come before it. If the demand should be acceded to and the Fair closed, it would probably deprive at least a million people of the privilege of visiting the national exposition.

*Springfield Journal.* It is a poor fact that the leading clergymen have not succeeded by the mere Christian people in desiring that the World's Fair shall be open Sunday. It is quite evident that Sunday as well as the churches, and the influence upon the people for public benefit with open entertainment, and interest, and politics are something alike, in some degree.

*Baltimore American.* From the recent action of the World's Fair Commissioners, it is very evident that the important question of what ultimate decision will be that the Exposition shall keep open on Sunday to give many visitors the opportunity of sight-seeing and at the same time of attending the World's Fair services on that day. This will be a compromise, and, like all compromises, will not fully satisfy the parties to the dispute.

*New Orleans Times-Democrat.* The people who are in favor of opening the World's Fair of the Exposition mainly depend, have also some strong arguments to present. Many people will not have the money to pay their way to Chicago to visit Chicago during the Exposition for the purpose of seeing it. If the gates are closed on Sunday they are shut out. The Exposition is given for the people. It is for the benefit and enjoyment of all, but to close the Exposition on Sunday is for the belief, and for the very small group of faiths who have no other day at their disposal to visit the World's Fair.

*Christian Advocate.* It will be for the great Exposition and for the people of Chicago who wish to prosper by it, the great mass of the people, not the "moral heroes" nor the "average beer-drinking, barrel," but the best and most civilized and happiest. The "Sabbath" will not be desecrated by opening the Fair on Sunday, and those who do not attend, would feel the usefulness greatly impaired if it were closed. And those who prate of the "Sabbath," misrepresent the facts—to call Sunday the "Sabbath" is not genuine distinction at all.

The last writer but one has fallen into the error of calling those who insist on Sunday closing, "Sabbatarians." Whichever sabbatarians desire that they shall be unmolested in their right to rest on the day of their choice, which is attend the Fair any other day of choice; they likewise insist that all other persons shall have the same full equal privilege. That is exactly what *The American Sentinel* and the National Religious Liberty Association advocates.
