THE Christian Advocate, of this city, remarks that "when people are off for a summer vacation they usually have less regard for the Sabbath than at any other time. They forget that their influence travels with them, and in their forgetfulness they frequently set a bad example." "During these summer months," says the Advocate, "crowds of Americans will sail for Europe. Before returning they will have learned by personal experience what the continental Sunday is. Many of them will talk eloquently against it with their friends at home; but how many of them will hold to their Christian Sabbath while abroad?"

The question is not a hard one to answer. Those who are really conscientious in the observance of the day at home will keep it just the same when abroad, but those who keep it at home simply because others do, will not keep it when among strangers.
