# No Sentinel Next Week!

IN order to give those employed on *The American Sentinel* an opportunity to attend an important meeting, at Mound Holly, New York, September 24 to October 5, there will be no paper issued from this office next week. Number 39 of *The American Sentinel,* will therefore be issued October 8, instead of October 1. Our subscribers will lose nothing by this omission, as it will contain thirteen publications. There will be days in which to learn the twelve papers necessary to complete the volume for the year.
