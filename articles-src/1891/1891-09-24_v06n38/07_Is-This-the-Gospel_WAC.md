The doctrine of National Reformers is that this is a Christian Nation, and that therefore all our laws should be made in accordance with their ideas of the Christian religion, and none but professors of Christianity and conformers to such laws be tolerated here. In other words, it is the theory of intolerance.

A vice-president of the National Reform Association, Rev. E. B. Graham, in a speech delivered at York, Nebraska, May 21, 1885, said:

If the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and for the sake of the devil subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas, and then if they can stand it, stay there till they die.

Rev. Dr. McAllister, one of the editors of the Christian Statesman, the official organ of this Association, at a convention held at Lakeside, Ohio, in August, 1887, likewise said:

Those who oppose this work now, will discover when the religious amendment is made to the Constitution, that if they do not see fit to fall in with the majority, they must abide the consequences, or seek some more congenial clime.

These are the sentiments held, and this the theory advocated by this Association, which was first started in this country in 1863, by the small denomination known as the Reformed Presbyterians, the descendants of the old Covenanters of Scotland. How rapidly these illiberal, un-American, unpatriotic, and unchristian ideas are gaining ground may be judged by the following from the pen of Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage, in the "Ladies' Home Journal" for September, 1891. Writing of the people of East Hampton, Long Island, from his summer home at that place, he says:—

Think of the high state of morals and religion which induced this people, at an early day, at a political town-meeting, to adopt this decree: "We do social and conjoin ourselves and successors to be one town or corporation, and do for ourselves and our successors, and such as shall be adjoined to us at any time hereafter, enter into combination and confederation together to maintain and preserve the purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which we now possess." The pledge of that day has been fully kept.

That document of two centuries ago reads strangely behind the times; but it will be some hundreds of years yet before other communities come up to the point where that document stops. All our laws and institutions are yet to be Christianized. The Puritans took possession of this land in the name of Christ, and it belongs to him; and if people do not like that religion let them go somewhere else. They can find many lands where there is no Christian religion to bother them. Let them emigrate to Greenland, and we will provide them with mittens; or to the South Sea Islands, and we will send them water-coolers. This land is for Christ. Our legislatures and congresses shall yet pass laws as radically evangelical as the venerable document above referred to.

Such sentiments are disloyal to the spirit of a free government, and to the gospel of Christ, it matters not who utters them. Think of Christ who associated with publicans and sinners, who came to seek and to save that which was lost, banishing men to Greenland, or to the South Sea Islands because he did not find them Christians, and of his condescending to promise to send them mittens and water-coolers in order to get rid of them! Is this the spirit of the gospel? Are such utterances calculated to convert anybody? Are infidels likely to be drawn toward the cross, or to behold the matchless charms of Jesus, by such statements? Christ is not lifted up, nor does he draw men, in this way. He never assumed a cold, seclusive, and repellant attitude. He did once, through zeal for the Lord's house, drive the money changers and the traffickers from the temple, and it would not have an unsalutary effect if the money changers and speculators were driven out of the churches calling themselves by his name to-day; but he never drove any one out of the Nation. Neither did he tell his disciples to colonize and banish to regions unknown all not of their faith, who sought their shores. On the contrary, he bade them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."

In the light of these facts the question is pertinent, What are we coming to?

No one can fail to see what will be the result of having all our laws and institutions "Christianized." Those who do not conform to the ideas of those who Christianize (?) them will be kindly told that they can go to Greenland, or the South Sea Islands, and, with the comforting assurance of having a pair of mittens or a water-cooler, stay there till they die, or if they see fit to remain here, "abide the consequences." Again we ask, Is this the gospel?
