A SUNDAY law makes a matter of conscience with the majority a matter of crime in the minority. And the man who observes another day than Sunday, whose labor disturbs the consciences of others, is compelled by such a law to render one-sixth of his income for the sake of the majority. That is, the State by a Sunday law exacts from the Sabbatarian one day in the week, which it does not from the majority.

I DENY the right of the law of the land to define how much, or just when, a man shall rest. I deny that it should say I shall and must rest one day in seven because it is good for me, as I would deny its right to say that I must bathe once a day, or once in every seven days; or that I should refrain from eating pork, or mixing pickles with my ice-cream, because thus to bathe or thus to refrain is good for me. I prefer to receive such instruction from my physician, and not from Congress nor the *American Sabbath Union.*

A CALIFORNIA minister, who seems to see in a Sunday law all the elements of necessary reform, is reported as saying:

"We do not wish to compel any one to stay at home and worship here or that. You must not sell bread and worship here or that. You could sell bread and make an invoice to the civil law to say that this shall be a non-secular day."

"That," says a Pacific Coast paper, "is simply asking for a civil law that will assume the prerogative of God. The Creator of days has never said [page 297] be a non-secular day, and he only can legitimately give character to a day. These Sunday-law preachers always boast that they do not want to say what men shall do on Sunday; but they are forward in demanding what they shall not do. Where is the difference in principle? Let them really succeed in getting the power to prescribe the acts of their fellows to the extent of limiting them, and the success will but whet the appetite for further power. The more of human power they acquire, the more they will depend upon that, and 'obey the power of godliness.' Then determining what men shall do, will follow as a natural consequence."
