A SUNDAY law makes a matter of conscience with the majority a matter of crime in the minority. And the man who observes another day than Sunday, whose labor disturbs the consciences of others, is compelled by such a law to render one-sixth of his income for the sake of the majority. That is, the State by a Sunday law exacts from the Sabbatarian one day in the week, which it does not from the Sunday-keeper.
