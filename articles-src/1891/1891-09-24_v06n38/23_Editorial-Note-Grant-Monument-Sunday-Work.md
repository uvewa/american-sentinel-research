"WORKMEN," says the Sun, of the 15th inst., "are laying the foundation of the Grant monument, at Riverside Park. Work goes on day and night and on Sunday." Why does the Mail and Express, which has long stood as sponsor for the monument enterprise, not cry out against this "desecration of Sunday"? Is it possible that those in charge of the work took a mean advantage of Colonel Shepard's absence in Chicago, to get in their Sunday work in Riverside Park? Evidently New York and Chicago are too far apart, even in these days of rapid transit, for one man to manage two such important enterprises as the World's Fair and the Grant monument.
