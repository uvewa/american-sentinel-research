THE danger of having upon the statute books of any State, an unjust law, even though it may have become a dead letter, is well illustrated by the present persecution of the Jews in Russia. During the latter part of the reign of Emperor Nicholas, the harsh laws relative to the Jews were permitted to fall into disuse to a considerable extent. Alexander II., the father of the present Czar, carried out in a general way the policy inaugurated by his father, Nicholas; and the opinion is expressed that had Alexander lived a few years longer, the Jewish question in Russia would have been permanently settled in a wise and humane way.

But both Nicholas and his son Alexander II. made a fatal mistake in not repealing utterly the anti-Jewish laws enacted by their predecessors; and so when the present Czar came to the throne, he found ready to his hand all the tyrannical anti-Jewish laws that his narrow, bigoted soul could desire; hence in the present persecution of one class of his subjects, Alexander III. is "only enforcing the laws." Unjust laws, even though slumbering in harmless disuse, should be promptly repealed, for though nominally "dead letters" they retain their venom, and may at any time be warmed into life by petty spite or sectarian bigotry.
