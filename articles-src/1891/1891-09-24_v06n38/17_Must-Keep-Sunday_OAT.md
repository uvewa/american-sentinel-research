A CORRESPONDENT has just sent us the following from Du Quoin, Illinois, in regard to the Law and Order League in that place:—

Brief mention was made in last night's News about the organization here by a large number of our best citizens for the purpose of suppressing all desecrations of the Sabbath within the corporate limits of this city. Investigation has developed the fact that the organization is being perfected and is ready for action now. Able counsel has been retained, and the society proposes to prosecute, with vigor, all violations of our ordinance, regarding the Sabbath day in Du Quoin. And where the laws are violated near to the city limits, the violators will be prosecuted under the laws of this State. Baseball, picnics, ratifications, etc., cannot be held with impunity in Du Quoin upon Sunday, without having to answer before our courts for it on Monday morning. Each and every case will be prosecuted without fear or favor. The matter is not only generally being talked about, but very warmly and seriously considered openly and above board.

Our correspondent also informs us that the mayor stopped the playing of baseball inside the corporation of Du Quoin, but granted a special permit to the Germans to hold a picnic on Sunday in the same park where they had been playing baseball. The Sunday-law advocates have sworn vengeance on him for allowing such a thing to be done.

It may be that the Law and Order League has only the "civil Sabbath" in view, but it is a little difficult to understand just how a "civil Sabbath" could be desecrated. In order for anything to be desecrated, it must first be consecrated; and we have not yet learned that the State or any incorporated town has power to consecrate a Sabbath and punish for non-observance of a man made institution. Such a procedure is not in harmony with the institutions of a free Republic like ours, and the danger to freedom concealed in such a movement should be made apparent to all lovers of liberty.

It will be noticed that they propose to "prosecute with vigor, all violations of our ordinance, regarding the Sabbath-day in Du Quoin." The ordinance referred to, reads as follows:—

No person shall on Sunday keep open or permit to be kept open, his or her place of business, or shall pursue his or her daily labor or occupation within the city; provided, this section shall not be applicable to persons who conscientiously observe some other day of the week as Sabbath; nor in cases of necessity or charity; nor to hotels, eating houses, drug stores, butcher shops, tobacco stores, livery stables or street cars. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be subject to a fine of not less than five dollars and not more than one hundred dollars.

It will be noticed that tobacco stores are among the things allowed to remain open on Sunday. Thus their ordinance would fine a man for doing honorable labor on Sunday, and yet would allow another to keep a tobacco store open, dignifying the sale of the "filthy weed" with a place above honest toil.
