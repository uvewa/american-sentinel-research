A vote of thanks should be tendered to Col. Elliott F. Shepard for pushing himself forward as an advocate of Sunday observance in all its moods and tenses, for whenever he opens his mouth he injures his own cause.

Before the National Columbian Commission the doughty Colonel in these words assumed, by way of a variety from that of an interpreter of providences, the prerogative of the prophet. Here is what he said:—

I believe firmly that if the Fair is not closed on Sundays the Lord will put his curse upon the enterprise and on the Nation. He will send plagues and pestilences as he did in the days of Pharaoh. If, on the contrary, the gates are closed on Sundays, the Lord will bless the Fair and make it the grandest success possible. You have no idea of the intense feeling of the Christian world on this subject. It is with us to a man, and should we win it will rejoice as one man. Hence it is imperative that the question should be decided at once.

The promoters of the Sunday cause might well pray to be delivered from its friends.

Apropos of the foregoing is the following item from the Christian at Work, of the 17th inst.:

If Sabbath closing of the Columbus Fair wins, as we believe it will, it will not be by reason of some pleas put up in its behalf. Here, for instance, is the utterance of a speaker at a recent meeting in Chicago:

It is the custom now to follow the example of great men. Germans copy the manners and deeds of the Emperor. In England the Queen, a motherly Christian woman, molds the fashions. The Prince of Wales cannot wear a coat without its being copied by every one the next day. And now here are Jesus and God who rest upon the Sabbath day—let us follow their example.

The idea of commending Sunday closing on the basis of copying Jesus and God, because the public mind is so ready to ape the manners and dress of royalty, will scarcely have weight among the intelligent, if it does not bring the cause of Sunday closing into contempt.

It is only justice to the reading public to say that "a speaker at a recent meeting in Chicago" and "the prophet" are the same.
