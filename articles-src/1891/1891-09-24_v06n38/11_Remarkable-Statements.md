# Remarkable Statements.

*The Boston Traveler,* in the issue of September 14, makes the remarkable charge that Colonel Elliot F. Shepard and his associates to influence the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition to close on Sunday, presents the most overwhelming disproportion, to say—

The *Traveler* says—

The Christian churches of the United States are said to number some fifty-five million denomination, of these who are in the families of church members, who attend Sunday service, of those whose names are on the one or several church books; including those who attend or who may be found from all classes—from the minister's son and daughter, the children professor, the business man who has joined during a revival, and includes, besides all other and all, all the babies in the Catholic Church that have had the ceremony of baptism performed. If these were eliminated, etc., would amount to, say, twenty percent of the entire people of this nation, that is reaches, assists, counts, on in the tenth generation. Americans, and includes all kinds and manner of those cases are in the families of churches and those who are in the church attendance role, if allowed, would make up the rest of the fifty-five millions said to be the church people in the light of facts what she could the Traveler reason! In the absence of actual facts, any such estimation will not be without some statistical reports, and the very most that can be claimed on the basis of actual statistics show fifty-five millions of church people in this country.

The *Traveler* said, "First out fifth Rock," and "those who hold their Christian Sabbath at home for these to that find it," and "bread is the way to the soul to follow Christianity, and others may go in theirs." Has this order been reversed? No. It has always been the same; and it will be so till the end of time, we need only upon his authority write from heaven to this effect, "shall he find faith on the earth." There is plenty of faith and this continent. But it will require a genuine article that will lead men, to love their neighbors.
