The following is a brief list of extracts from newspapers all over the United States, on the subject of Sunday closing of the World's Fair. Most of them were evidently called out by the recent decision of the Lady Managers of the Fair, by a vote of fifty-six to thirty-six, to use their influence to secure the closing of its gates on Sunday:—

**Louisville Times**: The Board of Lady Managers say the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday, thus endorsing the Rev. Mr. Patton's unfeeling remark that if the laboring poor had no other day to devote to the Fair, so much the worse for them. Fortunately, in this one instance, the ladies will not have the last word.

**Lawrence Journal**: The Board of Lady Managers of the World's Fair have decided, as far as they may decide, that the Fair shall be closed Sunday. The American Sunday is safe in the hands of the women.

**St. Joseph Herald**: The day of fanaticism is past, and the people are fast tiring of allowing a set of old women to prescribe their moral polulum. If the Fair is too wicked to be open on Sunday's it is too wicked to be open on Saturdays, and if the Puritans are to be consulted the Heleews and Adventists will want to be heard next.

**New York World**: Bigotry and crankism have combined in an effort to cripple its educational capacity by securing the closing of its gates on the only day of the week when the great multitude of workingmen and their families have leisure to visit it. This effort should be met now with a protest that will defeat it. If the Fair is not to be open Sunday it will lose half its value and half its interest to enlightened minds.

**Kansas City Star**: Col. Elliott F. Shepard declares that if the World's Fair is kept open Sunday the Lord will send a curse upon Chicago, and he is determined that the prophecy shall be fulfilled, even if he is compelled to remove to that city.

**Washington Post**: Perhaps the World's Fair managers will agree to close the show Sunday, if Col. Shepard will agree to remain closed the other six days of the week.

**Terre Haute Express**: The workingmen of Chicago and near-by cities can see the great exhibition Sunday without entailing the double cost of the admission and loss of wages that would be the case on a week day.

**Knoxville Journal**: The Journal believes that every reading-room, every library, every museum, every art gallery, every institution which teaches right and civilization, the world over, ought to be open Sunday's, the only day when the honest and industrious poor can attend and gather a breath of the inspiration of such institutions. The world would be better for it.

**Portland Oregonian**: There will doubtless be churches enough open in Chicago to accommodate those who prefer to attend them on the Sabbath, and the ministers, ushers, and janitors will do the necessary work in them, so that those who attend can enjoy themselves. There are others who would prefer to attend the Fair on that day, who cannot well afford to go on any other, and they should have the privilege of doing so.

**New York Sun**: If the question as to the Sunday opening of the Fair were put to popular vote, undoubtedly it would be decided in the affirmative in a very emphatic way. If the gates are opened on Sunday more visitors will enter than on any other day of the week.

**Kansas City Journal**: More harm would be done by closing it than by keeping it open. If it is open there will be a place for the crowds to go, that will keep them out of mischief, and crowds without the restraint of home to keep them steady, generally find worse places than the Fair in which to spend Sunday.

**San Francisco Examiner**: It is only proper that the World's Fair managers should give respectful attention to the appeals of the many excellent people who have asked them to close the Fair Sundays, but it is to be hoped that the resolution pledging the National Commission to take up and consider the question as soon as it shall properly come before it, does not imply anything more. Sunday closing would probably deprive at least a million people of the privilege—to which, as taxpayers they have a right—of visiting the Fair.

**Springfield Journal**: It is a queer fact that the Chicago saloonkeepers join hands with the Sabbath Union people in desiring that the World's Fair shall be closed Sunday. The Chicago saloons are open Sunday as well as the churches, and the saloonkeepers realize that the man who is attending the Fair will not toss any coin on his bar. Religion, self-interest, and politics are something alike, in that they make strange bed-fellows.

**Baltimore American**: From the recent action of the World's Fair Commissioners on certain phases of the Sunday question, it is quite certain that the ultimate decision will be that the Exposition shall be opened on Sunday, but that the machinery shall be stopped—the idea being to allow the people the opportunity of sight seeing and at the same time to get rid of actual work on that day as much as possible. This will be a compromise, and, like all compromises, it will probably be attacked by the advocates of both sides of the controversy.

**New Orleans Times Democrat**: The people who do not live in Chicago, and on whom the success of the Exposition mainly depends, have also some rights in the matter, and it would be well for them to speak out on the subject. They do not propose to visit Chicago during the Exposition for the purpose of going to church there Sunday, but to the Exposition; and they will naturally be disgusted if they are shut out. The Exposition is given for the benefit of the whole world, whatever its religious belief, and not for the very small group of Sabbatarians who insist that everybody else should be incommoded because they do not care to go to the World's Fair Sunday.

**Detroit Free Press**: It is well for the great Exposition and for the people of Chicago who wish to visit it that the decision of the Lady Managers is not final in the matter of Sunday closing. "The horrid men" have still something to say on the subject, and their decision is likely to be less sentimental and more practical than that of the ladies. The "Sabbath" will not be desecrated by opening the Fair on Sunday. But the great Exposition would find its usefulness greatly impaired if it were not opened the day of all others upon which the poor people will find it most convenient to visit the Fair.

The last writer but one has fallen into the error of calling those who insist on Sunday closing, "Sabbatarians." While Sabbatarians do insist that they shall be unmolested in their right to rest on the day of their choice, and to attend the Fair on any other day they please, they likewise insist that everybody else shall also be left free to enjoy the same privilege. That is exactly what THE SENTINEL contends for.
