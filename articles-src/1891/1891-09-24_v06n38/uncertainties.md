# Uncertainties Log: v06n38 (1891-09-24)

No significant uncertainties encountered in this issue. The OCR quality was good overall.

## Minor Notes:
- Page 2, line 47: "fittiness" - appears in original text (likely archaic spelling of "filthiness")
- Page 3, line 158: "Incline and Fall" - appears to be OCR error for "Decline and Fall" (Gibbon's famous work)
- Page 5, line 289: "polulum" - unusual word, but appears intentional in St. Joseph Herald quote
- Page 5, line 289: "Heleews" - appears to be OCR error for "Hebrews" in St. Joseph Herald quote
- Page 7, line 358: "363" - page number appears incorrect (should be 303), but transcribed as shown
- Author signature "O. A. TATE" (article 17) - previously recorded as "AOT" (A. O. Tait) in known authors list; this appears to be a variant spelling
