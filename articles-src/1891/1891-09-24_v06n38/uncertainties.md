# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, September 24, 1891 (v06n38)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

This issue was transcribed from low-resolution scan images (/tmp/as1891n38-1.png through /tmp/as1891n38-8.png). The small text size in the three-column format, combined with the scan quality, made many passages very difficult to read. Multiple articles contain passages where the transcription is a best-effort reading with LOW to MEDIUM confidence. A higher-resolution scan would be needed for full accuracy.

## Pages 1-2 (297-298)

### "The American Sentinel and the Church"
- **Page 1, right column bottom:** "...and of judgment, and as the Comforter and the"
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM - the transition text at the column break is hard to read
  - **Reason:** Standard Adventist theology suggests this reading (Holy Spirit convicts of sin, righteousness, and judgment; John 16:8)

- **Page 2, left column:** "And as we read, she 'was arrayed in purple...'"
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM - the transition between pages is unclear; "And as we read, she" is a best guess

- **Page 2, left column:** "She could not have had her hands made drunken..."
  - **Confidence:** LOW - "hands" may be wrong; possibly "have been made drunken"

- **Page 2, left column:** Block quote from Rev. Charles W. Shields
  - **Transcribed as:** "To would exclude the Roman Catholic Church, mother of all, the church of nations and of races..."
  - **Confidence:** LOW - this passage is very difficult to read and the transcription may be significantly garbled
  - **Reason:** The block quote text in this small font is barely legible

- **Page 2, left column:** "best to make Doctor Shields's appalling representative confessional a fact"
  - **Confidence:** LOW - "Doctor Shields's" and "representative confessional" are uncertain readings

- **Page 2, right column:** "*Thereby apostolic preaching.*"
  - **Confidence:** LOW - this italicized phrase is very hard to read; it may be a different phrase entirely

- **Page 2, right column:** "Prov. 9:12 last parts, Ecclesiastes."
  - **Note:** This line appeared at the end of the article in the first transcription pass but was removed as it may be a page reference or footnote rather than article text
  - **Confidence:** LOW

- **Page 2, right column, last paragraphs:** "Christians are nobody to call themselves Christians and nobody to call Christians and to call us"
  - **Confidence:** LOW - this sentence is garbled; the original likely reads differently

## Page 3 (299)

### Short Items Between "Not Dependent upon Men" and "Taking Another Step"
- **Obstruction:** Very small text, low scan resolution
- **Second pass completed:** Yes, multiple passes attempted
- **Confidence:** VERY LOW - entire section
- **Reason:** The text of these short editorial items (approximately 3-4 paragraphs in the left column between the two article headings) is almost completely illegible at this scan resolution. The transcription in 04a_Short-Items-Page-3-4.md is largely guesswork and should not be relied upon. A higher-resolution scan is essential for accurate transcription of these items.

### "Taking Another Step" - Opening Verse
- **Transcribed as:** "One brick upon another, / And the highest wall is laid; / One step, and then another..."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - this appears to be a children's verse but exact wording is uncertain

### "Taking Another Step" - Later Portions (Right Column)
- **Obstruction:** Small text, flowing across columns
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW to MEDIUM for many passages in the right column continuation
- **Reason:** The text about the law, postmasters, courts, and various quotes is very difficult to read accurately

### "Is It the Gospel?" by W. A. Blakely
- **Obstruction:** Small text at bottom of right column
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM for the main paragraphs, LOW for the quoted law text and final paragraphs
- **Reason:** The legal text quoted and the concluding paragraphs are in very small type

## Pages 3-4 (299-300)

### Short Items (Page 3 Left Column and Page 4 Left Column)
- **Confidence:** VERY LOW for entire section
- **Reason:** These editorial notes about the Association, Reformed Presbyterians, Rev. Talmage, etc. are in small type that is barely legible. The transcription is largely garbled and should not be relied upon.

### "Too Sensitive"
- **Main text:** Confidence MEDIUM-HIGH for the first several paragraphs
- **Right column continuation (page 5):**
  - "the running of a sewing-machine on Sunday are a little too sensitive, and the reason ought to be in them instead of encouraging them in their intolerance."
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Attribution:** "W. A. COLCORD."
  - **Confidence:** MEDIUM - W. A. Colcord appears as an author in other issues of the Sentinel
- **Final paragraphs:**
  - **Confidence:** LOW - several sentences appear garbled

### "Legislation by Clamor" by A. T. J.
- **Pages 4-5:** The article beginning is clear but the continuation on page 5 contains several passages of LOW confidence

## Page 8 (304)
