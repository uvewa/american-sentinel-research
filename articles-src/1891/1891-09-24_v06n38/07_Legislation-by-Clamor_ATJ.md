# Legislation by Clamor.

It is already evident that one feature of the Sunday-law movement of the present will be the subjection of legislatures to the presence of groups of persons who are capable of employing newspapers in controlling votes. Under the old system of legislation, the unity of legislature was to study carefully the details of proposed bills, to deliberate in discuss measures, and so, by deliberation, to arrive at deci-[page 300] sions; notice was that the statements should know what he intended to be, and should consider the proper means of reaching the desired results. This theory of legislation never has been very thoroughly put in practice anywhere, but has ever been more or less anticipated; but it is anticipated, that no one intend to seek a more complete realization of it as a reform in legislation, the call has been answered a time in altogether.

At the same time, therefore, that there is at vast extension of the field of legislation, there is an almost total transfer as to the method of legislation policy. Legislative bodies not only but imperfectly come to be acted upon by legitimate influences, but they submit to clamor more than to any other influence. The tendency is to travel through the legislative process of France, England, and the United States, during the last twenty-five years, is obviously in the direction of legislation by clamor. We have already carried it to such a degree that any effort to make political reforms out of a candidature to-day is un-American. Of a certain candidature for a local office, it says:—

> ministers to reflect whether they are determined to leave the civil power in matters of conscience from which they strive to extinguish; and it seems self-evident, that the magistrate is as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine which does not intimidate must give way to corporal pains to the perversion of the law; and his son and daughter are to be reduced to by many capital punishment.—*Justice and Fall of the Roman Republic.*

Pressing this inclination to human nature, the Harlan Herbert Spencer observes that "if the first step has been taken with seeming impunity, it will readily be assumed that a second is. School boys provoking of 'mind this ones,' are not to be tolerated. Make a hole through the principles by which to admit voluntary exception, and no person of authority, exception will be apt to be thrust through after it so as he further to stand in the way."
