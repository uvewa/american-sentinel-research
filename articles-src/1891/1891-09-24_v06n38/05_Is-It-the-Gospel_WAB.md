# Is It the Gospel?

The doctrine of National Reformers is that this is a Christian Nation, and that therefore all our laws should be made to accommodate with their ideas for Christianity and conformers to such as may be tolerated here. In other words, it is the theory of intolerance.

A vice-president of the National Reform Association, Rev. E. B. Graham, in a speech delivered at York, Pennsylvania, May 15, 1869, said:—

> If the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and for the sake of the experiment, try to found a community of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas, and then if they like it better, stay there.

Rev. Dr. McAllister, one of the editors of the *Christian Statesman*, the official organ of this Association, at a convention held at Lakeside, Ohio, in August, 1887, said:—

> Those who oppose this work over, will discover the situation, that if they do not see fit to fall in the majority, they must come to its own work at once or work anew more consciously.

"These men are telling people to 'promote their work,' at all violations, and of Sunday regulations regarding the Sabbath-day to call the Nation. This is the gospel?

No one can fail to see what will be the result of having all our laws bent and distorted to "Christianize." Those who do not conform to the ideas of those who Christianize in them will be kindly told that they can go to Greenland, or the South Sea Islands, and, with the comforting assurance of having a pair of mittens or a palm-leaf fan. Come and then if they die, or if they see fit to return here, "abide the consequences." Again we ask, is this the gospel?

W. A. BLAKELY.
