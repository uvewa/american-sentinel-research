THE Independent, of this city, is not at all confident that the World's Fair will be closed on Sunday. Of the recent hearing granted to representatives of the American Sabbath Union and other bodies, by the World's Fair Commission, concerning the question of Sunday closing, the Independent says:—

It does not indicate what the probable outcome will be. . . . We wish that we could believe with Colonel Shepard that the matter is practically settled, and that it is "almost certain that the gates of the Exposition will be closed on Sunday."

The Independent further remarks that "so much is involved in the right decision of this question that every possible argument and influence should be used to secure it." The threatened Christian (?) boycott is one of the "possible arguments," and there are some possible "influences" that are not generally considered legitimate. Is there so much involved that these "arguments" and "influences" should be used? Does the Independent really mean "every possible argument and influence"? If our contemporary means this, and the end would really justify the means, it should at once call upon the Mail and Express to open a subscription list to a gigantic corruption fund in the interest of Sunday closing.
