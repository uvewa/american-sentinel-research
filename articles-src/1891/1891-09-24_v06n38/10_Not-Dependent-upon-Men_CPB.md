COLONEL INGERSOLL is reported as saying, concerning the Sunday-closing question, "We have got to destroy the Sabbath."

The Colonel could scarcely have said a more unfortunate thing; nor one that would have better pleased the Sunday-law advocates. A fight for personal liberty is one thing, and a fight against a cherished institution is quite another. A great many men who would quite agree with Mr. Ingersoll were he to insist that personally he has a perfect right to rest, play, or work on Sunday, just as he sees fit, will have no sympathy with his expressed determination to destroy "the Sabbath."

As a matter of fact, however, aside from the question of what day is the true Sabbath, it is impossible for any man or for any number of men to destroy it. The Sabbath is not dependent upon the will of men, the wicked Colonel and the presumptuous Sunday-law advocates to the contrary notwithstanding.

Probably those who insist that "Sunday laws are necessary for the preservation of the Sabbath," do not realize that their words are a confession that their so-called Sabbath is only a man-made institution. That which man has instituted he may annul; but God's institutions are not dependent upon the will of men. The Sabbath was made a sign between God and his people (Eze. 20:20), and so long as there remains upon the earth a single soul, loyal to his Maker, the Sabbath will serve the purpose for which it was instituted; yea, and of the new earth (2 Peter, 3:13) God has declared, that "from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come up to worship before" him. Isa. 66:23. The Sabbath will survive all the attacks of both presuming and wicked men. The former may blasphemously assume that the Sabbath is dependent upon them, and the latter may endeavor to destroy it, but the event will prove them equally helpless. The Sabbath lives in the hearts and lives of God's people, and in the facts set forth in the fourth commandment, namely, that "in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." It is, therefore, equally foolish to talk of preserving or of destroying it.
