# Editorial Notes.

*The Christian at Work,* of September 10, in an article on "The Roman Catholic Church in the United States," thus describes complications: "The march of events, the growing tendency toward separation of Church and State, and the complete freedom of the people from the use alone to propagate sectarianism in any form, is become a necessity."

At a mass meeting at Oakland, California, has decided to be open other from 10 to 11 a. m., instead of from 10 to 1; that is, formerly, much to the dismay of the church-goers who say that they want to get their mail after attending meeting and not before. The Prison of that city proposes that office be closed all day on Sunday. The Sunday people have been quite liberal based from on this proposition.

---

The following dispatch, received the other day in Chicago presents a new phase of the Sunday-closing question:

> *Weatherford, Texas, September 9.* Board of Managers at Commerce, September through one thousand Texans protest against the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. But—

> NARROW TEXAS FAIR ASSOCIATION.

"This," remarks the Chicago *Journal,* "will probably prove a starter for hundreds of such protests. So far but one side of the question has been heard; the advocates against the opening. Now the other side has its innings."

---

"WORKERS," says the *Sun,* of the 15th inst., "are laying the foundation of the Great monument, at Riverside Park. Work goes on day and night and on Sunday." Why does the *Mail and Express,* which has long stood as sponsor for the [page 304] monument enterprise, not cry out against this "desecration of Sunday"? Is it possible that those in charge of the work took a mean advantage of Colonel Shepard's absence in Chicago, to get in their Sunday work in Riverside Park? Evidently New York and Chicago are too far apart, even in these days of rapid transit, for one man to manage two such important enterprises as the World's Fair and the Great monument.

A RECENT count made in Boston by a religious journal revealed the fact that the morning and afternoon attendance at 101 churches was only 17,095, whilst nearly 40,000 took trains or boats out of town, or rode in the horse cars, on recreation bound. Noting this fact in its relation to the demand for the closing of the Chicago Fair, a New York daily says: "Are not the convictions and the wishes of the great majority of the people entitled to consideration in this democratic country of free institutions?"

---

*The Sun,* of Bradford, Pennsylvania, remarks, that "Mr. Crafts's idea is that men who can rest on the Sabbath and won't, must be made to. That idea seems to have been uppermost in the minds of the Legislature which framed the law of 1794. But, in the march upward and onward since then, the fact has been so completely forgotten that it was in danger of utter oblivion until Crafts and his followers brought it more to the notice of the day. Luckily we are not going backwards; and in the direction of 1794, but headed forward toward the twentieth century."

The Rev. Henry Blanchard, one of the most prominent ministers of Portland, Maine, refuses to sign a petition against Sunday concerts, and says that he is willing to have the experiment tried, and then judge the results. Of the argument made by those who oppose the concerts, he says: "I agree not with them before listening; and not to the Sunday concert the desecration of the Sunday. I regard it as a day of worship and enjoyment. And I would prefer that men be in music in public parks under wise control."

Upon this an evening paper, of this city, says:—

> It will be remembered that many leading ministers of this city advocated the opening of the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday, and a similar diversity of sentiment among the clergy is perceptible throughout the country.

---

*The Independent,* of this city, is not at all confident that the World's Fair will be closed on Sunday. Of the recent lease granted to representatives of the American Sabbath Union and other bodies, by the World's Fair Commission, concerning the opening of Sunday closing, the *Independent* says:—

> It does not indicate what the probable outcome will be. We wish that we could believe with Colonel Shepherd that the matter is practically

settled and that it is "almost certain that the gates of the Exposition will be closed on Sunday."

*The Independent* further remarks that "so much is involved in the right decision of this question that every possible argument and influence should be used to secure it." The threatened Christian (!) boycott is one of the "possible arguments," and there are some possible "influences" that are not generally considered legitimate. Is there so much involved that these "arguments" and "influences" should be used? Does *The Independent* really mean "every possible argument and influence"? Temperance men really do mean this, and the end would and would justify the means, it should at once on the *Mail and Express* to open a subscription list to a gigantic corruption fund in the interest of Sunday closing.

---

It has always been a strong advance of the entire separation of Church and State, and the full recognition of the right of every man to worship as conscience dictates, and to observe or not to observe any day or institution of religion, because of his religious belief or lack of religion, protected in the right by civil law. The fact that a man has to be a Catholic or a Presbyterian does not indicate any reason: The American or it is not confined to religious or civil rights.

---

*The News* is quite right as to the principle. Let every man have the right of the most religious bigotry is pretty active in this country, however, and were it not for liberal ideas, as to the constitutional guarantees, it would be found more than necessary to defend. It was seen that the "free air" as we are wont to call it, has no remainder of effort acquired than of men, the movement of all else concerning evil for the "good time coming," which bears still in the vision of National Reformers and American Sabbath Unionists.

"It is high time to sound the alarm, when a comparatively small, but influential and well-organized body of ambitious clericals and troubled Protestants, backed by the Jesuits of the Catholic hierarchy, boldly and openly seek to blacken the character, if not the front, of our government from a purely secular to an ecclesiastical or priestly rule, and to compel all the people to bow, to all forms of government, the most tyrannical, that can well be conceived."
