The Boston Traveler, in its issue of September 10, referring to the recent effort made by Colonel Shepard and his associates to influence the Commissioners of the World's Fair to close its gates on Sunday, presents the most overwhelming (?) argument in favor of such a closing that we have seen yet. The Traveler says:—

The Christian churches of the United States, with their communicants, families, and affiliations are said to number over fifty-five millions.

That is to say, if we get the idea correctly, all whose names are on the various church books, including the wolves in sheep's clothing, the back-slidden professor, the business man who has joined the most popular church for business and social interests, all the babies in the Catholic Church that have arrived at the age of a few short weeks and have been christened, etc., would amount to, say, twenty millions. Then the "affiliations," such as all the uncles, aunts, cousins, on to the tenth generation, friends and acquaintances of church members and of those who are in the families of church members, would make up the rest of the "fifty-five millions." It is not intended to be rash, but in the light of facts what else could the Traveler mean? Certainly a great literary center like the "Huh" would not be without some statistical reports, and the Traveler would not want it understood that actual statistics show fifty-five millions of church members.

The Saviour said, "Fear not little flock," and "Narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it," and "broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat." Has this order been reversed? No, by no means. It is as true to-day as when the Master first uttered it. And to show that it will be so till the end of time, we need only quote his words, "Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?" There is plenty of show and parade in matters of religion, but the genuine article that will lead men to love their neighbor as themselves is not so manifest.
