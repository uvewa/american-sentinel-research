THE Era, of Bradford, Pennsylvania, remarks, that "Mr. Crafts's idea is that men who can rest on the Sabbath and won't, must be made to. That idea seems to have been uppermost in the minds of the Legislature which framed the law of 1794. But, in the march upward and onward since that date, that law has been so completely forgotten that it was in danger of utter oblivion until Crafts and his followers brought it once more to the light of day. Luckily we are not going backward in the direction of 1794, but are headed forward toward the twentieth century."
