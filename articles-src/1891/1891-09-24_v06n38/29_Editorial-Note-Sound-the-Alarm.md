"It is high time to sound the alarm, when a comparatively small, but influential and well-organized body of ambitious and unrestful Protestants, backed by the Jesuits of the Catholic hierarchy, boldly and openly seek to change the character, if not the form, of our Government, from a purely secular to an ecclesiastical or priestly rule, which experience has proved to be, of all forms of government, the most tyrannical, the most cruel, and the most oppressive."
