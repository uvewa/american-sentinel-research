THE Albion, Nebraska, News thinks that any effort to make political capital out of a candidate's religion is un-American. Of a certain candidate for a local office, it says:—

The News has always been a strong advocate of the entire separation of Church and State, and the present attempt to catch votes for Mr. Felly on account of his religion, instead of his qualifications for the office, should be rebuked, and we believe it will be. The fact that Mr. Felly may be a Catholic or a Presbyterian cuts no figure whatever. The free American air is not conducive to religious persecution.

The News is quite right as to the principle. The fact, however, is that religious bigotry is pretty active in this country, and were it not for liberal laws and constitutional guarantees, it would be seen that the "free air" we are wont to boast of, has somehow or other acquired a taint of intolerance that bodes evil for the "good time coming," which looms up in the vision of National Reformers and American Sabbath Unionists.
