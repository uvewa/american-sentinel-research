# Must Keep Sunday.

A CONVENTION has just met in the city of Des Moines, Illinois, in regard to the Law and Order League in this city.

Brief mention was made in last night's paper of an effort being made by a committee of our best citizens for the purpose of suppressing all violations of the Sunday law within the city limits of this city. Investigation has developed the fact that a regularly organized Law and Order League, similar to those in other cities, has been formed, and the society proposes to prosecute, with the consent of all citizens, all persons where Sunday laws are violated near to the city limits, the society asking that everybody shall cooperate in this work. The first case to be prosecuted is that of a person who is held with impunity in its ground on their field, and is to be brought up in the police court on Monday morning. Each and every case of this nature will be closely watched and very warningly and seriously considered openly and fairly.

Our correspondent also informs us that the person stopped the playing of baseball came into the [page 302] corporation of Du Quoin, but granted a special permit to the Senators to hold a game on children in the same park where they had been playing baseball. The Sunday-law advocates have never any vengeance on him for allowing such a thing to be done.

It may be that the Law and Order League means well, but it seems to those who take a little difficult to understand just how a "civil" body can consistently hold together in such a constitution, for be it observed, it must be consistent; and we have not yet learned that State or any other body's Government has power to consecrate a Sabbath and punish for non-observance of a man endued with the same rights of conscience. And it is not consistent with the institutions of a free Republic like ours, to punish for non-observance of any day; and that statement should be made apparent to all lovers of freedom.

It will be noticed that they propose to "prosecute their work," at all violations, and of Sunday regulations regarding the Sabbath-day for a call to the Nation. This—

No person shall on Sunday keep open or permit to be kept open any place of business or engage in any labor, except works of charity or necessity for the good; the city; provided, this section shall not be construed to apply to any person who conscientiously observes as the Sabbath any other day of the week, and actually refrains on that day from secular work and labor; provided he does not compel any person in his or her employ or of necessity or charity; nor to hotels, eating houses, or restaurants; nor to drug stores; nor to livery stables or street cars. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction fined in a sum not less than one hundred dollars.

It will be noticed that the penalties are among the things allowed to remain open on Sunday, and yet there are the things that are called an honorable labor on Sunday, and yet would allow the sale of the "filthy weed" with a place more than the table of the "filthy stool."
