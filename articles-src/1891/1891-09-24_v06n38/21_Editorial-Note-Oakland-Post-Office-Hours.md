THE Post-master at Oakland, California, has decided to open the post-office from 10 to 11 A. M., instead of from 12 M. to 1 P. M., as formerly, much to the disgust of the church-goers who say that they want to get their mail after attending meeting and not before. The Tribune of that city proposes that the office be closed all day Sunday. The Sunday people have not been heard from on this proposition.
