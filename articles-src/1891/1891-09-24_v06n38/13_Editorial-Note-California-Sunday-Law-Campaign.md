THE question of a Sunday law is being agitated in California in connection with the political campaign, and voters are urged to take this matter into consideration in deciding how to vote. It is not known just how much work is being done by the friends of a Sunday law, as they are working quietly securing the pledges of candidates for the Legislature. But some active work is being done by the opponents of Sunday laws. The following is a paragraph from a circular which has been scattered in some portions of the State:

Will you vote for a Sunday law, or for men pledged to enact a Sunday law? Should not the State guarantee to every man the right to keep any day or no day just as he chooses? The Sunday law is simply a relic of the Dark Ages; and such a law, if enacted, would be used as an engine of religious despotism. Sunday laws formed an important part of the penal code in the "good old days" when religious bigotry thrived, when witches were hanged, and heretics burned at the stake.

It is not thought that the Sunday-law sentiment is sufficiently strong in California to sustain such a law if it were enacted, of which, however, there seems to be little probability.
