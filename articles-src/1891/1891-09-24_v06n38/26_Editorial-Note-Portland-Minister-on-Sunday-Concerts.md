THE Rev. Henry Blanchard, one of the most prominent ministers of Portland, Maine, refuses to sign a petition against Sunday concerts, and says that he is willing to have the experiment tried, and then judge the result. Of the argument made by those who oppose the concerts, he says:

I can not agree with these brethren in their view of the Sunday. I regard it as a day of worship and rational recreation. I have advocated the use of music in public parks under wise control.

Upon this an evening paper, of this city, says:—

It will be remembered that many leading ministers of this city advocated the opening of the Metropolitan Museum on Sunday, and a similar division of sentiment among the clergy is perceptible throughout the country.
