THE Texas Methodists have, according to the Texas Christian Advocate, adopted the following resolution expressive of their views of the necessity of enforced Sunday observance:

Resolved, That we record with deep sorrow the earnest effort of our late State Senate to allow saloons and almost every other business to be run more than half of the Christian Sabbath, thus to abolish the Sabbath, which is the great bulwark of our holy Christianity and high civilization.

Think of it; the "Christian Sabbath" dependent upon the action of the Texas Legislature! How is it that whereas Christianity once flourished in spite of the civil power, and in the face of bitter persecution, it is now dependent on the favor of that power? Is there not some mistake about this matter?
