The Texas Methodists have, according to the *Texas Christian Advocate,* adopted the following resolution expressive of their views of the necessity of enforced Sunday observance:

*Resolved,* That we record with deep sorrow the fact that stores and almost every other business to be run continuously except for the day on which to abolish the Sabbath, which is the great bulwark of not holy Christianity and holy religion.

Think of it, the "Christian Sabbath" being "destroyed upon the sands of the Texas Legislature." How is it that the Christianity once flourished in spite of the civil power, and for the face of bitter persecution, it is now dependent on the favor of that power? Is there no one to instruct or mistake about this matter?

The danger of having upon the statute books of any State, an unjust law, even though it may have become a dead letter, is well illustrated by the present persecution of the Jews in Russia. The laws of the latter part of the reign of Emperor Nicholas, the harsh laws relative to the Jews were permitted to fall into disuse for a considerable extent. Alexander II., the father of the present Czar, carried out in a general way the policy inaugurated by his father, Nicholas, and the opinion was expressed that had Alexander lived a few years longer, the Jewish question in Russia would have been permanently settled in a wise and humane way.

No one can fail to see what will be the result of having all our laws bent and distorted to "Christianize." Those who do not conform to the ideas of those who Christianize in them will be kindly told that they can go to Greenland, or the South Sea Islands, and, with the comforting assurance of having a pair of mittens or a palm-leaf fan. Come and then if they die, or if they see fit to return here, "abide the consequences." Again we ask, in this the gospel?

The Sabbath lives in the hearts and lives of God's people and in the facts set forth in the fourth commandment, namely, that "in six days the Lord made heaven, and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it." It is the divine, God-wrought institution and no man is capable of destroying it.

The question of a Sunday law is being urged by the friends of a Sunday law, so they want to see that their worship is not disturbed on Saturday, and they would only be laughed at if they made any such demand, and very properly too. If all the lives and grand and industrial bodies of religious men are entitled to such protection, so are, for the theory of our political system is that all men are entitled to equal protection of the law. It is high time that people came to understand that demands that do not exist in this country by tolerance, but by right, that said right, and that each is just and ought, and he just as pointedly guarded by the government; the right is the dominant one.

Will you vote for a Sunday law, or for such changes in a Sunday law? Should one man be obligated against his right to keep any kind of a Sabbath on the first day of the week? The first step is only a relic of the Dark Ages, and each and every Sunday law question will come to a standpoint. Sunday law formed an important part of the penal code, in type of "church and state" together, the dark ages following, the witches were hanged, close-communion.

It is not thought that the Sunday-law movement is entitled to persist in any Sunday law endeavor to sustain such a law if it were enacted, or work, however, there seems to be little to sustain.

*Christian Advocate,* of this city, states that "when people are of for a summer that consequently they ought to leave the Sabbath the same as that or no other the care. They said that mothers and friends travel with them, and in their congregations they frequently get a bad example."

During these summer months," says the *Advocate,* "crowds of Americans will sail for Europe. Before they left their party have learned by personal piety it is the continuous Sunday. Many of those who sail will take eloquently against it with their families. Some of these church members are able to hold their Christian Sabbath when about.
