# Taking Another Step.

A LITTLE school boy once spoke—
"One brick upon another,
And the highest wall is laid;
One step, and then another,
And—and yet from bad to worse"—
he finally stammered, much to the amusement of the bystanders. But oftentimes the blunt, direct restatement of facts on some such coarse, common express truths that have all the force of prophecy, and at the same time have the reputation of telling the truth.

The idea of taking one step and then another, was the idea upon which the religious and civil powers were united in Rome. It has always been the plan of church managers in overstepping their legitimate powers and invading the rights of the people. It was the plan England adopted in attempting to subjugate the American colonists; but it did not succeed, for the simple reason that the colonists objected to the first step—and objected to it a way that was felt throughout the land. It is the plan adopted to-day by our religio-political agitators. They first ask for a law closing the World's Fair on Sunday; then they will want a Sunday law with an exemption clause; then they will want a law to make the Sabbatarians to keep Saturday; and so on. Of course, they will deny this; but that is merely because they do not see it now, and that is simply the logical outcome of the plan they have adopted.

It is only in comparatively recent times that they had a law in New England forbidding the celebration of Christmas, with penalties attached; and now comes the news that the Jews must not only observe [page 299] Haman's Sunday law, but also work on Saturday. "Jews," says a Boston journal, "have been forbidden to observe the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday), and to close their shops on that day, and are compelled to shut up their shops on Sunday."

How long will it be if the present demands of the Sunday-law advocates are granted before they will demand that the Sabbatarians of this country be forbidden to observe the seventh day of the week?

"Civil Government and Religion" calls attention to steps already taken in their demands, and it would be well to look to see where we will light, before we take our leap. The worst thing that—

Nor are they going to be content with a little, accordingly, speaking before the United States Senate committee in 1889, in favor of the *Blair* Sunday—

The law allows the local postmaster, if he chooses to do so, to open his office and distribute mail on Sunday, provided he does not molest the rest and quiet of others; but it is a strange interpretation and application of the law which makes a person a criminal because the devotions of his neighbors. One has no right to so place his religion so near to business—

One who from principle observes Saturday as a day of rest is certainly entitled to protection in that observance. If he works on Sunday, provided he does not molest the rest and quiet of others; of him there can require no further service; but it is a strange interpretation and application of the law which makes a person a criminal because the devotions of his neighbors. One has no right in religion to so encumber or so to say that it is right to religion matters to require of a Court. A Court in Cincinnati created an injunction against running certain cars or stages on Sunday, because it disturbed a religious meeting. But the courts do not abolish the Sabbath, which is the great bulwark of not holy Christianity and holy religion.

A law forbidding the opening between he and offers competition," and, "A law forbidding any and all Sunday works—

How much more? He continues—

A law forbidding any tendering of Sunday mail at such hour as would interfere with church and religious meetings. How much more?

A law forbidding the carrying on of all manufacture on Sunday. How much more? He continues—

A law forbidding any and all Sunday railroad operations. And, "It seems to me that all these operations shall be open at all on Sunday, we should at some time or other be brought face to face to see more than this."

How many more? Still he continues—

A law forbidding all further delivery of mail and the entire delivery would be further confined, and we had to pray. Then he says—

There is a law is instructing the Postmaster General to make or further contracts which shall compel labor and business on that day. But it is reduced or distributed on that day.

And then further steps are suggested of the Government in carrying out their monopolistic operations, including the abolition of that not at all. Nothing short of a complete and respective national Sabbath there. This is proved by Dr. McAllister's words at Lakeside, Ohio, July, 1887, as follows:—

> Let a man be what he may—Jew, seventh-day observer, or nothing—he can have by right, just as in other cases, the civil courts and civil Government to apply to every one; that day there shall be no public desecration of. That is what we want. Call this Sabbath, the day of rest for the Nation. They had a right day of rest in the time of the Roman Empire, when the whole of the Roman Empire was required to serve for the Nation at large, to that not to work as a matter of religion. Is it not a disgrace that Christians are not able to get that which pagans could secure?

I would say to the Presbyterian clergy of Virginia saw the universal human history and broad humanity that they withdrew their support from the religious legislation in that State in 1786. Speaking of this change of front, Madison says—

The Presbyterian clergy, too, who were so pressed friends in the scheme of the latter in giving it as we the support of teachers to give instruction to the religion as without any education... the help of that civil law of advances of the probability of further indifference of the Expediters, if (say one begins to detect is on to)

It is the same, to, to the initiation of the penalty. Small fines have already failed to keep Sabbatarians from Sunday work. The prosecutors are exasperated and proceeds plowing on Sunday as a nuisance in the case of the Seventh-day Adventist cases now pending in the United States courts and a fine of seventy-five dollars is imposed. When what fails a little accordingly, the deficit served as, in most severity will, what will be done next? Gibson makes the following observation:

> ministers to reflect whether they are determined to leave the civil power... in matters of conscience than which they strive to extinguish; and it seems self-evident, that the magistrate is as well as the crime, of the offender. The fine which does not intimidate, must give way to corporal pains to the perversion of the law; and his son and daughter... are to be reduced to... by many capital punishment.—*Justice and Fall of the Roman Republic.*
