THE following dispatch, received the other day in Chicago presents a new phase of the Sunday-closing question:—

Weatherford, Texas, September 9.—Board of Control Columbian Exposition: One hundred thousand Texans protest against the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The day of fanaticism is past. NORTHWEST TEXAS FAIR ASSOCIATION.

"This," remarks the Chicago Journal "will probably prove a starter for hundreds of such protests. So far but one side of the question has been heard, the advocates against the opening. Now the other side has its inning."
