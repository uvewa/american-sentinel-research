# Too Sensitive.

Two Polish Hebrews were arraigned in Gates Avenue Police Court, in Brooklyn, recently, on complaint made by a Catholic priest charging that on Sunday they run sewing-machines in their house to the great annoyance of his congregation, and in the circumstantial disturbance of divine service in the church. The Jews answered that they kept Saturday as a religious day, and claimed the privilege of working on Sunday. The Court said that they were right, and dismissed the complaint. These facts are stated by the *Christian Advocate,* only, which comments upon them thus—

One who from principle observes Saturday as a day of rest is certainly entitled to protection in that observance. If he works on Sunday, provided he does not molest the rest and quiet of others; of him there can require no further service; but it is a strange interpretation and application of the law which makes a person a criminal because the devotions of his neighbors. One has no right in religion to so encumber his neighbors as to say at a mission with the noise of his machinery. But it is also true that, A Court in Cincinnati created an injunction against running certain cars or stages on a certain street one Sunday, because it disturbed a religious meeting. Neighborhood discomposure is not so easy at that time.

It is strange it has not occurred to the *Advocate* that it is very unlikely that in this case there was any real disturbance. If sewing machines were running in the same building occupied by a worshiping congregation, and separated from them only by a thin partition, or single ceiling, it might be considered a real disturbance; but that such light machinery operated in another building could disturb a congregation is not at all likely, and seems scarcely possible.

The trouble with Sunday disturbance is that a great many people are too easily disturbed when other causes than Sunday religious faith and practice. The writer was formerly acquainted with a minister of the gospel, now deceased, who quite early in life joined the regular Baptist Church. Afterwards he became an observer of the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. At that time he was the publisher of a weekly paper somewhere in Wisconsin, and he used to set the composition himself. After beginning to observe the seventh day, he very naturally devoted Sunday to setting type. His work was done in a back room on the second floor, but some people were very much disturbed [page 300] by it. The case of the two Polish Jews in Brooklyn is probably similar. Worshiping congregations, and indeed all sorts of orderly gatherings, should be protected from all real disturbance, not only on Sunday but on all other days; but the protection should be to the peace of the whole congregation and not to the maintenance of any religious institution, nor of some point of view that feels that the world was made for him, and that no one ought to move except as he (the priest) takes payment. People who are disturbed by the running of a sewing-machine on Sunday are a little too sensitive, and the reason ought to be in them instead of encouraging them in their intolerance.

We do have yet to hear of the laws asking anybody to suspend ordinary work in order that their worship may not be disturbed on Saturday, and they would only be laughed at if they made any such demand, and very properly too. If all the life and grand and industrial bodies of religious men are entitled to such protection, so are, for the theory of our political system is that all men are entitled to equal protection of the law. It is high time that people came to understand that demands that do not exist in this country by tolerance, but by right, that said right, and that each is just and ought, and he just as pointedly guarded by the government; the right is the dominant one.
