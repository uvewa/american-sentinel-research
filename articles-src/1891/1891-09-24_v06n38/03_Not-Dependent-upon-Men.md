# Not Dependent upon Men.

COLONEL INGERSOLL is reported as suggesting, concerning the Sunday-closing of the Fair: "We have to destroy the Sabbath."

The Colonel could scarcely have said a more unfortunate thing; one for that would have better pleased the Sunday-law advocates. A fight for personal liberty is one thing, and a fight against a church institution is quite another. A great many men who would quite agree with Mr. Ingersoll that personally he has a perfect right to rest, or play, or work on Sunday, as he pleases, will have no sympathy with him in an attempt to "destroy" the "Sabbath."

As a matter of fact, however, aside from the question of what day is the true Sabbath, it is impossible for any man or for any number of men to destroy it. The Sabbath is not dependent upon the will of man, the wicked Colonel and the presumptuous Sunday-law advocate to the contrary notwithstanding.
