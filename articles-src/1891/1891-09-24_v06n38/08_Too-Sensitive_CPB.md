Two Polish Hebrews were arraigned in Gates Avenue Police Court, in Brooklyn, recently, on complaint made by a Catholic priest charging that on Sunday they run sewing-machines in their house to the great annoyance of his congregation, and the serious disturbance of divine service in the church. The Jews answered that they kept Saturday as a religious day, and claimed the privilege of working on Sunday. The Court held that they were right, and dismissed the complaint. These facts are stated by the Christian Advocate, which comments upon them thus:—

One who from principle observes Saturday as a day of rest is certainly entitled to pursue his calling on Sunday, provided he does not molest the worship of others who observe Sunday as a day of religious service; but it is a strange interpretation and application of the law which permits a man to disturb the devotions of his neighbors. One has no right to conduct his religious observances in such a way as to interfere with the worship of his neighbor. A Court in Cincinnati granted an injunction against the ringing of a Catholic Church bell at a certain hour on Sunday, because it disturbed a neighboring Methodist congregation engaged in worship at that hour.

It is strange that it has not occurred to the Advocate that it is very unlikely that in this case there was any real disturbance. If sewing-machines were operated in the same building occupied by a worshipping congregation, and separated from them only by a thin partition, or single floor, the noise might constitute a real disturbance, but that such light machinery operated in another building disturbs a congregation is not at all likely, and seems scarcely possible.

The trouble with Sunday disturbance is that a great many people are too easily disturbed when others dissent from them in religious faith and practice. The writer was formerly acquainted with a minister of the gospel, now deceased, who quite early in life joined the regular Baptist Church. Afterwards he commenced the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. At that time he was the publisher of a weekly paper somewhere in Wisconsin, and did part of the composition himself. After beginning to observe the seventh day, he very naturally devoted Sunday to setting type. His work was done in a back room on the second floor, but some people were very much disturbed by it. The case of the two Polish Jews in Brooklyn is probably similar.

Worshipping congregations, and indeed all sorts of orderly gatherings, should be protected from all real disturbance, not only on Sunday but on all other days; but the protection should be to the peace of the whole congregation and not to the feelings of a few bigots in the congregation, nor of some priest who feels that the world was made for him, and that no one ought to sneeze except as he (the priest) takes snuff. People who are disturbed by the running of sewing-machines on Sunday are a little too sensitive, and the Advocate ought to be in better business than encouraging them in their intolerance.

We have never yet heard of the Jews asking anybody to suspend ordinary business in order that their worship may not be disturbed on Saturday, and they would only be laughed at if they made any such demand, and very properly so too. But if the large and influential bodies of religionists are entitled to such protection, the Jews and seventh-day Christians are also, for the theory of our political system is that all men are entitled to equal protection of the law. It is high time that people come to understand that dissenters do not exist in this country by tolerance, but by right; and that their rights are just as sacred, and ought to be just as jealously guarded by the Government, as the rights of the dominant sects.
