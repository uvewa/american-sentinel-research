THE Register-Gazette, of Rockford, Ill., publishes this news item:

Four Sunday schools up to date have boycotted the steamer Arrow on account of Sunday business, Court Street, First Congregational, First Presbyterian, and Westminster.

Such a course as this is the legitimate result of the advice of Mr. Crafts and others to boycott the Columbian Exposition if it opens its doors on Sunday. Sunday laws are un-American, and it is but natural that the imported un-American "boycott" be used in their interest.
