A CORRESPONDENT from Atchison, Kansas, writes:—

Rev. W. F. Crafts spent June 21–24 at Atchison. The friends of Religious Liberty greeted him with a supply of good literature, to which he responded with warmth. He seemed to regard the opposition of the principles he advocates as an unwarranted personal insult that should not be tolerated.
