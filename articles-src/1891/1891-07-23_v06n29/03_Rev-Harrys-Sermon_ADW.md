## Rev. Harry's Sermon.

[226]

REV. J. Q. A. Henry delivered a sermon which has been quite widely circulated in the newspapers under the title, "A Review of God's Day, and What It Should Be to Man." In it he lays down the exact principles which we are glad to compare with others that also about as boldly contradictory as statements could well be. The articles above conclusively that Sunday laws are wholly in the interests of religion and the church. He began by saying:—

> "A close, proper observance of what is familiarly known as the Christian Sabbath, or the day of the Lord, would be adequate to solve our problem."

The American Sabbath is a civil institution, recognized and embodied in our law as a consequence of public morals, and as evidence to political power.

How can an appeal for the observance of a Christian institution be based upon the fact that American institutions are civil institutions? Did Christian institutions become civil in America? And must we regard the civil power in America as the authority for their observance? Is a United States Government Lord of [227] the Sabbath? if so, where did it get its authority? Certainly not from the Bible, for that gives Christ as Lord of the Sabbath. To plead for the observance of the Christian Sabbath on the authority of civil law, is to argue that the civil power is the authority, justification and object of religion; and this is just what Mr. Henry has done. There is nothing more.

The claim of the Sabbath as a Christian institution and worship is laid only on the individual conscience, and it was not laid on as a matter of legal statute. It is not a part of the Sabbath movement to make people good by law, but it is made to save by righteous means and righteous teaching, a teaching so free from religion as to bring a reform in the lives of citizens. It is lifted entirely from the doctrines and commands of the Church.

These are sound principles, but they exactly contradict what he said at first, and overthrow the whole theory of Sunday legislation. For, "if the claim on the Sabbath as a day of religious culture and worship is laid only on the individual conscience," and "it was not laid on as a matter of legal statute," but of "rights of the conscience," then no State has a right to constitute itself Lord of the Sabbath as a science by providing such observance. And "if Sabbaths are not kept by legislative enactments" or "they are, and they can not, be enforced by legal statute," it is manifestly wrong to "appeal to the proper observance" on the authority of civil law.

In his argument, Mr. Henry shows very clearly that all Sunday legislation is a direct enactment on the part of the State in the claim of religion. And though we wish he could avoid that conclusion by lay claiming that the "proper observance" of the Christian "Sabbath" does not mean the religious observance. But there is no observance of any religious institution that is proper, except a religious observance.

Another argument contained in the sermon was this:—

> The Constitution leaves a legal right to enjoy the Sabbath day. Every individual according to the Sabbath Course, has the right to the observance of the Christian Sabbath, without liability to annoyance from the ordinary secular pursuits of others, so easily as far as they may be dictated by or merely or charity.

Yes, the Constitution does insure the right to every man to enjoy the Sabbath day. The Constitution leaves him free to so enjoy himself, or to employ himself in anything else that will contribute to his enjoyment, as he himself may choose. The Christian also has the constitutional right to deprive him of his enjoyment by denying pursuit of rest when he does not want to. To oppose one man to by making his "secular pursuits" or "to Sunday is consideration of the annoyance and comfort of another, is to establish the principle that every person is also a right to have his religious feelings protected by law." To carry out such a principle would absolutely stop all religious works, and shut every man's mouth on the subject of religion; for nothing could be done or said that would be in harmony with the ideas and feelings of every one, and as surely as their opinions were crossed, their feelings would be disturbed. No error could be rebuked, no truth could be advocated but somebody's feelings would be disturbed.

The United States Constitution is based upon the principle that "all men are created free and equal" and it says that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law." According to that principle, if the Christian has a right to keep Sunday without liability to annoyance from the ordinary secular pursuits of life," the Jew has an equal right to observe Saturday without liability to such annoyance [227] on Sunday. Then its corrupt self-defense, no State will give the division into two days, or to preserve it after it is done. And to undertake such a thing is an attempt to re-constitution, and blaspheme in the sight of God.

Notwithstanding all this, the speaker coolly says, that "no attempt is being made to force religion down the throats of men." O, no; simply an effort to keep the "divine notices" from being cast out at them, that is all. And you might as well cook up a bottle to keep the light in when you are about to carry it into a dark room. Sunday laws are not "conducive to public order." Those who are compelled to stop work against their will, will make Sunday "a day of deviltry" as has always been remarkably exemplified in Kings County, New York. Bodies, there are laws to enforce public order on all days of the week. The more people who are idle, and are bent on mischief, as the result of Sunday laws, the harder it will be to enforce the laws of public order.

Another argument contained in the sermon was this:—

> "That government under which the rights of all citizens are not equally protected, is organized injustice."

Would Sunday-keeping Christians and Mr. Henry be willing to lay aside their secular pursuits on Saturday that the observance of the Jews and Seventh-day Christians might be free from all disturbances? Are they ready to apply the Golden Rule, and do as much for others as they ask others to do for them? Here is an excellent chance for them to test themselves, and see whether they are actuated by the spirit of Christianity, or whether they are controlled by a spirit of selfishness and bigotry. Whoever asks another to show respect for his religion has he is willing to show to others, thereby admits that the other religion is superior to his own. He expects the other man to be more of a gentleman than he is, or at least show more benevolence and charity in his behalf. Which he admits that or may not be true, but it is an admission, nevertheless that is, to his shame.

Mr. Henry annihilated the authority of the "civil Sabbath" by the closing words of his sermons. He said:—

> All plead, therefore, for the American Sabbath, that it may become a day of rest, of increased recreation, and of devout worship.

The supreme reason for the observance of the day is to be found in the claim of religion and of the divine statute. The Sabbath is God's institution; it was made for man; it is the one oasis of rest which reminds man that he is a being ever sabbath; disseminate and disintegrate sin from his nature; lift his better self to a higher and more forged against the well being of humanity. If we shall maintain this land, the day must be kept, and keep the Church right; and if we keep the Church right, we shall keep the Republic right.

Hardly does the speaker finish his plea for the "American Sabbath" before he gives positive proof that it is neither American not civil. He says that "the supreme source for the observance of this day is to be found in the claim of religion and of Christian faith." If it were an American civil institution, the supreme reason for its observance as such would be found, not in the claims of religion, but in the claims of American civil law. Again, if the Sabbath were a civil institution, there would be no sense in making it a day of "devout worship," unless one desired to worship the State by religiously bowing to institutions. But that would be idolatry. There is a vast difference between worshiping God on any day of the week, and worshiping him because the State has not spent that day. Such worship is directed to the State more than it is to God. "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey."

To ask that an institution "of devout worship," which finds the supreme source of "observance" in the "claims of religion," shall be recognized and embodied in law, it does ask that religion be forced upon the [227] people by law. And that is the purpose of the whole Sunday-law movement. If the "Sabbath is God's institution," Mr. Henry says, that then does not belong to America, nor to the State, neither unto them are the things which are America's, and unto God the things that are God's.

Mr. Henry admits that the whole question of the Sabbath or of Sunday, is between the Church and the people. If the Church then can be kept right, then the "State will be not unlike" "Sabbath" reform; then, should begin where the Sabbath began—in the family and in the Church. Ask to ask the State shall enforce by law the proper observance of the Sabbath, is to put the State in a function that is intolerable to do a free work of the State. It belongs to the family and to the Church, and which they will not do for themselves.

But, further, on all the ground that is ever employed for Christianity, either by family or by the Church, comes through the power of the Cross of Christ, and that every effort to have the State undertake such a work, is an effort in the direction of setting up a State in the power of the Cross of Christ. It puts the State in the line of God's of the cross-missions, and those who recognizes such substitution in religion as placing the Christian in the State; is a religious matter, thereby worships God not by free choice—that is, by religion—but by the legal effect of Sunday law, and well as of all other laws designed to force a recognition of religious institutions, to transfer the Government and the people.
