### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

[230]

1. We believe in the religion of the Bible.

2. We believe in temperance, and regard true piety closely connected with it.

3. We believe in supporting civil government, and regard it that duty of the subject.

4. We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

5. We believe that the legislation upon the subject of religion is an usurpation of the divine prerogative, and is in opposition to legitimate civil government.

6. We believe, therefore, that all religious legislation by secular government tends directly to unite Church and State, in violation of individual rights, dangerous to the peace of the Republic, destructive of the principles of true religion.
