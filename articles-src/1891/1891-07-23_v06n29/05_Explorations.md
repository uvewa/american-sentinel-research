## "Explorations."

[228]

THE careful attention of the reader is invited to this article from the *Christian Nation*, and also to a brief comment upon it on the last page of this paper.

"Ever since the bold navigators pushed away from their homes and discovered a new world beyond the Pillars of Hercules, men have sought through polar ice, the North West Passage. One after another they have made the trial and the wrecks which strew those frozen shores remain as a monument to highest hope.

"Such a quest has long been carried on to find a religious acknowledgment in the Federal Constitution. Notwithstanding the fact that the Constitution itself directly prohibits such a feature the search has been continued under discouragements which would have discouraged a Kane or a Franklin.

"The Constitution is not a large territory. It is composed of seven articles and fifteen amendments. This is all there is of it. It is shorter and more instructive than the President's message, more talked of and less read than any document in the Christian religion; it has in itself no character against the laws and religion of Muselmen.

"It is given to the people for the direction of the Federal Government. From this document alone it receives its authority to act. Cooley states, 'It is the Government derived its powers from the people, of the people, made by the Constitution, and the ages will be found in the Constitution, law and elsewhere.' Webster says, 'powers are enumerated but not defined.' Chief Justice Marshall written: 'Every power alleged to be vested in the national Government, or any organ thereof, must be affirmatively shown to have been granted.' From these the rule may be deduced that every power not enumerated is forbidden. Where then is the enumerated power in the Constitution, which empowers Christian legislation?

"It might be well first of all to consider the clause of the Constitution which prohibits any Christian feature in the fundamental law, for it is the rock on which these explorers, like the navigators, the other powers of the voyage, have met their fate. 'No religious qualification shall ever be required for any office or public trust under the United States.' Some have claimed that this clause means 'no denominational test.' At the interpretation at the time of framing the Constitution it was set forth by an amendment proposed by the minority of the Convention of this State wished to amend this clause so that it would read, 'no other religious test which precedes,' holding that the said oath which precedes was a 'religious qualification.' Could an oath be considered as a 'denominational' qualification?

"What Christian denomination would consider the oath a 'test'? The oath as used in the Constitution is not a test of a religious sect. But South Carolina was shown that the oath as administered had a religious character and the original remained unchanged.

"To whom would a religious clause in the Constitution become a test?—To the infidel, to the atheist, to the Jew. Every one who holds 'an office or trust under the United States' swears before the Constitution and all that it contains. If it had a single Christian feature, no unbeliever could hold office under the general Government. Would then these classes swear to the very thing which they deny? It is an imposition on their honesty. The infidel 'framers' in the Federal Constitution who considered prayers 'unnecessary' did not propose to make one that might dishonor themselves. They made such a thing impossible by express prohibition of religion. But the 'response of the law of the land' does not leave us without another witness for this interpretation. As the 'test clause' prohibits religion in the Constitution, the treaty with Tripoli states the fact in the case. It reads, 'As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on [229] the Christian religion; it has in itself no character against the laws and religion of Muselmen.'

"It is necessary to go no further to show that without such amendment, there can be no Christian acknowledgment, much less authority for Christian legislating in the Federal Constitution. But it may be necessary to examine some of the alleged discoveries to examine the allege of the charged.

"The first is 'Frequency and universality of prayer to God in the Constitution and the various parts of the supreme law.' This is an unsupported fact. The Constitution itself goes so far as to say, 'In the year of our Lord.' This is all it claims of Christian acknowledgment.

"But one can imagine the religious side with which Jefferson would date the Declaration of Independence after some 'explorer' claimed a 'saint's' got in the body of that paper. What a stolen explication! God must have thrilled the soul of Lopez or as he dated the contract by which the nation bought from Napoleon that large tracts of land in New Mexico, in reference to efforts in their behalf. But forever, every time an infidel dates a letter he acknowledges the Lord.

"But there are some other dates in the 'supreme law.' The Treaty of Tripoli was quoted to-day, 'the 4th day of *Jumed* in the year of the *Hegira* 1211.' Another Morocco on the twenty-fifth day of the *Shawol* month of *Stulack*. Now, if one dating recognizes Christianity, the other does the same for Mohammedanism. This is a dilemma for the explorers.

"'The second discovery of Christian acknowledgment' is in Section VII., 'no bill shall not be returned by the President in ten days, Sundays excepted, after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law.' Is it a *credit* or a *debit*? There has no reference to Congress but to the President alone. It does not refer to him in all his duties, but only to the fact, that of considering a bill. It limits him; it does not authorize much less compel him; and it does not extend the exception to give that day to others. Where is his authority to keep it? Does it say it? No. 'No powers are 'enumerated' in the Constitution. Where is the clause which' 'contains the phrase 'Sunday' to say anything? Is it allowed to the President in this one case.

"'But is it a Christian acknowledgment?' 'Sunday' is not the Christian Sabbath, any day in the week. If there is no claim of labor there must be an acknowledgment of some heathen custom. Compare Christianity.

"'Sunday is simply a legal holiday allowed to the President himself, in one of his functions. It rests on no higher basis than the "Sunday laws." Is that any recognition of the Lord of the Sabbath?' Let the decisions of the courts answer the question. That which the courts have regarded as the basis of these laws Judge [229] Cooley condenses in a sentence in which they are regarded 'as a sanitary regulation, based on the demonstration of experience that one day's rest in seven is needful to recuperate the exhausted energies of mind and body.' In a sanitary regulation? 'A Christian acknowledgment?' is the 'Sunday' allowed to the President rest on the same basis as a mail-spy quantum to Congress.

"TAB."

"The third discovery to be noted is that of the Bible usually termed the oath. 'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' This is not a form but the prescribed obligation of the form of the oath. A president can but has a religious character. Webster defines it was a solemn affirmation, or declaration made with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed. In this prescribed form there is no such appeal, it is an obligation of the office; it is not properly an oath at all. The President may modestly or about 'so help me God,' or 'God witness;' if his internal conviction demands it, but he does it in his own responsibility. The Constitution of the United States makes no reference to God or religion. 'We the people' are the only god of the Constitution.

"A matter equally important! 'And no.' Congress shall make no law respecting religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' A law written on the *Christian Nation* speaks of this clause as 'directly manifesting the sweep furthest free in the exercise of the Christian faith, etc.' This is not complimentary to Congress. How can prohibiting Congress from legislating on a subject 'manifest' anything in its way? Why not Blair find out that the way to manifest the sway of solicitude was to let Congress make a law on the subject? It is not a law.

"Some have taken 'religion' in the sense of 'denominational,' which does not; that class have read 'prohibiting the free exercise' of a 'denomination.' The 'free exercise' of a horse is proverbial but the former use of the word may be doubted. The meaning here is the same as in the 'test clause.' Religion means religion. The framers of the Constitution knew what they were talking about. This clause declares that Congress shall 'make no laws respecting religion.' As before, indeed, Congress cannot legislate in any sort without a grant of power. Where is that grant? The 'test clause' also prohibits it. The 'treaty' coolly concedes that it does not exist. Religion must be the same one hundred years ago that it does now.

"The Constitution forbids Congress to make laws respecting religion. That belongs to the sphere of State legislation. Judge Cooley says: 'The making provision for education, for the protection of personal liberty, and liberty of worship—all those powers were withheld from the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and reserved by the States.'

"A somewhat remarkable religious acknowledgment is claimed to lie in the region known as Amendment VII. The clause contemplated reads: 'In trial by jury shall to otherwise be examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of common law.' This recognition in certain cases the common law rules in the courts. Christianity is said to form a part of the common law. Through this means the Constitution recognizes Christian precepts as binding on the Government.

"This looks plain enough but there are some difficulties to be explained. The common law of Louisiana is largely derived, through its early inhabitants, from the Roman law. Mohammedanism formed a part of the Roman law and therefore of the common law of Louisiana. So if the Constitution through this amendment recognizes Christianity, it must recognize Mohammedanism as well. The Constitution is not partial in such a matter as religion. The next objection is found in the fact that this gives no 'power' to President, Congress, or the courts. It refers only to the latter and in a restriction of power.

"If further proof be needed for the statement that this amendment neither 'conjoins' nor authorizes Christian legislation on the part of the Government of the United States, it is found in the fact that the common law is no part of the Federal Constitution. Let it be noted as a treat—whether the year is the old Federal Constitution it is all comprised in seven articles and fifteen amendments. Here alone is the law to be found any grant of power to the Federal Government. The common law is no part of it, common law belongs to the States. Cooley states 'Each of the United States has a common law of its own, the United States as such can have no common law.'

"Concerning the latest and most original discovery it is stated: 'Amendment in consistency with the principle article of Christian precept alone recognized in Section I, clause 1, prohibiting the slave trade after 1808, etc.' Surely the wheels of progress have been backward a thousand years to find in this grant to slave dealers of another generation of traffic in the bodies of men a 'moral principle of Christian precept.' To what apt-does it belong? But did this clause prohibit the slave trade? The framers of the Constitution did not know it. Congress did not know it, for it passed in March 1807 a law making it unlawful after January 1, 1808. The best refutation of the discovery is found in the clause referred to which reads, 'The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit shall [229] not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year 1808.'

"Nigh unto seventy times seven have similar claims been reported and as often proved false, yet to remove some American Adventism will about 'Eureka' and appear with some recovered relic of Christianity in the Constitution.

"It is not the intention of this article to deprecate what is commendable in the Constitution. As a *purely secular* Constitution of government, it has no superior among the nations; but its value is not enhanced by mortifying it with finery which it never had nor was intended to have. The fact remains, and if by some Ciceronian spell the people of this country were suddenly changed into followers of the Prophet of Medina it would not necessitate any change in the 'supreme law of the land.' To the enemies of the Nazarene this is his glory.

"With equal deference to the explorers of the past and of the future, it must be said that all discoveries are, 'So if the present Constitution are what legends, is a chapter,—true before the fathers sought, to brought to him the "writing of the pen" test,' might have called 'an unwritten constitution.'"
