[232]

MR. MOODY thinks that the best way to induce people to go to church is to "close down away with Sunday newspapers and give the people a chance to attend." In the fourth century the bishops said: Close the Sunday theatres and the people will resort to the churches.

So far a National Reform meeting is taking a summer vacation that it is utilizing the season to the utmost, transforming the various Chautauqua meetings into training schools for National Reform workers. Never in the history of the world were the enemies of religious liberty so universally active as now.

A rutan meeting, said to have been attended by three thousand persons, has been held at Romagne, England, in favor of "shut-day Observance," at which the managers were elected upon to interdict all street cries and public noise on Sundays, to close the fish market, and stop the excursion trains from London, at the cost of the business interests, if they say the recommendations of the meeting bail with the authorities.

The American Sabbath Union has at the Christian Endeavor Convention at Minneapolis. At a result several auxiliary meetings were held in the interest of legal Sunday observance, and at one of which a resolution was passed looking to the "securing of speedy action by the State Christian Endeavor Conventions to bear upon their several communities in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday." The Christian Endeavor Societies little realize that they are becoming a vast National Reform whispering.

The *Catholic Review* remarks that the Catholic education and others interested in the practical settlement of the present difficulties of popular education will find a useful guide in the fact that the first free Catholic high schools in the State of New York are now in merger parts of the State University.

And so we may reasonably conclude that the end is not yet. The State and the Church are already in partnership in a good many ways in the State of New York. Every year millions of dollars are paid to sustain religious institutions, and for years the [232] matter has been a bone of contention between Catholics and Protestants. The strife has however not been for principle, but for State favor. The contention has been sharp, but the only question has been, Who should have the lion's share of the spoil?

This article "Explorations," which appears on another page of this paper, is from the *Christian Nation*, of July 8, and is a complete refutation of the constitutional arguments of the Sabbath Unionists and of the National Reformers. It is taken down blow from their own ranks. Let them all come frankly forward now and acknowledge that it is their intent to subvert the Constitution and present form of Government of the United States, and to establish in the place of this "purely secular" government "the only one so far among the nations," a government by religious dogma. The candid among the National Reformers are not attempting to escape from this inevitable dilemma.

There are but two errors noticeable in this article, one of confusion and the other of misstatement. The first exists in the failure to show that Sunday and other religions have had no more place in the State statutes after the adoption of this "purely secular Constitution" than laws concerning the movement to the throw, for they were a survival of the English union of Church and State; and the other is in the next to the last paragraph where it is said, if "the people of this country were suddenly changed into followers of the Prophet of Medina it would not necessitate any change in the 'supreme law of the land.' To the enemies of the Nazarene this is his glory."

The Liquor Dealers' Association of Norfolk, Virginia, have joined hands with the Sabbath Union and National Reformers in enforcing the Sunday laws. They give notice that detectives employed by them have reported several parties selling liquor on Sunday, also that witnesses have been secured, and that information counsel will be immediately employed to prosecute these Sabbath breakers for violating their mandate. So another organization must be added to the long list of those affiliated with the National Reform party,—the Liquor Dealers' Association of Norfolk, Virginia.

The City Council of Utica, New York, recently suspended the ordinances forbidding Sunday baseball, and again at a subsequent meeting reconsidered their action. As reported, the aldermen were to this course mainly influenced in this course by the religious feeling and sentiment of fellow-townsmen and church members; based of a considerable investigation of the civil principles involved. Among all the instances of the agitation of this Sunday question that one City Council has yet discussed the matter on becoming intelligent men and respectable law-makers—that is the city of Brooklyn.

The American Sabbath Union will hold "Sabbath observance" meeting in this auditorium, Chautauqua, Sunday, August 9; and on the 11th the State Sabbath Committee of New York will meet on the assembly grounds to complete the organization of the committee. These associations are making themselves heard in the different Chautauqua assemblies, in the different religious Endeavor Conventions, and everywhere throughout the country where instrumentalities are at work for the promotion of mental or religious enterprise. It is those who realize the errors which they teach appreciate the meaning of this movement.

REV. L. W. MUCHALL says in the *New York Observer*:—

> I propose to go south for two weeks to make my trip. ... Great Southern Exposition was so full that. Not a great deal for southern recreation; but it opens doors on Sunday. When the question of Sunday opening of the fair was finally and first brooded, I resolved never to visit it though it is claimed to be a number of matters of the year 1893, and to use my personal influence against it if it is opened on the Sabbath Day.

How innocently, deliciously egotistic this is! One remembers the Grand-Atlantic character which befell the New Orleans Exposition, and trembles for the World's Fair.

The Industrial Brotherhood of Canada demand among other things "that voting at elections shall be obligatory, no person to have more than one vote, and that the present system of 'canvassing' the elections be abolished, and it shall be an allowance to let no one be able to elect a vote in any way or try to influence the decision of voters." Nothing could be more utterly destructive of liberty than a provision of this kind.

Some people, as for instance the Referendum party in this country, think it is wrong to vote. It is their privilege not to do so. Again, to forbid an effort to influence voters would destroy at once all liberty to discuss political matters by voice or pen. Every political speech and every political newspaper article is an attempt to influence voters; and liberty to exert such influence is absolutely essential to a free government.

CONTRARY to general expectation, Sunday closing of saloons has not disturbed drunkenness in Los Angeles, California. On the contrary it seems to have the opposite effect. A dispatch from that city dated July 4, and published in the San Francisco *Chronicle*, says:—

> During the past few months, in which the Sunday saloon closing ordinance has been in effect, the arrests for drunkenness have not materially decreased. Last month there were one hundred and twenty-six arrests on this charge, which is about as many during the past three months. Let these waters even be still for a while.

Commenting upon this, an Oakland paper remarks that "Sunday saloon fans are want to foretell things to tell us that we can do as much in a year by closing six days as we could to work the entire seven; and it will be determined—be will in this matter indictable—that when closing one more day of enforced idleness, as much whisky will be sold in six days as otherwise would be sold in seven.

Teaching of religion belongs to the Church, and to the ......... only.
