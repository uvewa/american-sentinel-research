CONTRARY to general expectation, Sunday closing of saloons has not reduced drunkenness in Los Angeles, California. On the contrary it seems to have the opposite effect. A dispatch from that city, dated July 8, and published in the San Francisco Chronicle, says:—

During the past few months, in which the Sunday saloon closing ordinance has been in effect, the police report that drunkenness has largely increased. Last month there were one hundred and two arrests for this cause, a greater number than in any month during the past three years. Most of these arrests were made on Sunday.

Commenting upon this an Oakland paper remarks that "Sunday-law agitators are wont to frequently tell us that we can do as much in six days by resting Sunday as we could to work the entire seven; and it will be demonstrated—we wish to their satisfaction—that when Sunday is made a day of enforced idleness, as much whisky will be sold in six days as otherwise would be in seven."
