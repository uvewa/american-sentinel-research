A GROWING disregard of Sunday is by no means confined to the United States, nor is it limited to those countries having little or no legislation upon the subject. A late number of the Christian Commonwealth, a leading English paper, says:—

Slowly but surely the Continental Sunday is coming to England. The number of Sunday newspapers is steadily increasing; and, what is more to the point, the number of readers of these papers is rapidly multiplying. Now a new departure is about to be made at the New Gallery. It is proposed to institute a series of "Sunday afternoons," when the gallery will be opened to a limited number of subscribers and their friends. The gallery will be opened from two till seven during the continuance of the annual summer and winter exhibitions, tea being provided for the visitors.

This is only one of the many facts that might be cited in England to show that the same tendencies are seen there as in this country. And even Scotland, that country far-famed for its strict Sunday observance and for rigid laws upon the subject, is relaxing something of its old-time strictness, or rather the people are, and yielding to the seductions of the "Continental Sunday." A recent report to the General Assembly of Scotland, the highest church court in that country where Presbyterianism is the established religion, declares that football and cricket have done much harm "by the Sabbath indolence and neglect of ordinances which exhausted nature exacts from their votaries."

The report also says that in one county especially "the pernicious custom of visiting friends and places of interest on the Lord's day is rapidly spreading." And in another section "frivolous and purely worldly conversation on the Lord's day is common." The liquor traffic too seems to be active there as elsewhere, while the "sin of half-hearing" (going to church only in the forenoon) and neglect of the prayer meeting are sapping the life of the church.

A similar condition of affairs in this country is attributed by many to lax Sunday legislation, and to a total or partial failure to enforce existing laws upon the subject; but this is a mistake. As before intimated, neither England nor Scotland is lacking in the matter of Sunday laws, nor in official recognition of God as the source of civil authority. So far as civil law can make nations Christian these countries are Christian.

The truth of the matter is that civil laws have nothing to do with morals or religion, and instead of Sunday "desecration" being due to the absence of Sunday laws it is due to the low religious condition of the people; and no amount of civil law can possibly improve that condition or make the people more religious. Of course it naturally follows that the only way to secure better Sabbath observance is to make the people more religious, and this can be done only by teaching them the gospel.
