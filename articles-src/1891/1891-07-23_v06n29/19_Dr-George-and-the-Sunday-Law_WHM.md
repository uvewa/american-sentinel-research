The Utica Auxiliary of the American Sabbath Union has been holding a series of meetings at Utica. The Daily Press gives reports of the addresses. It quotes Rev. H. H. George as saying in reference to the business man, who receives letters on Sunday:—

Why doesn't he act on the letters and bill the orders they contain?—Because the law won't allow him to do it.

Will business men universally plead guilty to Dr. George's indictment, and confess that the only question in their minds as to what they may or may not do is, Will the law allow it? If the word of this minister, who is Assistant Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and a man who has had opportunity of extended observation among the church people of the country, is to be taken, then there is indeed a serious lack of conscientious principle among church members in the business world, which Sunday laws, however strict, can scarcely be expected to remedy.

Dr. George says further of the Sunday mail:—

Congress should stop it. It can be done and should be. When we have such men as Mr. Wanamaker in the post-office, and Mr. Harrison, an elder in the Presbyterian church, as President, it can be done if the fifteen million Christians of the country will stand by them.

This is equivalent to saying that because the Postmaster-general is a Sunday-school superintendent, and the President a Presbyterian elder therefore they should enforce the religious beliefs of their supposed following, irrespective of the principles of civil rights, or the views of the remaining fifty million.

Dr. George "also spoke against the Sunday excursion trains which run to the Thousand Islands from Utica, and said they were clearly illegal. He quoted from the law as follows: 'Nor shall any person travel on that day [first day of the week, commonly called Sunday], unless in cases of charity or necessity, or in going to or returning from church or place of worship, or going for medical aid,' etc. He said: I believe it wholly feasible to go down to that train next Sunday morning and arrest every man in it. Cries of 'amen!'"

The "amens" were a sufficient evidence of the willingness of these enthusiasts to enforce any law, whatever its character, which shall compel obedience to their interpretation of divine will. But their enthusiasm on this occasion shows a zeal without knowledge, for the Doctor read from the Revised Statutes of 1875 instead of the Penal Code of 1881, which contains the law as it now stands, and by which the clause in reference to traveling is repealed. The law as it stands in the Penal Code of 1881 is a marked survival of the religious laws of medieval Europe, but still not quite so favorable to those self-constituted constables and sheriffs of the Almighty as they thought.
