THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION had a special representative at the Christian Endeavor Convention at Minneapolis. As a result several meetings were held in the interest of legal Sunday observance, at one of which a resolution was passed looking to the "securing of speedy action from our State Christian Endeavor Unions to bear upon their several commissioners in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday." The Christian Endeavor Societies little realize that they are becoming a vast National Reform kindergarten.
