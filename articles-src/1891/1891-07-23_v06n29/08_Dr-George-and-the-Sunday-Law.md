## Dr. George and the Sunday Law.

[230]

The Utica Auxiliary of the American Union has has been holding a series of meetings at Utica. The *Daily Press* gives reports of the addresses. It reports Rev. T. H. George as saying in reference to the business man, who receives letters on Sunday:—

Why doesn't he act on the letters and tell the writer that he wished it—business for next work days?

Will business men universally plead guilty to Dr. George's indictment, and confess that the only question in their minds as to what they may or may not do. We'll be the allow it? If the word of this minister, who is Assistant Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, and a man who has had opportunity of extended observation among the business men of the country, is to be taken, then there is indeed a serious lack of conscientious principle among church members in the business world, which Sunday laws, with fines and costs, are vainly expected to remedy, so vainly as might be expected.

Dr. George says further of the Sunday excursion trains:—

> I will go on to show what the Church attitude should be. When we have such a man as Mr. Wan— I have in the Presbyterian church, as President, it seems to me that we ought to know what the law is.

This is equivalent to saying that because the Postmaster-general is a Sunday observance commissioner, and the President a Presbyterian elder therefore they should enforce the religious beliefs of their co-religionists following, irrespective of the principles of civil rights, or the views of the remaining fifty million.

Dr. George also spoke against the Sunday excursion trains which run to the Thousand Islands from Utica, from and they were clearly illegal. He quoted from the law as follows: "Nor shall any person travel on that day [the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday], in boats or Observation of charity or necessity, or in going to or returning from church or going to or returning from church or going of worship, or going for medical advice," etc, etc. He said: "I believe it wholly feasible to go down to that train next Sunday morning and arrest every man in it. Close of same."

"To wants" a sufficient evidence of the willingness of these advocates to enforce any law, whatever its character, which contemplated the prohibition of a perpetuation of divine will. But their enthusiasm on this occasion shows a real without knowledge, for the Doctor read from the Revised Statutes of 1873 instead of the Penal Code of 1881, which contains the law as it now stands, and by which the clause in reference to traveling is repealed. The law as it stands in the Penal Code of 1881 is a marked survival of the religious laws of medieval Europe, but still not quite so favorable to those self-constituted constables and sheriffs of the Almighty as they thought.
