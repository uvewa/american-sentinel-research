THE Spanish Prime Minister is interested or incited in the passage of laws by the Cortes "securing Sunday rest for workmen."

The *Christian Nation* opposes the one care of care on Sunday even for the purpose of going to meeting! It is, to say the *Nation*, "paving the devil's toll to get to church."

A CORRESPONDENT from Atchison, Kansas, writes:—

> *The U. T.* report June 21, 31-34 at Atchison. Mrs. Catherine E. Liberty greeted him with the Sentinel's compliments and warm address of warmth. He moved to regard the opposition and appeal the objection as personal—the very ground upon this personal issue should not be raised.

The liquor interest may yet array itself on the side of Sunday laws, and the Observation Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union find it is a not unexpected ally. An evidence of this possibility the liquor people be for a Sunday entered manifestly in the endorsement of Sunday closing upon all the taverns and men of the plan. Mrs. Willard and Mrs. Baldwin ready to take the nation in their Reform Battalions hand in hand with the saloon keeper, and for a real Sunday of genuine piety let the birthright of the temperance cause?

An article written from Excelsior, Wash., that the Sunday question is a live issue there. A new organization has been formed, called the "Anti-Sunday Saloon Association," composed principally of ministers and church people. A member of this body has been convicted and fined for violating the State Sunday law. The saloon men in town say they will enforce the law against all other kinds of business forbidden by it. When they have accepted this alliance with the rationalists to secure general Sunday observance, how will the ministers and church people and Christian Temperance Union women have the face to turn upon their friends, made respectable by association with them in the zealous enforcement of Sunday laws and by the discrimination of that law itself, and antagonize them?

In the *Arena* for May is an article from the pen of B. O. Flower, in which he says:—

> In the endeavor of her noble men throwing over the endeavors of religion, our nation during the revolution progress has not yet withered, science has none of its own. At the very portals of civilization have been planted the great truths of human freedom, previously taught by the ages then that science, or the right of the individual has always ever been concerned that disturb human freedom. I declare that no scientific or philosophic theory can or should be builded on other foundation than liberty and justice.

The South Dakota Sabbath Observance Association has elected twelve vice-presidents, eleven county secretaries, and a legislative committee of five. Eleven acts were "authorized to hold Sabbath reform meetings and form local study programs for Sabbath committees in the name of the State association all over the State." The plans organization of the State progressive continually. When it is too late the people of this county will discover, with astonishment, that their city councils, town and county boards, legislative, and even Congress itself, are controlled by the Church committees.
