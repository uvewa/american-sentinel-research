In the Arena for May is an article from the pen of B. O. Flower, in which he says:

In the sunshine of liberty I see a growing world. In the radiance of her smile man triumphs over error and superstition. But in the shadow of paternalism progress has ever withered, science has been a fugitive, and the vanguard of civilization have suffered ignominious death. No lesson is more impressively taught by the ages than that science, progress, and human unfoldment move in the wake of liberty. I have no faith in any theory of government that distrusts human freedom. I believe that no enduring progress or true civilization can be built on other foundation than liberty and justice.
