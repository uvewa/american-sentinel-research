The careful attention of the reader is invited to this article from the Christian Nation, and also to a brief comment upon it on the last page of this paper:—

"Ever since the bold navigators pushed across the Atlantic and discovered a new world beyond the Pillars of Hercules, men have sought through polar ice, the North West Passage. One after another they have made the trial and the wrecks which strew those frozen shores remain as a monument to blighted hope.

"Such a quest has long been carried on to find a religious acknowledgment in the Federal Constitution. Notwithstanding the fact that the Constitution itself directly prohibits such a feature the search has been continued under discouragements which would have dissuaded a Kane or a Franklin.

"The Constitution is not a large territory. It is composed of seven articles and fifteen amendments. This is all there is of it. It is shorter and more instructive than the President's message, more talked of and less read than any document in the country.

"It is given by the people for the direction of the Federal Government. From this document alone it receives its authority to act. Cooley states, 'It (the Government) derives its powers from the grant of the people, made by the Constitution, and they are all to be found in the written law and not elsewhere.' Webster says, 'powers are enumerated but not defined.' Chief Justice Marshall writes, 'Every power alleged to be vested in the national Government, or any organ thereof, must be affirmatively shown to have been granted.' From these the rule may be deduced that every power not enumerated is forbidden. Where then is the enumerated power in the Constitution, which 'compels' Christian legislation?

"It might be well first of all to consider the clause of the Constitution which prohibits any Christian feature in the fundamental law, for it is the rock on which those explorers, who escaped the other perils of the voyage, have met their fate. 'No religious qualification shall ever be required for any office or public trust under the United States.' Some have claimed that this clause means 'no denominational test,' etc. Its interpretation at the time of framing the Constitution is well set forth by an amendment proposed by South Carolina. The Legislature of this State wished to amend this clause so that it would read, 'no other religious qualification,' holding that the so-called oath which precedes was a 'religious qualification.' Could an oath be considered as a 'denominational' qualification?

"What Christian denomination would consider the oath a 'test'? The oath as it should be, is not a denominational but a religious act. But South Carolina was shown that the oath as administered had not a religious character and the clause remained unchanged.

"To whom would a religious clause in the Constitution become a test?—To the infidel, to the atheist, to the Jew. Every one who holds 'an office or trust under the United States' swears to this Constitution and all that it contains. If it had a single Christian feature, no unbeliever could hold office under the general Government. Would these classes swear to the very thing which they deny? It is an impeachment on their honesty. The infidel framers of the Federal Constitution who considered prayers 'unnecessary' did not propose to make one that would disfranchise themselves. They made such a thing impossible by express prohibition of religion. But the 'supreme law of the land' does not leave us without another witness for this interpretation. As the 'test' clause prohibits religion in the Constitution, the treaty with Tripoli states the fact in the case. It reads, 'As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion; it has in itself no character against the laws and religion of Mussulmen.'

"It is necessary to go no further to show that without amendment, there can be no Christian acknowledgment, much less authority for Christian legislation in the Federal Constitution. But it may be interesting to examine some of the alleged discoveries.

"The first in frequency and unimportance is the date in the Constitution and in various parts of the 'supreme law.' This is an unquestioned fact. The Constitution itself goes so far as to say, 'In the year of our Lord.' This it is claimed is a Christian acknowledgment.

"One can imagine the religious feeling with which Jefferson would date the Declaration of Independence after having written his Creator's name as 'god' in the body of that paper. What a solemn emotion must have thrilled the soul of Ingersoll as he dated the contract by which the Star Route thieves made over to him a large tract of land in New Mexico, in return for efforts in their behalf. If this be true, every time an infidel dates a letter he acknowledges the Lord.

"But there are some other dates in the 'supreme law.' The Treaty of Tripoli just quoted is dated, 'the 3d day of Jamad in the year of the Hegira 1211.' Another with Morocco is signed, 'At our court of Morocco on the twenty-fifth day of the blessed month of Shaban.' Now, if one dating recognizes Christianity, the other does the same for Mohammedanism. This is a dilemma for the explorer.

"The second discovery of Christian acknowledgment is in Section VII, 'If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sunday excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law.' It is evident that this has no reference to Congress but to the President alone. It does not refer to him in all his duties, but only in one, that of considering a bill. It does not even authorize much less compel him to give that day to others. Where is his grant of power for such action? All his powers are 'enumerated' in the Constitution. Where is the clause which 'compels' him to give 'Sunday' to any one? It allows-it to the President and that is all.

"But is it a Christian acknowledgment? 'Sunday' is not the Christian name of any day in the week. If there is anything in the name it must be an acknowledgment of some heathen religion. Certainly not Christianity.

"Sunday is simply a legal holiday allowed to the President himself, in one of his functions. It rests on no higher basis than the 'Sunday laws.' Is that any recognition of the Lord of the Sabbath? Let the decisions of the courts answer the question. That which the courts have regarded as the basis of these laws Judge Cooly condenses in a sentence in which they are regarded 'as a sanitary regulation based on the demonstration of experience that one day's rest in seven is needful to recuperate the exhausted energies of mind and body.' Is 'a sanitary regulation' a Christian acknowledgment? The 'Sunday' allowed to the President rests on the same basis as a small-pox quarantine. Tekel.

"The third discovery to be noted is that clause usually termed the oath. 'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' This is not a form but the prescribed constitutional form of the oath. A proper oath has a religious character. Webster defines it 'as a solemn affirmation or declaration made with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed.' In this prescribed form there is no such appeal, it has no religious character, and is not properly an oath at all. The President may mentally or aloud add 'so help me God,' or 'Gambrinus,' if his internal constitution demands it, but he does it on his own responsibility. The Constitution of the United States makes no reference to God or religion. 'We the people' are the only god of the Constitution.

"Another equally important 'find' is in Amendment 1. 'Congress shall make no law respecting religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' A late writer in the Christian Nation speaks of this clause as 'directly maintaining the sway though free in its exercise of the Christian faith, etc.' This is not complimentary to Congress. How can prohibiting Congress from legislating on a subject 'maintain its sway.' Why did not Blair find out that the way to maintain the sway of education was to keep Congress from making laws on the subject? It is not yet too late.

"Some have taken 'religion' in the sense of 'denomination' which would make the last clause read 'prohibiting the free exercise' of a 'denomination.' The 'exercise' of a horse is reasonable but the former use of the word may be doubted. The meaning here is the same as in the 'test clause.' Religion means religion. The framers of the Constitution knew what they were talking about. This clause declares that Congress shall 'make no laws respecting religion.' As shown before, Congress cannot legislate on any subject without a grant of power. Where is that grant? The 'test clause' prohibits it. The treaty quoted shows that it does not exist. Religion meant the same one hundred years ago that it does to-day.

"The Constitution forbade Congress to make laws respecting religion. That belongs to the sphere of State legislation. Cooley says, 'The making provisions for education, for the protection of personal liberty, and liberty of worship—all these powers were withheld from the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and retained by the States.'

"A somewhat remarkable religious acknowledgment is claimed to lie in that region known as Amendment VII. The clause in question reads, 'No fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States than according to the rules of common law.' This recognizes that in certain cases the common law rules in the courts. Christianity is said to form a part of the common law. Through this means the Constitution recognizes Christian precepts as binding on the Government.

"This looks plain enough but there are some difficulties to be explained. The common law of Louisiana is largely derived, through its early inhabitants, from the Roman law. Heathenism formed a part of the Roman law and therefore of the common law of Louisiana. So if the Constitution through this amendment recognizes Christianity it must recognize heathenism as well. The Constitution is not partial in such a matter as religion. The next objection is found in the fact that this gives no 'power' to President, Congress, or the courts. It refers only to the latter and is a restriction of power.

"If further proof be needed for the statement that this amendment neither 'compels' nor authorizes Christian legislation on the part of the Government of United States, it is found in the fact that the common law is no part of the Federal Constitution. Let it be bound as a frontlet between the eyes that the Federal Constitution is all comprised in seven articles and fifteen amendments. Here alone is there to be found any grant of power to the Federal Government. The common law is no part of it, common laws belong to the States. Cooley states 'Each of the several States has a common law of its own, the United States as such can have no common law.'

"Concerning the latest and most original discovery it is stated: 'Amendments in consistency with the moral principle of Christian precept alone recognized in Sec. IX clause I., prohibiting the slave trade after 1808, etc.' Surely the wheels of progress have rolled backward a thousand years to find in this grant to slave dealers of another generation of traffic in the bodies of men a 'moral principle of Christian precept.' To what age does it belong? But did this cause prohibit the slave trade? The framers of the Constitution did not know it. Congress did not know it, for it passed in March 1807 a law making it unlawful after January 1, 1808. The best refutation of the discovery is found in the clause referred to which reads, 'The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year 1808.'

"Nigh unto seventy times seven have these claims been reported and as often proved false, yet to-morrow some American Archimedes will shout 'Eureka' and appear with some resurrected claim of Christianity in the Constitution.

"It is not the intention of this article to deprecate what is commendable in the Constitution. As a purely secular Constitution of government it has no superior among the nations; but its value is not enhanced by ascribing to it a character which it never had nor was intended to have. The fact remains, that if by some Circean spell the people of this country were suddenly changed into followers of the Prophet of Medina it would not necessitate any change in the 'supreme law of the land.' To the enemies of the Nazarene this is its glory.

"With due deference to the explorers of the past and of the future, it must be said that all discoveries of Christianity in our present Constitution are what Ingalls, in a happier time before the Kansas breezes brought to him the 'winter of his discontent,' might have called 'an iridescent dream.'
