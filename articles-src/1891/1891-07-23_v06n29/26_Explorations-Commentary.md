THE ARTICLE "EXPLORATIONS," which appears on another page of this paper, is from the Christian Nation, of July 8, and is a complete refutation of the constitutional arguments of the Sabbath Unionist and the National Reformers. It is a knockdown blow from their own ranks. Let them all come frankly forward now and acknowledge that it is their intent to subvert the Constitution and present form of Government of the United States, and establish in the place of this "purely secular Constitution," which "has no superior among the nations," a government by religious dogma. The candid among the National Reformers are not attempting to escape from this inevitable dilemma.

There are but two errors noticeable in the article, one of omission and the other of misstatement. The first exists in the failure to show that Sunday and other religious laws had no more place in the State statutes after the adoption of this "purely secular Constitution" than laws concerning the succession to the throne, for they were a survival of the English union of Church and State; and the other is in the next to the last paragraph where it is said, if "the people of this country were suddenly changed into followers of the Prophet of Medina it would not necessitate any change in the 'supreme law of the land.' To the enemies of the Nazarene this is its glory." This last sentence should read, "To the enemies of the Nazarene this is confusion." It ought not to take much study of Christ's words to prove this to every one who desires to practice the Golden Rule. How much more then should they understand it who wish to be counted devout followers of the humble Nazarene?
