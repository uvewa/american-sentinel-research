THE INDUSTRIAL BROTHERHOOD of Canada demand among other things "that voting at elections shall be obligatory, no person to have more than one vote, and that the present system of canvassing the electorate be abolished, and it shall be an offense punishable by law to solicit a vote or in any way to try to influence the decision of a voter." Nothing could be more utterly destructive of liberty than this. Some people, as for instance the Reformed Presbyterians in this country, think it wrong to vote. It is their privilege not to do so. Again, to forbid all efforts to influence voters would destroy at once all liberty to discuss political subjects either by voice or pen. Every political speech and every political newspaper article is an attempt to influence voters; and liberty to exert such influence is absolutely essential to free government.
