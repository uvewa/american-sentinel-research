"In 1879," said Colonel Shepard to a reporter, "I was in Paris with a party of friends one Sunday; they invited me to go with them to Longchamps to see a review of the races. I declined, saying I would rather go to church, and I did. My friends went. The day being a drizzling one, one of the ladies took sick. . . Now, the next year in Paris I attended a review of the troops. It was a week day, and a beautiful day it was. . . I did not catch cold, and I was paid for keeping the Sabbath."

These characteristic remarks were with reference to the impropriety of opening the Museum of Art on Sundays. Perhaps no one but the bluff, plain-spoken Colonel would have stated the argument so simply and directly, but there are, probably, many worthy people who are unconsciously influenced by somewhat similar reasoning. An immediate interposition of Providence is seen in the ordering of the weather, which is not seen in the appointing of horse-races. The hand of God is in the one, while the hoof of the devil is in the other. Then there follows, to the minds of unlearned but devout persons, a logical connection between the weather and the races, and finally a providential relation between these two happenings and the casual presence or absence of the devout person himself. Is not this, too, one of the infinite and protean manifestations of human vanity?
