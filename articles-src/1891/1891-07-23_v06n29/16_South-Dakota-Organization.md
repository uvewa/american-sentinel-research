The South Dakota Sabbath Observance Association has elected twelve vice-presidents, eleven county secretaries, and a legislative committee of five. Eleven ministers were "authorized to hold Sabbath reform meetings and form local rest-day leagues or Sabbath committees in the name of the State association all over the State." This systematic organization is progressing continually. When it is too late the people of this country will discover, with astonishment, that their city councils, town and county boards, legislatures, and even Congress itself, are controlled by the Church committee.
