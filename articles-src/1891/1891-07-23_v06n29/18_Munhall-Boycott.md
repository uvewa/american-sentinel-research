Rev. L. W. MUNHALL says in the New York Observer:—

Together with my family I spent two weeks in New Orleans nearly six years ago, at the time the Great Southern Exposition was in full blast. Not one of us went near it, and only because it kept open doors on Sunday. When the question of Sunday opening of the Columbian Exposition was first broached, I resolved never to visit it though I expect to be in Chicago a number of times during the year 1893, and to use my personal influence against it if it is opened on the Lord's day.

How innocently, deliciously egotistic this is! One remembers the financial disaster which befell the New Orleans Exposition, and trembles for the World's Fair.
