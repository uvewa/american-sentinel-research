A SUBSCRIBER writes from Excelsior, Wash., that the Sunday question is a live issue there. A new organization has been formed, called the "Anti-Sunday Saloon Association," composed principally of ministers and church people. A number of saloon-keepers have been indicted for violating the State Sunday law. The saloon men in town say they will enforce the law against all other kinds of business forbidden by it. When they have accepted this alliance with the saloonists to secure general Sunday observance, how will the ministers and church people and Christian Temperance Union women have the face to turn upon their friends, made respectable by association with themselves in the zealous enforcement of Sunday laws and by the discrimination of that law itself, and antagonize them?
