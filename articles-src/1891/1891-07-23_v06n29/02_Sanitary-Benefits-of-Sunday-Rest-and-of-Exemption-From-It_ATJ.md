## "Sanitary" Benefits of Sunday Rest, and of Exemption From It.

[225]

QUESTION and answer number four, of that Woman's Christian Temperance Union Leaflet No. 8, which is considered by the Union of so much importance that even a funeral must be made the occasion for the distribution, are as follows:—

4. If one has conscientiously refrained from his work on Saturday, is it not oppressive to make him abstain on Sunday?

Answer.—"To secure the greatest good to the greatest number, is not an abused, the aim of law." If to secure this requires a good building to be torn down or a nuisance to be abated, or a man to remove his slaughter-house to a sanitary distance from a settlement, these are incident to using property on a day of rest. If the good of a rest day for all, it were necessary to compel all to rest, it would not be oppressive; but inasmuch as such is not the case, the exemption clause makes it possible, and the bill for the national Sunday law, far, following State laws, expressly exempts those who, having conscientiously observed another day, do not by their work disturb others.

The government principles announced at that first sentence is fully worthy of the cause in behalf of which it is propounded: that is to say, it is utterly false, and the carrying out of it is only despotism and oppression. It is the same principle that has characterized the oppressive governments of the past, and which was so totally revolutionized when our fathers in their immortal Declaration announced to all the world that governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, and to secure the inalienable rights of the people who compose the government. The aim of law and good government "is, or should be," to secure to each person the inalien- [226] able right of each individual to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The theory of the greatest good to the greatest number is simply that by which a certain class who call themselves the "good" secure control of the governmental power, and compel everybody else to conform to what those persons say is good for them. It is simply the principle of class legislation, and in practice it never can be anything but oppression.

The second sentence simply argues that because occupations engaged in on Sunday are as dangerous as a raging fire, or as much of a nuisance as an ill-smelling slaughter house. When honest occupations are put in such a category as that, and are forbidden in communities, then what would be left over could come from no other than confirmed criminality made universal by the law; yet such is the demand that is made in order that Sunday may have free course to run and be glorified. Any estimate that requires the employment of such arguments to justify it and such stations to uphold it is unworthy of respect or consideration by any human being—religious or otherwise—who can think far enough ahead to see beyond the beginning of a thing.

Mrs. Bateham says that "if to secure the good of a rest day for all, it were necessary to compel all to rest, it would not be oppressive;" and we need not further answer the question. The question is as to whether it is not oppression to compel men to rest on Sunday who have already rested a day on Saturday. Is it? Why, to a man, sure enough, it is not oppression to compel him to rest two days if he does not choose to; but if he please himself and is pleased to labor, then it is not oppression to compel him to rest even against his pleasure, nobody else's tips. On what sanitary principle is it that the people who observe the seventh day as a day of rest must be compelled to take an additional day of rest well? for those who do not observe the seventh day only one day of rest is sufficient for all sanitary purposes? Are the sanitary benefits of rest on Sunday so transcendent that that single day of rest not only equal to in- [page 226] self but to an additional day of rest by those who observe another day? It is most singular that people should be so deluded as to find that of "sanitary" "Sunday rest" any benefits.

The phenomenon, however, is accounted for by that Scripture which declares that "The unjust knoweth no shame."

Yet the answer says that the law is an exemption clause. Accordingly, the national Sunday bill expressly exempts those who have conscientiously observed another day. Now an exemption clause, while it continues virtually destroys the force of Sunday laws. So certainly is this true, that the Sunday laws which now exist with exemption clauses are not enforced to any material extent. In fact the exemption clause so entirely defeats the purpose of the law that the only hope which they have of securing the intent of the Sunday law is to repeal the exemption. The State of Arkansas has thus made exclusive Sunday observers of any State in the Union that has an exemption clause. They secured the repeal of the exemption clause in 1885. Then until 1887 they persecuted those who observed the seventh day by such a system that one of the chief justices of the whole State: in the Statutes of 1887 the bar of the State and it "shocked the bar of the whole State." In the Statutes of 1887 the bar of the State succeeded in legislating an exemption clause, but it was so worded as to be worthless. The Legislators of 1889 a strong effort was made again to repeal it, as likewise a similar effort was made, in the Legislature of 1891; and although the law for as far as enforced the observance of Sunday upon all citizens, still reads as it always did, yet no effort whatever is made to enforce it. Just as fast as they succeed in repealing the exemption clause, the Sunday will be enforced again in the same old persecuting way upon those who choose to observe Saturday.

Mrs. Bateham herself knows that if they will have a Sunday law to purpose effectual, they will have to repeal the exemption clause, the exemption which they preach, is a very little while. This we know for that lady because it has been stated it before in such a way that she will never forget it. It was at the hearing before the Senate committee, December 13, 1888, and the following is the record:

Mr. Jones—Suppose an exemption clause were given. Those people who would profess to keep Saturday, but Adventists or for the express purpose of getting a chance to open saloons or house of business—

*Senator Blair*—Call Mrs. Bateham's attention to the question.

*Senator Blair*—Let me repeat it: you give an exemption clause or has been tried—there are no Adventists or Seventh-day Baptists, but that they get more traffic on Sunday than they did on Saturday, and they will profess to be Seventh-day Adventists; they will profess to be Sabbath keepers.

Mrs. Bateham—"I believe that if the spiritual eye look into the heart, you cannot investigate as to the professions of a person as to whether they are professions or not. They will profess to be Sabbath-keepers, and then they will open their saloon on Sunday. Then, its corrupt self-defense, no State will give any exemption clause that has ever had that exemption clause. It will not last a little while."

*Senator Blair*—I agree with you there.

Mr. Jones—I ask that reason; those people cannot afford to offer an exemption clause, and for the reason it puts the majority at the whole power of our conscience; we deny their right to do anything of the kind. I ask the exemption clause representatives here to think of this after the hearing is over. It will be but all the investigation they will need.

*Senator Storer*—I should like to call everybody's attention to one fact. Don't you think that an exemption of this kind, you would better ask for legislation by the State. The great fault I find with the bill is in the effort to get the assistance of the parties another two, one on one side and the other side and they and the plain substance of all of which you ask.

*Senator Blair*: Perhaps you remark that if the exemption clause virtually defeats the purpose of Sunday laws, why does not THE SENTINEL, in its opposition to Sunday advocate an exemption. All! the answer that can exist an exemption clause can repeal it); and when any one advocates an exemption clause as a remedial principle; and when the one who advocates the principles of the enactment of an exemption clause, he gives the whole case away and robs himself of the right to protest against the repeal of it. If the right to legislate on the questions be conceded even to the extent of an exemption clause, then the right having been recognized, the principle having been endorsed, no power exist it chooses in the exercise in the right which has been conceded. Next we shall have a word to say upon the argument about the exemption clause: they may propose, and will show why they propose it, in the face of the knowledge which they possess concerning it.
