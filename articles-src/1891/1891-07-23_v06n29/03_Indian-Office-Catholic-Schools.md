"AFAIRS have taken a curious turn at the Indian Office," says the Washington correspondent of the Baptist Examiner. "I told you some time since that about half a million dollars are annually paid out to Catholic contract schools through this bureau. There is a self-constituted organization in our city called the Bureau of Catholic Missions that has been making it pretty hot for Commissioner Morgan ever since he came into office. The result of this was a war between them and a loss of school money to the bureau. The Bureau of Missions through the Catholic press made much capital of this, but its guns have been spiked by Commissioner Morgan's ignoring the Mission Bureau altogether, and paying the contract money all to the schools. Hitherto it has been understood that the bureau was kept up by commissions drawn from this school money. If that be so it will be hard for them in the future to pay off their clerks, as the contract schools pay out on sworn vouchers."
