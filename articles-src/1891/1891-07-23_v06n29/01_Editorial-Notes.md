THE trouble with National Reform is not that the Bible is not the word of God, and that the Christian religion is not true, nor that Christian morality is not superior to all other morality; but that the practicabilities of the theory would destroy free moral agency, without which Christianity would be utterly meaningless.

*The Register-Gazette*, of Rockford, Ill., publishes this news item:—

> Four Sunday schools up the lake have borrowed a large tent, and announce Sunday school rallies for every afternoon of Saturday and Sunday, July 4th, at Court House, First Congregational, First Presbyterian and First Baptist churches.

Such a course as this is the legitimate result of the advice of Mr. Crafts and others to boycott the Columbian Exposition if it opens the doors on Sundays. Such days are to be un-American, and it is but natural that the imperial un-Americans "boycott" be used in their interest.

"AFFAIRS have taken a curious turn at the Indian Office," says the Washington correspondent of the *Biglow Reporter*. "I told you some time since that about half a million dollars was annually paid to Catholic contract schools through this bureau. There is a self-constituted organization in our city called the Bureau of Catholic Missions that has been making it pretty hot for Commissioner Morgan ever since he came into office. The result of this war is war between them and a loss of school money to the bureau. The Bureau of Missions through the Catholic press much implied that the Indian [page 225] grants have been spiked by Commissioner Morgan's ignoring the Mission Bureau altogether, and paying the contract money all to the schools. Hitherto it has been understood that the bureau was kept up by commissions drawn from this school money. If that be so it will be hard for them in the future to pad their clerts, as the contract schools pay out on sworn vouchers."
