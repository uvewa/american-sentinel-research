REV. J. Q. A. HENRY delivered a sermon which has been quite widely circulated in the newspapers under the title, "A Review of God's Day, and What It Should Be to Man." In it he lays down some excellent principles which we wish to compare with others that are about as flatly contradictory as statements could well be made. The article shows conclusively that Sunday laws are wholly in the interests of religion and the church. He began by saying:—

Our appeal for the proper observance of what is familiarly known as the Christian Sabbath, or the Lord's day is based upon the following propositions:

The American Sabbath is a civil institution, recognized and embodied in our law as a conservator of public morals, and as conducive to public order.

How can an appeal for the observance of a Christian institution be based upon the fact that American institutions are civil institutions? Did Christian institutions originate in America? And must we regard the civil power in America as the authority for their observance? Is the United States Government Lord of the Sabbath? if so, where did it get its authority? Certainly not from the Bible, for that says Christ is Lord of the Sabbath? To plead for the observance of the Christian Sabbath on the authority of civil law, is to argue that the civil power has rightful jurisdiction over the Christian religion; and this is just what Mr. Henry has done. Then he says:—

The claim of the Sabbath as a day of religious culture and worship is laid only on the individual conscience, and is not and can not be enforced by legal statute. It is no part of the Sabbath movement to make people good by law. Sabbaths are not kept by legislative enactments. No attempt is being made to force religion down the throat of men. God only is Lord of the conscience, and has lifted it entirely from the doctrines and commandments of men.

These are sound principles, but they squarely contradict what he said at first, and overthrow the whole theory of Sunday legislation. For, if "the claim of the Sabbath as a day of religious culture and worship is laid only on the individual conscience," and "God only is the Lord of the conscience," then no State has a right to constitute itself Lord of the conscience by requiring such observance. And if "Sabbaths are not kept by legislative enactments," if they "are not, and can not, be enforced by legal statute," it is manifestly wrong to "appeal for the proper observance" on the authority of civil law.

In his argument, Mr. Henry shows very clearly that all Sunday legislation is a direct attempt on the part of the State to control the consciences of men. The only way he can avoid this conclusion is by claiming that the "proper observance" of the "Christian Sabbath" does not mean its religious observance. But there is no observance of any religious institution that is proper, except a religious observance.

In the last quotation the speaker said, "It is no part of the Sabbath movement to make men better by law." Practically, he contradicted this when he said that the Sabbath was "recognized and embodied in our law as a conservator of public morals." To be a conservator of morals, is to be a preserver or keeper of morals. It means that the State, through Sunday laws, undertakes to keep people from growing any worse morally. But whether the State tries to make men better by law, or undertakes to keep them from getting worse, the principle is the same. In both cases, the State assumes jurisdiction over the subject of morals. Here is another proof that Sunday laws have to do with the conscience. Morality is conformity to God's moral law, the ten commandments. This law requires us to love God with all the heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. Thus morality is love and immorality is hatred. These are matters of conscience, conditions of the heart, over which the civil law has no jurisdiction. In his closing paragraph, the speaker himself said, that "moral law is but the transcript of the divine nature." This is true; and we hold that it is impossible for the State to put the divine nature into anybody, or to preserve it after it is there. And to undertake such a thing is an insult to conscience, and blasphemy in the sight of God.

Notwithstanding all this, the speaker coolly says, that "no attempt is being made to force religion down the throats of men." O, no; simply an effort to keep the "divine nature" from leaking out of them; that is all. And you might as well cork up a bottle to keep the light in when you are about to carry it into a dark room.

Sunday laws are not "conducive to public order." Those who are compelled to stop work against their will, will make Sunday "a day of deviltry," as has already been complained of in Kings County, New York. Besides, there are laws to enforce public order on all days of the week. The more people who are idle, and are bent on mischief, as the result of Sunday laws, the harder it will be to enforce the laws of public order.

Another argument contained in the sermon was this:—

The Constitution insures a legal right to enjoy the Sabbath day. Every individual, according to the Supreme Court, has the right to the enjoyment of the Christian Sabbath, without liability to annoyance from the ordinary secular pursuits of life, except so far as they may be dictated by necessity or charity.

Yes, the Constitution does insure the right to every man to enjoy the Sabbath day. The Constitution leaves him free to rest, or work, or fish, or to do anything else that will contribute to his enjoyment, so long as he is not uncivil. And no one has the constitutional right to deprive him of his enjoyment by compelling him to rest when he does not want to. To compel one man to lay aside his "secular pursuits" on Sunday in consideration of the religious feelings of another, is to establish the principle that every person has a right to have his religious feelings protected by law. To carry out that principle would absolutely stop all religious work, and shut every man's mouth on the subject of religion; for nothing could be done or said that would be in harmony with the ideas and feelings of everyone; and as surely as their opinions were crossed, their feelings would be disturbed. No error could be rebuked, no truth could be advocated, because somebody's feelings would be disturbed.

The United States Constitution is based upon the principle that "all men are created free and equal;" and it says that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." According to this principle, if the Christian has a right to keep Sunday "without liability to annoyance from the ordinary secular pursuits of life," the Jew has an equal right to observe Saturday without liability to such annoyance.

"That government under which the rights of all citizens are not equally protected, is organized injustice."

Would Sunday-keeping Christians be willing to lay aside their secular pursuits on Saturday that the observance of the Jews and Seventh-day Christians might be free from all disturbances? Are they ready to apply the Golden Rule, and do as much for others as they ask others to do for them? Here is an excellent chance for them to test themselves, and see whether they are actuated by the spirit of Christianity, or whether they are controlled by a spirit of selfishness and bigotry. Whoever asks another to show more respect for his religion than he is willing to show in return, thereby admits that the other religion is superior to his own. He expects the other man to be more of a gentleman than he is, and to exhibit more benevolence and charity in his deeds. What he admits may or may not be true, but it is an admission, nevertheless.

Mr. Henry annihilated the authority of the "civil Sabbath" by the closing words of his sermon. He said:—

All plead, therefore, for the American Sabbath, that it may become a day of rest, of innocent recreation, and of devout worship.

The supreme source for the observance of this day is to be found in the claim of religion and of Christian faith. Moral law is but the transcript of the divine nature. The Sabbath is God's institution; it was made for man; it is the one ordinary which reminds man that he is facing eternity. Sabbath desecration and intemperance are the keenest blades that the enemy of souls has forged against the well-being of humanity. If we can keep the family right on Bible lines, then we shall keep the Church right; and if we keep the Church right, the State will be safe indeed.

Hardly does the speaker finish his plea for the "American Sabbath" before he gives positive proof that it is neither American nor civil. He says that "the supreme source for the observance of this day is to be found in the claims of religion and of Christian faith." If it were an American civil institution, the supreme source of authority for its observance would be found, not in the claims of religion, but in the claims of American civil law. Again, if the Sabbath were a civil institution, there would be no sense in making it a day of "devout worship," unless one desired to worship the State by religiously honoring its institution. But that would be idolatry. There is a vast difference between worshiping God on any day of the week, and worshiping him because the State has set apart that day. Such worship is directed to the State more than it is to God. "know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?"

To ask that an institution "of devout worship," which finds its supreme source of observance "in the claims of religion," shall be recognized and embodied in law, is to ask that religion be forced upon the people by law. And that is the purpose of the whole Sunday-law movement. If "the Sabbath is God's institution," as Mr. Henry says, then it does not belong to America; render therefore unto America the things which are America's, and unto God the things that are God's.

Finally, Mr. Henry admits that the whole trouble after all is with the family and the Church. If these can be kept right on Bible lines, then, he says, "the State will be safe indeed." Sabbath reform, then, should begin where the difficulty lies, namely, in the family and in the Church. And to ask that the State shall enforce by law the proper observance of the Sabbath, is to request that the State shall undertake to do a work which belongs to the family and the Church, and which they will not do for themselves.

But, further, as all the good that is ever accomplished for Christianity, either by the family or by the Church, comes through the power of God, it is manifest that every effort to have the State undertake such a work, is an effort to substitute the power of the State for the power of God. It puts the State in the place of God as Lord of the conscience; and those who recognize such substitution by rendering obedience to the State in a religious matter, thereby become worshipers of the State instead of worshipers of God. Thus the logical effect of Sunday laws, as well as of all other laws designed to enforce a recognition of religious institutions, is to make the Government an object of worship, and enforce idolatry upon the people.
