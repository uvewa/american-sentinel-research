THE CITY COUNCIL of Utica, New York, recently suspended the ordinance forbidding Sunday baseball, and again at a subsequent meeting reconsidered their action. As reported, the aldermen seem to have been mainly influenced in this course by the religious feeling and sentiment of fellow-townmen and church members, instead of a considerate investigation of the civil principles involved. Among all the instances of the agitation of this Sunday question but one City Council has yet discussed the matter as becomes intelligent men and responsible law-makers—that of the city of Bradford, Pennsylvania.
