THE CATHOLIC REVIEW remarks that Catholic educators and others interested in the peaceful settlement of the present difficulties of popular education will find matter for useful discussion in the fact that five Catholic high schools in the State of New York are now integral parts of the State University.

And we may reasonably conclude that the end is not yet. The State and the Church are already in partnership in a good many ways in the State of New York. Every year millions of dollars are paid to various religious institutions, and for years the matter has been a bone of contention between Catholics and Protestants. The strife has however not been for principle, but for State cash. The contest has been sharp, but the only question has been, Who should have the lion's share of the spoil?
