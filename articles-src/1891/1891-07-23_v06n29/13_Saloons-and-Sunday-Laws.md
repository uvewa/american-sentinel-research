The liquor interest may yet array itself on the side of Sunday laws, and the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union find in it an unexpected ally. As an evidence of this possibility the liquor dealers of Tacoma, Wash., when compelled to close on Sunday assisted zealously in the enforcement of Sunday closing upon all business men of the place. Are Miss Willard and Mrs. Bateham ready to usher in the National Reform millennium hand in hand with the saloon keeper, and for a mess of Sunday pottage sell out the birthright of the temperance cause?
