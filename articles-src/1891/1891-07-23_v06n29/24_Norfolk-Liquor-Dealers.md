THE LIQUOR DEALERS' Association of Norfolk, Virginia, have joined hands with the Sabbath Union and National Reformers in enforcing the Sunday laws. They have given notice that detectives employed by them have reported several parties selling liquor on Sunday, also that witnesses have been secured, and that competent counsel will be immediately employed to prosecute these Sabbath breakers among their number. So another organization must be added to the long list of those affiliated with the National Reform party,—the Liquor Dealers' Association of Norfolk, Virginia.
