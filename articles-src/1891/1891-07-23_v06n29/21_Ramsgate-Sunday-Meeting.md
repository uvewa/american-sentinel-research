A PUBLIC meeting, said to have numbered three thousand persons, has been held at Ramsgate, England, in favor of "Sunday Observance," at which the magistrates were called upon to interdict all street cries and public noise on Sundays, to close the fish market, and stop the excursions from London. Advices do not state what influence, if any, the recommendation of the meeting had with the authorities.
