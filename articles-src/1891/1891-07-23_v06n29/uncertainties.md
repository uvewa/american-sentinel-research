# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, July 23, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 29)

## General Note

The scan quality across all 8 pages of this issue is poor, with significant degradation in many areas. The type is often blurry and difficult to read with certainty. Many passages were transcribed with best-effort judgment but contain a higher than normal proportion of uncertain readings. This note applies broadly across all articles in this issue.
