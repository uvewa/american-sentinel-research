The American Sabbath Union will hold a "Sabbath observance" meeting in the auditorium, Chautauqua, Sunday, August 9; and on the 11th the State Sabbath Committee of New York will meet on the assembly grounds to complete the organization of the committee. These associations are making themselves heard in the different Chautauqua assemblies, in the Christian Endeavor Conventions, and everywhere throughout the country where instrumentalities are at work for the promotion of mental or religious growth. Do those who realize the errors which they teach appreciate the meaning of this?
