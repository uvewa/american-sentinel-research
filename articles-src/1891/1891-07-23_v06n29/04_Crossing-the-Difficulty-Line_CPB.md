## Crossing the Difficulty Line.

[227]

A UNCOVER disregard of a certain standard is noticed by Friday in Sunday. Similar ideas are noticed in those countries having little or no legislation upon the subject. A late number of the *Christian Endeavor*, a leading English paper, says:—

> Sunday is not more strictly observed in England. In coming to England: the number of Sunday workers is rapidly multiplying. ... In the past few years the number of visible Sunday workers has been considerably on the increase, the Sunday trading having been stimulated from the facilities offered by the running of the tram cars, and the arrival of the seasonal summer and winter exhibitions, and the like.

This is only one of the many facts that might be cited in England to show that the same tendencies were at work in every country. And even Scotland, that country far-famed for its strict Sunday observance and for rigid laws upon the subject, is relaxing somewhat of its old-time strictness, or rather the people are, giving yielding to the influences of the "Continental Sunday." A recent report to the General Assembly of Scotland, the highest church court in that country [228] where Presbyterianism is the established religion, declares that football and cricket have done much harm "by the Sabbath indolence and neglect of ordination which exhausted nature starts from their vacations."

The report also says that in one county especially "the pernicious custom of visiting fairs and places of interest on the Lord's Day is rapidly spreading." And in another section "Frivolous and purely worldly conversation on the Lord's Day is common." The liquor traffic too seems to be active there as elsewhere, while the "saint of half-bearing" going to church only in the foreword and impolite notice of the prayer meeting are sapping the life of the church.

A similar condition of affairs in this country is attributed by many to lax Sunday legislation, and to a total of partial failure to enforce existing laws upon the subject; but this is a mistake. As before intimated, neither England nor Scotland is lacking in the number of Readers, not in official recognition of God as the source of civil authority. So far as civil law can make nations Christian these countries are Christian.

The truth of the matter is that civil laws have nothing to do with morals or religion, and instead of "Sunday" "observance" being due to the absence of Sunday laws in the base or low moral condition of the people; and no amount of such law can possibly improve that condition or make the people more religious, of course it naturally follows that the only way to secure better morals is to refrain to make the people more religious; and this can be done only by teaching them the gospel.
