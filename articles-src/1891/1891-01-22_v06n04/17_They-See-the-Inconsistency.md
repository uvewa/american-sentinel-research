The Catholics are not slow to see the inconsistency of the attitude of certain so-called Protestants who favor giving what they are pleased to call "unsectarian instruction in the public schools." The *Catholic Review* says:—

Our brethren outside the fold have a hard time with the separation of Church and State. With the right hand they are doing all in their power to sustain their own privileges in all public institutions, and with the left they are doing their utmost to pull these privileges down. The recent school conference in New York illustrates this point admirably. It declared for an utter divorce of Church and State one moment, and the next it praised this State for its teaching of Christian morals and its maintenance of religious exercises. We must ask the members of the conference what consistency lies in their position? We must also ask, if a State hospital, prison, or home pays a chaplain to instruct and solace its inmates, where can be the harm of paying a teacher to instruct children in Catholicity? And if the trustees of a Catholic school prove that for one school year they have taught five hundred American children efficiently certain secular branches, what hindrance can there be to the payment of State funds for this instruction? If there be no union of Church and State in the case of the hospital and the public school, there is none in the case of the parochial school.

It is just as much a union of Church and State to teach Protestantism at public expense as it is to teach Romanism, and everybody ought to be able to see it so. The State should let every sort of ism entirely alone; and to do so, it must let religion alone.
