NOTING the declaration of the Roman Catholic Council of Baltimore on Sunday observance, Rabbi Mendes of this city, very pertinently says:—

"Without going over to the Judaic Sabbath?" Did these learned men understand the phrase? Did it occur to them that perhaps they would be more consistent Christians if they did "go over" to the Judaic Sabbath? The Judaic Sabbath is the Sabbath of the seventh day. Not one priest in all that vast assemblage, not one layman there, could have given or could to-day give one sound reason why the Founder of Christianity should be by them slighted as he is by the institution of the Sunday Sabbath! For he himself kept the seventh-day Sabbath, truly not with extremist or puritanic rigor, but as a sacred day, as the Sabbath, the only Sabbath that he knew of. He himself ordained the continuance of the seventh-day Sabbath when he commanded, "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or tittle shall in no wise pass from the law," and the fourth commandment of that law ordains the seventh-day Sabbath.

If, as we are told by no less an authority than Bishop Taylor, among a thousand others: "The primitive church kept both the Sabbath and the Sunday till the time of the Laodicean Council, about three hundred years after the birth of the Founder of Christianity;" if, as another authority, such as Paley, among a myriad of others, asserts: "There is not a single instance recorded in the Christian Scriptures of the Sunday having in the time of the apostles been observed as a prayer day," and, "Those Scriptures contain no evidence from which we can even infer a custom among the Christians of that period so to observe it,"—if, in spite of these facts our Christian brethren choose to institute a Sunday Sabbath they make free to do so, but they thus defy their own origin of action and of being. It is no New Testament command they thus obey; and above all they may not hold up as a something to be steered clear of "the Judaic Sabbath," since it is the Sabbath which alone has Old or New Testament authority, and which the Founder of their faith kept and bade his followers keep.
