A FREETHOUGHT paper notes the fact that "indictments for blasphemy are very common in Germany; Dr. Peus, of Berlin, Mr. Aug. Kruhl, of Hirshberg, and Dr. Voelkel being the latest victims. The latter has at present five indictments against him—two in Berlin, one in Halle, one in Muhlhausen in Thuringen, and one in Bernburg." Such indictments are not common in this country, but nobody will pretend to say that, religiously, this country is not far in advance of Germany which is noted for its skepticism.
