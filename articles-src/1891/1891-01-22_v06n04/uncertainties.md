# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, January 22, 1891 (v06n04)

## General Note

This issue was transcribed from scanned page images at relatively low resolution. The small typeface and period printing style made many passages difficult to read with full confidence. The uncertainties below represent the most significant areas of concern, but there are likely additional minor reading errors throughout due to the image quality.

## Page 1 (p. 25)

### Editorial Notes, left column
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Multiple passages uncertain:** The editorial snippets below the masthead information contain several passages where individual words are difficult to distinguish. The paragraph about the Washington correspondent's quote about the "democratic free labor party" is particularly uncertain in its exact wording.
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Very small text, printing artifacts, and period typeface make precise transcription difficult at this resolution.

### "The World" and the Constitution
- **Transcribed as:** "the appeal of the King from the Transvaal"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - The word "Transvaal" is what appears in the text, though "the King from the Transvaal" is an unusual phrasing. May refer to a different case.
- **Reason:** The text is small but readable; the reference context is somewhat unusual.

## Page 2 (p. 26)

### Continuation of "The World" and the Constitution
- **Passage:** "It is true that the 'original package' decision carried in a long way in the wrong direction..."

- **Reason:** Small text and possible printing degradation.

### Religious Influences in Politics

- **Passage about Lord Justice Fitzgerald:** The legal quotation on page 26 right side is partially readable. Several phrases within the quoted passage are uncertain.
- **Reason:** Small typeface combined with scan quality makes precise word-by-word transcription very difficult.

### Religion in the Schools
- **Overall confidence:** LOW
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Issues:** The source attribution at the end is very difficult to read. Transcribed as a reference to a "D.D., in New York Christian Intelligence" but this is uncertain.

## Page 4 (p. 28)

## Articles Requiring Re-transcription from Higher Quality Scans

The following articles would particularly benefit from re-transcription using higher-resolution scans:

1. **Religious Influences in Politics** - Many passages are uncertain
2. **Religion in the Schools** - Source attribution and several passages uncertain
3. **The Authority Questioned** - Author name and several quotations uncertain
4. **They See the Inconsistency** - The Catholic Review quotation is largely uncertain
5. **A Serious Question** - Several key passages uncertain
6. **Editorial Items (p. 32)** - Multiple items have uncertain readings

## Structural Notes

- The "Authority Questioned" article on page 4 (left column) may actually be two articles or a continuation. The relationship between the Rabbi Mendes quotation about the Jewish Sabbath and the text that follows with the "A. DELOS WESTCOTT" signature needs verification.
- Some articles that continue across pages may have text that was misattributed between articles due to the difficulty of reading column breaks at this resolution.
