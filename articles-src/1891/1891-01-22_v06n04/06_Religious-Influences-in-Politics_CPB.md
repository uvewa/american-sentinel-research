The Mail and Express of January 7, has an editorial on the subject of ecclesiastical influence in political affairs in Ireland, which is worthy of careful reading and thought. Our contemporary, though of National Reform proclivities, says:—

The letter of Mr. Vincent Scully, the defeated candidate for North Kilkenny, saying that the Irish struggle is "a struggle for the Irish to manage Irish affairs after their own manner," seems to emphasize the remarks of Parnell as he was leaving Dublin, attributing their defeat in that election to undue influence by the priests. Mr. Parnell is reported to have said at Dublin:—

The priests led the people of North Kilkenny to the polls like sheep. In many cases where they could not coerce the people they prevented them from voting. If a petition were lodged, it could be backed by such evidence to prove undue influence as to make a revolt in our farce certain. Mr. Scully is a strong Catholic, but he sees clearly that if the priests are permitted similarly to influence the coming election Ireland will be lost. The general election is not far distant, and I shall push forward preparation for it.

Should Mr. Parnell carry out the idea of a petition to set aside the election on the ground of undue influence, and so secure to the Irish people the right to vote as they please in the general election, it will be a victory for the electors of both wings, and will give a new interest to the Irish question by the decision that the Irish are fairly entitled to home rule so far as voting as they please, instead of being subject to the dictation of the Roman Curia.

The principle of English law applicable to the exercise of undue influence was plainly stated by Sir Samuel Romilly, and is one that should be carefully understood by every American. That eminent jurist said:—

Undue influence will be used if ecclesiastic make use of their power to excite superstitious fears or pious hopes; to inspire, as the object may be best promoted, despair or confidence; to alarm the conscience by the horrors of eternal misery, or support the drooping spirit by unfolding the prospect of eternal happiness.

This precedent, according to Mr. Lindsey in his work entitled "Rome in Canada: the Ultramontane Struggle for Supremacy Over the Civil Authority," (Toronto: Lovell Bros., 1877), was followed by Baron Fitzgerald in the Mayo contested election in 1857, and the election was annulled on the ground that spiritual intimidation had been made use of. Speaking of what the priest may do and may not do in this respect, the Judge said: "He may not appeal to the fears or terrors or superstition of those whom he addresses. He must not hold out the hope of reward here or hereafter, and he must not use threats of temporary injury, or of disadvantage or punishment hereafter; he must not, for instance, threaten to excommunicate or withhold the sacraments, or to expose the party to any other religious disability, or denounce the voting for any particular candidate as a sin or an offense involving punishment here or hereafter. If he does so with a view to influence a voter the law considers him guilty of undue influence. . . . As priestly influence is so great we must regard its exercise with extreme jealousy, and seek by the utmost vigilance to keep it within due and proper bounds."

The principle is just the same in this country, and should prevent the clergy of all denominations from participating in politics in their capacity as clergymen. A powerful church, the vote of whose members can be controlled by its priesthood, is a menace to free government, and the principle is just the same in the smaller denominations.

The minister of religion should inculcate correct principles, should insist upon honesty in every walk of life, but when he attempts to coerce voters by threats of the Divine displeasure, or even to influence them in a certain direction by threatening them with his own or the church's displeasure, he abuses his sacred office and arrays himself on the side of religious despotism. It matters not even if, in a given case, the minister's views are correct as to the better political course to pursue, the principle remains unchanged; and it should be insisted upon by free people everywhere that ecclesiastics, as such, shall keep out of politics.
