THE Christian Statesman thinks that the pamphlet by Richard B. Westbrook, President of the American Secular Union, in which he argues that the Bible should not be read in the public schools because of its defective morality, "will be helpful to the friends of the Bible in the schools." This is just what we said when we first read Mr. Westbrook's argument. Secularism is wounded in the house of its friends by such productions as this by the President of the Secular Union.
