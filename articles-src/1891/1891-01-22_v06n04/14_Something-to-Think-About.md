St. Augustine once said: "It is indeed better that men should be brought to serve God by instructions than by fear of pain and being punished, but because the former is better the latter must not be neglected." And it would seem that a great many religious people at the present time are of the same opinion. For instance, a bill is before Congress for the purpose of amending the United States Constitution, that God may be recognized in that instrument; another to enforce Sunday observance—or the American Sabbath as it is called by some—as though the Sabbath was peculiarly American and did not have its birth in Eden before America was ever thought of; still another bill to enforce the observance of Sunday in the District of Columbia; and last the Edmunds bill for a national university, where we would presume from the bill, religion in its multifarious forms is to be consolidated and thus promulgated. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union has to a certain extent stopped temperance work to cry for religious legislation. Several organizations have been formed with that as their main object, and the Young Mens' Christian Associations have, in some places, committed themselves to this fascinating role of making a country religious by law. Congress is being flooded with petitions in support of the various means proposed; and now a body of ministers in Chicago have decided that the Columbian Exposition must be closed on Sunday because laboring men must have a day of rest, and it is important that Chicago should be a model in this respect to our Sabbath-breaking European friends who may come to visit us in 1893.

Now this all seems like a joke in a country like ours, the last especially. One would think Chicago the last city in the Union to take as a model to show Europeans how to behave on Sunday. But perhaps they imagine our foreign friends are accustomed to saloons, gambling, and drunkards, and will be so absorbed in meditating on the righteousness of closing the Fair so people will have a chance to go to church, that they will be oblivious of Chicago's "attritivites." But I am compelled to believe otherwise. We also believe that the laboring men as well as the visitors, who do not go to church, would be far better off attending the Exposition on Sunday than aimlessly roaming the streets on which are so many inducements to "yield to temptation." Our friends start at the wrong end. They want to reform the Fair to reform the people. It would be more logical, as well as being more in accord with their profession as Christian ambassadors, to reform the people, and let the Fair take care of itself.

Christ and his apostles spent their lives trying to induce men to voluntarily put their trust in the Saviour and be saved by faith in his redeeming blood, at the same time submitting meekly to the Government. But many Christians seem to think that they have discovered an improvement on Christ's methods, and one that will advance their cause faster than he ever thought of, that is, to make Christians by law. It is to be hoped, however, that these good people will come to a realizing sense of the fact that this country is better to remain under a civil Government than to retrograde several hundred years and go under church rule. In Japan petitions are circulated in opposition to the Christian religion, and we condemn the action as heathen, but in this country petitions are circulated to induce legislation in favor of the Christian religion, and it is commended. The difference in the two is not so great as at first appears. The policy of each is destructive of religious freedom.
