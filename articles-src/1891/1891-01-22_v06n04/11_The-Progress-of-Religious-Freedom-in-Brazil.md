THE people of the United States have been so accustomed to religious freedom, that it is so much a part of their life, that full to it understand the idea of making a country teaches exists in other places of what denying what they got them, and "nonchalant instruction in the public churches." *Catholic Review*, says:—

Our brethren outside the fold have a first and with the separation of Church and State, which right had they are qualified at all to exercise, that other would be; like essentially the practice from the philosopher, to the overloading this principle. Its civil freedom equally, but not one easily or too easily found. Originally, the right and Sabbath has been established, and the first people to organize a commission for considering religion in America was now one that the others could, ordered his expeditions monasteries in all other rights from the colonization of his power with their representatives were power in the State, but of the Prot­estants. It is only here and there, and very slowly, and with increasing difficulty, that the obligations of human well-being in place of familiar multifarious of a national of courses national. Perhaps part of all the governments of the past has been the source of much commonplace and the distinction in the world's ways and issues in this time. And certainly, like of all movements, the alert to the duty of the State to preserve existing rights.

We are slowly reaching a point at last where the most civilized peoples are beginning, even if with at least partial clearness, that the function of the State is to maintain perfect civil rights and conduct in this life, and to their rearing on the leading of religion to the perfectly free choice of the opinion may of reason of religious opinions and principles, and to the teaching of some sort yet it is to preserve equality, as to give preference to any evil with many; that it is the rights of the of things that operates on its transactional causes and interest its individuals, not to enforce some person's ideal of education, of "which eternal faith can only on a permanent basis be the right one for the seeking of things in the world."

[30] men have no right to think for themselves upon the subject of religion.

In the sixteenth century, when Brazil was a Colony of Portugal, John Boles, a French Huguenot, was executed in Rio de Janeiro for heresy. Even at the time of the independence, in 1821, the spirit was so strong that the Romish Church was made the State Church. The State erected the church buildings, supported the priests, provided salaries for the education of the candidates for orders, and gave to the entire moral support to that church. All persons were bound to respect it, and no one was allowed to speak or write against it. Other religions were only tolerated.

Even this was a step in advance of the old conditions; nevertheless it was very far from giving religious freedom. Providence, to attend to the necessity in purpose or business to need for worship in private houses or in houses with no "exterior form of a temple." In consequence of this clause of the constitution church buildings in Brazil are plain structures without steeples or belfries, the absence of these being considered sufficient distinction from "a temple." The first Protestant church building ever erected in Brazil was the English chapel in Rio, built in 1833. The feeling was so strong against it that the chief of police sent a guard that the wall was met to prevent disorder. Little by little the people became accustomed to the presence of a Protestant house of worship, and discovered that it was really quite as harmless as an ordinary private dwelling. In fact all the services were held in a foreign language, and therefore could do no harm to Brazil. Later on, however, when Protestant missionaries came from the United States and Scotland, and after learning the language began holding religious services in Portuguese, the old persecution spirit was revived, and these men were killed, threatened and persecuted in various ways. But they were men who were not easily daunted by such opposition, and since then this indecent spirit has to a large extent died out, except among the priests, who are as bitter as ever.

This result has come largely through the influences of Protestantism and a general growth of liberal ideas among the people. Some of the leading men of the country have visited Protestant lands and become convinced that Protestantism and religious liberty are not so horrid as the priests have pictured them. The more travel increased the spirit in the last thirty-five time, became dead letters; but it was only in 1881 that Protestant were recognized, and even in 1888 Parliament refused to consider a liberty of worship bill.

But the cause of religious liberty gained a complete victory through the Revolution of last November. It may be only a temporary advantage, but we hope that it is permanent. The provisional Government separated Church and State, granted liberty of worship, entitled Roman Catholic marriage from the public schools, instituted civil marriages, placed the control of the public cemeteries in the hands of the civil

government that is to enforce justice, not the religious teachings of some sort; yet it is to preserve equality, not to give preference to any evil with many; that it is the rights and interests of individuals, not to enforce some person's ideal of education or philosophy on all.

The provisional Government has prepared and decreed a new Constitution which was to be presented to the Constituent Assembly, called to convene on November 15, this assembly to have power to amend and finally adopt it. The following are the articles which treat of religious freedom:—

> It is prohibited to the States as well as to the Union henceforth, to set in the exercise of any religious worship.

> All individuals and religious denominations may publicly and freely exercise their worship, association bleached for the purpose, and acquiring property within the limits prescribed by the law of each of the references.

> The Republic recognizes civil marriage only, the celebration of which must be always gratuitous.

> Cemeteries will be secular in character and administered by the municipality.

> Instructions furnished by public institutions will be secular.

> No denomination or church shall enjoy official favor, or have relations of dependence or alliance with the Government of the Union, or that of the States.

If these articles are approved by the Assembly and the principles of religious freedom become thus embodied in the Constitution of the Republic, Brazil has before it a bright future, and her statesmen will be forever freed from the troublesome religious question; "and the people of Brazil liberated from the thralldom of the Papacy, free to follow the dictates of their consciences, will be a happier and a better people."

The Romish Church itself will reform, if it is possible for the Church in Brazil to reform, and a grander opportunity will be presented for Protestant Christendom to enter and freely and openly teach "the truth as it is in Christ Jesus."—*Rev. John M. Kyle, D.D., Rio de Janeiro, in Church at Home and Abroad.*
