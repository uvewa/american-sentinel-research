[32] NEW YORK, JANUARY 22, 1891.

Is a novel calico musard of an individual belief founded upon certain evidences more or less valid? But in the latter position one whit more defensible than the other?

The editor of THE SENTINEL must just strike what he said. We believe that the highest type of morality is inseparable from Christianity, and that whatever is immoral is also unChristian. In an occasional sense immorality means outward conformity to the rules of propriety, but properly speaking only that is moral which is in harmony with the moral law, the law of God, and that takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

The First Methodist Church of Louisville, Colorado, published a complete programme of its Sunday and other services, in the form of a four-page weekly *Sunday* paper, which contains, beside the church notices, advertisements of various business houses in the town. The expenses of publishing the paper is probably not in this way; but inasmuch as the Methodist Church is foremost in the American Sabbath Union crusade against Sunday papers, it would be well for its ministers and Official Boards to set a better example than does the First Church of Louisville.

In answering this question, "What is the difference between religion and morality?" the *Christian Times*, says: "Religion is defined by Michael as 'any effect such a manifestation of the infinite as produces an influence upon the moral nature of man. In a less general but more practical sense, religion is that maintenance of such relations between the soul and God as promote life and character and give righteousness. Accepting either of these definitions, there is evidently a distinction that which come between morality; and, in our judgment, there is no permanent, unfailing morality which is not rooted in and dependent upon religion."

One of the beauties of living under a Government that makes a difference in the treatment of its citizens on account of religion, is illustrated by the following from the St. Petersburgh correspondent of *London Times:*—

> A lad of poor percentage went up to serve his sought for military service in one of the identified Mongrel and was rejected on account of ill health. His father, who was a Jew, had meanwhile reported to the Governor that the lad had been born on the Sabbath of the converted Jews. His right to reside where he was belonging now and was refused to its subsidized enemy roles back to the village on the defaults. He was given ten minutes walking all the way. The lad's father made up to relate the officer who sent his son's heir fortune, and to take the later back to the recruiting office in the town, but on arriving there the lad was ultimately ordered to be walked back to his village, and then to be brought to the office again by day. The boy, however, was again rejected as unfit for service, and the report to the tribunal was proved to have been false.

AN interesting question has been raised in this city, by the refusal of a Hebrew to hold court upon the seventh-day, the Sabbath, *The Breakfast.*

PETITIONS for a national Sunday law are still flowing into Congress. True, the stream is not nearly so large as it was a year and a half ago, when Mr. Crafts was manipulating the springs that fed it; but this plagues, nevertheless, show a sluggish generous in the attitude of religious legislation.

\* \* \*

The City Council of Toronto, Canada, has decided that no more street cars shall be run in that city on Sunday. It follows that all who cannot afford private carriages must remain at home, or within walking distance of home, on Sunday. Is that the kind of Sunday legislation that shall discriminate against the poor.

A PETERSBURGH paper notes the fact that "indictments for blasphemy are very common in Germany. Dr. Prox, of Berlin, Mr. Krugh, of Hindsberg, and Dr. Baumburg" being the latest victims. The latter has at present five indictments against him—two in Berlin, one in Halle, one in Hagensworth, and one in Braunschweig or Bamburg." Such indictments are not common in this country, but nobody will pretend to say, religionists, this country is not in advance of Germany which is ruled in the adaptations.

THE Bishops, City, town, upon us. It is as we are citizens requiring all the saloons to be closed from an clock Saturday evening until six Monday morning. Because

"Don't burn!" Does the elite editor of THE SENTINEL mean this to be understood as claiming that there is no morality which is not dependent upon Christian belief? What then to morality subscribe to the laws of the man to the religion to as Reform for Christianity? Is there no morality to what that's dependence upon Christian religion? Or, are the terms thus given not synonymous? The position of THE SENTINEL's agreement, the editor seems to be, that none which is not based upon Christian belief in Christianity, but that belief is Christianity is not possible without morality." If the latter, it seems legitimate to infer that THE SENTINEL holds that Christianity and every other religion as well

is a novel calico musard of an individual belief founded upon certain evidences more or less valid? But in the latter position one whit more defensible than the other?

The editor of THE SENTINEL must just strike what he said. We believe that the highest type of morality is inseparable from Christianity, and that whatever is immoral is also unChristian.

WE print on another page the conclusion of an article by Rev. John M. Kyle, of Rio de Janeiro, entitled "The Progress of Religious Freedom in Brazil." This article first appeared in the October number of *Home and Abroad*, and subsequently in the *Christian Statesman*, though why that paper published it we are at a loss to understand. According to the *Statesman's* ideas Brazil is now just entering upon an era of destruction. It is, according to Mr. Kyle, fully deliver of the United States in the matters of the separation of Church and State, and in some things has gone far beyond us.

Just what, if any, recognition of the divine Being the new Constitution contains, we cannot say, upon it. It seems to us however that it will prove of all sufficiency to nations that believe well in the Universal Government, in what the ecclesiastical arrangement is known as "Christian civil government."

"Is the Papacy a Prophecy?" is the title of a new hundred page pamphlet by Rev. Thomas Haskins, M. A., Rector of the Church of—, Los Angeles, California. This question, Mr. Haskins answers in the affirmative, the answer given by Protestant generally, but he supports the answer by an exhaustive accumulation of facts and contemporary arguments from Catholic sources themselves. The work is well worth careful and conscientious study, and deserving the reading, and in costs, according to binding, the cheaper style being sent by express, price—cloth, *Address, Los Angeles Churchyard*, Los Angeles, California.

THE *Graphic* congratulates THE AMERICAN SENTINEL on the celebration of its sixth anniversary. It is one of the most Christian publications in America, and its peers are very scarce. It has no ism but Christ, yet it defends Jew and Greek, Turk and Buddhist, from the Christian cranks who would not themselves agree against every other intelligence on this globe, Venus, and Mars, and all the rest. It defends Christianity, opposes, to a day of rest. THE SENTINEL has our cordial thanks, and deserves contributions for its good work.—*Colorado Graphic.*
