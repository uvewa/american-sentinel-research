"Is the Papacy in Prophecy?" is the title of a one hundred page treatise by Rev. Thomas Haskins, M. A., Rector of Christ Church, Los Angeles, California. This question, Mr. Haskins answers in the affirmative, the answer given by Protestants generally, but he supports his conclusions by arguments at once original and convincing. The work is well worth not only reading but study. It sells for 25, and 60 cents, according to binding; the cheaper style being paper, the more expensive, cloth. Address, Los Angeles Churchman, Los Angeles, California.
