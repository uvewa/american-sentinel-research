ANY man is to be commended for an effective office because he is a Baptist, Methodist, or Romanist; all Americans should scratch him. He is put on the ticket solely for his bigotry and lack of Americanism.—*Legal American.*

IN answer to a request sent to them by the *Independent*, for their views as to whether the Columbian Exposition should be open on Sunday, one hundred and nine members of Congress responded, fifty of this number, forty expressed themselves as opposed to Sunday opening, fifty favored keeping the Fair open on that day, and seven declined to express any opinions.

THE *Christian Statesman* thinks that the pamphlet by Richard Westbrook, President of the American Secular Union, in which he argues that the Bible should not be read in the public schools because of the defective morality, "will be helpful to the friends of the Bible in the schools." It is just what we said when we first read Mr. Westbrook's argument. Secretary Watts is installed in the horns of the friends by such productions as this by the President of the Secular Union.

A Washington correspondent of a *New York* paper says:—

> The same wing of the democratic free labor party, that their great objection to the secularization of the money is the first time accompanied it with look at the compulsory continuance of all work for seven days a week. This mechanical idea that if they could not

take that side of the question who otherwise would not do so. But in these days of workers' combine forces the tendency is toward less work and more pay, so there is very little probability of such fears being realized, but, of course, this steady increase.

This is true. In California, where they have no Sunday law, the tendency is not toward seven days work per week. Indeed, there, as everywhere else, the trend is toward shorter hours and a less number of days' labor, with a corresponding increase of opportunities for recreation. Working people join in the demand for Sunday laws in the hope that they will thereby improve their conditions, are unwittingly submitting their necks to the yoke of a religious deposition.
