THE London correspondent of a New York paper says:—

The stock excuse of the Sunday-law party is, that their great objection to the secularization of the Sunday is the fear that eventually it will lead to a compulsory continuation of all work for seven days a week. This statement has induced a number to take that side of the question who otherwise would not do so. But in these days of workers' combinations the tendency is toward less work and more pay, so there is very little probability of such fears being realized; but, of course, this is only an excuse, and nothing more.

This is true. In California, where they have no Sunday law, the tendency is not toward seven days' work per week; indeed, there, as everywhere else, the trend is toward shorter hours and fewer days of labor, with a corresponding increase of opportunities for recreation. Working people who join in the demand for Sunday laws in the hope that they will thereby improve their condition, are unwittingly submitting their necks to the yoke of a religious despotism.
