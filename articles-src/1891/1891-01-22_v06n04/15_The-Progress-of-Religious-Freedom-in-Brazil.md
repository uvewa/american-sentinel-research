The people of the United States have become so accustomed to religious freedom, and it is so much a part of their life, that they fail to understand the spirit of intolerance which exists in other parts of what is known as "free America." All who live to the south of us have Governments which are like ours in form, but the spirit which pervades them is different. The Latin and Anglo-Saxon races have been trained in different schools, and they do not have the same conceptions of liberty. From colonial times the people of South America have had what is called paternal government. Though some things can be said in its favor, it is not the kind of government which begets an independent spirit in the people. Those who governed cared not for the "will of the people," but sought to carry out those measures and ideas in government which, in their opinion, were for the highest good of the people. Accepting the intolerant claims and teachings of the Papacy, they thought it necessary for the highest good of the people to train them in the Romish Church. To encourage in any way the propagation of "heresies" was to foment discord and trouble. Reasoning in this way, those who were in authority were led to persecute Protestants in colonial times and only to tolerate them both under the empire in Brazil and in all the Spanish republics.

The power which inaugurated the Spanish Inquisition and the spirit which moved it had not entirely spent their force. The same feeling which was dominant among the Latin people of Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries still exists in the Romish priesthood of South America. It is the feeling that Protestants have no rights which Romanists are bound to respect, and that men have no right to think for themselves upon the subject of religion.

In the sixteenth century, when Brazil was a Colony of Portugal, John Boles, a French Huguenot, was executed in Rio de Janeiro for heresy. Even at the time of the independence, in 1822, this spirit was so strong that the Romish Church was made the State Church. The State erected the church buildings, supported the priests, provided seminaries for the education of candidates for orders, and gave its entire moral support to that church. All persons were bound to respect it, and no one was allowed to speak or write against it. Other religious sects were only tolerated. Even this was a step in advance of the old colonial policy. Protestants were allowed to meet for worship in private houses or in houses with no "exterior form of a temple." In consequence of this clause all the Protestant church buildings in Brazil are plain structures without steeples or belfries, the absence of these being considered sufficient conformity to the regulation. The first Protestant church building erected in Brazil was the English chapel in Rio, built in 1823. The feeling was so strong against it that the chief of police sent a guard the day it was dedicated to prevent disorder. Little by little the people became accustomed to the presence of a Protestant house of worship, and quieted their fears by reflecting that all the services were held in a foreign tongue, and therefore could do no harm to Brazil. Later on, however, when Protestant missionaries came from the United States and Scotland, and after learning the language began holding religious services in Portuguese, the old persecuting spirit was revived, and these men were vilified, threatened and persecuted in various ways. But they were men who were not easily daunted by such opposition, and since then this intolerant spirit has to a large extent died out, except among the priests, who are as bitter as ever.

This result has come largely through the influence of Protestantism and a natural growth of liberal ideas among the people. Some of the leading men of the country have visited Protestant lands and become convinced that Protestantism and religious liberty are not so horrid as the priests have pictured them. The more intolerant laws upon the statute books, in time, became dead letters; but it was only in 1861 that Protestant marriages were recognized, and even in 1888 Parliament refused to consider a liberty of worship bill.

But the cause of religious liberty gained a complete victory through the Revolution of last November. It may be only a temporary advantage, but we hope that it is permanent. The provisional Government separated Church and State, granted liberty of worship, excluded Romish teaching from the public schools, instituted civil marriage, placed the control of the public cemeteries in the hands of the civil authorities; in a word inaugurated an era of entire religious freedom. All this is at once wise, just, and reasonable, and places Brazil, in this respect, far in advance of the other South American republics.

The provisional Government has prepared and decreed a new Constitution which was to be presented to the Constituent Assembly, called to convene on November 15, this assembly to have power to amend and finally adopt it. The following are the articles which treat of religious freedom:—

It is prohibited to the States as well as to the Union to establish, aid or hinder the exercise of any religious worship.

All individuals and religious denominations may publicly and freely exercise their worship, associating themselves for this purpose, and acquiring property within the limits prescribed by the law of *mortmain*.

The Republic recognizes civil marriage only, which will always precede the religious ceremonies of whatever faith.

Cemeteries will be secular in character and administered by municipal authority.

Instructions furnished by public institutions will be secular.

No denomination or church shall enjoy official subsidy, nor hold relations of dependence or alliance with the Government of the Union, or that of the States.

If these articles are approved by the Assembly and the principles of religious freedom become thus embodied in the Constitution of the Republic, Brazil has before her a bright future, and her statesmen will be forever freed from the troublesome "religious question;" and the people of Brazil liberated from the thralldom of the Papacy, free to follow the dictates of their consciences, will be a happier and a better people.

The Romish Church itself will reform, if it is possible for the Church in Brazil to reform, and a grander opportunity will be presented for Protestant Christendom to enter and freely and openly teach "the truth as it is in Christ Jesus."—Rev. John M. Kyle, Rio de Janeiro, in *The Church at Home and Abroad*.
