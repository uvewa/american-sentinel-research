NOTING the declaration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy that the observance by Catholic Council of Baltimore on Sunday observance, Rabbi Mendes of this city, very pertinently says:—

"Without going over to the Jewish Sabbath? Did those men more rational than the proposal. Did it occur to them that the world would be more consistent Christians if they kept "the seventh" as the Jewish Sabbath? The Sabbath came to us in the Sabbath of the seventh day. Not one prophet, or one of that last assemblage, not of any person them, there could have given or could today give one sound reason why the Founder of Christianity should be by them shifted as right as the by the institution of the Sunday Sabbath? For he himself kept the seventh-day Sabbath, truly not with forms or a particular sign, but as an ordained day, as the Sabbath, the only Sabbath that is know of. He himself ordained the continuance of the seventh-day Sabbath when he commanded, "'Til heaven and earth pass, not jot or title shall in no wise pass from the law," and the fourth commandment of that law ordains the seventh-day Sabbath."

He is as we are told by no less an authority than Bishop Taylor, among a thousand others: "The primitive church kept both the Sabbath and the Sunday till the fifth century. The claim of substituting the new day for the Legislative Council, about three hundred years after the birth of the Founder of Christianity," it is another authority, as Paley, among a myriad of others, —"There is not a single instance of dissent from the Christian Scriptures of the Sunday having in the time of the apostles been observed as a prayer day," and —"These Scriptures contain no evidence which we can only infer as existing in the Christianity of that period as to its observe it,"—in, in spite of those facts our Christian brethren choose to institute a seventh Sabbath they make free to do so, but they thus only from origin of

[28] able to see the point. And if they believe their own assertion, that it is impossible for people in different longitudes to all observe the same day, we shall expect them from this time out to confine their operation to one particular longitude, which, since longitude has no width at all, will relieve not only California but every other place in the whole world from all danger of their uncertain work.

Thus the American Sabbath Union themselves have now sawed off the limb on which they sit, and annihilated every excuse for its own existence. This is characteristic of all of them. If they were persuading the truth, and their ways were just, their arguments would not nullify self, and destroy one another. Truth never can be over stated, but error will generally stab itself half the time if it has a fair presentation.
