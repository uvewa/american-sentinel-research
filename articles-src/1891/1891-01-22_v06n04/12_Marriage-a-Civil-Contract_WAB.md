The pulpit and press, to a greater or less extent, in various parts of the country, are decrying the shamefulness of the fact that the State allows so many divorces; and, as does Dr. Schaff in his "Church and State in the United States," (page 69), call for "a reform of legislation in conformity to the law of Christ." But any such "reformation" would be most decidedly a deformation. The precepts of the gospel of Christ, as Jefferson says in his disquisition on Christianity and the common law, were "intended by their benevolent Author as obligatory only in foro conscientiae."* And to enforce them by civil law is a shameful usurpation on the part of the State, and reflects dishonor upon Christ; for obedience to his precepts is to come from the heart, not to be a compulsory or a superficial and hypocritical obedience. It is no more the duty of the State to enforce the "law of Christ" on the question of divorce than it is to enforce the law of Christ on self-defense, which says, "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;" or the law of Christ on unjust prosecutions, which says, "And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;" or of restriction of liberty, which says, "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." Think what a model Government (?) we would have, if, when a man came into court who had been struck on the side of the head, the Court should say, "It is a shame that in a Christian country like this our courts should be filled with cases of prosecutions for assault and battery; we will not give you redress; we will afford you no relief whatever; you should, when you are assaulted, turn to the aggressor the other cheek, as the law of Christ says, and that law will be enforced by this Court!" The absurdity of thus enforcing this precept of Christ must be evident to all.

But it is equally absurd to enforce the law of Christ on the question of divorce. Even the theocracy which punished Sabbath-breaking by death, and which was ruled by God himself, did not attempt to do it; much less should a secular government attempt to enforce religious ethics. The churches and would-be reformers of the land should work to remove the causes for divorce, not to prevent divorce when the causes exist. It should be remembered that government is to enforce justice, not the religious teachings of some sect; that it is to preserve equality, not to give preference to any cult whatever; that it is to protect the rights and interests of individuals, not to enforce some person's ideal of ethics or philosophy.

In the Forum of September, 1890, Mr. M. J. Savage, treating on this question, truly says:—

One of the most needed, as it is one of the most difficult, of all reforms, is that which aims at having the State mind its own business. This includes two things—letting alone what is not its business, and really minding what is. In the light of legal history, one of the most curious things is the still surviving popular faith in mere laws as means for preventing evil and accomplishing good. The statute-books of even our young country are chiefly old lumber-rooms. But beyond this, and more mischievous still, is the fact that the State is continually legislating concerning things that are beyond the limits not only of its rightful, but even of its possible, jurisdiction. Many of its attempts are as impracticable as would be a legal interference with the force of gravity. Should Congress enact laws concerning things in India, all the world would smile. But not our country only, nearly all countries, are still passing laws that imply a claim of jurisdiction over other worlds and other states of existence. They are passing laws that attempt to deal with inner conditions of consciousness—with metaphysical subtleties over which philosophers and ecclesiastics are still wrangling. People want laws passed not only for the protection of life and property, and for securing good conduct here and now, but they want laws the causes of which are supposed to come from other worlds, and for ends which issue only in other worlds. In brief, they are continually confounding the functions of the priest, the preacher, the philosopher, or the metaphysician with those of the legislator.

Unreasonable as this may seem to be, the causes of it are easily traced. Originally, all governments were theocracies. The gods were but supernatural chiefs, clothed by superstitious imaginations with unknown and therefore awful powers. Whether their representatives were priest or king, their supposed will superseded all other considerations. Even now, it is only here and there, and very slowly, that any of the nations are beginning to put considerations of human well-being in place of barbaric traditions of assumed authorities. Perhaps the larger part of all the governments of the past has been dictated by considerations supposed to emanate from other worlds and issue in them. And precisely this part of all government has always been the most cruel and the most unjust.

We are slowly reaching a point at last where the most civilized people are beginning to see, with at least partial clearness, that the functions of the State should be limited to the practical matters of conduct in this life, and to their bearing on the liberties and rights of men as citizens. The philosophers may reason of ethical origins and principles, and of supersensual sanctions. The metaphysicians may speculate as to transcendental causes and results. Theologians may theorize as to what was in "the mind of God," of which actual facts are only a partial expression. For my present purpose, I question neither the right nor the wisdom of these things. But the point I wish to make is this, that, whether true or false, they do not concern the State as such.

As evidence of the fact that "we are slowly reaching a point at last where the most civilized people are beginning to see, with at least partial clearness, that the functions of the State should be limited to the practical matters of this life," the evolution of this question itself might be cited. Marriage was once quite generally regarded as a sacrament; and the Roman Catholics and others still so consider it. "Marriage," declares that church, "is purely religious. But we alone are the possessors and guardians of the true religion. Hence, all marriages not sanctioned by the church are void." And, as a recent writer says, "this is the logical and inevitable conclusion to which they arrive, upon the assumption that marriage is a religious institution or sacrament. This conclusion, with all its disastrous consequences, is embodied in a formal decree by the Catholic Church. (See a record of the decrees of the Council of Trent, November, 1563.)"

This theory, however, was one of those which the Reformation caused to be seen in a different light. The idea that it was an institution of the true religion exclusively was seen to be absurd, for it is an institution that exists in every nation under the sun. And that it is simply an agreement between two parties is evident from the fact that that was all that was possible in the case of the first parents of mankind. This very illustration was used in the leading case on this question, that of Dalrymple vs. Dalrymple, 4 English Ecclesiastical Reports, 485, the decision being written by Lord Stowell, one of England's most distinguished judges. In that decision Lord Stowell says:—

Marriage, in its origin, is a contract of natural law. It may exist between two individuals of different sexes, although no third person existed in the world, as happened in the case of the common ancestors of mankind. It is the parent, not the child, of civil society. In civil society it becomes a civil contract, regulated and prescribed by law, and endowed with civil consequences. . . . It was natural that such a contract should, under the religious system which prevailed in Europe, fall under ecclesiastical notice and cognizance with respect both to its theological and its legal construction, though it is not unworthy of remark that amidst the manifold ritual provisions made by the divine Lawgiver of the Jews for various offices and transactions of life, there is no ceremony prescribed for the celebration of marriage.

At the Reformation this country disclaimed, among other opinions of the Romish Church, the doctrine of a sacrament in marriage, though still retaining the idea of its being of divine institution in its general origin; and on that account, as well as of the religious forms that were prescribed for its regular celebration as an holy estate, holy matrimony; but it likewise retained those rules of the canon law which had their foundation, not in the sacrament or in any religious view of the subject, but in the natural and civil contract of marriage.

This view is the one that is held universally in this country, and is now regarded as a firmly established American principle.
