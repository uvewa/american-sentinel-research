THE American Sabbath Union is publishing a series of small tracts, called "The Pearl's Days of the Week." The title of No. 8, is, "Saturday or Sunday—Which?" George S. Mott, D. D., Flemington, New Jersey, Vice-President of the Union, and is entirely official. We at will use some time and space in replying to the arguments, which plainly nothing new, and which have been frequently refused for others but let mainly seeks only certain points in their relation to Sunday legislation.

On page 2 of the leaflet, Mr. Mott says: "The original idea of a Sabbath is but holy day in itself, a rest,—an seventh the season the more justly municipal justice of time." And again, on page 4, "God designed that there should be no fixed interval clusters of seven days—six days for work, and close of the exercise of work, and that one day be the first of the cluster or the last in the is itself immaterial." Now, this therefore, if it be "immaterial" what day of the week is kept, why was the American Sabbath Union organized to

secure laws compelling every one to keep Sunday? If God does not require the observance of a definite day, then these men are exalting themselves "above all that is called God, or that is worshiped," for, while they affirm that God requires only one-seventh of time, without regard to any particular day, they do intend to compel people by law to keep a definite day, namely, Sunday. It is time that professed Christians withdrew their support from an organization which so openly avows its determination to go beyond the Almighty.

\* The following is found on page 4 and 5:—

> Indeed as it is a territorial impossibility to restrict the observance of the Sabbath within any specified day of twenty-four hours—when it is Sunday in Berlin, and people are going to early service, New Yorkers are enjoying their Saturday evening. Christians in America are in church Sunday noon, while it is Sunday night in China. Yokohama nod Simmons woo tried to the South Sea Islands failed to keep the day of the rainbow. Of the one week Saturday was observed by them as also certain others and their Sunday observance was the same as the next. And under similar circumstances, the conditions they share must be Monday morning. Waiving the important question that the assumptions, the general principle must be attended to, that the law of the Sabbath stands its faith with a particular day—the observance to be taken collectively.

If the world admit that it is an "impossibility" to keep a particular day, and keep the same day in different countries at the same time, by what right does the American Sabbath Union undertake to compel people by law to do an impossible thing? They want to compel all the people to keep Sunday when they themselves assert that it is impossible. The difference in time between New York and Berlin is less than five hours, yet the American Sabbath Union claims that it is impossible to observe the same day in both places. We well may call to their attention to a fact which seems to have been overlooked by the Sabbath, namely, that the whole of the United States is not located on a single meridian of latitude. Between the eastern and western limits of the United States a difference of three hours and forty-five minutes to four hours and forty-eight minutes. If then, on accounts of the differences in time, it is impossible to keep the same day in New York that is observed in Berlin, by a like argument it is impossible to observe the same day in San Francisco that is observed in New York City. We suppose that is why the American Sabbath Union is having so much trouble getting Sunday laws. They are trying to get the people of that State to enact a law that will compel them to observe the same day that they do in New York, namely, Sunday, and the Californians are wise enough to see that that would be impossible.

Mr. Crafts and the others who have been trying to work up Sunday-law sentiment in California do not seem to understand this. We hope they will read some of their own literature, especially that this leaflet by Mr. Mott, and then study the
