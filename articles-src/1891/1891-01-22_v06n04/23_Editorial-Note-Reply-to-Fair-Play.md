Fair Play, Sioux City, Iowa, quotes us as follows: "Homes in which moral instruction is not given are not Christian, even though the head of the house may publicly minister in sacred things," and then says:—

How is this? Does the able editor of THE SENTINEL mean to be understood as claiming that there is no morality which is not dependent upon Christian belief? Was there no morality antecedent to the birth of the man worshiped as a Saviour by Christians? Is there no morality to-day which is no dependent upon Christian dogmas? Or, are the above questions asked through a misinterpretation of THE SENTINEL's argument, the editor meaning to say, not that morality is impossible without belief in Christianity, but that belief in Christianity is not possible without morality? If the latter, then it seems legitimate to infer that THE SENTINEL holds that Christianity (and every other religion as well) is a moral cultus instead of an intellectual belief founded upon certain evidences more or less valid. But is the latter position one whit more defensible than the former?

The editor of THE SENTINEL meant just what he said. We believe that the highest type of morality is inseparable from Christianity, and that whatever is immoral is also unchristian. In an accommodated sense morality means outward conformity to the rules of propriety; but properly speaking only that is moral which is in harmony with the moral law, the law of God, and that takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
