The Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum are said to be disappointed that the evenings on which the Museum is opened, namely, Tuesday and Saturday, do not bring a larger attendance. There is plenty of electric light, and the pictures and statuary and other objects of interest can be seen to even better advantage than in the daytime. There seems to be a disposition to regard the workingman as an ungrateful sort of person, wholly unappreciative of the great things that the directors of the Metropolitan Museum have done for him.

Well, the workingman who has been working from seven till noon, and from one to six, does not feel much like going out, after his evening meal. He is a sturdy fellow as a rule, but there are limits even to his physical endurance, and it is no wonder if he feels too tired on Tuesday evening to go to the Museum. It is a wonder if he does not feel tired by Saturday evening.

But open the Museum doors to him at one o'clock Sunday afternoon, when he has had a good rest, and has perhaps been to church or early mass and then taken a little walk in the Park with his wife and children. See how he will fill the Metropolitan Museum then. See how the old masters and the modern masters and the casts of marvels of ancient and modern sculpture, will interest him. . . . That is the way it works in other cities where art museums are opened during Sunday afternoons. Messrs. Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, give the workingman a chance when he is fresh. Did it ever strike those of you who think you are trustees of "the Sabbath" as well as of the Metropolitan Museum, that the way to make it a perpetual and beneficent institution in a land of universal suffrage is to make man, for whom the Sabbath was made, not he for it, call the Sabbath a delight?—*New York Press*.
