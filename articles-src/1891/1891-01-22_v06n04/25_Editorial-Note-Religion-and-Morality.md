In answering the question, "What is the difference between religion and morality?" the Christian Union, says: "Religion is defined by Max Muller as being such a manifestation of the infinite as produces an influence upon the moral character of man. In a less generic but more practical sense, religion is the maintenance of such relations between the soul and God as promote life and character that are righteous. Accepting either of these definitions, there is evidently no true religion which does not promote morality, and, in our judgment, there is no permanent, enduring morality which is not rooted in and dependent upon religion."
