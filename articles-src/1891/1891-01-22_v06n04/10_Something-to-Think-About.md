ST. AUGUSTINE once said: "It is indeed better that men should be brought to serve God by instruction than by fear of punishment or pain of being punished, but because the former is a better the latter must not be rejected." And it would seem that a great many religious people and the present time are of the same opinion. For instance, a bill is before Congress for the purpose of amending the United States Constitution, that God may be recognized in that instrument; another to enforce Sunday observance—or the American Sabbath as it is called by its movers—though the Sabbath was peculiarly American and had no claim to have its birth. It before America was ever thought of; still another bill to enforce the observance of Sunday in the District of Columbia; and last the Edmunds bill for a national convention, where we would pressure from the bill, religion in its multifarious forms is to be established is thus pronounced.

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union has to a certain extent stopped temperance work to cry for religious legislation. Several organizations have been formed with that as their main object, and the Young Men's Christian Associations have, in some places, conventional formation full this foreshadowing role of making a country religious by law. Congressional Bosok will petitions in support of the various measures proposed; and now a body of military chaplains, having decided that the Industrial Exposition must be closed on Sunday because laboring men must have a day of rest, and it is important in this respect other results, so as to institute for them a Sunday or Sabbath-breaking European friends many range to visit them on that day.

Think what it means when like a joke in a conflict like ours, the last especially. One would think Chicago the last city in the Union to take as a model to show European paws how to behave on Sunday. But perhaps they imagine our foreign friends are accustomed to saloons, gambling and drunkards, and will be astonished in meeting in a majority of free churches. European temperance, when it refused to take any part in the guerilla of Sunday closing. Because the real issue, as they stated it, is saloon at the temperance question, and not in behalf of Sunday only.

action and of being. It is so. Now Testament commands men to live this way; and allows all they may not hold up as a something to be assured clear of "the Judaic Sabbath," since it is the Sabbath which alone has Old or New Testament authority, and which the Founder of this faith kept and bade his followers keep.

In the *Forum* of September, 1889, Mr. M. D. Conway, the well-known writer, truly says:—

> It is indeed the most fundamental and most difficult, of all reforms, is that which aims at having government to be informed justice, and not enforcer of the religious teachings of some sort; yet it is to preserve equality, not to give preference to any evil with many; that it is the rights and interests of individuals, not to enforce some person's ideas of education or philosophy on all.
