The First Methodist Church of Leadville, Colorado, publishes a complete programme of its Sunday and other services, in the form of a four-page weekly Sunday paper, which contains, besides the church notices, advertisements of various business houses in the town. The expense of publishing the paper is probably met in this way; but inasmuch as the Methodist Church is foremost in the American Sabbath Union crusade against Sunday papers, it would be well for its ministers and Official Boards to set a better example than does the First Church of Leadville.
