The pulpit and press, to a greater or less extent, in various parts of the country, are decrying the shameful character of the fact that the State allows so many divorces; and as done Dr. Schaff in his "Church and State in the United States," (page 69), call for "a reform of legislation in conformity to the law of Christ." But any such "reform" would be most decidedly a de-Reformation.

The principles of the gospel of Christ, as Jefferies says in his disquisitions on Christianity and the common law, were "intended by their benevolent Author for the happiness of man only in this life." And to enforce them by civil law is a shameful usurpation on the part of the State, and the robbers chasing Catholic Grant, for obedience to his precepts is to come from the heart, not to be a compulsory or a superficial and hypocritical obedience. It is no less the duty of the State to enforce the "law of Christ" on the question of divorce than it is on the value of the love of a sister nation, altogether, whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;" or of the covetous and injust presentations, which says, "And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also;" or of mediators of liberty, which says, "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." Think what a model Government if we would have, if, when a man turns his other cheek but been struck as the tale of the State, the Court should say, "It is a shame that a Christian country like ours should be filled with cases of prosecution for assault and battery; we will not give you redress; we will afford you no relief against the blow: you have been assaulted; turn to the agreement the other cheek, as the law of Christ says, and that law will be enforced by this Court." The absurdity of thus enforcing this precept of Christ must be evident to all.

But it is equally absurd to enforce the other or on the other points of divorce. Even the theocracy which punished Sabbath-breaking by death, and which was ruled by God himself, did not attempt to do it; much less should a secular government attempt to enforce religious edicts. The churches and would-be reformers of the land should work to make the causes for divorce, not to prevent divorce when the causes exist. It is much better for

[29] a sacrament; and the Roman Catholic and others still so consider it. "Marriage," declares that church, "is purely religious." But we have the resources and guarantees of the true religion. Flavors all of these were find not sanctioned by the church of the past and religion, but instead, let facts proved." And, as a noted writer says, "this is the legal and inevitable conclusion to which they carry, upon the assumption that marriage is a religious institution or sacramental." This conclusion, with all its disastrous consequences, is embraced in a formal decree by the Catholic Church. (For a record of the decrees of the Council of Trent, November, 1563.)

But these, however, was one of those which the Reformation reused to be seen and to signified fight. The view that it was an institution of the true religion exclusively was seen to be absurd, for it is an institution that exists in every nation under the sun. And that it is simply an agreement between two parties is evident from the fact that that was all that was possible in the time of the first patriarchs thereof. This very illustration was used in the leading case on this question, that of *Dalrymple vs. Dalrymple*, 2 *English Ecclesiastical Reports*, 463, the decision being written by Lord Stowell, one of England's most distinguished judges. In that case Lord Stowell said:—

Marriage, in its origin, is a contract of natural law. It may exist between two individuals of different sexes, although no third person existed in the world as it is the consent of parties that constitutes the contract of marriage. It is the parent, not the child, of civil society. Its civil society is a becomes a civil contract, regulated and prescribed by law, and endowed with civil consequences. In most civilized nations such a contract, solemn, under its religious, but not made so by the solemn act of religious ceremony, the celebrant before witnesses with religious ceremonies by clergymen was adopted, both in its theological and its legal connection, to mark its importance. But the marriage ceremony in the manifold parishes should seem more then by the divine truth of life, there is no ceremony prescribed for the solemnity of marriage.

This view is the one that is held universally in this country, and is now regarded as a firmly established American principle.
