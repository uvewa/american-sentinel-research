We print on another page an interesting article by Rev. John M. Kyle, of Rio de Janeiro, upon the "Progress of Religious Freedom in Brazil." This article first appeared in the Church at Home and Abroad, and subsequently in the Christian Statesman, though why that paper published it we are at a loss to understand. According to the Statesman's ideas Brazil is now atheistic. It is, according to Mr. Kyle, fully abreast of the United States in the matter of the separation of Church and State, and in some things has gone far beyond it.

Just what, if any, recognition of the divine Being the new Constitution contains, does not appear, but it seems very unlikely that it will prove at all satisfactory to ardent believers in what in the Statesman's vernacular is known as "Christian civil government."
