IN answer to a request sent to them by the Independent, for their views as to whether the Columbian Exposition should be open on Sunday, one hundred and nineteen members of Congress responded. Of this number, sixty-two expressed themselves as opposed to Sunday opening, fifty favored keeping the Exposition open on that day, and seven declined to express any opinion.
