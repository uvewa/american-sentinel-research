The Graphic congratulates THE AMERICAN SENTINEL on the celebration of its sixth anniversary. It is one of the most honest Christian publications in America, and its peers are very scarce. It has no ism but Christ, yet it defends Jew and Greek, Turk and Buddhist, from the Christian cranks who would set themselves against every other intelligence on this globe, Venus, and Mars, and all the other peopled and unpeopled spheres, as to a day of rest. THE SENTINEL has ennobled itself, and deserves fortunes for its good work.—*Colorado Graphic*.
