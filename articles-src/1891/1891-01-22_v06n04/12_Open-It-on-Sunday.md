THE Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum are said to be disappointed that the outflow on walks to the Museum is expected, namely, Tuesday and Saturday, do not bring a larger attendance. Thirty is not electric light, and the pictures and statues, and objects might expect at these same to even better advantage than in the daytime. There seems to be a disposition to regard the workingman as an ungrateful sort of person, wholly unappreciative of the great things that the directors of the Metropolitan Museum have done for him.

Well, the workingman who has been toiling overtime thus evening till nine, and turning out to six, does not feel much like going out, after his evening meal. He is a fairly fellow as a rule, but there are limits even

to his physical endurance, and it is no wonder if he feels too tired to spend Tuesday evening to go to the Museum. It is a wonder if he does not feel tired every day evening.

But open the Museum doors to him at nine o'clock Sunday afternoon, after he has had a good rest, and has perhaps been to church or early mass and then taken a little walk in the Park with his wife and family, and he will fill the Metropolitan Museum. See. But then show the old masters and the modern masters and the casts of masterful of ancient and modern sculpture, will interest him. That is the way it works in other cities where art museums are opening during Sunday afternoons. It ought to work well in the populous Manhattan, give the workingman a chance when he is fresh. It will ever strike those of you who think you are trustees of the "Sabbath" as well as of the Metropolitan Museum, that way to make it a perpetual and beneficent institution to give an opportunity for a chance to make man, for whom the Sabbath was made, not for it, to call the Sabbath a delight.—*New York Evening Post.*
