The charge of "godless" laid at the door of the public schools should be repelled, for it is troubling some weak consciences. Systematic religious instruction never has been and never can be undertaken in a country of free churches. England with her Established Church, has reduced religious instruction in her Board Schools to the minimum, and made this optional.

What of the much discussed exclusion of the Bible? Does not this indicate an infidel attitude? As a matter of fact the reading of the Scriptures, prayer, and singing is suggested as a fitting morning exercise by the statutes of every State. But in case these services are omitted, as they should be, rather than be allowed to furnish an occasion for Rome to strengthen her stays, may the schools then be pronounced "godless?" Do we stigmatize the cotton-factory or the saw-mill as "godless" because they do not begin with religious services? But where, apart from preconceived notions resulting from custom, is there any ground for discrimination? The religious instruction given in Germany and Austria is sometimes very formal and lifeless; so would it be with the simple service provided for our schools if, under all circumstances, insisted upon.

The Church should remember that her relation to education has changed. The direction of secular education, so far as primary and intermediate instruction is concerned has been assumed by the State; and the State should be allowed to provide for this in the manner that promises most successfully to accomplish the desired work of unifying a heterogeneous school population and fitting it for intelligent and loyal citizenship. The Church thus left the narrower field of caring for higher education, and her distinctively religious work, should bestow upon these more careful thought and intenser effort.—Principal Denton, D.D., in *New York Christian Advocate*.
