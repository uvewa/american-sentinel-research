One of the beauties of living under a Government that makes a difference in the treatment of its citizens on account of religion, is illustrated by the following from the St Petersburgh correspondent of the London Times:—

A Jewish lad of poor parentage went up as a conscript for military service in one of the districts of Mogiloff, and was rejected on account of ill health. The lad had no sooner returned home than it was reported to the Governor that the lad had been illegally absolved from service, and he was therefore ordered to be conducted many miles back to the recruiting office in the district town by etape, which means walking all the way. The lad's father managed to elude the police who had been sent for his son, and to take the latter back to the recruiting office in his cart, but on arriving there the lad was arbitrarily ordered to be walked back to his village, and then to be brought to the office again by etape. The boy, however, was again rejected as unfit for service, and the report to the Governor was proved to have been false.

Under the "atheistic" Government of the United States, such an outrage would be impossible, but under the "Christian" Government of the Czar, such occurrences are frequent. The moral is that Governments, as such, should know no religion.
