Not long since *The World* mentioned the appeal of the King from the Transvaal to the United States Court. "The appeal being taken," says *The World*, "upon the plea that such a statute is in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it abridges the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States," and then presents the following curious piece of political and constitutional wisdom:—

> If this proposition can be maintained it may be extended to a State-court as well as a United States Court, and it comes within the province of the State as well as of the Federal Constitution. There is, in fact, no doubt that the State has power to regulate its people. It reserves every day all valid and legal restrictions in personal liberty. These Sunday laws are bad, but the establishment of the right to pass them covers the "original package" question as well. The remaining question would be, therefore, whether the State should go on further. The same dilemma opens upon its State and the one the Federal Government touches him, the better for every individual and for our form of government.

How this proposition could be addressed to the State Court as well as the United States Court, it would be well for the *World* to explain—or rather it might be well for the *World* to explain how it thinks it could be addressed to the State Court at all. That provision of the United States Constitution is itself addressed to the States. It says, "No State shall make or enforce any law abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." The question of such a proposition can never arise except as between a State and a citizen of the United States. Those are the parties to the controversy, and yet the *World* presents the singular idea that the citizen of the United States is to appeal to the other party in the controversy for decision in his case. That is, one of the parties in this controversy is to be judge in its own case, and to decide for itself and for the other party in the constitutionality of the question in dispute! The *World* would introduce a queer system into jurisprudence.

Again, by the statement that the establishment of the right of the Federal Government to overturn State statutes would be worse than Sunday laws, it seems that the *World* has not yet learned that this right has been established by a constitutional amendment for the last twenty-five years. In fact it never was adopted as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It is the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that "No State shall make or enforce any law abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." That Amendment prohibits any State in the Nation from making any law having the effect named. More than this, it distinctly forbids a State from enforcing any such law already made, having the effect named. In a considerable number of the States this Amendment was adopted there are laws of long standing which did abridge the privileges and immunities of persons who now by this Amendment are made citizens of the United States, but from that time forth no one of these laws, no matter of how long standing, could be enforced. Therefore, by this Amendment it has been declared and established that the Federal Government has the right to overturn State statutes; and that the *World* at this late date should make such a remark as that, would imply that, in the matter of the Constitution, the [26] United States, that journal is not at all up with the times as its management in other directions demands that it should be.

It is true that the "original package" decision carried in a long way in the wrong direction, but that direction is not the one suggested by the *World*. Nor was it in one way that the "original package" decision carried as a long way in the wrong direction.

It is likewise true that the "lines the Federal Government touches him the better for every individual and for the Government." But the State which ought to protect him, opposes him in his religious rights that belong to men, that is, in his religious convictions, and then the Government must touch him in the exercise of the supreme protective power which it must possess for its own existence.

We can only say again that in the above argument the *World* sets forth a queer piece of political and constitutional wisdom. We would it would try again.
