The American Sabbath Union is publishing a series of small tracts, called "The Pearl of Days Leaflets." The title of No. 3, is, "Saturday or Sunday—Which?" It was written by the Rev. George S. Mott, D. D., Flemington, New Jersey, Vice-President of the Union, and is entirely official. We will not consume time and space in replying to the arguments, which present nothing new, and which have been frequently refuted for many years, but will merely notice two points in their relation to Sunday legislation.

1. On page 3 of the leaflet, Mr. Mott says, "The original idea of a Sabbath is one holy day in seven, i. e., one seventh of time." And again, on page 4, "God designed that time should be divided into clusters of seven days—six days for work, and one for rest and worship—and whether that one day be the first of the cluster or the last is in itself immaterial." Now, the question is, if it is "immaterial" what day of the week is kept, why was the American Sabbath Union organized to secure laws compelling every one to keep Sunday? If God does not require the observance of a definite day, then these men are exalting themselves "above all that is called God, or that is worshiped;" for, while they affirm that God requires only one-seventh of time, without regard to any particular day, they do intend to compel people by law to keep a definite day, namely, Sunday. It is time that professed Christians withdrew their support from an organization which openly avows its determination to go beyond the Almighty.

2. The following is found on pages 4 and 5:—

Indeed, it is a terrestrial impossibility to restrict the observance of the Sabbath within any specified twenty-four hours. When it is Sunday morning in Berlin, and people are going to early service, New Yorkers are shopping on Saturday evening. When thousands in America are at church Sunday noon, it is midnight in China. Years ago, English missionaries who went to the South Sea Islands failed to allow for the variation of time, and in consequence Saturday was observed by them as Sunday. And years passed before the error was discovered. And under similar circumstances now, the Sabbatarians would find themselves observing Sunday. We therefore assert that the assumption, to which so great importance is attached, that the law of the Sabbath stands or falls with a particular day—viz. the seventh—is not tenable.

If the world is so round that it is an "impossibility" to keep "a particular day," and to keep the same day in different places, why does the American Sabbath Union undertake to compel people by law to do an impossible thing? They want to compel all the people to keep Sunday when they themselves assert that it is impossible. The difference in time between New York and Berlin is less than six hours, yet the American Sabbath Union claims that it is impossible to observe the same day in both places. We wish now to call their attention to a fact which seems to have been overlooked by them, namely, that the whole of the United States is not located on a single meridian of longitude. Between the eastern and western limits of the United States a difference in time exists of about three hours and forty-eight minutes. If, then, on account of the difference in time, it is impossible to keep the same day in New York that is observed in Berlin, by a like argument it is impossible to observe the same day in San Francisco that is observed in New York. We suspect this is why the American Sabbath Union is having such trouble with California. They are trying to get the people of that State to enact a law that will compel them to observe the same day that they do in New York, namely, Sunday, and the Californians are wise enough to see that this would be impossible.

Mr. Crafts and the others who have been trying to work up Sunday-law sentiment in California do not seem to understand this. We hope they will read some of their own literature, especially this leaflet by Dr. Mott, and then they will be able to see the point. And if they believe their own assertion, that it is impossible for people in different longitudes to all observe the same day, we shall expect them from this time on to confine their operations to one particular longitude, which, since longitude has no width at all, will relieve not only California but every other place in the wide world from all danger of their unchristian work.

Thus the American Sabbath Union has once more sawed off the limb on which it sits, and annihilated every excuse for its own existence. This is characteristic of error. If they were preaching the truth, and their cause were just, their arguments would not collide with, and destroy one another. Truth never cuts its own throat, but error will generally stab itself half the time if it has a fair chance.
