THE thing most "godless" at the door of the public schools should be expelled, for it is troubling some weak consciences. Systematic religious instruction never has been and never can be undertaken in a majority of free churches. England with her Established Church, has compelled the Government to yield the Schools to the ministers, and made this the State religion.

What of the much discussed exclusion of the Bible? Does not this indicate an infidel attitude? As a matter of fact reading of the Scriptures, prayer, and singing is suggested as a fitting morning exercise by the statutes of every State. But in case these exercises are objected to, they should be, rather that he allowed to furnish an occasion for Rome to strengthen her stay, may the schools be pronounced "godless." Do we stigmatize the colony factory or the saw-mill as "godless" because they do not begin with religious services? But where, where apart from pronounced notions resulting from custom, is there any ground for the assertion? The religious instruction given in Germany and Austria is sometimes very flatly described as would be with

the simple service provided for our schools if, under all circumstances, insisted upon. The Church should remember that her functions have not been changed. The direction of secular education, so far as primary and intermediate instruction is concerned, has been assumed by the State, and the State should be allowed to provide for this in the manner best calculated to successfully to accomplish the desired result of qualifying individuals for useful occupations in the State to earn a good population and fitting it for intelligent and loyal citizenship. The Church has left the narrowed field of caring for higher education, and her distinctively religious work, should bestow upon those more careful thought and intense effort.—*Proceedings, a capital Thank the*, *D.
