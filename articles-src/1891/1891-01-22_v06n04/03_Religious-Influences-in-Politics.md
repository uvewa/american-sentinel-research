The *Irish Express* of January 2, has an editorial on the subject of ecclesiastical influence in political affairs in Ireland, which is worthy of careful reading and thought. Our contemporary, through a National Reform proclivities, says:—

The issue of Mr. Wisont Seely, the defeated candidate for North of Ireland, who said of his struggle "is a struggle for the Irish to manage Irish affairs after their own fashion," is about equal to the remarks of Parnell as he was leaving Dublin, admonishing men therein to that election to make brave and steady fight.

These papers where they catch one current or another are so unsatisfactory. We see nothing particularly that should be decided by such confusion to prove neither unfair principles nor compromise. For the coming election between Father McFadden and the nominee who does so the great promise for the Parnell forces is unduly taken.

Should Mr. Parnell carry out the idea of a political campaign, free from religious or ecclesiastical influence, and so secure in the Irish people the right in actual political practice, it would be a greater victory for the Irish, for the elevation of both wings, and will demonstrate that the Irish are fairly entitled to home rule as saying in as strong they showed all along and yet to the dictation of the Roman Curia.

The principle of English law applicable to the case of religious or ecclesiastical influence was plainly stated by the eminent Lord Justice Fitzgerald in a manner understood by every American. That eminent jurist

[26] in respect, the judge said: "He may not appeal to the fears or terrors or superstitions of those he should be address. He must not hold out the hope of temporal reward or loss of God's favor, nor must he resort to any form of temporary injury, nor of disadvantage or position or standing of the community. Neither may he, for instance, threaten to excommunicate or withhold the sacrament, or to expose the party to any other spiritual disadvantage. He must not obtain or influence partisan votes here on as divine or ecclesiastical punishments here or hereafter. But as the clergyman on no priest or divine or punishments here or hereafter, he may not violate the law considers him guilty of undue influence. And, indeed, in my opinion, a clergyman must regard his exercise with extreme jealousy, and he must not yield to pressure."

The principle, just in the same in this country, and should prevent the clergy of all denominations from participating in politics in their capacity as clergymen, a powerful church, the voice of whose members can be controlled by its priesthood, is a menace to free government, and the principle is just the same in the smaller communion.

The minister of religion should inculcate correct principles, should teach the right way in every walk of life, but when he attempts to coerce voters by threats of the Divine displeasure, or even to influence them in a certain direction by presenting them with his own or the church's dis­pleasure, he abuses his sacred office and manifestly is on the side of religious despotism. It matters not even if, in a given case, the minister's views are correct as to the better political course to pursue, the principle of taking any political course based on or inspired upon by free people upon that ecclesiasticism, as such, shall keep out of politics.
