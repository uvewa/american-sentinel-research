ON an active canvas was conducted in California on the Sunday closing question for most of the past year. In Oakland there was a strong, active Sunday-closing campaign. During the political struggle the Sunday workers did their best to get the candidates of the regular parties to pledge themselves to favor Sunday closing. Those pledges to favor Sunday closing in the Legislature is returns for votes. A Sunday-closing crusade was also conducted in San Francisco; but no matter what the methods employed in the latter place will be given here. Here we wish to call attention to the memorial which a National Reform element, that of the California Union, Christian Temperance Union, circulated for signatures, and presented to the City Council.

Mr. citizens of Oakland, respectfully ask you to use as we are citizens requiring all the saloons to be closed from an eleven o'clock Saturday evening until six o'clock Monday morning. Because,

1. Open on Sundays the saloons are seen the foe of the peace, and they lead hundreds of young men astray.

2. Saloon-keepers as well as others need the rest and the opportunities which the day affords.

3. Many industrious, temperate workmen are tempted by the ministers of the peace, and they lead our Monday morning police courts would not be so

4. Many industrious laborers, husbands and fathers, spend in these Sunday saloons modest stores of their earnings of the previous week. Thus, such saloons are robbers of poor families.

5. It is now but a few days and months more should be done on our weekly rest day.

6. It would do wrong to none, but good to all classes; and substation of the loss of crimes would be grateful to the Council.

Every argument in that memorial justifies the saloon on every day of the week but Sunday. The first proposition, that open saloons are "not needed" on Sunday. The first proposition, that others rest-day, grants that they may be, if they are not actually, needed on other days of the week. The second one, that saloon-keepers as well as others need the rest and opportunities which the day

[27] affords, argues that saloon-keeping is a worthy business,—so entirely worthy, in fact, that saloon-keepers should have a regularly recurring rest-day to recuperate their wasted energies,—so that they can carry on their work the other six days with more vigor and do the very best purpose. No stronger argument could be made in favor of the saloons and the saloon business on every day of the week but Sunday than is made in this statement by that portion of the National Reform Association, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

Number 3, is saying that Sunday saloons are schools of vice and intemperance by trying men, argues that the saloons at other times are not so. Number 4 to the same effect, and Number 5 emphasizes this argument. Note, it says that many industrious laborers, husbands and fathers, spend in these Sunday saloons modest of their savings of the previous week, and then declares that "such saloons are robbers of poor families." By this they distinctly and emphatically single out the Sunday saloon from every other kind of saloon, and they say that such saloons as that are robbers of poor families.

Without an open and justifiable defense of the saloon and all that it implies, it would be impossible to present a stronger justification of it at all times except Sunday than is presented in this memorial.

The non-partisan Woman's Christian Temperance Union, not only did wisely, but showed itself loyal to the principle of temperance, when it refused to take any part in the guerilla of Sunday closing. Because the real issue, as they stated it, is saloon is at the temperance question, and not in behalf of Sunday only. A. T. J.
