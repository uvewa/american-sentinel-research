Lately is a contest coming. Paternalism has been constantly encroaching on the rights of the people, and as a result those who most enjoy the fruits thereof, who enjoy their liberty the encroachments deny the existence of such rights. It is not surprising that they should deny also right to the encroachments so. But for the leading State organ of a political party to deny natural rights is too bold, is audacious.

The occasion of the words was the following excerpt from the speech of Hon. Roger Q. Mills, of Texas, at Staten Island.

> The individual existed before society, and society was formed by these individuals in the exercise of that—if state is differently, man existed before the state, and created the state as an instrument for securing to him such rights and powers as man confers upon it. Man owns a duty to this state in requiring of his efforts to be enforced by his own conscience. The government has neither reason nor conscience; man as its creation, it acts. They are parts of his animal organism.

In the last thirty years paternalism has been extending its boundaries and liberty has been contracting here. The Government has been providing the houses of it has at the right to provide everything right here. It includes the—

How long a man will work and at what time he is a-coming is for him to new determination. The law comes in and says that he shall do this in the decrease its production and also decrease labor, and the working people have got to raise it up to it, the thing people to raise money to appropriate to fairs, to improve rivers and harbors and do what it thought or needed. It regulates the practice of medicine, and if our paternalist could have it, would to promote rents of pay for its practitioners, and it is demanded by a great number and certain people that the Government shall lend money to the people and help them to live. Poll could hardly go further. The answer of democracy is all these invasions is that said government must stop at the boundary of natural right, that it need never them the power of government over the individual to force it and then we fight on the battle of life in his own way, and then he should be served by others, who show that clearly that liberty could only by possession, and only be maintained by authority and authority and the power of government.

These are second principles. They lay at the foundation of the American political system, and should be the guide in all governmental action. But the answer of each such national institution, including the paternalistic Detroit *Tribune*, to, under the heading, "A Modern Jefferson," in the issue of August 8, it for Mr. Mills and the principles asserted to be made, in the following style:—

> Here is the doctrine of natural liberty; the pet theory of political philosophers who are fond of quoting ideas of Thomas Jefferson, revised and adapted to the circumstances of to-day in discourses. The subscription is partial. Natural liberty is as explained figures. So believe in sovereignty, and nobody expects governmental policy to conform to it. Liberty is an artificial product. It is a gift of society or the State to man. Its limits are defined by the State. Its blessings are conserved by the same agency. This is the doctrine by which modern governments are administered; this is the doctrine by which modern legislation is framed.

Mr. Mills can not see with the estimates the current of events by the interpretation of the doctrine of natural liberty. The theories of modern democracies all run counter to the Mills view, that our constitutions emboss the rearranged Jeffersonian philosophy.

Here the principles of liberty and the principles of paternalism (or a better term would be despotism) are contrasted.

Mr. Mills (following the founders of our Government) says that government is the people's agent and "only has such powers as man confers upon it."

The paternalistic *Tribune* replies: "Liberty is only an artificial product. It is a gift of society, or the State, to man." Mr. Mills says: The agent or employer must get the powers from the employer—"society has only such rights as the individual confers upon it."

The *Tribune* replies: "Natural liberty is as explained figures."

Mr. Mills says: "Just government must stop at the boundary of natural right; it must secure that against every invasion."

The *Tribune* replies: "Few believe in [page 258] [national] liberty [sovranty], and nobody expects governmental policy to conform to it."

Mr. Crafts says to Mr. Mills: "In the last thirty years paternalism has been extending over your foundation and liberty has been contracting."

The *Tribune* replies: "Mr. Mills can not now rediscover the current of events by the interpretation of the principles of the Fathers."

And then as an unanswerable argument the *Tribune* contemptuously calls Mills a liberty "rearranged Jefferson philosophy."

Nevertheless, be it called "rearranged" by whatever names, it is a liberty in which the American people are grounded. May the understand to-day only pass by the paternalistic and rationalistic the life the intents that, if they could, they impart the Immortal Declaration of Independence in the dust, that would consign the liberties of the people.

W. F. Crafts, whose Chicago address made him at the "leader of Sunday legislation," has issued an "Open Letter to the Postmaster-General." In it he asks for postage stamps and deliver mail on the Sabbath except in "original packages" at the window.

As a specimen of sophistical logic, of the characteristics of "American" work, it is quite successful in placing the Postmaster-General in various apparently embarrassing situations to contentions. But in consistency in the standard, Mr. Crafts's grand stroke will most notably what the charges to be turned against him in all but methods; fixed things are not inherently in the method; when a great theme is under consideration with Mr. Crafts and that is the Sabbath observance, Mr. Crafts's letter is a "Julias" to the last degree. It "charge the Sabbath-breaker" equal to the Paroled. Under Judaism, when it had grown formal and powerful, the observance of the Sabbath was burdened with countless imaginary restrictions, wearisome, which were "tithes mint, anise and cummin," but which the Lord did not regard. And such is the law. Such are Mr. Crafts's charges against Postmaster-General Wanamaker. [page 259]

that he may sell postage stamps and deliver mail in the "original packages" on Sunday, but not otherwise.

Whenever one considers Mr. Craft's theory of "Sabbath reform" he must be given by noting its double-faced contrivance features. In one breath he claims that the civil law deals with Sunday as a "civil institution" only, and yet calls upon him to enforce any religious observance. Considering it as a civil institution, we take that two of its definitions given by Worcester may be applied to Sunday. The first and fourth are as follows:—

"1. Relating to a city or to a community or governed by laws; political; as opposed to military; political."

"4. Lay, as opposed to ecclesiastical."

"Lay," by the Postmaster-General should be complied by the Secretaries of Mr. Crafts "open" "reject" often to find back for repairs, he will undoubtedly seek the aid of the almost legal and political justice to this land in order to decide how the civil interests of the Nation are endangered by selling stamps or delivering mail on Sunday, otherwise than in the "original packages." And since the case is one for definition, we think that it would be well for Mr. Letters to inform the Postmaster-General just what is an "original package."

By the naivety of Mr. Crafts, but to answer to suggest that a letter addressed to John Doe is an "original package" which the writer commits to the care of the Post-office Department for transmission to him, and if it can deliver "original packages," it can deliver any letter or card without infringing upon this national Constitution, or endangering the public welfare. Since each such mail is an "original package," or so each man, to Mr. Crafts gives away the whole case, and the Postmaster-General is not yet convicted of doing anything "uncivil" on the "civil Sabbath." And further, each one is an "original package" for unit of value. And if this be so universally surely, a "sheet of stamps" would contain all demands, and it will take a content more technical than the average Talmuds to discover the "miracle" and nationally injurious character of a business transaction which is civil and right if one hundred stamps were sold at once, and wrong if one at once. When does a sale of stamps cease to be civilly right on Sunday? At seventy-five, at fifty, at twenty-five, at ten, or five? Where? Such questions are the essence of folly.

If we turn to the religious side of the question, and consider what Mr. Crafts or wants to call this "a religious Sabbath," it becomes more than Judiaistic. If he insists, let the civil element or to deliver one hundred letters or sell one hundred stamps? God forbids! great on the "original package" system? It must! But since the Post-office Department is not a religious organization, we suppose that the "religious Sabbath" can have no place in the constitution of that sole of the question.

The ultimate truth of the matter can be told in a few words. The civil law has not yet provided in the case, even of a "rest-day," except to provide for the general good, comfort and safety of the interests of the commonwealth. When the combined facts show that Postmaster Wanamaker's policy ignores the interests of citizens, or the Nation as a Nation, the civil law may be invoked. What men shall do with Sunday, or any other day as a religious matter, is not to be settled by results of civil law.—*The Outlook.*
