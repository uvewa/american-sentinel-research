From a letter received from Brother R. B. Bolan, of Illinois, we learn that the dragon spirit is being manifested in that State against those who "keep the commandments of God."

Brother David Longacre, of that State, has been arrested on the following charge:

Charges against David Longacre. Complaint of the county of Moson, and State of Illinois; at the end of the week a complaint, which the people to say, on this 18th day of July, A.D. 1891, of making an noise or a complaint with a loud voice, whereby at the said violated in the hearing the said one by their dues on the charge.

The arrest was based on section 252, of the Statutes of Illinois, which provides a fine for "committing a disturbance of any religious meeting" and "each person guilty of disturbing the peace of any private family. "By any noise, rout, or amusement," on the first day of the week, called Sunday."

The complainant failed to prove the charges, he himself admitting that Brother Longacre was not at the church but at his home, for it stood out and, step them, and not he knew, that was not and step them, and not he would on any other day.

Illinois has another case like Sunday law which forbids common labor on Sunday, but excepted "whosoever thinks proper to keep any other day as a Sabbath."

Failing to convict under section 252, Brother Longacre was found "guilty" in a trial held for the second section, and ordered to pay a fine and costs amounting to $17.00. The decision was based on section not, not referred to in the complaint, and which contains an exemption clause as follows:

Mr. Talmage had a visitor at the time the noise was not distressing. He was disturbed by Brother Longacre's working, and as Brother Longacre came past, called to him a few sharp conditions pieces, and asked if he was a heathen. One of the witnesses for the defence a resident, the decision he should [page 261]

not be disturbed by reasoning, for he swore himself, but he would be disturbed if any dog doing such at his house as Brother Longacre had done at his house. Mr. Talmage's hours.

All the prosecutions against Seventh-day Adventists have demonstrated that honest labor by a man who conscientiously keeps the seventh-day Sabbath is more disturbing than Mr. Talmage's or Sunday Holiness.

We would respectfully refer the case to the advocates of Sunday laws who tell us that intolerance is confined to the South, and would not manifest itself in the North.
