"THE Russian Government," it is said, "now consents to allow Baron Hirsch and his committee to act as agents for the colonization of the Jews, conjointly with a committee for the same purpose formed in Russia." That is to say, since the Russian Government has robbed the Jews of all their possessions, and refuses to allow them to live in Russia outside of prison walls, it graciously permits Baron Hirsch to assist them to leave the country. The Czar and his minions are, it is to be presumed, surprised at their own moderation!
