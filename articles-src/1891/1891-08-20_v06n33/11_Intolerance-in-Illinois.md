FROM a letter received from Brother T. B. Bolton, of Illinois, we learn that the dragon spirit is being manifested in that State against those who "keep the commandments of God."

Brother David Longnecker, of that State, has been arrested on the following charge:—

> Jacob Tidmore complains that David Longnecker, of the county of Macon, and State of Illinois, on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, to wit, on the 19th day of July, A. D. 1891, was guilty of making a great noise, screaming, and talking with a loud voice, whereby the peace of the affiant and his family was then and there disturbed.

The arrest was based on section 262, of the Statutes of Illinois, which provides for a fine of not more than twenty-five dollars for disturbing the peace of any private family, "by any noise, rout, or amusement, on the first day of the week, called Sunday."

The complainant failed to prove the charge, he himself admitting that Brother Longnecker was heard to speak to his horses, to start and stop them, and no louder than was necessary, nor louder than he would on any other day.

Illinois has another Sunday law (section 261) which forbids common labor on Sunday, but exempts "whomsoever thinks proper to keep any other day as a Sabbath."

Failing to convict under section 262, Brother Longnecker was found "guilty in that he had labored on the Sabbath," and ordered to pay a fine and costs amounting to $17.80. The decision was based on section 261, not referred to in the complaint, and which contains an exemption clause as quoted.

Mr. Tidmore had a visitor at the time he was disturbed, who was also disturbed by Brother Longnecker's working, and as Brother Longnecker came past, called to him with a blasphemous oath, and asked if he was a heathen. One of the witnesses for the plaintiff declared that he should not be disturbed by swearing, for he swore himself, but he would be disturbed by any one doing near his house as Brother Longnecker had done near Mr. Tidmore's house. All the prosecutions against Seventh-day Adventists have demonstrated that honest labor by a man who conscientiously keeps the seventh-day Sabbath is more disturbing than blasphemy or Sunday Saloons.

We would respectfully refer this case to the advocates of Sunday laws who tell us that intolerance is confined to the South, and would not manifest itself in the North. Brother Longnecker has appealed his case.
