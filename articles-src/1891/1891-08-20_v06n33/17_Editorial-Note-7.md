The Voice notes the fact that Mayor Grant, of this city, has declared in favor of Sunday liquor selling, and says:—

> This is done, evidently, to reconcile the liquor dealers who are exasperated with the President of the Excise Board, appointed by the Mayor. If prohibition is wrong in theory, and impossible to enforce six days out of the week, as we are so often told, we fail to see why it should not be equally wrong and impossible on the seventh day. The Sunday-open saloon is the logical result of the anti prohibition argument.

We have italicized a portion of this paragraph to call attention to a truth for which THE SENTINEL has always contended, namely, that Sunday prohibition is in the interests not of temperance but of Sunday as a sacred day. If the saloon business is legitimate six days in the week there is no civil reason in the world why it should be prohibited on the one remaining day. On the other hand if it is a civil evil on Sunday it is certainly just as great an evil on every other day, and ought to be prohibited on every day. The Voice is quite right on this point.
