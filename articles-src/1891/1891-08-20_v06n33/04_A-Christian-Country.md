Notwithstanding the barbarous persecutions inflicted by the Russian Government on those who do not accord with the Czar's definition of Christianity, the *Christian Statesman* still continues to call Russia a "Christian country." Let the devil label himself "Christian," and there will doubtless be found those who are ready to recognize him under that title.

But, after all, why should not the National Reformers recognize Russia as a Christian country, since Russia is simply carrying out those principles which they claim are essential to so-called National Christianity? They hold that a government is a "moral person," that it "must have a religion of its own, and exercise its own choice of a religion," and claim further, that it is the duty of government to compel all the people to submit to the national religion. In the issue of the *Christian Statesman* of October 2, 1884, is said:—

> Give all men to understand that this is a Christian Nation; and that, believing that without Christianity we perish, we must maintain by all means our Christian character.

Every week the *Statesman* prints the Constitution of the National Reform Association, in which it is proposed "to place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

And what do the Reformation propose is that true Christianity in the document with whom they refuse to accept what the institutions and usages of Christianity? The following from the *Christian Statesman* of May 21, 1885, answers the question:—

> We might add, in all justice, if the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land; and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, inhabit it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas, and then, if they can stand it they stay there till they perish.

This programme laid down by the National Reformers is precisely the one [page 259] which the Russian Government is following to-day. That country has adopted "a religion of its own," and is asserting itself "about religion's affairs" in the way that the *Statesman* declares every country must do. The Czar is giving "all men to understand that Russia is a 'Christian nation,'" and that he is determined it must "maintain by all means" its "Christian character." He has placed "all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of the government on an undeniable, legal basis;" and whoever dares to deny to hold to this is pretty sure to be sent to the "wild, desolate land" of Siberia, to stay there till he perishes.

The Czar and the National Reformers are exactly agreed as to what constitutes the right by reason of which the Christian character of a nation should be maintained. "Resistance" to some, and "desolate land" is the penalty for all those who refuse to submit to the government religion of God. This is the way they would do "for the inconsistent of Christ."

The *Christian Statesman* complains bitterly of the religious persecution in Russia, while, at the same time, it exists for the sole purpose of securing the introduction of a like system in our own Government. Let not its editors say that the United States would be different, for our government has adopted a false religion; for they hold that Russia a Christian in religion, they thereby assert that a nation's religion—the Christian religion—that Russia claims to have the Christian religion, and the National Reformers admit that it is Christian.

But further; if, as they affirm, it is the duty of every government in behalf of defining Christianity for its subjects, it necessarily follows that the definition given must be right by that country, for if there was any doubt about it, the Christianity could not be blamed for refusing to accept it, and the official decision would be without force. Submission to the authority is the decision of the government, and do as they please about accepting it. If there is no use for the government to make a decision; and if the government is to decide for, it is to decide, then its citizens are a right to question the decision.

Russia has made an official decision that true Christianity is the Christianity in the document of the Greek Church, and the National Reformers assert the right of government to decide in such matters. Why ought not to be the easiest to find fault with the decision.

This official Christianity, which Russia has made for the benefit of her citizens, is vindicated by it, has become almost identified with its not according to them some sort of authority in each matters. There is in this well the world older or superior to the people themselves—and the people do not hesitate to exercise this authority. Society is only the delegated authority of the individual.—*Chicago Clipper.* [page 260]
