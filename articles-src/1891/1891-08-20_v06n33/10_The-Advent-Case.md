The decision of Federal District Court in the case the celebrated Tennessee Seventh-day Adventist case is that it has no jurisdiction to settle the Constitution of Tennessee. Those of the members of the church some leading man in the country may remember, perhaps, was first made at the instance of the parties. Federal courts that they had no jurisdiction; and the whole area in which they are a Federal matter, or so remain under the Federal Constitution.

Briefly stated, the facts of the case: R. M. King, a respectable and hard-working farmer of Frosty County, was arrested and charged with being a Seventh-day Adventist. The members of the sect of Christians have peculiar beliefs; among their harmless theories concerning the second advent, is the commandment which says "keep" the Sabbath or seventh day of the week instead of the first day, the holiday observed by other denominations and made legal by the acts of the Church, which approve existing Sunday law in Tennessee are in most respects what is not well made. R. M. King crops recovered for two days in the week. He was arrested for a charge, his work done on the Sabbath, the day before. He was arrested for plowing in a field near his home. In the effective against him it was alleged that his work was on farm on Sunday created a public disturbance. On this entirely untenable ground he has [page 262]

bath-breaking is plowing a field on Sunday. He appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, and then to the Supreme Court of the United States being taken up by the Adventists and the National Reform Association of the American Sabbath Union of the State of New York. The decision does not so much traverse the subject matter of the case as it does leave it standing by reversing the decision below, not for want of a Federal Court to review the case of a conviction under a State law that is in direct conflict the decision, and it may he rests on Saturday or work on Sunday in such a way as to indicate thereby his religious views, and bad morals, and bad religion.

This is in marked contrast with the comments made by some of the religious press, and does credit to the *Independent.* We have some hesitation, however in saying that the *National Secular Advent* has anything to do with the case; it should have said the National Religious Liberty Association.

According to the Boston *Herald* of the last, an organization representing the earnest Young People's Christian Endeavor societies in Lynn has decided to adopt stricter measures respecting the enforcement of law on Sunday. The action, the *Herald* says, will be independent of the police authorities.

The committee, it is reported, proposes to secure warrants for two or three storekeepers who open their stores on Sunday, and make test cases of them. Members of the committee refuse to make their plan of action has been determined.

The city government was petitioned by the societies to enforce the law.

The condition of affairs in Lynn on Sunday, in fact, seems to be similar to that of Boston, a few years ago.

The *Christian at Work* of August 8 has the following:—

"Some little time ago we directed attention to the fact that the barber shops in most cities of this State until the adoption of the present Civil Service Code were free of Grant Statue. Every barber had a right to shave in the highway in front of his house, and stop all Sunday travel, though he uses a horse, a cart and delivery one horse only must be allowed to pass. And naturally the most; families are well able to come." [page 263]
