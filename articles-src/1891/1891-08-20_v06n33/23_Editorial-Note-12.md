THE New York Independent, of August 6, thus states the facts in the King case and comments upon the decision and the law:

"A case of which we have more than once spoken was decided last week by the United States District Court at Memphis, Tennessee. A Seventh-day Adventist, R. M. King, was convicted of Sabbath breaking in plowing a field on Sunday. He appealed to the Supreme Court of the State, and the sentence was affirmed. The case was then taken up by the Adventists and the National Secular Association, and appealed to the Federal Court, and argued on the ground that the conviction was contrary to the Bill of Rights of the State of Tennessee and the Constitution of the United States. The decision does not so much traverse the subject of the constitutionality of the law against Sabbath breaking, but it says it is not the province of the Federal Court to review the case of a conviction under process of the State law. The decision may be right, but the law which does not allow a man who rests on Saturday to work Sunday in such a way as not to interfere with the rest of others is bad law, and bad morals, and bad religion."

This is in marked contrast with the comments made by some of the religious press, and does credit to the Independent. Our contemporary errs however in saying that the National Secular Association has anything to do with the case, it should have said the National Religious Liberty Association.
