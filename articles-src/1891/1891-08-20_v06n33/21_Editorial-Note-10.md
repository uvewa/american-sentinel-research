REV. W. J. BUCHANAN, of Xenia, Ohio, complains in a letter to the United Presbyterian of July 23, that the railroads in the State are doing all they can to contribute to Sunday excursions. He says:—

"Railroad officials sometimes claim that trains are run on Sabbath only to satisfy the demands of the public. In many cases, however, these officials seem to be doing all they can to create a demand for "Sunday" trains. At different times during the summer the "C. H. & D." has scattered flaring hand-bills in the towns along its lines announcing special "Sunday" excursions to the National Soldiers' Home at Dayton, to Weedsdale Island Park, near Hamilton, and elsewhere. In large capitals the attractions are announced: Drum corps, boat races, boat riding by steam yacht, sail, or row boat, toboggan slides, merry-go-rounds, puzzle gardens, razzle-dazzle, swings, pony rides, carriage drives, donkey races, and "many other amusements for young folks." These posters are signed by officers of the road, the first name being that of the central passenger agent, who, no doubt, arranges the excursions for the money that is in them.

"To such an extent has Sabbath desecration been carried in our sister city of Dayton, that the best citizens there have recently organized a Law and Order society. Of their three hundred and sixty-two saloons, three hundred and forty were open either by front door or back, on the Sabbath. Of three hundred groceries, one hundred and fifty did business on that day. Of eighty seven meat markets, eighty supplied customers. All of the drug stores were open, and fourteen out of the nineteen photograph galleries. Eleven thousand "Sunday" newspapers were sold or distributed in the city."

Thus from every quarter comes the news of increasing agitation of the Sunday question in all its phases, of growing disregard of the day on the part of some, and of louder and more persistent demands for Sunday laws and their enforcement on the part of others.
