The decision of the Federal District Court in the now celebrated Tennessee Seventh-day Adventist case is that it has no jurisdiction to construe the Constitution of Tennessee. Those who have followed the progress of this highly interesting case in the courts may remember, perhaps, that the Republic asserted on the appeal to the Federal courts that they had no jurisdiction, and that the person who is being so grossly persecuted has no remedy under the Federal Constitution.

Briefly stated, the history of the case is that R. M. King, a respectable and hard-working farmer of Obion County, was prosecuted and fined for being a Seventh-day Adventist. The members of this sect of Christians have peculiar but perfectly harmless theories concerning the second advent, in conformity with which they "keep holy" the Sabbath or seventh day of the week instead of Sunday, the holiday observed by other denominations, and made legal by the act of Charles H., which survives as a Sunday law in Tennessee and in most of the other States. Not being able to leave his crops unworked for two days in the week, Mr. King plowed them on Sunday, after having kept the Sabbath, the day before. He was arrested under the Sunday law, and in order to make it effective against him it was alleged that his work on his own farm on Sunday created a public nuisance. On this entirely untenable ground he has been harassed from court to court. He was a poor man, but he has been supported by the friends of religious liberty from other denominations of Christians in and out of Tennessee.

The Tennessee Sunday law was inherited from North Carolina, where it existed before the Revolution as a Colonial statute. It had been in "innocuous demetude" for many years until neighborhood prejudice revived it in this case. Judge Hammond of the Federal Court holds that as far as his court is concerned the action of the State courts must be accepted as due process of law. The decision is sound from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution. The Constitution of Tennessee guarantees religious liberty and prohibits an establishment of religion, but the State is not restricted on this point by the Federal Constitution. If Seventh-day Adventism were made the established religion of the State by State enactment compelling all citizens to support it, the Federal courts could not interfere, as the clause of the Federal Constitution on this point applies expressly to the Federal Government and to that only.

Mr. King has been grossly wronged, but his only remedy at law is under the law and Constitution of Tennessee. It appears that for the present his remedy is denied him, and this being the case he has no better recourse than to submit to the oppression and go to prison—to the convict camp, if it suits the convenience of his persecutors to send him there. One such appeal as that to the sense of justice of a free people is worth more than all the law on the side of oppression.
