"THERE is war among the church members of Atlanta," says an Atlanta, Georgia, dispatch of the 10th inst., "because Mayor Hemphill allowed a gang of men to finish up some street work yesterday, which was necessary because the engine houses of the Fire Department were blockaded. Mr. Hemphill was elected Mayor by the influence of the church element. These people were shocked when they saw the men at work, and more so when they saw the written permission which the foreman held.

"The pastor of Trinity Church, of which the Mayor is an official, grew red in the face while denouncing the act, and had resolutions of censure passed. The most rampant of the resolutions, however, were those of the Walker Street Methodist Church which read: 'The action of Mayor Hemphill in granting permission to citizens of Atlanta under such circumstances to violate a State statute as well as disgrace a law of the Church of which he is an official member, is inexcusable, unwarranted, and criminal before God and man.'

"Mayor Hemphill says that under the same circumstances he would again grant the order."
