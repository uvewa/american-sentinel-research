The Union Signal, "official organ of the World's and National Woman's Christian Temperance Union," in a paragraph enumerating the feminine rulers in the governmental affairs of the world, closes its final sentence with these words, "And the great Republic has twelve million queens potential—to be queens actual soon, in Church and State."

These words, "queens in Church and State," were no slip of the pen. They are an open and ingenuous expression of an achievement to which the Woman's Christian Temperance Union confidently looks. It fully corresponds with the teachings of Miss Willard and Mrs. Bateham and other prominent women of the Union, both in their published writings and in their discourses at conventions and other public meetings.

That insignificant body of denominational aliens which really constitutes the National Reform Association, and from which its working force is drawn, furnishes the principles and lays out the line of work, but in the accomplishment of the final result the Woman's Christian Temperance Union will be a factor infinitely more efficient and successful. As Satan first approached Eve in the Garden of Eden with the lying assertion, "Ye shall not surely die," and the blasphemous assurance of the attainment of wisdom like to the divine; so now in his last struggle for supremacy over mankind, appealing to her religious nature to accept for Christ that temporal power which he refused for himself, "all the kingdoms of the world" and the glory of them, and for herself the queenship of Church and State, he deceives her again with the glamour of false religious hopes and flattering promises of the ascendancy of her sex.
