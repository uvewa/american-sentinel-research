It seems that those who circulate Sunday-closing, and Sunday-law petitions dislike to have them dissected. That, upon the outset, is not a recommendation for them. Truth says, "Handle me carefully, let me form, examine me." Error says, "Hide me, let me up in a napkin and lay me away."

No man, except a criminal, is in this country compelled by law to work. All that he has to do is to shut up shop, take a vacation or a day of rest. Men of wealth can of course afford to take more time for rest and recreation. Those of thrift and mercenary inclinations may take less than they are able to take. The Sunday-closing petition contemplates the forcing of all, whether willing, able or not, to take one day of rest regularly each week, and upon a certain day of the week. And why? Oh, it is said that some will not close up on Sunday unless they are compelled to do so by law, and they should be made to, so as there can others on in the same line that wish to, and unless all are required to close, those who close up will suffer by trade those who close up. So one man signs a petition to force his neighbor to close up when he wishes to close, so that he will lose no money by taking his vacation of days of rest. And what is that but supreme selfishness? What prompts to the act but a godly generous motive? The former could take his rest if he chooses to, but notwithstanding who chooses to keep at his business would be making some money, and he can't stand that, so he petitions. Who can fail to see that love of money is the ruling principle underneath the Sun- [page 257] day man who signs it and says he will not close unless others are made to close also, virtually confesses that his love of money is stronger than his love for his religion and his Sabbath.

And what shall be said of those professors of the gospel of Jesus Christ who urge men on in this scheme of selfishness, and thus encourage them in that which in Holy Writ is declared to be "the root of all evil" (1 Tim. 6, 10.) The religion of Christ teaches men to deny themselves, to set their affections on things above, not affections on things on the earth, but to set their affections on things above; not to love the world nor the things that are in it, but to seek first the kingdom of heaven; not to seek for the gold which perisheth, but that inheritance which is incorruptible, not to lay up treasures below, but to sell what they have, give alms and lay up treasures in heaven. That religion teaches men to deny themselves, take up the cross, and in the self-denial put them into something—the loss of property, the loss of friends, the loss of all things, even life itself, if need be, to win Christ and eternal life through him. But what kind of religion and moralism are the churches and advocacy of such petitions creating? We leave it to the candid reader if it is not a sheer incentive to worldliness and worldly gain, and an encouragement in the idea and that they "must be" secreted to the skin on every body else of man, as the saying goes that they'll not get a chance to. The whole thing is wrong from first to last; it is wicked to its very core, and they stop their legitimate work, and shall mess religious. Idleness if itself is an evil, and if all Sunday-closing petitions, Sunday ordinances and Sunday laws (at least those of to-day) they may be different by tool and type—that in so far as there mere worldly good—simply idleness. They are simply negative. They do not say what you shall do, but simply what you shall not do. But that isn't all that imply. Say what you may, while they prohibit all secular employment and recreation, they intend that you shall go to church and act religious, whether you are or not through [page 258]

for a century or two that chose has been cut off from them largely. But it is there in spirit is not in letter; for if after a man "to undertake to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever; what under the sun is left for him to be let for or said religious? There is absolutely nothing.

But the other Sunday laws didn't cost that feature. Charlemagne, who was Emperor of France, Italy, Germany, and many Hungary, in his Sunday law of A. D. 800, not only prohibited everything done to "needle-work," "shoeing sheep" and, "watching them openly," but also said, "but they shall all come to church, to magnify the Lord their God." But those of more recent dates, if they do not absolutely say it, put it in a more refined and back-handed way; as, for instance, the Vermont Sunday law which prohibits the employment being "present at any public assembly except such as is held for social and religious worship and moral instruction."

But the thing is there—the idea and intent of forcing men to be religious—whether it is concealed, kept in the background, travels about under simple cloaking, of what not. It is there, and the sooner we shall learn it first kind, and while learning from that that is not in accord with the gospel of Jesus, Church-going which may. "Whosoever will," and not "You must," said the fact that more than the only one heard commanding Sunday laws are ministers is strong presumptive proof that such people worship is of their nature and intent. In kindness and in endearment to all such we would say, To your pulpits and your Bibles? Christ rests enough the aid of civil power to enforce his religion, but to impersonate Peter and Paul this prayer.—*W. A. C.* *Bradford (Pa.) Era.*
