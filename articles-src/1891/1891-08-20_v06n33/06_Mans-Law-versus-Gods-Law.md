Having arrived at his decision in the celebrated Tennessee Seventh-day Adventist case it is that it has no jurisdiction to establish the Christianity of Tennessee. The decision of Judge Hammond of the celebrated Seventh-day Adventist King case, I find it laid down that man's work was to be stopped, even though it commands that which God has never commanded, and, it may be, has expressly commanded. The Judge says:—

> God, has not decreed that day of rest and worship between the six days of man's labor. He set it apart in due form by his law, for, not, it is not a mere human regulation. In the light of this it is just as well to violate such a law in the eyes of the world, as not maintained by faith, but just as criminal in law.

In another part of his decision Judge Hammond affirms that a law like the Tennessee Sunday law, which would compel Mr. King to rest on the first day of the week, does not invade the latter's conscience, since it is not any part of his creed, or of that of his denomination, that the fourth commandment requires labor during six days in the week. Now we say, Mr. King's conscience tells him on this point I do not know; but I think every candid person must admit that such a law, if not in conflict with what the fourth commandment enjoins, is in direct conflict with what the commandment allows, and therefore equally void and out of place upon the statute books of any State. The fourth commandment says:—

> Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work.

Now, if this language has any meaning it is a direct permission to man from the Almighty himself to perform work upon all six days of the week; and to say, in the [page 260] face of this, that Sunday laws are not obeyed by the seventh-day keeper on the plea that they do not require him to violate his conscience, is to ignore God's revelation to man, and invade a right which "no human authority should dare to interfere with."

When the Almighty has said with his own voice, "'six days thou shalt labor and do all thy work,'" when is the man or combination of men that have the authority to say, thou shalt not labor all six days? Mr. King ought to be at once released.
