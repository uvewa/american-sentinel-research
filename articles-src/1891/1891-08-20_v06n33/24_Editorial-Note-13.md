According to the Boston Herald, of the 5th inst., a committee representing the several Young People's Christian Endeavor societies in Lynn has decided to adopt decisive measures regarding the enforcement of law on Sundays. The action, the Herald says, will be independent of the police authorities.

The committee, so it is reported, proposes to secure warrants for two or three storekeepers who open their places on Sunday, and make test cases of them. Members of the committee refuse to state what plan of action has been determined upon.

The city government was petitioned by the societies to take action in the premises, but refused. The condition of affairs in Lynn on Sundays, its citizens claim, is no worse than in other cities in Massachusetts.
