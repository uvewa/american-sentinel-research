ON Sunday, July 26, while a congregation were worshiping in a country church near Osborne, Georgia, lightning struck the building and very seriously shocked a number of the congregation. If they had been playing baseball instead of worshiping on Sunday, doubtless the editor of the Christian Statesman would have been out by this time with a vociferous editorial, prefaced with bold type headlines, "A most striking visitation of Divine wrath on bold desecrators of the Sabbath day." We record these lines with the hope that they may come to mind when the ardent advocates for Sunday laws are tempted to write on such subjects.
