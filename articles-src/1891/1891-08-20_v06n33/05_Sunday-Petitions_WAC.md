It seems that those who circulate Sunday-closing, and Sunday-law petitions dislike to have them dissected. That, upon the outset, is not a recommendation for them. Truth says, "Handle me carefully, turn me over, examine me." Error says, "Hide me, roll me up in a napkin and lay me away."

No man, except a criminal, is in this country compelled by law to work. All are free to shut up shop and take a vacation or a day of rest. Men of wealth can of course afford to take more time for rest and recreation. Those of thrift and mercenary tendencies may take less than they are able to take. The Sunday-closing petition contemplates the forcing of all, whether willing, able or not, to take one day of rest regularly each week, and upon a certain day of the week. And why? Oh, it is said that some will not close up on Sunday unless they are compelled to do so by law, and they should be made to do so, as there are others in the same line who wish to, and unless all are required to close, those who are open will get more trade than those who close up. So one man signs a petition to force his neighbor to close up when he wishes to close, so that he will lose no money by taking his vacation or day of rest. And what is that but supreme selfishness? What prompts to the act but a purely mercenary motive? The former could take his rest if he chooses to, but somebody who chooses to keep at his business would be making some money, and he can't stand that, so he petitions. Who can fail to see that love of money is the ruling principle underneath the Sunday-closing petition? that the business man who signs it and says he will not close unless others are made to close also, virtually confesses that his love of money is stronger than his love for his religion and his Sabbath?

And what shall be said of those professors of the gospel of Jesus Christ who urge men on in this scheme of selfishness, and thus encourage them in that which in Holy Writ is declared to be "the root of all evil?" (1 Tim. 6, 10.) The religion of Christ teaches men not to set their affections on things on the earth, but to set their affections on things above; not to love the world nor the things that are in it, but to seek first the kingdom of heaven; not to seek for the gold which perisheth, but that inheritance which endureth; not to hoard up treasures below, but to sell what they have, give alms and lay up treasure in heaven. That religion teaches men to deny themselves, take up the crosses, and let their religion cost them something—the loss of property, the loss of friends, the loss of all things, even life itself, if need be, to win Christ and eternal life through him. But what kind of moral stamina can the circulation and advocacy of such petitions be creating? We leave it to the candid reader if it is not rather an incentive to worldliness and worldly gain, and an encouragement to men to think that they must "be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease," or else decide that they will not go there at all.

The whole thing is wrong from first to last. It is not even civil to force men to stop their legitimate work, and much less religious. Idleness of itself is an evil, and that is all Sunday-closing petitions, Sunday ordinances and Sunday laws (at least those of to-day; they may be different by and by) teach—that is so far as their mere wording goes—simply idleness. They are simply negative. They do not say what you shall do, but simply what you shall not do. But that isn't all they imply. Say what you may, while they prohibit all secular employment and recreation, they intend that you shall go to church and act religious, whether you are or not, though for a century or two that clause has been left out of them largely. But it is there in spirit if not in letter; for if after a man has been "forbidden to perform any worldly employment or business whatsoever," what under the sun is left for him to do but to be (or act) religious? There is absolutely nothing.

But the older Sunday laws didn't omit that feature. Charlemagne, who was Emperor of France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Hungary, in his Sunday law of A. D. 800, not only prohibited everything down to "needle-work," "shearing sheep" and "washing linen openly," but also said, "but that they all come to church to magnify the Lord their God." But those of more recent date, if they do not eliminate this, put it in a more refined and back-handed way; as, for instance, the Vermont Sunday law which prohibits any person from being "present at any public assembly except such as is held for social and religious worship and moral instruction." But the thing is there—this idea and intent of forcing men to be religious—whether it is concealed, kept in the background, travels about under sheep's clothing, or what not. It is there, and the people may as well learn it first as last, and while learning learn that that is not in accordance with the gospel of Jesus Christ, which says "Whosoever will," and not "You must." And the fact that about the only ones heard championing Sunday laws are ministers is strong presumptive proof that such laws are religious in their nature and intent. In kindness and in earnestness to all such we would say, To your pupils and your Bibles! Christ never sought the aid of civil power to enforce his religion, but to impetuous Peter said, "Put up thy sword."
