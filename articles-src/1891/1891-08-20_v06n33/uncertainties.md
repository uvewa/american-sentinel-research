# Uncertainties Log - v06n33 (1891-08-20)

## OCR Quality
The OCR transcription from Mistral was generally clear and legible. The following items were noted:

### Page 4, "Causes Which Led to the French Revolution" article
- **Transcribed as:** "hey did not begin with themselves"
- **Likely intended:** "they did not begin with themselves"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear OCR error (missing 't')
- **Action taken:** Transcribed as appears in OCR to preserve accuracy

### General Notes
- The OCR source contained standard page headers ("THE AMERICAN SENTINEL", page numbers) which were ignored per instructions
- Image references (e.g., "![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)") were ignored as instructed
- Advertisement sections at end of issue were skipped (book advertisements for "Sacred Chronology" and patriotic songbook)
- Subscription information at bottom of page 8 was not transcribed as it is boilerplate publication information

### Author Attribution Notes
- **Thomas M. Lane (TML)** - New author initial not previously in known authors list. Letter signed at end.
- Several articles had clear reprint attributions from other publications (The Outlook, Review and Herald, New York Times, San Francisco Examiner, St. Louis Republic, Kansas City Journal)
