# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, August 20, 1891 (Volume 6, Number 33)

## General Note

This issue presented **extreme difficulty** in OCR transcription due to the scan quality. The images are low resolution with very small, dense print across three-column layouts. Pages 1-3 (pages 257-259) are particularly problematic, with numerous passages that could not be read with confidence. Many phrases and sentences throughout the transcriptions represent best-effort readings rather than confident transcriptions.

**A full human review against higher-resolution scans is strongly recommended for this entire issue.**

**Recommendation:** This entire issue requires re-transcription from higher-resolution scans. The current transcriptions preserve article structure, frontmatter categorization, and the general content of each piece, but many specific passages contain errors due to the scan quality limitations. The images provided (/tmp/as1891n33-1.png through /tmp/as1891n33-8.png) are low resolution with very small, dense three-column print that makes word-by-word accuracy impossible for many passages.
