The *Union Signal*, "official organ of the World's and National Women's Christian Temperance Union," in a paragraph enumerating the feminine rulers in the governmental affairs of the world, closes the final mention with these words, "And the Best Republic has twelve million women potential—to be queens actual some in Christian grace did say."

This word, "queens in Church and State," were no slip of the pen. They are an open, frank, ingenuous expression of an achievement to which the Woman's Christian Temperance Union confidingly looks. It is fully correspond with the teachings of Miss Willard and Mrs. Bateham and other prominent women of the Union, both in their published writings and in their discourses at conventions and other public meetings.

This insignificant body of denominational alone which really constitutes the National Reform Association, and than which its working force is drawn, furthermore of the other women that in its line of work, but in the accomplishment of the final result the Woman's Christian Temperance Union with its factor of a faintly more efficient and succeed. As Satan first approached Eve by the Gates of Eden with the lying assertion, "ye shall not surely die," and then the plauseous assurance of the attainment of visions too for the divine; so now in his last strongwork more successful, march, approaching to her religious nature to accept for Christ the temporal power is to be refused for himself; "all the kingdoms of the world" and "the glory of them," or—for herself the queenship of Church and State, to deceive her again with the glamours of false religion upon false and flattering promises of the ascendancy of her sex. [page 262]

"Education alone makes men neither moral nor religious. The remedy is to be found in the family and in the denominational school. Fathers and mothers, in the early years of childhood, must do the work of religious instruction and training.

THE official order to close the Barge Office—the present landing place for immigrants to this city—on Sundays, was received from Washington on the 13th inst., and went into effect on the 16th. Immigrants arriving too late to land on Saturday must now remain on shipboard till Monday.

"The Russian Government," it is said, his committee to so as agents for the collectation of the Jews, completely with a committee a means that the same purpose formed in Russia." That is to say, since the Russian Government has robbed the Jews of all their possessions, and refuses to let them live in Russia outside of prison walls, it graciously permits Baron Hirsch to send them to outside parts. The Czar and his ministers are, it is to be presumed, surprised at their own moderation!

"THERE is war among the church members of Atlanta," says an Atlanta, Georgia, dispatch of the 10th inst.,—"because Mayor Hemphill allowed a gang of men to finish up some street work yesterday, which was necessary because the engine house of the Fire Department were blockaded. Mr. Hemphill was elected Mayor by the influence of the church element. These people were shocked when they saw the men at work, and more so when they saw the written permission which the foreman held."

"The pastor of Trinity Church, of which the Mayor is an official, grew red in the face while denouncing the act, and had resolutions of censure passed. The [page 261]

most support of the resolutions, however, were those of the Walker Street Methodist Church which read: 'The action of Mayor Hemphill in granting permission to citizens of Atlanta under such circumstances to violate a State statute as well as a disgrace a law of the Church of which he is an official member, is intentional, unwarranted, and criminal before God and man.'

"Mayor Hemphill says that under the same circumstances he would again grant the same order." [page 264]

The Protestants and Roman Catholics of a faith representative of Montreal are in agreeable in gatering the proper observance of Sunday. According to their various from thus immemorial and in consequence with the teaching of their religion advises Roman Catholics he per think it important to indicate by dumping, ball playing, or other similar forms that they are not working. The Protestant residents, in this case, have determined to secure enforcement of the law, friendly of this kind.

That notice the fact that Mayor Grant, of this city, has declared in favor of Sunday liquor selling, and any opposition.

"To such an extent has Sabbath desecration been entered in one outer city of Hartford, that the best citizens there have recently expounded a Law and Order League. . . . Last Sunday a number of grocers, mostly, slightly muffled contrivance. All of the drug stores and three groceries were closed, and one store either by front door or back, on the Sabbath. Of the thirteen groceries, not one did their business. Soda lots, slightly muffled contrivance. All of the drug stores and three groceries were closed, and the most of the drug stores, let closened "Sunday" Photograph galleries. eleven thousand 'Sunday' newspapers were sold as distributed in the city."

Thus from every quarter comes the news of increasing agitation of the Sunday question is all its phases, of growing disregard of the day on the part of some, and of bolder and more repressive measures for Sunday laws and their enforcement on the part of others.

*Providential* asks: "What does the Sacred Scriptures mean by saying, 'One day out of seven should be observed as a day of worship or recreation, according to the decision of a person's own conscience, and that day should be Sunday'?" [page 264]

It means this, that the *Scriptures* doesn't care a cent what day is observed only if it is Sunday.

In answering questions of Chattanooga, the other day, on woman suffrage, Dr. Buckley, editor of the *Christian Advocate* said:—

The majority of the advocates of modern spiritual movement. The same is true concerning Christian missions. women who would be in the world most active to crush the infidel. One of the gravest incidents coming from the woman suffrage movement was the fact that its best known representative, when speaking in a foreign country of the evils which would be cured should women have the suffrage, to correct the wrongs with the prevailing spirit. Women mobbed her to correct the evils—much would have been accomplished.

The Doctor might have added that few women are doing more than men to further religious legislation in this country.

REV. J. J. MYRA, District Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in Iowa; at Des Moines he said that he was asking for a civil and not a religious Sabbath; and claimed that all Sabbath laws are civil because the courts have said so.

The eighth annual report of the Kings County Sunday Observance Association urges upon individuals the duty of requiring public officials to execute the Sunday laws of the State for the protection of a community as a religious but a civil institution.

At the last annual conference of the National Reform Association in Washington a resolution was publicly passed to expunge the expression "civil Sunday" from their vocabulary. They would naturally follow, of course, that the line of thought and argument for which that expression stands came also in their charge.

It is evident that the American Sabbath Union, with its different branches, is still at variance with the mother association on this as a matter of policy, although their close affiliation proves that they [page 264]

have no difference in principle. In this the National Reform Association, like the ancient prototype of the Old World, is certainly consistent.

In his address before the late Temperance Congress held in this city, Mr. Crafts said:—

> Make laws for the observance of Sunday—the one day necessary for the laboring man to be secured for that, one of the last vestiges of religious liberty which we can claim: complete separation of church and state.

THE SENTINEL has no sympathy for the liquor traffic and no apology to make for the advocates of saloons. It does, however, insist that prohibition to be effective must not be limited to one of the whole days. Such limitation places prohibition upon a religious basis. It fosters a religious institution, more than in retaliating at a civil resty, but as is clearly indicated by the Archbishop's claim of the whole purposes of Sunday closing laws to enforce the observance of Sunday is not on Sunday.

Sunday is not so careful to conceal the real nature underlying the demand for Sunday laws are any lax American Sabbath Union friends.

Their purpose is to exalt Sunday more than it is to promote temperance and he is not asked to let be let in the way to that of the Archbishop is more candid or has more sense than those who allege the Sunday laws advices is not for me to decide; penalty be in its faith.

On Sunday, July 19, while a congregation were worshiping in a country church near Collins, Georgia, a lightning struck a building and very markedly shocked a number of the congregation. If they had been two at the workshop instead of worship on Sunday, doubtless the editor of the *Christian Statesman* would have noted it by this time with a vociferous editorial, protest and with large type, stating that violation of holding of Divine wrath in bold desertion of the Sabbath day."

Reversed them times will the hope page they may come to mind when the ardent advocates of such laws are tempted to write on such subject.

COTTAGE CITY, Dukes County, Massachusetts, is another eloquent resort that is suffering from the rigid enforcement of a Sunday law. The small dealers of the place are there greatly, but the authorities have determined.

Trim Junior Order of United American Mechanics of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, passed at its a name "is often school and re-echoed at different time and places at different meetings. But some people still think there is more in a name than there is in a mass. They take my delight us to the conclusion of Church and State if it can only be accomplished within the reach. They have so accomplished since. They have so accomplished in complying Sunday laws—the direct heritage of Church and State of the "civil" Sunday or the "American Sabbath." Although all our Sabbath traditions came down from an exclusively religious source, and although actually Sunday as went named it after the sun, others, woman festival it was, yet to-do-day we are told of it we'll every refusal that one call this an "American" or "civil" that changes the whole character of it.

It seems that these modern Sunday-law advocates are as much mixed as to facts, as was good old "Uncle Moon," of Deshares, who told this story: The man from the distance, who has. Free from others the following anecdote:—

"Well, Uncle Moon," said a man, "I hear you have another pair of shoes." "Shoes, Massa, you has them."

"Yes, Moses, yours was the horse, you know."

"Hoss!" named the puzzled "the dog, little wasn't he?"

"How?" named him you did say he was?

"Yass, boss; I done named 'em oafah two do 'da foot predestination," he was told.

> Landed! "What is that?"

> "*De Chrisfol Christians of Julayan children of dis Nation, we want a nation de chillen of its* presidential to our homes."

The ecclesiastical world has one long formed man into a false position that it has become almost hereditary with its not according to them some sort of authority in each matters. There is in this well the world older or superior to the people themselves—and the people do hesitate to exercise this authority. Society is only the delegated authority of the individual.—*Chicago City dispatch.* [page 264]
