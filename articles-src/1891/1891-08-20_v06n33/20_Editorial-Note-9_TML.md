Poplar Bluff, Mo., August 6.

EDITOR SENTINEL:—There is a man here by the name of John Harbin, alias William V. Harbin, who has been convicted of murder in the first degree, and is sentenced to be hanged on the 21st day of this present month. John L. Kennedy, a prominent attorney of Nashville, Tennessee, a former acquaintance of Harbin's, is here circulating a petition to have Harbin's sentence commuted to life imprisonment. After Attorney Kennedy had stated his business to the writer, he was told that it was altogether right for him to intercede for executive clemency for the man that he had known under more favorable circumstances, and as a law abiding citizen. He said, "I always do it at home." The writer called his attention to the recent oppressive decision rendered in his State in the R. M. King case; at the same time took up the St. Louis Republic and read the account of the decision recently handed down by Judge Hammond, of United States District Court of Memphis, Tennessee. Mr. Kennedy said: "I would not think of interceding for executive clemency in such a case as that; that man broke the Sabbath which is the foundation of our Government or at least, the Christian religion is the groundwork of our civil institutions."

This shows the extent to which this religious prejudice and persecuting spirit has obtained in Tennessee. Harbin is a murderer, he intercedes for him, he always does it at home, but King plowed on Sunday, he would not think of interceding for a man like that.
