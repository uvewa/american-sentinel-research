IN answering questions at Chautauqua, the other day, on woman suffrage, Dr. Buckley, editor of the Christian Advocate of this city, said:—

> The majority of the advocates of modern spiritualism are women. Nine out of ten mediums are women. The same is true concerning Christian science. In all the false religions of the world women are in the ascendancy. The biggest political mistake ever made in the world was the endorsement of a third or Prohibition party by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The Mormons were the first to grant woman suffrage, for they know that women would stand up for polygamy. There's a great similarity between women and music. Both will help a circus, a cathedral, or an army. Women are always in sympathy with the prevailing spirit. Women mobbed John Wesley in Ireland, while others were willing to die for him.

The Doctor might have added that women are doing more than men to further religious legislation in this country.
