REV. J. P. MILLS, District Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in Iowa; at Des Moines he said that he was asking for a civil and not a religious Sabbath; and claimed that all Sabbath laws are civil because the courts have so decreed.

The eighth annual report of the Kings County Sunday Observance Association urges upon individuals the duty of requiring public officials to execute the Sunday laws of the State for the protection of Sunday, not as a religious but a civil institution.

At the last annual conference of the National Reform Association in Washington a resolution was publicly passed to expunge the expression "civil Sunday" from their vocabulary. It would naturally follow, of course, that the line of thought and argument for which that expression stands must also go with it.

It is evident that the American Sabbath Union, with its different branches, is still at variance with the mother association on this as a matter of policy, although their close affiliation proves that they have no difference in principle. In this the National Reform Association, like its ancient prototype of the Old World, is certainly consistent.
