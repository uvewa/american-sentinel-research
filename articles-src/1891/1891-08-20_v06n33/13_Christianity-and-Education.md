The question is whether Christianity shall be taught in the public schools, and, if so, what Christianity and how much. Toward the answer to this question the assertion that Christianity is part of the law of the land takes us a very little way. In England, from which our courts have borrowed the expression, it has a definite meaning. It means Christianity as formulated by the Established Church of the country, even including the denunciation in the Articles of the "vain talk" of "certain Anabaptists." Where the Church and the State are one, the doctrine taught in the State schools is the doctrine of the Church. But how does it help us in considering whether the common schools shall give religious instruction to be told that Christianity is part of the law of the land? No law book lays down what the Christian doctrines are in which courts have a judicial belief, or what doctrines are essential and what unessential. The judges who have delivered the doctrine have been compelled to generalize it. One of the most impressive statements of it, that quoted by Mr. Jay from Daniel Webster, is also one of the vaguest: "Christianity, Christianity independent of sects and parties, general, tolerant Christianity, is the law of the land."

This is doubtless impressive, but it scarcely affords the material for a curriculum of religious instruction in the secular schools. Where is "Christianity independent of sects and parties" to be found? Suppose we admit that general, tolerant Christianity should be taught in the common schools, though no other part of the law of the land is so taught, where is unsectarian Christianity to be found? Is there any Christian authority which is not also a sectarian authority? The Methodist pastor and the Catholic priest might admit each other to be Christians, though each of them would probably have so many qualifications to make that the Christianity of the other would appear to be as unimportant as it was general. Each of them, at any rate, professes and calls himself a Christian, and each would have as good a right as the other to say how much Christianity and what Christianity the common schools should teach. Everybody knows that they would not in the least agree about it, even though they professed to make it as "general" as possible. The Roman Catholic would insist that "the simple reading of the Scripture without note or comment," which seems to be the ultimatum of the evangelical Protestants, was either too much or too little, and certainly was not a proper teaching of general Christianity. We can imagine the horror, on the other hand, with which the Methodist would recoil from any scheme of religious instruction that the Roman Catholics would propound.

As there is, practically speaking, no unsectarian Christianity, the only resource would be to invite all the Christian sects to unite in preparing a suitable course of religious instruction, and this it is certain that they could not agree upon. Yet their rights as citizens are precisely the same. Anglican Christianity is part of the law of England, but no American court has yet decided that either Protestantism or Catholicism is part of the law of this country, any more than any court has denied that both Protestantism and Catholicism are entitled to be considered forms of Christianity. Yet no religious instruction can be given in the schools upon which Catholics and Protestants will agree, although all Catholics and a limited number of Protestants agree that some religious instruction should be given. If the majority of the voters could be brought to this opinion, the division of the school fund which the Roman Catholics desire would be the natural solution of the difficulty. We believe, and we believe that a majority of the voters believe, that this would be a grievous public calamity. The only way to avert it is to hold that the instruction of the common schools should be exclusively secular, and that anybody who insists upon the necessity or desirableness of adding religious instruction to it shall be at liberty to add it in his own way and at his own cost, but not in the common schools nor at the cost of the taxpayers. A man whose money is taken from him by the State to administer religious instruction which he disapproves is certainly not in the enjoyment of the religious liberty guaranteed to him by the Constitution. To quote, in justification of this abstraction, that Christianity is part of the law of the land is idle, meaningless, and exasperating.
