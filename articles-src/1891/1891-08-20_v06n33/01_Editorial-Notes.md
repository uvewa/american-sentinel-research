If the Lord himself could have secured morality or righteousness by law, he never would have needed to send the gospel. Therefore, as the Sunday-law workers have wedded themselves to a scheme of making men moral by law, the proper and consistent thing for them to do, is to utterly repudiate the use of the gospel.

No man can ever get right of making the basis of any plea on ecclesiastical or canonical favor, nor the ground of any complaint of governmental discrimination. If there is not enough good in the religion to pay him for professing it then there is not enough to pay the government for establishing or professing it in whatever.

That which is the Lord's, rests only between the man and God, and if any man does not render it to God, he is responsible only to God, and not to any man, nor to any set of men. And no man is to render for his failure or refusal any account but to God; and no man has the right to punish any man for his failure or refusal to render to God that which is God's—that is the place of God.

A day of weekly rest in itself is no indication of God. The basis is the rest of God, which was wholly spiritual. Its purpose is to cultivate the spiritual in man. Its authority is the commandment of God which is spiritual and religious, and which must be religiously and spiritually be observed to be observed at all, says the seer of Patmos, "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." The whole subject, therefore, in all its bearings is entirely beyond the jurisdiction and even the reach of the power of civil government or of man. It rests wholly in the power and jurisdiction of God, and remains solely between the individual and God. [page 257]
