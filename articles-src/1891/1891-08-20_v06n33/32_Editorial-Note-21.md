Freethought asks: "What does the Merced Express mean by saying, 'One day out of seven should be observed as a day of worship or recreation, according to the dictates of a person's own conscience, and that day should be Sunday?'"

It means this, that the Express doesn't care a cent what day is observed only so it is Sunday.
