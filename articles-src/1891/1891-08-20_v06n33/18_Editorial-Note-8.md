The persecution of a Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee because he worked in his field on Sunday is a singular proceeding for an American State. Nobody pretends that this victim of religious intolerance was disturbing his neighbors. He was plowing on his own land at a distance from any place of worship, but under a medieval law such as certain misguided Californians have sought to introduce here he was arrested, fined, and from present appearances will be compelled to concert with criminals in jail.

A local contemporary thinks that Tennesseeans have a right to wreak religious bigotry on minorities in this fashion, and that if the members of the minority do not like it they can do as the Jews are doing in Russia—give up their homes and leave. That is not the common idea of American liberty. The principle at the root of our Government is that every man has a right to do as he pleases so long as he does not infringe the rights of anybody else. The attempt to confine a Seventh-day Adventist to five days' work a week when other people are allowed to work six is a discrimination so unjust that it ought to make a Tennesseean ashamed to acknowledge his State.

At this moment there are probably hundreds of murderers in Tennessee who have never been molested. It is safe to say that among the ultra-pious neighbors who have insisted upon imprisoning an otherwise blameless man because he kept his Sabbath instead of theirs, there are some who have taken their guns to church and can look back upon feuds maintained by assassination. The State itself, whose laws make criminals of those who divide the week in the way laid down on Sinai, is guilty of keeping up the infamous convict lease system, which has been simply a scheme of wholesale murder for gain, and now has brought the commonwealth to the verge of civil war.

Californians have much to be thankful for, but nothing more than that they live in a community in which people mind their own business, each disposing of his time as he sees fit and allowing his neighbors to do the same.
