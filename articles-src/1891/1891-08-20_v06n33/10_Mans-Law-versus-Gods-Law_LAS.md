EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: In the recent decision of Judge Hammond in the celebrated King case, I find it laid down that man's law must be obeyed even though it commands that which God has never commanded, and, it may be, has never sanctioned. The Judge says:—

> It may be harmless in itself (because as petitioner believes, God has not set apart that day for rest and holiness), to work on Sunday; and yet, if man has set it apart in due form by his law, for rest, it must be obeyed as man's law if not as God's law; and it is just as evil to violate such a law in the eyes of the world, as one sanctioned by God—I mean just as criminal in law.

In another part of his decision Judge Hammond affirms that a law like the Tennessee Sunday law, which would compel Mr. King to rest on the first day of the week, does not invade the latter's conscience, since it is not any part of his creed, or of that of his denomination, that the fourth commandment enjoins labor during six days in the week. Now, what Mr. King's conscience tells him upon this point I do not know; but I think every candid person must admit that such a law, if not in conflict with what the fourth commandment enjoins, is in direct conflict with what the commandment allows, and therefore equally void and out of place upon the statute books of any State. The fourth commandment says:—

> Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work," etc.

Now, if this language has any meaning it is a direct permission to man from the Almighty himself to perform work upon six days of the week; and to say, in the face of this, that Sunday laws must be obeyed by the seventh-day keeper on the plea that they do not require him to violate his conscience, is to ignore God's relation to man, and invade a right which the latter's conscience tells him is as sacred and well established as any which could possibly belong to the individual.

Man's law is no less in conflict with God's law when it forbids that which God's law permits, than when it permits or enjoins that which God's law forbids. When the Almighty has with his own voice said, "six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," where is the man or combination of men that have the authority to say, thou shalt not labor six days? Mr. King ought to be at once released.

Yours for the right,

L. A. SMITH.
