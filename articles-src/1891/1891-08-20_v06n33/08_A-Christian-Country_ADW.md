Notwithstanding the barbarous persecutions inflicted by the Russian Government upon those who do not agree with the Czar's definition of Christianity, the Christian Statesman still continues to call Russia "a Christian country." Let the devil label himself "Christian," and there will doubtless be found those who are ready to recognize him under that title.

But, after all, why should not the National Reformers recognize Russia as a Christian country, since Russia is simply carrying out those principles which they claim are essential to so-called National Christianity? They hold that a government is a "moral person," and that it "must have a religion of its own, and exercise itself about religious affairs." They claim further, that it is the duty of government to compel all the people to submit to the national religion. In the issue of the Christian Statesman of October 2, 1884, it said:—

> Give all men to understand that this is a Christian Nation; and that, believing that without Christianity we perish, we must maintain by all right means our Christian character.

Every week the Statesman prints the Constitution of the National Reform Association, in which it is proposed "to place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

And what do the Reformers propose to do with those who refuse to accept what the Government shall officially declare to be the institutions and usages of Christianity? The following from the Christian Statesman of May 21, 1885, answers the question:—

> We might add, in all justice, if the opponents of the Bible do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land, and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a government of their own on infidel and atheistic ideas; and then, if they can stand it, stay there till they die.

This programme laid down by the National Reformers is precisely the one which the Russian Government is following to-day. That country has adopted "a religion of its own," and is exercising itself "about religious affairs." This is what the Statesman declares every nation must do. The Czar is giving "all men to understand" that Russia is a "Christian nation," and that he is determined to "maintain by all right means" its "Christian character." He has placed "all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of the government on an undeniable, legal basis;" and whoever denies his right to do this is pretty sure to be sent to the "wild, desolate land" of Siberia, to stay until he dies.

The Czar and the National Reformers are exactly agreed as to what constitutes the right means by which the Christian character of a nation should be maintained. Banishment "to some wild, desolate land" is the penalty for all those who refuse to worship the government instead of God. This is the way they are made to "feel the inconvenience of dissent."

The Christian Statesman complains bitterly of the religious persecution in Russia, while, at the same time, it exists for the sole purpose of securing the introduction of a like system in our own Government. Let not its editors say that the reason Russia persecutes is, that the government has adopted a false religion; for when they call Russia a Christian country, they thereby assert that it has the true religion—the Christian religion. Russia claims to have the Christian religion, and the National Reformers admit that the claim is just.

But further: if, as they affirm, it is the duty of every government to officially define Christianity for its subjects, it necessarily follows that the definition given must be right for that country. If there was any doubt about it, then the subjects could not be blamed for refusing to accept it, and the official decision would be without effect. If the subjects are to criticise the decision of the government, and do as they please about accepting it, then there is no use for the government to make a decision; and if the government has a right to decide, then no citizen has a right to question the decision.

Russia has made an official decision that true Christianity is embodied in the doctrines of the Greek Church; and as the National Reformers assert the right of governments to decide in such matters, they ought to be the last ones to find fault with the decision.

This official definition of Christianity, which Russia has made for the benefit (?) of her citizens, is undoubtedly in harmony with the ideas of the majority. It is only the Jews, the Lutherans, and others who are in the minority, that get persecuted. Russia legislates on the principle of "the greatest good to the greatest number," and of course she cannot afford to have a half dozen different and conflicting standards of religion. If the Lutherans and Jews do not like Russia "and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land . . . and set up a government of their own, and then, if they can stand it, stay there till they die." As it is with National Reformers, so it is with the Czar—any one is an atheist who does not accept his definition of Christianity.

All the persecution in Russia arises from the enforcement of what the Czar calls "Christian laws;" that is, laws for the protection and enforcement of Christianity, as officially defined by the government. And these laws are said to be enforced for the good of the State, in order that Russia may maintain her "Christian character."

Reader, beware of a so-called Christian government. Beware of a government that has concluded to have a religion, and to "exercise itself about religious affairs." Beware of a government that officially defines Christianity for its citizens. Beware of a government which commands the people to do a thing because it would be pleasing to God. Beware of a government which defines the will of God for its subjects. Beware of a government that passes laws favoring Christianity, for in so doing it defines Christianity. Beware of a government which asks the people to look to it for their religion, instead of looking to God. Beware of a government that puts itself in the place of God to rule the consciences of men. Beware of a government which substitutes the power of civil law for the power of God. Beware of a government which calls religious institutions "civil," that it may assume jurisdiction over them. Beware of a government which enforces a recognition of religious institutions "for the good of the State," or "for the benefit of the public health." Beware of a church or of an individual that asks the government to do any of these things.
