THE Protestants and Roman Catholics of a fashionable suburb of Montreal are at loggerheads regarding the proper observance of Sunday. According to their custom from time immemorial and in consonance with the teaching of their religious advisers Roman Catholics do not think it improper to indulge in dancing, ball playing, or other similar amusements in the afternoon of Sunday. But their Protestant neighbors, in this case, have determined that they will not tolerate any sacrilegious frivolity of this kind.

The expression of religious fervor on the part of the Protestants became so intense that the presence of the Mayor was necessary to prevent a social riot. These Protestants forget that Sunday is a Roman Catholic institution and as they established it there can be no higher authority than they as to what shall constitute its proper religious observance.
