## Religious Persecution.

The prosecution of a Seventh-day Adventist in Tennessee because he would not be idle on a singular proceeding for an American man. A body yesterday said that certain act of religious intolerance was disturbing his neighbors. He was ploughing in his own field at a distance from any place of worship, but under a medieval law or certain enmeshed Christianity was sought to introduce here he was arrested, fined, and forced present opponents will be compelled in consent with criminals in jail.

A local contemporary states that Tennesseeans have a right to weak religious bigotry on account in this fashion, and, since of the conviction to liberty to do it, which if they can be in the case of denying to those we go, by their error and leave, and to preach which they have error in believing. The principle at the root of our Government is that every man has a right to worship God, and he does not infringe the rights of anybody else. The attempt to conform in towards all Adventists in five days' work a week when other people are at work on six days is a description of persecution, and it ought to make a Tennessean ashamed to countenance it.

At this moment there are probably hundreds of institutions in Tennessee who have never been arrested. It is safe to say that among the often grossly storekeepers who have violated upon improprieties as offensive as these must become. Yet they go to holy land instead of them, there are some who of each individual from application to labor on the fruits retaliated by assassination. The whole idea to divide the work in the way laid down in the Fourth Commandment as given at Sinai, but whose manner, which has been simply a scheme of wholesome sanitary period, but rest has brought the commonwealths to the verge of civil war.

Christianity has never to insist be established, but nothing more than that they live in a community in which people could do as they pleased, and disposing of his time as he sees fit and allowing interference in the house.—*San Francisco Chronicle.*

REV. J. J. MYEN, District Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, has been lecturing in Iowa; at the Moines he said that he was asking for a civil and not a religious Sabbath; and claimed that all Sabbath laws are civil because the courts had said so.

The eighth annual report of the Kings County Sunday Observance Association urges upon individuals the duty of requiring public officials to execute the Sunday laws of the State for the protection of the community as a religious but a civil institution.

Rev. W. F. Buckley, of Ohio, complains in a letter to the *United Presbyterians* of so-called liberal ministers in Ohio churches who care to contribute to Sunday base-ball games.

"Railroad officials sometimes claim that trains must be run seven days in the week, that in so far doing all they can to contribute to the observance of Sunday. This is all a sham. They can stop all Sunday trains except one each way, and Sunday excursion trains, band bills in the towns along the lines announcing excursion train, the Sunday trains leaving from Dayton, to Woodville Island and other resort places between the hours of 8 and 12 o'clock A.M. advertise a cheap, boat trains, boat riding by steam yachts, sail, and row boats in connection with the trains.

man, but he has been supported by the friends of the movement from other denominations of Christians in and out of Tennessee.

The Tennessee Sunday law was inherited from the Carolinas, where is existed from the time as a Colonial statute. It had been in "inope-rative" for many years until some religious people revived it of the time. Hon. Judge Hamond of the Federal Court holds that no far the law is considered the action of the State courts must in accepted as the process of law. The decision is sound from the standpoint of the National Constitution. The Constitution here guarantees religious rights; equally religious liberty and religion, on this point by the Federal Constitution is still within the last years to determine the national religion of the State by hands of its friends, and citizens in keeping by the Federal courts could not interfere, as the claims of the citizens, do not of themselves, the palm was especially to the Federal Government and in that only.

Dr. King was given a nearly equal way to worship as any law in under the law and Constitution of the Nation and State of Tennessee for six days, so as desired him, and this being the case he was not deprived of any right of that nature, and so go to prison—the correct stamp, of the character of the measure and those executing it, we are almost disposed to say that if the quality of justice of a free people is worth more than all the Sunday laws that ever were enacted.

This is not Sunday observance, but Sunday persecution; not is it careful to conceal the real nature underlying the demand for Sun-day laws are any lax American Sabbath Union friends.

Their purpose is to exalt Sunday more than it is to promote temperance and he is not asked to let be let in the way to that of the Archbishop is more candid or has more sense. The one that is really that is really, is that some others their advice therefore is not for me to decide; penalty be in its faith.

On Sunday, July 19, while a congregation were worshiping in a country church near Collins, Georgia, a lightning struck the building and very markedly shocked a number of the congregation. If they had been two at the workshop instead of worship on Sunday, doubtless the editor of the *Christian Statesman* would have noted by this time with a vociferous editorial, protest and with large type, stating that violation of holding of Divine wrath in bold desertion of the Sabbath day."

Reversed them times will the hope page they may come to mind when the ardent advocates of such laws are tempted to write so much about.

COTTAGE CITY, Dukes County, Massachusetts, is another eloquent resort that is suffering from the rigid enforcement of a Sunday law. The small dealers of the place are there greatly, but the authorities have determined. [page 263]
