The *Christian Nation*, of June 13, 1891, prints a summary of a recent address on "The Sabbath Rest," by Dr. H. H. George, in Rochester, New York, in which he says: "Are we to be allowed to have a Sabbath in this country? On every gather was on a city, a most terrible warning was brought to bear upon him, to take away from him his Sunday. But does he bare any hope that evil will ever come when he will not be allowed to keep Sunday?— Nothing of the kind. Then what does he mean, and what does he want?— He wants matters so arranged in this country that religionists of his stamp can compel everybody to keep the day he calls the Sabbath; and his question is— has been working in follow:—'Are we to be allowed to have a law in this country to be allowed to have a law in this country that as things now it religion our of the same, and others, and require to observe them to observe whatever he happen in is mind, whatever whether it is to act with to keep it or not?' This is the intent of the country in behalf of Sunday; why not say it like it is?"—*Review and Herald.*
