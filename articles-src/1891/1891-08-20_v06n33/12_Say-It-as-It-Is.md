The Christian Nation, of June 15, 1891, prints a summary of a recent address on "The Sabbath Rest," by Dr. H. H. George, in Rochester, New York, in which he says, "Are we to be allowed to have a Sabbath in this country?" One would gather from such a wall that a terrible pressure was being brought to bear upon him to take away from him his Sunday. But does he have any fears that the time will ever come when he will not be allowed to keep Sunday?—Nothing of the kind. Then what does he mean, and what does he want?—He wants matters so arranged in this country that religionists of his stamp can compel everybody to keep the day he calls the Sabbath; and his question should have been worded as follows: "Are we to be allowed to have a law in this country so that we can bring all the people to our terms, and oblige them to observe the day we call the Sabbath, whether they regard it so and wish to keep it or not?" This is the intent of the outcry in behalf of Sunday; then why not state it as it is?
