INFIDELITY, the change of the week and weekly rest-day, the suppression of the Bible and religious rites, are sometimes referred to by those who favor an establishment of religion by law, as the causes of the French Revolution, or "Reign of Terror." But such is not the case. These are simply incidents of that awful epoch, and not causes. Ridpath, in his candid and impartial "History of the World," thus states the causes which led to the French Revolution:—

> There were 23,000 monks in France; there were 65,000 curates and vicars; there were 37,000 nuns; there were 2,500 monasteries, 1,500 convents, and 60,000 churches and chapels. In all of these there were 130,000 persons who enjoyed themselves in the work of saving France from her sins. But hey did not begin with themselves. There were 140,000 nobles in France. They put on regalia, and stuck feathers in their hats. The noble families numbered 30,000. On each square league of territory, and for each thousand of the inhabitants, there was a castle and one noble family. France was not only saved, but she was ennobled. It required a great deal of land to support properly the dignity and office of one of her saviours. The Abbey of St. Germain-en-Laye owned about 900,000 acres. One-fifth of all the land of France belonged to the clergy, one-fifth to the nobility, one-fifth to the communes and kings. . . . It is impossible to describe in adequate terms the system of government and of social despotism established over the French nation in the eighteenth century. . . . The theory, reduced to a formula, ran thus: It is the duty—the business—of the State to teach men what things to do, and of the Church to teach them what things to believe. As for man, it is his business to be governed.

Of the Revolution itself, Ridpath says:

> It was simply a revolt, an insurrection of the emancipated mind of France against the tyranny of her social, civil, and religious institutions, a rebellion of man against his masters, a struggle of the human spirit to break an intolerable thralldom which had been imposed upon it by the past. . . . The day of pleasant things had passed. No more could the fiery spirit of roused-up France be soothed with royal cordials or put to sleep with a lullaby. The new king's ancestors for two hundred years had sown to the wild, and now their princely and good natured offspring must reap the whirlwind.
