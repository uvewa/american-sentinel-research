There is a contest coming. Governmentalism has been constantly encroaching on the rights of the people, and as a result those who support this encroachment must, in order to justify themselves, deny the existence of such rights. It is not surprising that they should deny rights so far as the encroachments go; that would be expected. But for the leading State organ of a political party to deny natural rights in toto is, indeed, a matter of surprise.

The occasion of the words was the following excerpt from the speech of Hon. Roger Q. Mills, of Texas, at Staten Island:—

> The individual existed before society, and society has only such rights as the individual confers upon it; or, to state it differently, man existed before government, and the government only has such powers as man confers upon it. Man owes a duty to himself, but it is declared by his own reason and enforced by his own conscience. The government has neither reason nor conscience; these are attributes of the man. They are parts of his animal organism.
>
> In the last thirty years paternalism has been extending its boundaries and liberty has been contracting hers. The Government has been prescribing the hours of labor. If it has the right to prescribe eight hours, it has the right to prescribe twenty-four. It has neither.
>
> How long a man shall work and at what business is a question for his own determination. The Government loads down one kind of butter with a heavy tax to decrease its production and give higher profits to another kind. The Government taxes people to raise money to appropriate to fairs, to buy grain for those who have lost theirs by drought or insects. It regulates the practice of medicine and law, and it is being urged by some to prescribe rates of pay for its practitioners, and now it is demanded by a great number of good people that the Government shall lend people money and help them to live. Folly could hardly go further. The answer of democracy to all these demands is that just government must stop at the boundary of natural right; that it must secure that against every invasion, and then leave every man free to fight out the battle of life in his own way. This is the creed declared by its great founder, who saw clearly that liberty could only be preserved, enjoyed, and transmitted by adhering faithfully and courageously to the principles of self government.

These are sound principles. They lie at the foundation of the American political system, and should be the guide in all governmental action. But the assertion of such anti-paternal ideas was too much for the paternalistic Detroit Tribune, so under the heading, "A Modern Jefferson," in its issue of August 3, it took Mr. Mills and the principles asserted by him to task, in the following style:—

> Here is the doctrine of natural liberty, the pet theory of eighteenth century doctrinaires, the favorite mental idol of Thomas Jefferson, seriously enunciated as a party creed in the last decade of the nineteenth. The anachronism is painful. Natural liberty is an exploded dogma. Few believe in it nowadays, and nobody expects governmental policy to conform to it. Liberty is an artificial product. It is a gift of society or the State to man. Its limits are defined by the State; its blessings are conserved by the same agency. This is the doctrine upon which modern governments are based; this is the doctrine by which modern legislation is guided. Mr. Mills can not now retroverse the current of events by the interposition of the doctrine of natural liberty. . . . The theories of modern publicists and the experience of modern legislators alike contravene the revamped Jeffersonianism of Mr. Mills.

Here the principles of liberty and the principles of paternalism (or a better term would be despotism) are contrasted.

Mr. Mills (following the founders of our Government) says that government is the people's agent and "only has such powers as man confers upon it."

The paternalistic Tribune replies: "Liberty is an artificial product. It is the gift of society, or the State, to man."

Mr. Mills says: The agent or employed must get its powers from the employer—"society has only such rights as the individual confers upon it."

The Tribune replies: "Natural liberty is an exploded dogma."

Mr. Mills says: "Just government must stop at the boundary of natural right; it must secure that against every invasion."

The Tribune replies: "Few believe in it [natural liberty] nowadays, and nobody expects governmental policy to conform to it."

Mr. Mills says: "In the last thirty years paternalism has been extending her boundaries and liberty has been contracting hers."

The Tribune replies: "Mr. Mills can not now retroverse the current of events by the interposition of the doctrine of natural liberty."

And then as an unanswerable argument the Tribune contemptuously calls human liberty "revamped Jeffersonianism."

Nevertheless, be it called "revamped" or by whatever term, it is a liberty of which the American people are proud. There are undoubtedly to-day many paternalists and nationalists like the Tribune, that would, if they could, trample the immortal Declaration of Independence in the dust, that would consign its grand principles of natural liberty to oblivion; that would, if they could, overthrow the American Constitution, which was formulated to "establish" natural justice, and construct a despotism, like that of the Czar of Russia, parcelling out liberty in small quantities as it saw fit; but fortunately for the American people they can not. All they can do is to call the principles therein enunciated "exploded dogmas," "pet theories of eighteenth century doctrinaires," etc., but the grand political system, the superstructure erected upon those foundation principles will ever command the admiration of all lovers of liberty and humanity.
