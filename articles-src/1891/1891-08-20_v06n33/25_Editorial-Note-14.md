THE Christian at Work, of August 6, has the following:

"Some little time ago we directed attention to some obsolete laws which were on the statute books of this State until the adoption of the present Codes swept them away. One of these laws allowed any householder to stretch a chain across a highway in front of his house, and stop all Sunday traffic, though the parent's horse and the doctor's one-horse stay must be allowed to pass. And naturally the same features are met with on the other side, as in England where probably very few persons are aware that the Lord's-Day Observance Act of Charles II. is still in force. But it is, and a Hair-dressers' Association tried to take advantage of it at Oldham the other day. It appears that a barber in that town refused either to join the union or close his shop on Sunday morning, and it occurred to some of the union officials that the old statute might be used to bring him to terms. A warrant was procured against him, and he was arrested; but the magistrates saw through the trick and dismissed the case on the ground that the prosecution was malicious and prompted by a desire to help the Association, rather than by any anxiety about the proper observance of the Sabbath. Whether they would refuse to enforce the law in a case where the motive was less suspicious they did not say, but it appears that some barbers were fined at Derby not long ago for shaving on Sunday. Probably the Derby judiciary do not consider shaving to be a work of necessity. It very clearly is not to a good many."
