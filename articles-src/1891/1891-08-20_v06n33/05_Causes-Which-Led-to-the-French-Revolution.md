Invariably, the causes of every upheaval of all weekly revolts, the engrossments of the Bible and religious rites, are sometimes referred to by those who favor an establishment of religion by law, as the causes of the French Revolution, or "Reign of Terror." But each is in direct conflict with the known facts. These, are the simply incidents of that awful epoch, and not its causes. Bliss(ph), in his candid and impartial "History of the Sabbath," recites the causes which led to the French Revolution:—

> In 1700 the king of France was then the most powerful in Europe. There were 60,000 convents and visitors; there were 37,000 nuns. The 100,000 priests, who came to the consideration of 215,000 churches and chapels. In all of these there were 215,000 souls, some who were employed in the work of saving France her sins. But they did not begin with themselves. There were [page 260] 130,000 nobles in France. They got rapals, and much idleness in their haste. The noble families go on to 100,000. On such square leagues of territory, but of much the inhabitants, there was a castle and one noble family. France was not only served, but she was ruined. She only a great deal of land to support properly the dignity and title of one of her citizens! . . . The Abbey of St. Germain-en-Laye owned about 200,000 acres. One-fifth of all the land of France belonged to the clergy, one-fifth to the nobility, one-fifth to the communities and kings. . . . It is impossible to describe in adequate terms the system of government and of social degradation established over the once prosperous and happy France. . . . For the theory, reduced to a formula, ran thus: it is the right and duty of those who have the authority, who know what things to do; and of the Church to teach them what things to believe. Let for that needs to be the government itself, Helpfully as Christian religion.

> This was simply a revolt, an insurrection of the suffering people of France, against the despotism of not social, civil, and religious institutions—a revolution of civilization against Feudalism, against the human spirit to break an intolerable limitation, which has had impious arouse to put upon the name. The day of pleasant things had passed. No more could the royal pageant of France be Paraded to recall with royal cordials or put to sleep with a million. The new king's demonstration or reminder vanished scarce to the wind, and now their princely and good assumed offering most origin of religion.
