THE Junior Order of United American Mechanics of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, passed at a late meeting the following resolutions:

"Whereas it has been customary for foreign societies to hold public parades, celebrating foreign events, upon the Sabbath, commonly called Sunday, thereby desecrating the American Sabbath and casting reflections upon our free institutions, founded upon principles advocated by our forefathers and upheld by us, one of which is to keep the Sabbath holy, and to remain a day of rest; Therefore be it

Resolved, That this Council condemns all such parades and demonstrations as being un-American and dangerous, both to the sanctity of the Sabbath and to the spirit of our free institutions, and that these resolutions be brought before the Advisory Council of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics for action by the representatives of that body, and that we hereby commend the Mayor of our city for refusing to address such bodies on that day."

It is worthy of notice that these resolutions do not openly ask the suppression of the Sunday parades of foreign societies by law, but the supposition is that such action would meet the approbation of this order. The phraseology employed bears unmistakable evidence to the parentage of the resolution, and shows how generally the "National Reform" spirit is permeating all classes and finding expression through organization which are not professedly religious in their purposes.
