IN his address before the late Temperance Congress, Archbishop Ireland said:—

> Make laws for the observance of Sunday—the one day of the week which we have striven to hold sacred for God, one of the last vestiges of religion in the land—and the saloon-keeper opens wide his doors and defies you.

THE SENTINEL has no sympathy for the liquor traffic and no apology to make for the saloon-keeper. It does say, however, that prohibition to be effective must not be limited to one day in the week. Such limitation places prohibition upon a religious basis; it honors a religious institution more than it restricts a civil evil; but as is clearly indicated by the Archbishop's words the whole purpose of Sunday-closing laws is to enforce the observance of Sunday as a religious institution. The Archbishop is not as careful to conceal the real motive underlying the demand for Sunday laws as are his American Sabbath Union friends.

Their purpose is to exalt Sunday more than it is to promote temperance and he is not afraid to let it be known. Whether the Archbishop is more candid or less wise than some other Sunday law advocates is not for us to decide; possibly he is help.
