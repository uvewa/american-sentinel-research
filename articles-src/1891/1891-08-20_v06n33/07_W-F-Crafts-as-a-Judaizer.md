W. F. CRAFTS, whose friends denominate him as the "leader" in Sabbath reform, has issued an "Open Letter to the Postmaster-General: Is it legal to sell postage stamps and deliver mail on the Sabbath except in 'original packages'?" As a specimen of sophomoric logic, of the "Argumentum ad hominem" sort, it is quite successful in placing the Postmaster-General in various apparently unfavorable attitudes as to consistency. But if consistency be the standard, Mr. Crafts would suffer most notably were the tables to be turned against him and his methods. Such things are but unworthy by-play when a great theme is under consideration. As an effort to sustain Sunday observance, Mr. Crafts's letter is "Judaistic" to the last degree. It "chops logic and splits hairs" equal to the Talmud. Under Judaism, when it had grown formal and powerless, the observance of the Sabbath was burdened with countless negative restrictions, which were like tithing "mint, anise and cummin," but which did not touch the "weightier matters of the law." Such are Mr. Crafts's charges against Postmaster-General Wanamaker. The main issue raised by Mr. Crafts is that he may sell postage stamps and deliver mail in the "original packages" on Sunday, but not otherwise.

Whenever one considers Mr. Crafts's theory of "Sabbath reform" he must begin by noting its double-faced contradictoriness. In one breath he claims that the civil law deals with Sunday as a "civil institution" only, and does not aim to enforce any religious observance. Considering it as a civil institution, we find that two of the definitions given by Worcester may be applied to Sunday. The first and fourth are as follows:

1. "Relating to a city or to a community as governed by laws: municipal; as opposed to military; political."

4. "Lay, as opposed to ecclesiastical." If the Postmaster-General should be compelled by the fierceness of Mr. Crafts's "open" attack to fall back for repairs, he will undoubtedly seek the aid of the ablest legal and judicial talent in the land in order to decide how the civil interests of the Nation are endangered by selling stamps or delivering mail on Sunday, otherwise than in the "original package." And since the case is one for definitions, we think that it would be well for Mr. Crafts to inform the Post-office Department just what is an "original package." We are not wise in the more than Judaistic casuistry of Mr. Crafts, but we venture to suggest that a letter addressed to John Doe is an "original package" which the writer commits to the care of the Post-office Department for transmission to him, and if it can deliver "original packages," it can deliver any single letter without infringing upon the national Constitution, or endangering the public welfare. Since each man's mail is an "original package," consigned to him, Mr. Crafts gives away his case, and the Postmaster-General is not yet convicted of doing anything "uncivil" on the "civil Sabbath." As to stamps, each one is an "original package" designed for use by itself, as a specific unit of value. But if this be questioned, surely a "sheet of stamps" would meet all demands, and it will take a casuist more technical than the average Talmudist to discover the "uncivil" and nationally injurious character of a business transaction which is civil and right if one hundred stamps are sold at once, and wrong if one be sold. When does the sale of stamps cease to be civilly right on Sunday? At seventy-five, at fifty, at twenty-five, at ten, at five? Where? Such questions are the essence of folly.

If we turn to the religious side of the question, and consider what Mr. Crafts is wont to call the "religious Sabbath," the case becomes more than Judaistic. If it be sinful to sell one stamp or to deliver one letter, how does it become non-sinful to deliver one hundred letters or sell one hundred stamps? Does God graduate guilt on the "original package" system? But since the Post-office Department is not a religious organization, we suppose that the "religious Sabbath" can have no place in the consideration of that side of the question.

The ultimate truth of the matter can be told in a few words. The civil law has no province in the case, even of a "rest-day," except to provide for the general good, comfort and safety of the citizens of the commonwealth. When the combined facts show that Postmaster Wanamaker's policy injures the citizens as citizens, or the Nation as a Nation, the civil law may be invoked. What men shall do with Sunday, or any other day as to religious duty, is entirely beyond the reach of civil law.
