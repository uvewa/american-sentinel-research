THAT which is the Lord's, rests solely between man and God; and if any man does not render it to God, he is responsible only to God, and not to any man, nor to any assembly or organization of men, for his failure or refusal to render it to God; and any power that undertakes to punish any man for his failure or refusal to render to God what is God's puts itself in the place of God.
