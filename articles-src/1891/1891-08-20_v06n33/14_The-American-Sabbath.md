Romeo's celebrated query, "What's in a name?" is often echoed and re-echoed at different times and on all sorts of occasions. But some people think there is more in a name than there is in the substance. They have no objection to the union of Church and State if it can only be called something else. They have no objection to compulsory Sunday laws—the direct heritage of Church and State of the Old World—if you only call the day the "civil" Sunday or the "American Sabbath." Although all our Sabbath traditions came down from an exclusively religious idea, and although anciently Sunday itself was named after the sun-god, whose festival it was, yet to-day we are told that if we only enforce these ideas and call them "American" or "civil" that changes the whole case at once.

It seems that these modern Sunday-law advocates are as much mixed as to facts, as was good old "Uncle Mose," of Detroit, not long since. The Free Press relates the following anecdote:

"Well, Uncle Mose," said a lady, "I hear you have another pair of twins at your house."

"Yaas, Missus, yaas we has,—bress dey little h'arts!"

"Have you named them yet?"

"Yaas'm; done named 'em aftah two ob de fust pres'dents ob dis kentry."

"Indeed! What two?"

"Ole Christofi Clumbus an' Juleyus Caesar, ma'am. We'se grate on namin' de chil'ens fo' de presidents 't our house."
