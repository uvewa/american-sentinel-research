THE THEATRES OF SPOKANE, WASHINGTON, have been closed on Sunday evening by the order of the Mayor. It seems the enforcement of such an ordinance was left at the discretion of the Mayor, and so, he, having vested in him the power of a Christian government, by his converting command to the evangelical police force of Spokane, christianized the theatre goers of that city in one night.
