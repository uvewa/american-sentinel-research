THE OBSERVER says our ministers, and laymen, and women, "must, if necessary, forget all other politics in this one kind of politics, the politics that compels our rulers to respect the opinions of the Christian public." Where in the language of the Master has the *Observer* found an example for such arrogant words as these? Does the *Observer*, in this, assume the political attitude which Christ taught the disciples they should bear toward their Roman rulers?
