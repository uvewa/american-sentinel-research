Two distinctive characteristics of our Government is the entire separation of Church and State. The Constitution declares itself the supreme law of the land. From this law religion is entirely eliminated. It has been asserted that this was a Christian Nation. Washington declared in a treaty with Tripoli, in 1796, that the Government of the United States "was in no any sense founded upon the Christian religion;" and that official declaration has been repeatedly vindicated. Religion is not once mentioned in the body of the Constitution, and then only to declare that no religion test shall be a qualification for any office or trust under the Government. The First Amendment prohibits law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. It denies to unmistakable terms the right of the State to interfere in religious matter. Stoutly it but once mentions religion: "If any" it shall not be reformed by the President, within the six days (five days excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it. Here it is not recognized as a day upon which the President might not want to work. Clearly the document contains no law for enforced Sabbath observances. Congress and courts surpass human sanity through individual determination the day, and through legal reputation they. Congress frequently sits in Sabbath sessions.

Some years ago this question was thoroughly discussed by the Nation, and signally defeated in Congress. In the advance every report the committee the "real" the Government is a civil, not a religious instrument. It is the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true and what false. It as principles to insure establish that religious or religious observances shall be inferred by laws, legislative acts, are enacted in what is its mission. Wouldst, if constitutional, provide for the exercise of discussion, and the support of Christian ministers, if we could advance one step further in the interest of Christianity. Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion for enforcing religious observances. Let the professors of the Christian community their religion be kept from, beseeches, by Christian meekness, with lives of temperance and holiness. Let them combine their efforts to instruct the ignorant, reform the vicious and the outcast, to proclaim to the world the doctrine of the Savior, recommending the propriety by their personal habits, Government will find its legitimate objects in protecting them. It can not stop them, and they will not need the all their moral influence will then do more to advance the true interests of religion than any measure which they may call on Congress to enact."

Congress adopted this report, and twice since have measures for the enforced observance of the Sabbath been defeated. This Congress registers the voice of the people that religion shall stand apart from the State. The public observance of the Sabbath depends then on custom and not law. Congress declares the Sabbath a religious institution, and declines to enforce it. The State provides for the free exercise of religion. When, therefore, any religious institution is enforced by law, a precedent is given to a select institution and mode of worship, against the letter and spirit of the Constitution.

We have proven the Sabbath a purely religious institution; its enforced observance is, therefore, an undue preference in favor of the Christian sects observing that day. The Constitution, grants the right of individual preference to no sect, but protection to all. A Sabbath law grants toleration to all, but preference to those worshipping on the first day of the week. It says to the Christian observer of the first day, "You wish to worship on Sunday and have the right, and shall be protected;" to the Christian observer of the seventh day, and to the Jew, it says, "You wish to worship on Saturday; you may, but you shall also keep the day demanded sacred by the other sects, for it is our duty to protect the Sabbath."

This can not be their most discreet opinion. The conscience of the seventh-day observer compels him to keep the seventh day; the compels him to keep the first. His neighbor works on days; he may work but five; Friday observes no work. "There is as much holiness in work as in rest;" says a *reading* the seventh day. The State compels him to violate the conscience of the seventh. Who days shall then labor," and takes from him a forfeit of one-sixth of his time (one-sixths expense only) for the privilege of worshipping God, and even then denies the sacred right. Our laws record the case of one of our Italian 11 who refused to act as witness on Saturday, alleging that he dared not violate his Sabbath. He was fined. Thus by law we violated the conscience of a Sabbath which he profallies, and for refusing to violate a day which he deems sacred. Such laws are an invasion of conscience, the death of liberty, and the essence of tyranny.

In regard to the decision of Judge Belt, I quote Judge Terry, Supreme Justice of California, and at least as good a jurist as Bell. He says: "By an examination of the question, it will be seen that the position taken rests in more assertion, and that not a single argument is advanced to prove that a preference in favor of the Christian religion is not given by it.

"No, that clause inserts the proposition broadly, but surely it is a legitimate conclusion from what precedes it, and must be taken as the plainest sense of general principles. That which proceeds it establishes that the law does not destroy religion, destroys toleration, and is that a grand equity. So far the criticism of this learned justice of Judge Bell's decision; that it can contain more assertions, not arguments, and decisions is worthy of their learned judicial; does not destroy toleration; not that it grants equity.

But it is claimed that the present law enforced because "Christianity is part of the common law." It was part of the English common law, but we have adopted the common law in only as far as it is adapted to our institutions. Common law unites Church and State; that part is inapplicable as a fundamental principle in our system of government. Therefore, as far as common law invades the realm of religion we reject it. It was part of the common law to say when Paley's religion was drivi; when Quakers were banished and Quakeresses hanged; when the plea of butors of death more Cuthbert Fenwick who brought the sacrament to the dying faithful. But it is not a part of the common law of any State whose statehood was born in 1776. The Constitution is the supreme law and prohibits it. Primacy, in the words of the able Judge Davidson, "is that which tribes either Christianity nor any other religion is part of the common law." It could be no supreme law.

Were any religion part of the common law, it would have its own sanctions and penalties for its violation. Then is the Church the superior of the State, and "Every person is to be punished by the civil power who refuses to enforce its doctrines and follow its precepts." That this is beyond the province of civil laws it is conceded. The decision declares "if in the course of the nation is inquiries, it ceases to be the case." It cannot be said in any connection it is an absurdity in logic, and a nullity in fact." Says Judge Applegate, of the Supreme Court of Maine: "Christianity may be the religion of the people, but it is not the religion of the State. The Constitution does not recognize the superiority of any religion nor sect or denomination. It regards all as possessing equal rights."

That governments and majorities have declared the Sabbath a civil institution and under their control is no proof for the affirmative; and to debate it on that ground is to debate the institute of the question, which look out from and by the planting almost of trees, up to the infallible source of eternal truth.

No man, or State, or government has the right to claim that this Sabbath can be observed as a civil manner. Governments have marital barbarians to the Lord's supper. Did that make it a civil institution? or "the wine to deny that institution!"
