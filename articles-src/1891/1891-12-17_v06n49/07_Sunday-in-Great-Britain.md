In 1856, an attempt was made in the English Parliament, to have the British Museum, and National Art Gallery open on Sunday. Of the discussion by Dr. Tinsley counted by this motion the *Westminster Review*, of April in that year says:--

The speakers in opposition to the motion, and every argument they adduced, may be easily possessed by two leading convictions,--one, that it was wrong to the nation to set the bait before the people in church by forcing them upon opinion, the course of order;--and the other, that Christianity has no reality independently of popular assent. The former a relic of what was the most creed of the wretched being borne to the generation that nation produced by that great shock cast Scotland adrift and gave us Puritanism from which to form, and it was not very much, of a liberal educated, and enlightened spirit, in cast England at that it necessarily costs a country to exist for nearly half a century in ignorance of political principles, and in blindness to political facts. Religion lost in the level of an act of governing, and when it has once descended to this, it is hard to raise it. In the division we refer to speaker after speaker opposed what they termed the insertion of the wedge. Opening the National Gallery the right in itself and proper in itself: but it was getting the wedge in. The people would lose the religion, which the speaker did not pretend to say was a true one, that Sunday was a divine institution; and if they did not believe the Bible, the religion of the country; our institutions would break up; those would be the opinions of the day, the politics, the theology, no distinction between right and wrong, for the ignorance which we are beginning to detect that Christianity is a true religion, and especially adapted to the wants of mankind. If it is so, it is moldy it will make its own way; and its existence is in no way threatened because a man shall think it right to go into a gallery on Sunday, being none of the worse for that inspiration, or the any wrong that they should go to.

The above may give the whole system of Anti-Sabbatarian Government the better. The working classes of large towns are sent to be watched and rested into being good loafers. They know too much, think too much, disbelieve too much.

Who can read this without instantly recognizing the fact that the same controversy now going on regarding the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. The same cry about the entering wedge is here, the same fear that all our institutions, founded upon this one, and that the very distinction of right and wrong can not exist independent of an enforced Sunday! And this is but publicly denying the power of godliness, and subordinating fact if it the power of the State, or, as the *Westminster Review* says, it amounts to, Christianity has no reality independently of positive law! The *Review* proceeds to give an account of the petition to Parliament against the Sunday opening, and to show its character and effect.

It would seem from the account, that the American Sabbath Union, and the W. C. T. U. Christian Temperance. Unions, were not in existence then, at least, their methods of work were. Indeed them were taken.

At Kewin Town, a meeting was convened by the Sunday Rest Association. Lord Shaftesbury was in the chair, and proposed that the procedure should commence with prayer. This raised an objection. After prayer there were addresses by present, and an amendment respecting the church; a chapel's prayer or warrant, and missionary the meeting pledged itself to promote the opening of public institutions on Sunday.

There is, here, although the working-class men were invited and present in large numbers, yet it was declared to be, not in the least, a clerical movement, but it was the spontaneous acts of the "poor overworked laboring population."

It is somewhere that one man is a hundred who would wish to trade should from by fear of the investigation, the noisy and fore for or five others that he would try to make Sunday work, yet he can always do; if he pleases, unless be prevented by law, both really, constitutionally, and effectually.

The leaders themselves are convinced that in the large the first and and Italy Lord Stanley affirmed that there were in London 16.000 persons who were compelled, by their employers to

work against their will; and the majority of those who actually trade, "do so, not only, in order to live, but they are also told, only to force to a strict measure which would prevent their master's compelling them to work."

Thus, all with only one or two exceptions, signed from the same motive of charity toward the poor. They therefore intended to secure an admission from God's government that they were laboring men.

ers, if they work seven days, will finally have to do it for six days' wages,--with these arguments, it seemed, did all originate in Mr. Charla's fertile brain, but he found them all ready to his hand. The *Review* says:--

The clause of Sunday legislation is not that all would be forced to keep open shop, but that the workman will not some days work for six days' wages. Has it ever occurred to them to make of this reliance continued laborers to do this; and if so how it can happen that their employers do not may any advantage from it. Both propositions can not be true--that the masters will make their stores some days seven days because it is profitable, and that it is unprofitable to make servants work seven days.

As to the distinction between innocent and useful recreations, and the prohibition of labor on Sunday, the *Review* says:--

If we attempt to lay down any rules as to what amusements, and what are not innocent, we are at once beset with infinite difficulties. What constitutes innocence of recreation and amusement; he had been severely convicted by a Subbatrarian for shooting with arrows in his garden. We despise after this, of facing any alternative views, so much more easily discussed; that the matter to the decision of conscience and taste. If we assume convictions, it is not what, what is to hinder a continental Sunday being transplanted over England? A continental Sunday is one of which in every town.

"Yes, that is the bugbear still, and in this country, as well as in England, while Sunday enforcements cry in the same tone "forever down the ringing grooves of change;" we can see that those across say "ho, just run it cyclone," and so far as Sunday law argument is concerned, "There is nothing new under the sun."

G. E. FIFIELD.

This prime defect in the whole National Reform system is the view that the State is a person, and, in fact, a moral person; that it is an individual, distinct from the individuals who compose it, in the same sense that one individual man or woman is distinct from another. But the State is no more a personality than the Patristic Order or the Sons of America is a personality. The State as an individual cannot do anything. The action of the State is only the action of the majority of the individuals who compose it, or their representatives. It becomes their action, there is the responsibility and the morality or the immorality, the real right or wrong of what it does attaches to the individual men who are concerned in it. The State is not a soul, it is only a means through which to accomplish an end. It is an organization formed by men by which to express themselves and the will which they possess, and that is all in the world that it is.

THE MAN who sits in judgment on another in the matter of his religion, and then attempts to punish him for what he is pleased to term "heresy," simply usurps a prerogative of God.
