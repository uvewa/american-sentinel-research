THE first issue of the *Christian Statesman*, under the new management, is a pictorial edition, containing cuts of the beast of Revelation which "had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon," used by the Seventh-day Adventists in the interpretation of prophecy; the American eagle, brooding the stars and stripes, from the fly leaf of the publications of the National Religious Liberty Association; and an illustration of that famous saw which was so long exhibited as a fac simile of the one "laid down every Saturday night" by Jesus Christ the carpenter of Nazareth. The editorial article thus illustrated and entitled "The Most Active Advocates of Sunday Opening" should be read by every subscriber to THE SENTINEL, and every member of the Religious Liberty Association. No unprejudiced mind would need to look any farther for an argument in refutation of Sabbath Union and National Reform positions, than that unconsciously presented in the editorial.
