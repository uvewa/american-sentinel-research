THE *Christian Nation*, of December 2, has this editorial paragraph in reference to the *Christian Statesman*:—

Our readers will bear testimony that no word has ever appeared in these columns with reference to the *Christian Statesman* that was not kindly. To the Covenanter Church that paper and the National Reform Association have sustained the same relation, and toward both the Association and its organ the *Christian Nation* has been unwaveringly loyal. This paper will therefore not be misunderstood in saying that under the new management, it is a sorrowful sight to see the testimony of the *Statesman* for the claims of King Jesus lowered, and National Reform taking a subordinate position among the reforms of the day, instead of being still maintained as the one that is fundamental to all the others. Covenanters are no longer under any obligation to support it; it is not doing the work it was originally established to do. In all the past seven years and more, no hint or suggestion was ever made, privately or publicly, by any one connected with the *Christian Nation*, to the writer's knowledge, looking to the substitution in any home, or elsewhere, of this journal for the *Statesman*; but to-day we have no hesitation in saying to Covenanters that we believe you should prefer the *Christian Nation* before the *Statesman*, in your prayers, in your homes, and in your labor.
