The following quotations, one from a description of Russia's treatment of the Jew, which appeared recently in the New York Times, and another from a letter recently received from a resident of Tennessee, and printed in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, are so nearly parallel that one has but to change the name of Russia to that of Tennessee, and the name of Jew to that of Seventh-day Adventist, to imagine himself reading the same account.

**RUSSIA.**

The Hebrews, of course, religiously abstain from labor on Saturday. It was considered by Ignatieff an extremely smart trick to forbid them to do business on Sunday as well.

In its essence, this meant that the Jews could only have five earning days against other people's seven. Although there are laws on the books prohibiting Christian labor or business on Sunday, they are a complete dead letter. Every traveler in Russia knows that Sunday in the markets and business streets differs in no respect from any other day save that there are no Jews about. Having remained idle on Saturday for their own Sabbath, they are compelled to observe Sunday for the Christian Sabbath—the while the Christian himself works or barters from morning till night, and the market places are filled as well with Tartars, gipsies, and Persians, whom no one molests.

**TENNESSEE.**

In a place called the Cove, three or four miles from Dayton, is a small colony of Sabbath keepers, who are very conscientious and devout Christians. These not long ago were wicked and profane men. For many years, they with their neighbors and friends, had indulged in all kinds of work and amusements on Sunday; but recently when some commenced the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath immediately things changed. Those who were once their friends now became their foes. So long as they did not keep the seventh day nothing was said about Sunday desecration, no matter how much, or the kind of work that was performed. And that has been the custom in that vicinity for years.

Last week the Deputy Sheriff and two other men were in the Cove watching to catch Saturday keepers at work; and some of their nearest neighbors have been lounging around on Sunday, like coyotes in a thicket, to catch their innocent prey. These very men who are now trying so hard to bring seventh-day observers before the courts for working on Sunday, have time and again borrowed tools of Seventh-day Adventists to chop wood all day Sunday.

The Sheriff referred to lives at Morgantown, one and a half miles from Dayton, and one and one-half miles from the Cove, his place of attack. Dayton is where the large iron and coal furnaces of the Dayton Coal and Iron Company are situated, employing three hundred men, running full blast day in and day out, Sundays not excepted, with all its noise and bustle, producing one hundred and twenty tons of iron every Sunday, and that too within speaking distance of two churches, yet nothing is said about that.

Why should the Sheriff leave so grand an opportunity to catch none at work, and go two miles over a mountain and skulk around to find engaged in honest toil some poor farmer who had observed the previous day? Ah! it is not the nature or the amount of work performed, that constitutes the offense so much as the fact that those who do it observe another day.

The Sunday law of Tennessee is a dead letter until it comes to seventh-day observers then life will spring up in it equal to that of the Inquisition.

That these Russian methods of persecution should manifest themselves now and then in free America is not strange, for the human heart is much the same the world over, but that they should receive the sanction of State and Federal courts, as in the case of the late R. M. King of Tennessee, in this "land of the free," in 1891, is passing strange.
