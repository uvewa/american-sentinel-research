[Continuation of the negative argument, delivered at the annual contest of the Philosoph and Adelphis Literary Societies of Westminster College, New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, June 24, 1991, by A. L. Russell (Philo.), Bulger, Pa.]

The distinctive characteristic of our Government is the entire separation of Church and State. The Constitution declares itself the supreme law of the land. From this law religion is entirely eliminated. It has been asserted that we are a Christian Nation. Washington declared in a treaty with Tripoli, in 1796, that the Government of the United States "is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion;" and that official declaration has never been withdrawn. Religion is but once mentioned in the body of the Constitution, and then only to declare that no religious test shall be a qualification for any office or trust under the Government. The First Amendment prohibits any law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. It denies in unmistakable terms the right of the State to interfere in religious matters. Sunday is but once mentioned: "If any bill shall not be returned by the President, within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be law in like manner as if he had signed it." Here it is but recognized as a day upon which the President might not want to work. Clearly the document contains no law for enforced Sabbath observance. Congress and courts suspend business merely through individual deference to the day, and not through legal requirement. Congress frequently sits in Sabbath session.

Some years ago this question was thoroughly discussed by the Nation, and signally defeated in Congress. In the adverse report the committee said: "Our Government is a civil, not a religious institution. It is not the legitimate province of the Legislature to determine what religion is true and what false. If the principle is once established that religion or religious observances shall be interwoven in legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum. We shall, if consistent, provide for the erection of churches, and the support of Christian ministers, if we believe such measures will promote the interests of Christianity. Our Constitution recognizes no other power than that of persuasion for enforcing religious observances. Let the professors of Christianity commend their religion by deeds of benevolence, by Christian meekness, by lives of temperance and holiness. Let them combine their efforts to instruct the ignorant, relieve the widow and the orphan, to promulgate to the world the doctrine of the Saviour, recommending its precepts by their habitual example. Government will find its legitimate object in protecting them. It can not oppose them, and they will not need its aid. Their moral influence will then do more to advance the true interests of religion than any measure which they may call on Congress to enact."

Congress adopted this report, and twice since have measures for the enforced observance of the Sabbath been defeated. Thus Congress registers the voice of the people that religion shall stand apart from the State. The public observance of the Sabbath depends then on custom and not law. Congress declares the Sabbath a religious institution, and declines to enforce it. The States provide for the free exercise of religion. When, therefore, any religious institution is enforced by law, preference is given to a religious institution and mode of worship, against the letter and spirit of the Constitution. We have proven the Sabbath a purely religious institution; its enforced observance is, therefore, an undue preference in favor of the Christian sects observing that day. The Constitution grants the right of individual preference to no sect, but protection to all. A Sabbath law grants toleration to all, but preference to those worshiping on the first day of the week. It says to the Christian observer of the first day, "You wish to worship on Sunday and have the right, and shall be protected;" to the Christian observer of the seventh day, and to the Jew, it says, "You wish to worship on Saturday; you may, but you shall also keep the day deemed sacred by the other sects, for it is our duty to protect the Sabbath."

This can not be other than discrimination. The conscience of the seventh-day observer compels him to keep the seventh day; the law compels him to keep the first. His neighbor works six days; he may work but five. Bishop Newman says, "There is as much holiness in working six days as resting the seventh." Thus the State compels him to violate the fourth commandment, "Six days shall thou labor," and takes from him a forfeit of one-sixth of his time (over sixteen per cent) for the privilege of worshiping God, and even then denies the sacred right. Our laws record the case of a Jew (2 Dallas 13) who refused to act as witness on Saturday, alleging that he dared not violate his Sabbath. He was fined. Thus the Sabbatarian is punished for violating a Sabbath which he repudiates, and for refusing to violate a day which he deems sacred. Such laws are an invasion of conscience, the death of liberty, and the essence of tyranny.

In regard to the decision of Judge Bell, I quote Judge Terry, Supreme Justice of California, and at least as good a jurist as Bell. He says: "By an examination of the question, it will be seen that the position taken rests in mere assertion, and that not a single argument is adduced to prove that a preference in favor of the Christian religion is not given by law. The last clause asserts the proposition broadly, but surely it is a legitimate conclusion from what precedes it, and must be taken as the plainest case of petitio principii. That which precedes it establishes that the law does not destroy religious toleration, not that it grants equity." Such is the criticism of this learned justice on Judge Bell's decision: that it contains mere assertions, not arguments, and that these show only that the law does not destroy toleration; not that it grants equity.

But it is claimed that the Sabbath is enforced because "Christianity is part of the common law." It was part of the English common law, but we have adopted the common law only so far as it is adapted to our institutions. Common law unites Church and State; that they are separate is a fundamental principle in our system of government. Therefore, so far as common law invades the realm of religion we reject it. It was part of the common law when Roger Williams was driven out; when Quakers were banished and Quakeresses hanged; when the penalty of death hung over Catholic priests who brought the sacrament to the dying faithful. But it is not a part of the common law of any State since statehood was born in 1776. The Constitution is the supreme law and prohibits it. Therefore, in the words of the able Judge Thurman, "It follows that neither Christianity nor any other religion is part of the common law." It conflicts with the supreme law.

Were any religion part of the common law, it would have to have sanctions and penalties for its violation. Then in the words of the New York Supreme Court, "Every person is liable to be punished by the civil power who refuses to enforce its doctrines and follow its precepts." That this is beyond the province of civil law is conceded. The decision continues: "If the sense of the maxim is untrue, it ceases to be intelligible, since law without a sanction is an absurdity in logic, and a nullity in fact." Says Judge Appleton, of the Supreme Court of Maine: "Christianity may be the religion of the people, but it is in no sense the religion of the State. The Constitution does not recognize the superiority of any religious sect or denomination. It regards all as possessing equal rights.

That governments and majorities have declared the Sabbath a civil institution and under their control is no proof for the affirmative; and to debate it on that ground is to refuse to debate the merits of the question, which look out from and beyond the glaring errors of man, up to the infallible source of eternal truth.

No man, or State, or government has the right to claim that the Sabbath can be observed in a civil manner. Governments have marched battalions to the Lord's supper. Did that make it a civil institution? Or who dares say that the sacrament was "observed"? Laws can be repealed only by the same authority enacting them, never by those who are subjects to them. Never by word of God, or act of Christ, or precept of apostle, has that *holy* institution been changed to a civil institution; hence it is holy still. And though the State declare it civil, the duties of the citizen to the State are swallowed up in the obligation of the individual to his God.

Briefly, then, we find that the Sabbath, being a religious institution, the sole control of which is the divine prerogative, so acknowledged by Holy Writ, by our Congress, by Supreme Courts, and by all history—it cannot be a fit subject for civil legislation and it is not the prerogative of civil government to enforce it.
