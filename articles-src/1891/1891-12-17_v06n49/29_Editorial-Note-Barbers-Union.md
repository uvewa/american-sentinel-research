THE Sun thus pointedly comments on the action of the barbers' convention at Grand Rapids, Michigan. "Why should the Barbers' International Union ask the State legislatures to enact laws prohibiting all the barbers of the United States from plying their razors on Sunday? There is no law in any State requiring barbers to engage in Sunday shaving. Every barber in the country is at liberty to refuse to shave anybody, or trim anybody's beard, or cut anybody's locks on Sunday. Any barber has the right to close and bar his shop every Sunday of the year. The International Barbers' Union had better let the legislatures of the States attend to public affairs while its members regulate their own business. The proposed legislation would not reach the root of the matter. What the legislatures must do, if they would give genuine relief to the barbers, is to pass prohibitory laws or constitutional amendments forbidding beards to grow on Sunday."
