IN 1856, an attempt was made in the English Parliament, to have the British Museum, and National Art Gallery opened on Sunday. Of the discussion in Parliament occasioned by this motion the Westminster Review, of April in that year, speaks as follows:—

The speakers in opposition to the motion, and almost every speaker was in opposition, seemed possessed by two leading convictions,—one, that it was the duty of the Legislature to keep the people in check by forcing upon them opinions, whether true or not, which are calculated to promote the cause of order; and the other, that Christianity has no reality independently of positive law. The former is a relic of what was once the creed of the whole governing body in the generation that was terrified by the French Revolution. The reaction produced by that great shock cost Scotland all that her ministers of religion once possessed, and it was not very much, of a liberal, educated, and intelligent spirit: it cost England all that it necessarily costs a country to exist for nearly half a century in ignorance of political principles, and in blindness to political facts. Religion sank to the level of an art of governing; and when it has once descended to this, it is hard to raise it. In the debate we refer to, speaker after speaker opposed what they termed the insertion of the wedge. Opening the National Gallery might be right and proper in itself; but it was getting the wedge in. The people would lose the notion, which the speaker did not pretend to say was a true one, that Sunday was a divine institution; and if they did, who could tell how far the wedge would go? All our institutions would break up; there would be no religion, no going to church, no influence of the clergy, no distinction between right and wrong. Do the gentlemen who use this language really believe that Christianity is a true religion, and especially adapted to the wants of mankind? If it is, surely it will make its own way; and its existence can not depend on one set of persons, who think it right to go into a gallery on Sunday, being kept out by another set who think it abstractedly wrong that they should go in.

The sooner we give up the whole system of Anti-Jacobin Government the better. The working-classes of our large towns are not to be dandled and coaxed into being good babies. They know too much, think too much, disbelieve too much.

Who can read this without instantly recognizing its perfect likeness to the controversy now going on regarding the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday? The same cry about the entering wedge is here, the same idea that all our institutions depend upon this one, and that the very distinction of right and wrong can not exist independent of an enforced Sunday. What is this but publicly denying the power of godliness, and substituting for it the power of the State, or, as the Westminster Review puts it, asserting that "Christianity has no reality independently of positive law?" The Review proceeds to give an account of the petitions to Parliament against the Sunday opening, and to show how they misrepresented the real public sentiment.

It would seem from the account, that if the American Sabbath Union, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were not in existence then, at least, their methods of work were. Indeed there was a Sunday Rest Association, for the paper says:—

At Kentish Town, a meeting was convened by the Sunday Rest Association. Lord Shaftesbury was in the chair, and proposed that the proceedings should commence with prayer. This raised an opposition. Large bodies of working men were present, and an amendment negativing the Chairman's proposal was carried, and subsequently the meeting pledged itself to promote the opening of public institutions on Sunday.

Then, as here, although the workingmen very largely opposed the movement, yet it was declared to be, not in the least, a clerical movement, but all in the interests of the "poor overworked laboring man." They said:—

It is scandalous that one man in a hundred who who wishes to trade should force, by fear of his competition, the ninety and nine who are otherwise disposed, to trade against their wishes. . . . And yet he can always do so, if he pleases, unless the law is stringent enough to put him down easily and effectually. . . . The traders themselves are anxious not to trade but they can not help it. Lord Stanley affirmed that there were in London 50,000 persons who were compelled, on Sunday, to work against their will; and the majority of those who actually trade, are, it was said, quite in favor of a strict measure which would prevent their trading. The butchers of Clare market, for instance, all with only one or two exceptions, signed a petition in favor of the measure. The bill was therefore intended to secure an acknowledged public benefit, and was brought forward in the interest of the over-worked poor.

Nor did this plea, ostensibly in behalf of the laboring man, go without a reply. The paper adds:—

But numberless instances suggested themselves in which the proposed measure would bear very hardly on the comfort of the poor. Why was a man who only had a long sleep once a week, and only shaved once a week to get up so early on Sunday, that not only he but all the other customers of the barber should be shaved before 9 o'clock? Again, as Mr. Drummond informed the House, there are 150,000 families in London who live in a single room; it would be rather hard to compel these persons to get their Sunday's dinner on Saturday, and keep it through the night tainting the atmosphere, and becoming itself corrupted. Then there are many trades connected with the innocent recreation of the poor. Was the poor man in his afternoon's walk, his one holiday-walk in a dreary week, not to be allowed to buy an orange or a twist of tobacco? The public-houses were open in the middle of the day and in the evening, why should not the confectioners' shops be open too? Why should not the hungry pedestrian be able to buy a biscuit or a bun, without exposing himself to the temptation of spirituous liquors?

Again, with reference to the butchers signing a petition to be compelled to stop selling meat on Sunday, even as the bakers of Boston last year petitioned the Legislature of the State to stop them from selling bread on Sunday, the Review says:—

That the existing Sunday legislation has a bad side, which ought most seriously to be taken into account when its praises are sung, is evident when we hear such facts as the petition of the Clare market butchers mentioned above. They were so accustomed to walk in legislative leading-strings, that they had lost all notion that there was a right thing for them to do, and that they could do it. From all we can learn of the wants and habits of the London poor, we think it a work of necessity that these butchers should open their shops during a part of Sunday. But if they do not think so, why do they not shut their shops? They say they are afraid to shut them—that their neighbors would get the start of them, their custom would fall off, and they would be ruined. But thousands of Jews shut their shops on Saturday, and take their chance of ruin; why can not Christians imitate them on Sunday? If the traders put this as a matter of conscience, let them be ruined; why should the State stand between an honest man and the sacrifice his conscience demands of him? But if they treat it as a matter of expediency, and calculate probabilities, we think the true answer is this. If the poor require that these shops should be open on Sunday, it is on the whole expedient that the shops should be open, rather than that the butchers should have an entire holiday. If the poor do not require these shops to be open, or so far as they do not require it, the probability is that no one would be ruined by closing his business premises on Sunday.

Even Mr. Crafts's two pet, but conflicting, arguments, First, that if the Sunday is not protected by law, the manufacturer's greed for gain, will gradually compel all artisans to labor on Sunday, and Second, that more work can be done in six days than in seven, and so that the laborers, if they work seven days, will finally have to do it for six days' wages,—even these arguments, it seems, did not originate in Mr. Crafts's fertile brain, but he found them all ready to his hand. The *Review* says:—

The defenders of Sunday legislation tell us not only that all would be forced to keep open shop, but that the workman will give seven days' work for six days' wages. Has it ever occurred to them to ask whether continental laborers do this, and if so how it can happen that their employers do not reap any advantage from it. Both propositions can not be true—that the masters will make their servants work seven days because it is profitable, and that it is unprofitable to make servants work more than six.

As to the distinction between innocent and harmful amusements, and the prohibition of the latter on Sunday, the *Review* says:—

If we attempt to lay down any rules as to what amusements are, and what are not, innocent, we are at once beset with infinite difficulties. What is an amusement? A clergyman lately told us that he had been severely censured by a Sabbatarian for carrying a walking-stick on Sunday. . . . We despair after this, of finding any amusement that all will agree in as innocent. We must leave the matter to the decision of conscience and taste. . . . If we amuse ourselves, it is said, what is to hinder a continental Sunday being transplanted into England? A continental Sunday!—that is the bugbear.

Yes, that is the bugbear still, and in this country, as well as in England, while Tennyson says "Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change," we can see that those grooves "do but run in cycles," and so far as Sunday law argument is concerned, "There is nothing new under the sun."
