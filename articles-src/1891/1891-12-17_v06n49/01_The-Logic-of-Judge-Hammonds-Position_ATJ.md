A LEGAL can only create an interest in legal things, and so can only create an interest in legal things with legal people. The union of civil law and ecclesiasticism has never been and never will be anything else than an "alliance of fraud and force to degrade the nations, a compact of the priest and the tyrant to crush the right of conscience; a combination of regal and priestly arrogance."

We object to Sunday laws not because they require the observance of that particular day, but because of the *principle* involved. If the people are wrong, if they work hardship and injustice, they lead to idolatry from heart service to God, thus making hypocrites. Pugsley their motive may proceed from heart service, yet the fact remains for the laboring man, the fact remains that the great majority of those who are always laws make the demand simply because they repeal Sunday or a sacred day. Therefore the passage of a Sunday law at best interferes in religious matters, and involves the judicial decision of religious questions. It follows that by establishing law the State usurps a prerogative of God.

No Very Rev. Dr. Thomas Bouquillon, of the Catholic University, writing from France, to the *Catholic Review*, of the miraculous cures claimed to be performed at Lourdes, says "God made both the temporal, says Holy Writ; and truly in politics as well as in religion, France shall be healed and once more lead in the way."

This political alliance of the clergy with the people is, of course, the national desire of every loyal Roman Catholic. But these utterances are very familiar to us from other than the lines from which they are naturally to be expected. In this one sentence is expressed the two distinctive features of the platform of the "National Reform" party, which did not originate in a Roman Catholic; but yet not from a source which would wish to acknowledge itself even remotely with Roman Catholicism. Yet, the acceptance of the religious fiction of the personal responsibility of the Nation to God, as a corporate body, and the oneness of clergy and people, Church and State, in politics as in religion; are the distinguishing marks of the Roman Catholic and the National Reformer alike. This is a sufficiently broad foundation upon which to establish Church and State, and upon this it will be built, but when finished the structure will be papal.

In an unofficial communication of later date than his dictum, in the King case, Judge Hammond has gone over the same ground again, and has made some additional statements which are of interest as well as of importance in connection with the statements which we have already noticed from the dictum.

After reiterating one of the main propositions of his opinion upon the keeping of Sunday, like the religion upon which it is founded, belongs to the people as a characteristic preamble, that "since" fore religion is essentially a part of the laws, and its preservation as such "a necessity of statesmanship"--he makes the following important statement:--

*The logic of this position may lead to a union of Church and State, and if it does, it does; and we are not alarmed, indeed often observe, to see it.*

In the review of the dictum of Judge Hammond we have demonstrated against it that it is not in conflict with the civic degree of religious freedom. In view of these statements we should like the Judge to explain just what is the civic degree of religious freedom.

Yet further, and in his very last words, so far, on the subject, he still justifies the sentence in the following statement:--

It is also noticeable that the early Christians brought the curse of their masters upon the old religion by a disregard of their holy days, and for this they were first persecuted by the law as they did now differentiate between the Jews and the Seventh-day Adventists.

We are not by any means ready to admit that it is the early Christians who do not now differentiate the Jews and the Seventh-day Adventists. Neither the early Christians, nor any other Christians, either *now* or at any other time, ever held such a doctrine as that any man, because he is not a Christian, may persecute one that is a Christian. It is true that the early Christians were persecuted, by "due process of law" too, precisely as the Jews and the Seventh-day Adventists are now persecuted by "due process of law." The persecution is the same, because, as we in the same "process of law" by which the persecution was then legalized and justified, but the manifestation of the "inscrutable tendency of the logic" of the page "principles of human conduct" just the same then as now, and precisely the same as it is only it is now.

The early persecuted Jews and Seventh-day Adventist, THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, with all its corps of workers from editor-in-chief to office boy, is glad to stand, and to be classed with the early Christians, to bear their reproach, and to share their sufferings; as we know that in suffering with them, we are suffering with Him with whom they suffered. And "if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we shall also reign with Him." And he is the Author of a religious liberty which is in conflict with no "civic degree of religious freedom."

Church and State is logically inherent in the position assumed throughout that document. It is well therefore for our readers to know that he sees and acknowledges the union thing himself. And from this it is perfectly proper, as well as logical, to inquire, Is it the prerogative of a judge of a United States Court to include from his official seat the doctrine of a union of Church and State in these United States? At his induction into that responsible office he took a solemn oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which, both in its principles and its specific precepts, is diametrically opposed to a union of Church and State and to every position the logic of which would lead to a union of Church and State.

His logic, that it is not essential to get to the end of one's logic, is as puerile as is the other political government making a practical thing harmless in itself to prevent "breach of the peace." It is a pitiable thing indeed when a person builds upon maintaining a position, the logic of which is in anything to oblige to be illegitimate and. But this is not all that enters in the case. It would be bad enough were this so only with him as an individual.

But this is not so. He occupies the place of a judge of the United States, a representative of the judicial department, of the Government of the United States. As such he has spoken; as such he has taken this position; and as such he has given to the position, as far as he in his lay, the sanction of the Government of the offices which he holds. And just as certainly as the position which he has taken, should be confirmed, by the higher court as the position of the Government, just so certainly it would be the sanction and forever beyond his power to either check or to recall the logic of it in any way; and just as certainly would the religious element that has already seized and favored it to this thing, use that the logic of the position is carried fully to the end which even he sees and acknowledges involves it. The logic of the argument is the statement of it.
