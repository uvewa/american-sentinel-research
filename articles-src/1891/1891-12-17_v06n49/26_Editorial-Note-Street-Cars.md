THE Colorado Graphic says: "Stop the street cars on Sunday and see how quickly the threadbare members of the Law and Order League who cannot afford the luxury of a horse and carriage will interpose in their own behalf." Certainly they would; the persons who are so ready to dictate to others as to how they shall spend Sunday do not expect to be restricted in the least in their own actions. If a law were passed that in any way restricted their movements on any day, it would be promptly denounced as an unwarranted interference with their sacred rights. Indeed they are so bigoted and so wrapped up in self that they think all the world should do on Sunday just as they say; and they cannot be happy until they have it in their power to compel this very thing.
