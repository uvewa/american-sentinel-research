ARCHBISHOP JOHN IRELAND thus calls his fellow-religionists to take an active part in prosecutions and persecutions under the Sunday laws: "I have noticed with much regret that in movements of citizens to enforce the Sunday laws of the country, Catholics are not in large numbers among the foremost combatants. This may rise from some singular political ideas held by them, but no political ideas must prevail against such obligations as those binding us to the observance of the Sunday."

Certainly not, for Sunday and its observance is that to which the Roman Catholic points as the proof of the dominance of the form of ecclesiasticism which he represents, whether it be acknowledged or not.
