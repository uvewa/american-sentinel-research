Under the heading, "Organizing to Defend the Sabbath," the *Christian Statesman*, of November 26, publishes in detail the method of organization of a "Rest Day League." In this is uncovered the inquisitorial purposes of the combination. There is a startling parallel to be drawn between the methods of this would be arch-inquisitor of the nineteenth century used here, and the account of the first steps in the organization of the Inquisition, when it was enjoined upon the bishops "to bind in every parish a priest and two or three, or more, laymen by oath, to search out heretics," and to aid these a "new order was founded called the *Militia Jesu Christi contra hereticos*. [The soldiery of Jesus Christ against heretics.] The Church, however, contented itself, with the examination of the heretics, and called on the secular arm to carry the sentence into execution." The life principle of the Inquisition,—that religious dissent is a crime punishable by civil law,—has but lain dormant for a few generations, scorched not killed, and now raises its serpent-head again. Mark the secret investigating committee of four or more, the appointment of which is here recommended, and consider whether the livery of Satan has been, is, or ever can be, the distinctive apparel of the servants of God:—

The editor being recently in St. Louis to conduct the "Forum of Reforms," and C. L. S. C. Round Table, in a four-day Chatauqua, afterward organized a Rest Day League for that city, which had hitherto neither a Sabbath Association nor a Law and Order League. The Rest Day League is both of these in one. Its Constitution or plan of work is mostly in the following, from Article V. "—

"Committees shall be appointed as follows: The Secretary or Secretaries shall appoint an investigating committee of four or more, known only to themselves, some of whom on each Sabbath shall by personal observation ascertain what violations of the law of the State and of humanity are in progress, and report fully, in writing, to the Secretary as a basis for reports from him to the Board, to guide its work, and to the public by the press and platform, and to civil officers as an urgent incentive to fidelity on their part. The President shall appoint committees: (1) On furnishing matter to the press. (2) On circulation of literature. (3) On voluntary closing of places of labor and business. (4) On securing and forwarding petitions against Sunday opening of the World's Fair.

"The whole Constitution will be sent to any who apply with stamp.

(5) On public meetings. (6) On legislation

The Secretary is expected to report somewhat as follows, every Monday, what has been reported to him by his investigating committee.

## AN OPEN LETTER.

To the Mayor, Chief of Police, Sheriff, County Attorney, and other Public Officers of the City and County:

The Rest Day League yesterday ascertained, through its Investigation Committee, that our humane Sabbath law, designed to protect employes against needless work, and merchants against unfair competition on the general rest day, is being violated as indicated in the following table:

Bakers open, . closed. . . ; barbers open. . . , closed. . . ; butchers open. . . , closed. . . ; clothiers open. . . , closed. . . ; grocers open. . . , closed. . . ; etc. Although the front doors of saloons were closed, the sounds that came from within, and the persons seen entering from without, make it evident that the law is being violated. These violations of law are so open that the officers appointed for enforcement of law can procure all necessary evidence, and we shall not furnish such evidence until we have given such officers opportunity to redeem themselves from the implication of willful neglect of duty. We have no doubt that some officers and some of the violators of the Sunday law do not know what the law is, and we therefore urge the authorities of the city or county to proclaim it through the press and by bulletins. We also urge that the city council pass such a screen ordinance as is now in force in many other cities, to reduce the difficulty of law enforcement in the case of saloons.

[Signed] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Secretary of Rest Day League.
President.
1891.

The Committee on furnishing matter to the press will find the papers willing to publish far more on reform than they usually do, if it is furnished to them regularly, in brief and readable form. The Endeavor Societies and the Epworth Leagues together form the Committee on Circulation of Literature, and are expected to divide up the city and put Sabbath reform documents in English, or German, into every home. The Committee on voluntary closing is composed of Woman's Christian Temperance Union workers, who will present to those merchants who keep open on the Sabbath, an agreement like the following:

"The undersigned persons engaged in mercantile pursuits in the city (or town) of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
hereby express their conviction that there would be great gain in health and happiness and in good morals, and no loss even in profits if Sunday traffic were entirely suspended (except sales of milk and medicines for not more than two hours of the day), and any of the undersigned who have previously opened their places of business for any part of the day, agree to conform to the above plan of a universal closing (with exceptions stated), if such a closing can be secured."

It is hoped, also, to persuade those whose opening is partly a work of mercy or necessity, such as druggists, hotels, and eating houses, to cut down their hours by a joint agreement to that effect, for example: "The undersigned druggists agree that they will not sell on the Sabbath anything except prescribed medicines and surgical appliances, and that they will not open except from 9 to 10 A. M., and 5 to 6 P. M., (or will not open except as called from their houses by emergencies of sickness, or will not open except in turn, one drug store each Sabbath."

"The undersigned hotels and eating houses, in consideration of waiters' rights of conscience and right to rest, will on the Sabbath, limit the meals to 8-9.30, 12.30-1.30, and 6-7."

The Young Mens' Christian Association furnishes the Committee on Public Meetings; the Evangelical Alliance, the Committee on Reducing Sunday Work in the Post Office.

The Committee on Legislation is to secure a screen ordinance to uncover the interior of saloons at hours they are required to close, as many cities have already done. This committee is also to cooperate with other leagues in the State, to secure repeal of the unjust exception in the State Sabbath law, leaving provision dealers outside of its protection. The amendment manhood of the city, as far as possible, is put into the Committee on Sunday Saloons, who will seek to unite both radicals and conservatives, in compelling even saloons to respect the law.

A young lawyer of ability, Mr. J. L. Secor, has been secured as secretary, in the hope that he will be salaried, and so his whole energy secured for this work, for which every other city of the rank of St. Louis supports one or more agents.

This League has been thus fully described, that like organizations, formed and to be formed, may have the benefits of its practical plan of work.

Such an organization is not a new society, but a realization of the proposed "federation of churches" in a very practical form, with kindred organizations added.

The editor came on a curious instance of discouragement in connection with one of the Rest Day Leagues. The president had given up because only fæste persons came to a business meeting. Preacher that he was, he forgot that twelve men had changed not only a city, but the world. The best Law and Order League in the land has been carried on for years by four men. Ten would have saved Sodom. One subdued Nineveh. Let us not count but conquer.

Strangely contradictory and unaccountable as it may seem, the very next article is a paragraph headed "Religion Recognized but Not Enforced," in which the statement is made, in the face of the previous recommendation for the appointment of an inquisitorial committee to search out and report to "the Mayor, Chief of Police, Sheriff, County Attorney," etc., for indictment, those who fail to obey the civil law for the observance of the religious rest on Sunday,—that "no religious observance of the Sabbath is, or should be, enforced by law." If anything were lacking to complete the parallel of the initial methods of organization of the medieval and the modern Inquisition, it is the jesuitical ability here shown of blowing hot and cold in the same breath, of affirming and denying the same thing, in different language, in the same or adjoining paragraphs.
