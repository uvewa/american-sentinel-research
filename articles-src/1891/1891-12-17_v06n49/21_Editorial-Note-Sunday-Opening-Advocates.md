THE very words of the title, "Advocates of Sunday Opening," used by the *Stafesman*, and other advocates of Sunday closing by compulsion of law, is indicative of their inability, or unwillingness, to understand the principles involved in this question, and which animate the Religious Liberty Association as well as all other intelligent opponents of religious legislation. The advocates of legal Sunday closing proceed aggressively from the intolerant conviction that all, irrespective of religious opinion, or practice, or personal wish, should be compelled to close their exhibits on Sunday. They are so fully possessed by this spirit, and by an intensity of mistaken belief, that they are thus doing God service, that they seem unable to comprehend, in an opponent, any position except one that is in complete antithesis to their own, and would make the statement of the case "Enforced Sunday opening so enforced Sunday closing." Such a statement of the position of the Religious Liberty Association as this is just as far from the truth as to attribute to it the advocacy of Sunday closing by law. The principle which animates this Association is succinctly expressed in the Declaration at the head of these columns, "We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions." This principle applies equally to affirmative and negative legislation. If any should ask that the general government, or a municipality, should commit itself to the enforcement of a law for Sunday opening, instead of a law for Sunday closing, the Religious Liberty Association would oppose it with equal earnestness, for either would be equally intolerant with the other. As opponents of such measures as these the Association stands on the sure foundation of Christian charity and sound Christian statesmanship found in God's word. Is it moral blindness, or intellectual inability, from which arises the incapacity to comprehend a position so clearly stated?
