It is said that more than fifty thousand blank petitions have been sent out to ministers of different denominations, for them and their congregations to sign, praying Congress to interfere in the municipal regulations of the city of Chicago and require that the gates of the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. The unconstitutionality of that which is asked probably does not appear quite so plainly in the language of the petition, but for Congress to assume a local authority in the municipal affairs of Chicago, or any other city outside the District of Columbia, is just as unconstitutional stated in one set of words as another. Congress may regulate the Government exhibit, its own especial charge, but beyond that it has no more specific and local authority than it has over the rest of Chicago or over the city of New York.
