We object to Sunday laws not because they require the observance of that particular day but because of the principle involved. Sunday laws are wrong, they work hardship and injustice, they tend to destroy free heart service to God, thus making hypocrites. Disguise their motives as they may by pleas for a rest day for the laboring man, the fact remains that the great majority of those who desire such laws make the demand because they regard Sunday as a sacred day. Therefore the passage of a Sunday law is State interference in religious matters, and involves the judicial decision of religious questions. It follows that by enacting such laws the State usurps a prerogative of God.
