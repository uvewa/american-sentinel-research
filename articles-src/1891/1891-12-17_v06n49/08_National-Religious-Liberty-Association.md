DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and regard it the duty of every American citizen to do so.

We believe it is the right of every civil government to legislate in regard to civil matters; but we deny the right of any civil government to legislate on matters of religion; or in any way to unite religion with civil government.

We believe it is not only the right, but the duty of every individual to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience, so long as he does not interfere with the equal rights of others.

We believe it is the duty of every citizen to assist in preserving the fundamental principles on which our Government was based, viz.: the total separation of Church and State, as guaranteed by the national and State constitutions.

We also believe it our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the United States Congress or by any State Legislature; to oppose every movement tending to unite Church and State; and to resist every encroachment of the rights of conscience by any civil authority.

R. C. PORTER.

The theatres of Spokane, Washington, have been closed on Sunday evening by the order of the Mayor, and the managers have agreed to the order. Everything that could be done to suppress vice was left at the discretion of the Mayor, and he has been bold in his declaration of what his government, by his coercing command to be done. It is to be observed also, that it shut the theatre goers of that city in one sight.

The *Observer* says our ministers, and laymen, and others, "must, if necessarily, further take part in this one kind of politics, the politics that relates to the morals, social order and public." Where in the language of the Scriptures are ministers told to "take the sceptre" as it does in these, or of similar import words as these? Does the *Observer*, in this, state of the mind of the Master, who taught the disciples they should bear toward their Roman oppressors?

BUTTERCUTS are to be deprived of their beans and Boston brown bread breakfast, on Sunday mornings. In a discussion on the condition of the labors of Boston and their stubbornness has been objected to be used for the first time, various Bostonians have concluded that they can not refrain from selling and kitchen customers baked beans and baked Boston on Sunday without they have an act of the Legislature to pass it that has and that, on their front door. If these plain and customary articles of Sunday are not sinful some others the community of the year round, who would ever remember the seventh day to go out and buy baked beans and brown bread for Sunday?

A recent, as clergyman of Bridgeport, Connecticut, having no pulpit, asks to be empowered, that he would deliver, on Sunday evenings, a series of discourses on the land's lack, from whom he had but just returned, and, to make more vivid the impression of scriptural scenes illustrated with pictures from Palestine by stereopticon views was requested. To his purpose the discourse of the church objected strenuously, on several grounds, one of which is said, standard morality of the Divine Laws, attributed to Constitution, whereas a man was prohibited from kissing his wife, or even teaching her to guide the gates of one. The discourse, with stereopticon accompaniment was given in the town hall, to overflowing houses, when it was not possible that the morals of the community could be injured by them!
