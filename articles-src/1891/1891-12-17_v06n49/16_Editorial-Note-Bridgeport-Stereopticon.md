A POPULAR clergyman of Bridgeport, Connecticut, recently gave notice to his congregation that he would deliver, on Sunday evenings, a series of discourses on the Holy Land, from whence he had but just returned, and, to make more vivid the impressions of scriptural incident, illustrations of scenes from Palestine by stereopticon views were promised. To his surprise the deacons of the church objected strenuously, on several grounds, one of which it is said, smacked strongly of the ancient Blue Laws, attributed to Connecticut, wherein a man was prohibited from kissing his wife, or lovers from hanging over the garden gate on Sunday. The discourses, with stereopticon accompaniment were delivered on other evenings of the week, when it was not possible that the morals of the community could be injured by them.
