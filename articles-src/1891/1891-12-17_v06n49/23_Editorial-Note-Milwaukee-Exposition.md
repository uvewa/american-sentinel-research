THE Milwaukee Exposition, the past summer, has been opened on Sundays; no civil disorder has resulted, although the attendance reached as high as twenty thousand, larger than that of any other day.

This is worthy of notice as evidence that the demand for Sunday closing of the World's Fair, at Chicago, has no foundation in experience, from which to claim the necessity of closing to avoid civil difficulties and confusion.

The desire to enforce religion by law is the sole motive.
