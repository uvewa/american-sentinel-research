The *Colorado Graphic* says: "Stop the Sunday car lines now and see how quickly the streetcar members of the Law and Order Leagues that can be enacted. The luxury of a horse and carriage will interpose in their own behalf." Certainly they would, the person who was so ready to declare to others as to how they shall spend their time, never carries his intent in the least in their own actions. If a law were passed that in no way restricted their convenience in any day, it would be promptly denounced as an unwarranted interference with their sacred rights. Indeed they are so bigoted and so wrapped up in self that don Sunday just as they say; and they should copy Sunday just as they say; and it is their power to compel until they have it in their power to compel the very thing.

As fellow-religionists take an active part in prosecutions and persecutions of any person for Sunday work, it argues so much regret that in movements of citizens to enforce the Sunday laws of the country, Catholics are not in large numbers. Mr. Lepors' allusion to the political. This may rise from some singular hold of ideas held by them, but no political ideas must prevail against acts and conclusions those binding us to the observance of such days.

Certainly not, for Sunday and its observance is wholly a Catholic institution; Catholic as the proof of the dominance of the form of ecclesiasticism which he represents, whether it be acknowledged--

In his department of "Christian Civilization" in the *Christian Nation*, the Rev. J. Coleman, Professor of Political Science, at Geneva College, Pennsylvania, says, "What is the most important, the greatest, the oldest political question of the time." Was it from the Bible, or from political science, or from Government theology, that this professor of political science drew the conclusion that the Sabbath question is an ancient political question? Did Jehovah from the beginning commit his Sabbath to the keeping of the word political? Professor Coleman's Quotation of "Moses at the head of" ...observe commandeth" is a positively unhappy

one. Moses was not a political boss, neither was he raised to a position of authority by the suffrage of the Jewish people, but he was directly called of God. He who argues that government as now administered should enforce the law of God as that government of which Moses was the divinely appointed representative exercised it, argues that faiths, folks, corruptly, human majorities possess the divine prerogative, and demands a return to the ancient pagan Roman blasphemy, that the voice of the people is the voice of God.

THE *Sun* thus pointedly comments upon the action of the barbers' convention at Grand Rapids, Michigan: -- "Why should the Barbers' International Union ask the State legislatures to enact laws prohibiting all the barbers of the United States from offering their chairs on Sunday? There is no law in any State requiring barbers to engage in Sunday work. Every barber in the country is at liberty to refuse to shave anybody, or trim anybody's heard, or cut anybody's hair, on Sunday. Any barber has the right to close and bar his shop every Sunday of the year. The International Barbers' Union had better let the legislatures and the States attend to public affairs while its members regulate their own business. No proposed legislation would not touch the root of the matter. What the legislatures must do, if they would give substantial relief to the barbers, is to pass predominantly forbidding beards to grow on Sunday.

*The Christian Union* notes the appointment of Rev. Dr. William A. Bartlett, of Washington, D. C., to a place on the board of management, of the House of the Good Shepherd, a Roman Catholic institution, and thinks that "Protestants and non-Catholics will be alert, or they will be left behind by their Roman Catholic brethren in a genuine emulation for preeminence in Christian catholicity." On Sunday Dec. 6, Rev. W. F. Crafts, apostle and large, to preach the enforced observance of the Roman Sunday, shifted the Roman Catholic pulpits in Newark, New Jersey. History verifies the truthfulness of the statement that "Rome never changes." Who is it that has changed that this union of effort must take place and in the condition for the furtherance of a Protestant, or a Catholic idea?

It is narrated in a London paper that the Bishop of Salisbury had offered to set an old labourer on his estate the position of lodge-keeper, at the Bishop's house, a life situation; but that the conscientious old man refused the place, for the reason that he was a nonconformist, and supposed, if he accepted personal service under the bishop, he would be required to attend

church instead of chapel, and this he would not do. However, when the bishop heard his story the man was nevertheless retained at his post. He simply "found worship where he pleased." This incident the *Northwestern* comments on as "quite creditable to both persons." Ordinarily this transaction was evidence of honest religious conviction on the part of the laborer, but what does it prove in the bishop? It is shown by his actions that he and his kind have enforced a subservancy to religion so complete and strict in that neighborhood that even the most man's unconsionably accepted condition of servitude. With humble him standing the alternative is the alternative; but it is accomplished. The reason that it is that religionists should assure to "grant" free toleration that freedom which is of God at their begetting, and never had power to any one else either to yield or withhold?

The first issue of the *Christian Statesman*, under the new management, gives in the first column a leading cuts of the heart of Jerusalem which "had been sealed" and announces the same ideal as that used by the Seventh-day Adventists in the publication of prophecy; the American eagle, brooding over the stars and stripes, from the fly leaf of the publication of the National Religious Liberty Association; and an illustration of that famous sentence "laid down every Saturday night" by Jesus into the supremacy of "National Christianity," these illustrated and entitled: "The Most Active Advocates of Sunday Reform for their right by every subscriber to THE SENTINEL, and every member of the Religious Liberty Association. The *Statesman* is the clearest demonstration given before for an argument in refutation of Sabbath legislation ever issued. Not so clearly and as continuously presented in the editorial.

The *Christian Nation*, of December 5, has an editorial paragraph in reference to the Christian *Statesman*.

Our readers will bear testimony that no word that we have written has been prompted by any feelings other than of good will for its success. To the *Covenanter* Church that paper and the organization it represented were very dear. In its organ the *Christian Nation* has been unable to join in the good wishes of many others. It is recommended that under the new management it will be broader, better, and more liberal, covered, and *National Reform*'s principle fundamental to all the others. Covenanting nation has not been its foundation hitherto, nor is it since doing the work it was originally established to do? "Broader, better, and more liberal." These words are scarcely complimentary to Mr. Wylie and to any one connected with the *Christian Nation*. "more liberal," would have satisfied the *Christian Statesman*; but to-day we have to notice that there is a tendency to go faster than is prudent. We prefer the *Christian Nation* before the *Statesman* and not the *Christian Statesman* before the *Christian Nation*.

The policy of manipulation by division of force in active operation in National Reform matters, does not result in the *Christian Nation* giving up its favorite competitor, but the first result is the above reception, that its objects to a new thing from itself, by real principles of the Christianity of the New, from letters published by the *Christian Nation* of Allegheny, Pa.

God is opening the way, and those parties who are working against religious liberty will discover, discover, discover defect, if there be any, and charge them. They sit in the council of men against the one. But with all means they can to disconcert the work of America in the cause of religious liberty.

Some people can not comprehend how any one could be opposed to Sunday laws or to the
