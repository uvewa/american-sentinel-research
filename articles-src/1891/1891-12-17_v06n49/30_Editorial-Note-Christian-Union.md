THE Christian Union notes the appointment of Rev. Dr. William A. Bartlett, of Washington, D. C., to a place on the board of management of the House of the Good Shepherd, a Roman Catholic institution, and thinks that "Protestants will need to be alert, or they will be left behind by their Roman Catholic brethren in a generous emulation for preeminence in Christian catholicity." On Sunday Dec. 6, Rev. W. F. Crafts, apostle at large to preach the enforced observance of the American Sunday, filled Roman Catholic pulpits in Newark, New Jersey. History verifies the truthfulness of the statement that "Rome never changes." Who then has changed that this union of effort might take place, and is the coalition for the furtherance of a Protestant, or a Roman Catholic, dogma?
