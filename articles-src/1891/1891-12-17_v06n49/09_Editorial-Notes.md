The very words of the title "Advocate of Sunday Opening," used by the *Statesman*, and other advocates of Sunday closing by its committee of law, is indicative of their inability, or unwillingness, to understand the principles in the law of the land, and which animate the Religious Liberty Association in its efforts against the proposed religious legislation. The advocates of legal Sunday enforcement are proceeding upon the protestant conviction that all, irrespective of religious opinion, or position, or personal will, should be compelled to close their exhibits on Sunday. They are so fully possessed by this spirit, such by an intensity of sinister belief, that they are thus doing God service, that they seem unable to conceive that, in an opponent, any position except one that is in complete subversion to their own, and would make the statement of the one "Enforced Sunday opening vs. enforced Sunday closing;" such a statement of the position of the Religious Liberty Association as this is just as far from the truth as an advocate is to the advocacy of Sunday closing by law. The principle which animates the Religious Liberty Association is that of opposition to the enforcement of legislation on religious lines at the head of three columns. "We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions." This principle applies equally as affirmative and negative legislation. If any should ask that the general government, or a municipality, should commit itself to the enforcement of a law for Sunday opening, instead of a law for Sunday closing, the Religious Liberty Association would oppose it with equal earnestness; for either would be equally insistence as those the Association stands on the sure foundation of Christian charity and sound Christian statesmanship found in truly work. It stands for freedom, or intellectual inability, from which action the incapacity to comprehend a position so utterly itself.

It is said that more than fifty thousand blank petitions have been sent out to ministers of different denominations, for them and their congregations to sign, praying Congress to influence the municipal Republicans of the city of Chicago and the Commissioners of the World's Fair to close on Sunday. The unconstitutionality of that which is asked partially lost its unconstitutionality in the language of the petition, but for Congress to assume a local authority in the municipal affairs of Chicago, or any other city outside the District of Columbia, is just as unconstitutional asked is one act of work as another. Congress may regulate the Government exhibit, in its own special charge, but beyond that it has no more specific and local authority than it has over the rest of Chicago or over the city of New York.

The Midwinter Exposition, this past summer, has been opened on Sundays; no civil disorder has resulted, although the attendance reached as high as twenty thousand, larger than that of any other single day.

This is worthy of notice as evidence that the expectation of rowdyism from Sunday opening in Chicago, has no foundation in experience, from the Midwinter exposition is such a fact as to give civil difficulties and confusion.

The penalty for breaking a Sunday law by no life administration.

Since it has been decided to remove the Christian Statesman to Pittsburg, active efforts seem to have been made to purge that field of the Sunday newspaper, and to suppress all Sunday labor which to preach the gospel of law and salvation, through toll gates, philosophy. On Sunday, Nov. 1, just about the time that the German comedian Joseph E. King case, and was with the German comedian Joseph E. King, the delivery wagon and cars, and a barber, were arrested for violation of the Sunday law.
