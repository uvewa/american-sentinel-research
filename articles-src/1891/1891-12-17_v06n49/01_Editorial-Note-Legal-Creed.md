A LEGAL creed can only create an irreligious people. The union of civil law and ecclesiasticism has never been and never will be anything else than an "alliance of fraud and force to degrade the nations, a compact of the priest and the potentate to crush the rights of conscience; a combination of regal and prelatic tyranny to repress true religion."
