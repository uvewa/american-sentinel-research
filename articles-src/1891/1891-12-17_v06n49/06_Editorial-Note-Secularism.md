The term "secularism," is often used as though it were a synonym of "infidelity"; but this is not the case. "Secularism" means, "The state or quality of being secular;" and "secular" means, "Pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy." "Secularism" is not, therefore, a synonym for infidelity, and very many Christians and some Christian papers are secularists, that is, they believe in keeping Church and State entirely separate.
