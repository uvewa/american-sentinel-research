THE PRIME DEFECT IN THE WHOLE NATIONAL REFORM SYSTEM IS THE VIEW THAT THE STATE IS A PERSON, AND IN FACT, A MORAL PERSON; that it is an *individual*, distinct from the citizens who compose it, as one individual is distinct from another. But the State is no such thing. The State is no more a personality than the Patriotic Order of the Sons of America is a personality. The State as an individual cannot do anything. The action of the State is only the action of the majority of the individuals who compose it, or their representatives. It becomes their action, theirs is the responsibility; and the morality or the immorality, the real right or wrong of what is done attaches to the individual men who are concerned in it. The State is not an end; it is only a means by which to accomplish an end. It is an organization formed by men by which to protect themselves and the rights which they possess, and that is all that it is.
