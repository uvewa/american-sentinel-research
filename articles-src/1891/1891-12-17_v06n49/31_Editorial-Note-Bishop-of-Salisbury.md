It is narrated in a London paper that the Bishop of Salisbury had offered to an old laborer on his estate the position of lodge-keeper, at the bishop's palace, a life situation; but that the conscientious old man refused the place, for the reason that he was a nonconformist, and supposed, if he accepted personal service under the bishop, he would be required to attend church instead of chapel, and this he would not do. However, when the bishop heard his story the man was nevertheless retained, and "granted full freedom to worship where he pleased." This incident the Northwestern comments on as "alike creditable to both persons." Certainly this transaction was evidence of honest religious conviction on the part of the laborer, but what does it prove in reference to the bishop? It shows that he and his kind have enforced a subserviency in religion so complete and of such long continuance as to have made it an unconsciously accepted condition of servitude. With humble sturdiness the man accepts the alternative; but is it as creditable to the bishop that he in his lofty graciousness should assume to "grant" that freedom which is of God from the beginning, and never belonged to any one else either to yield or withhold?
