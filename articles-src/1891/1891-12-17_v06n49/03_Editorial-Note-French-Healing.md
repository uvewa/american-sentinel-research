THE Very Rev. Dr. Thomas O'Gorman, of the Catholic University, writing from France, to the Catholic Review, of the miraculous cures claimed to be performed at Lourdes, says: "God hath made the nations healable, says Holy Writ; and truly if the French clergy and people become one in politics as well as religion, France shall be healed and once more lead in the van of civilization."

This political alliance of the clergy with the people is, of course, the natural desire of every loyal Roman Catholic. But these utterances are very familiar to us from other lips than those from which they are naturally to be expected. In this one sentence is expressed the two distinctive features of the platform of the "National Reform" party, which did not originate in a Roman Catholic country nor from a source which would wish to acknowledge itself even tinctured with Roman Catholicism. Yet, the acceptance of the religious fiction of the personal responsibility of the Nation to God, as a corporate body, and the oneness of clergy and people, Church and State, in politics as in religion; are the distinguishing marks of the Roman Catholic and the National Reformer alike. This is a sufficiently broad foundation upon which to establish Church unity, and upon this it will be built, but when finished the structure will be papal.
