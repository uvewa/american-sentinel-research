In his department of "Christian Politics," in the Christian Nation, Rev. W. J. Coleman, Professor of Political Science, Geneva College, Pennsylvania, says of the Sabbath question, "This is perhaps the oldest political question of the time." Was it from the Bible, or from political science, or from Covenanter theology, that this professor of political science drew the conclusion that the Sabbath question is an ancient political question? Did Jehovah from the beginning commit his Sabbath to the keeping of the ward politician? Professor Coleman's illustration of "Moses at the head of the Hebrew commonwealth" is a peculiarly unhappy one. Moses was not a political boss, neither was he raised to a position of authority by the suffrages of the Jewish people, but he was directly called of God. He who argues that government as now administered should enforce the law of God as that government of which Moses was the divinely appointed representative executed it, argues that fallible, fickle, corruptible, human majorities possess the divine prerogative, and demands a return to the ancient pagan Roman blasphemy, that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
