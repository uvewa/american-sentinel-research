BOSTONIANS are to be deprived of their baked beans and Boston brown bread hereafter, on Sunday, by legislative enactment, if the joint petition of the bakers of Boston and their stablemen has any weight with the Legislature. These representative Bostonians have concluded that they can not refrain from selling and delivering brown bread and baked beans on Sunday without they have an act of the Legislature to paste in their hat and tack on their front door. If these plain and customary articles of Sunday diet are refused to Bostonians on Sunday it will certainly cause them to "Remember the seventh day to go and buy baked beans and brown bread for Sunday."
