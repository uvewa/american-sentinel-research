THE policy of multiplication by division is still in active operation in National Reform matters, and that it will result in an increased earnestness, almost competitive, for the rapid propagation of their principles is shown by such expressions as these, from letters published by the *Christian Nation*:—

God is opening the way, and those parties who have managed to take the *Christian Statesman* out of our control have greatly simplified matters for us. They will in some measure do the work that we have been doing; we will go on to do the work yet undone. Here's for the new crusade!

Yours fraternally,

That National Reform is just now passing through a crisis no one can doubt. With the sale of the *Christian Statesman*, its removal to Pittsburg, its editorial management, control and direction, now out of the hands of Covenanters, it appears that the National Reform Association, and National Reforms are in a critical situation; yet we know that "all things work together for good." As the Covenanter Church has been, and possibly through the near future will continue to be, the principle factor in National Reform work, she should at this juncture review the work of the past quarter century, discover defects, if there be any, and prepare herself for a "new campaign" for Christ, and the acknowledgment of his authority by this Nation.

Yours,

This separation of the National Reform cable into its individual ropes, to be twisted tighter and strengthened, will not lessen but increase its efficiency. It is really "helping Brother Crafts all the time to set stakes, and get ropes ready." The closer woven and better organized is each separate strand the stronger will be the rope of which they are the constituent parts.
