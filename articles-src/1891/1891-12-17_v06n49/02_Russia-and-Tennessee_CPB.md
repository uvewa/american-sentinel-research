The following quotations, from an account of Russia's treatment of the Jews, which appeared recently in the New York *World*, are applicable to a letter recently received from a resident of Tennessee, and printed in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, are so nearly parallel that we have but to change the name of Russia to that of Tennessee, and the name of Jew to that of Seventh-day Adventist, to imagine himself reading the same account:--

The Hebrews, of alternately obtains from labor on Saturday. It was considered by Ignatist authorities that the Jews could also have five resting days against other people's religion. Although there has been no law prohibiting Christian labor or business on Sunday, they are a compete and four State Sunday laws.

Russia knows that Sunday in the markets of business almost as dirty as he respects every any other day says that there are no Jews about. In spite of the persecution to which they are subjected, they are compelled to observe every Sunday for Christian; Sabbath-day, while the Christians will about works or loafers from working that day. If you walk through the Russian market you find Jewish shops, gipsies and Persians, whom no one molests.

In a place called the Gow, three or four miles from Batoum, there is a large Jewish settlement, who are very conscientious and devoted Christians. For many long ago we walked and talked with them for many years, they, with their young children, have been obliged in all kinds of work and other dealings on Sunday; but merely actually to the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath.

Russia knows that in the current condition, once their friends now became their foes, because they kept Saturday. The community was told something was said about Sunday desecration, no matter what a Jew's actual crime was, the word Sabbath was brought up. And that has led the nation in that vicinity to the present crisis.

Last week the Deputy Sheriff and two other men went to one of the farms, and while all hands were at work; and some of their nearest neighbors were among them. They hired a man to drive them in a buggy, to catch their innocent prey. These Seventh-day Adventists were taken before the County Clerk on that seventh-day observance before the courts for work on Sunday. Belonging to the Seventh-day Adventists.

The *World* correspondent writes from the place, near the place of persecution:

In a half mile from Dayton, and one can not describe the place in the large iron and coal and furnaces of the Dayton Coal and Iron Company, was situated, employing three hundred men, running night and day, all the year round. The town was with all its noise and bustle, producing one hundred and fifty tons of pig iron a day; and within a half a mile of the furnaces is the field where these men were at work.

Why should the Sheriff leave so great and pressing a business in the town of Dayton to go over a mountain and shirk around to find engaged and quiet men at work, and then arrest them on a pretense of war? Of course, it is not the interest of the State, and the farmers are good citizens. If it comes to seventh-day observers then it will be because they have the industry and thrift.

That those Russian methods of persecution should manifest themselves now and then in America is not strange, for the human heart is much the same the world over, but that they should receive the sanction of State and Federal courts, in the case of R. M. King, of Rhea Co., Tennessee, in this "land of the free," in 1891, is passing strange indeed.
