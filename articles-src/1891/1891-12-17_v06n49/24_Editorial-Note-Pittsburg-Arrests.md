SINCE it has been decided to remove the *Christian Statesman* to Pittsburg, active efforts seem to have been made to purge that city of its Sunday-breaking elements, and make it a fit place from which to preach the gospel of law and salvation, through the police court. On Sunday, Nov. 15, the manager of the Pittsburg Grand Opera House, together with the German comedian Joseph K. Emmett and twenty others, and nineteen hackmen, were arrested for violation of the Sunday law.
