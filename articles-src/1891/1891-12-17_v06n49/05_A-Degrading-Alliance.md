WHEN the Church appeals to the civil power for aid, it is a tacit admission that it is not sustained by divine power, and that God's cause is dependent on the State, and without government aid all will be lost. When the Church thus appeals to the civil power, her cry is, "Help, or we perish!" It limits the power of God and it places him in the position of an humble applicant before the State,--in the person of those that claim to be his representatives,--then it will give the State to the State which he is unable of himself to accomplish.

The theory of Church and State makes the State a divine creature, and the institution a divine adopter. He that man look to the State for religious instruction; it must direct him to a life of righteousness, direct him in the way of righteousness.

When the Church places her herself in line to be the cause of God on the "ship of State," it is consigned to the uncertain fallows of political opinion to whatever change as often as popular sentiment may chance to dispose. It makes the voice of the people the will of God, in harmony with priestly desire above the voice of Jot. And all then will of the people centers in the chief magistrate his decrees must be considered the decrees of God. Like the papacy theory in the days of the papacy, it constitutes the ruler of the government a god; or in other words, its theory of religion and the State is both authoritarianism and pagan.

Those that have contended for union of religion and the State, advocating that it would prove a panacea for all ills both in the Church and in the State, have ever proved the greatest enemies to the cause that they were in their misguided way trying to defend. A church separate from the State is a church of Christ allied with the world it is a spiritual harlot. By such an alliance Rome became the "mother of harlots," as described in Rev. 17:5, and her chief ruler a god, as described in 2 Thess. 2:4.

A writer says of the fourth century: "The Church was allied with the State, and religious dogmas were enforced by the sword of the magistrate. The mission of the Church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the State." Such an alliance is a degrading one, and it is to be hoped that those that are contending for religion and the State in our Government, may see their error before it is too late, and not degrade Christianity by such an unholy alliance.
