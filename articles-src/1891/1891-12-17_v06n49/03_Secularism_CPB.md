The term "secularism," is often used as though it were a synonym of "infidelity," but this is not the case. The *Century* means, "The state or quality of being secular;" and "secular" means "pertaining to this present world, or to things not spiritual or holy; relating to or connected with worldly things." So far as the State is concerned "secular" is not, therefore, a synonym for infidelity, and very certainly it is not atheism; some Christian papers are so certain that, they believe in keeping Church and State entirely separate.
