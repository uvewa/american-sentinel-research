THIS may seem a queer heading for an article. And if it were not for the fact that statements are seriously being urged which justify it, it would be quite in place to offer an apology for writing on such a subject; yea, it would be quite improper to write on such a topic at all.

We hear of great corporations trying to cut off competition so that their business will have no obstacles, and that they may the more readily heap up massive fortunes. The world has just been startled at the statement that the Standard Oil Company has about gained the control of the petroleum output of the whole world. If this be true, it will have no competition, and can regulate the price of oil at will. It is always the aim of worldly enterprises to put down competition so that they may have things largely their own way.

But Christianity asks no such favors. The true Christian realizes that his power is not dependent upon men or the favors of human agencies. When his Master commissioned him to represent Heaven, and to stand as a light in the world, he told him that "in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." "Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles." "And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake." "They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

In contrast with these statements of Scripture read the following from No. 2 of the Sabbath Reform, a quarterly, edited by Rev. W. F. Crafts, and published by the Authors' Publishing Company:—

To officers and owners of railroads: We urge upon all Christian and humane owners and managers of railroads, separately and jointly, to ask Congress and State legislatures to eliminate the only real obstacle to the complete suspension of Sunday trains, namely, competition, by enacting laws forbidding all Sunday trains, except in cases of mercy and necessity.

In another article in the same paper, we read further:—

The only real obstacle to suspending Sunday railroading is competition, which Congress can and would remove speedily if such a man as Cornelius Vanderbilt would add his powerful influence to the great petition at Washington.

When an advocate for a Sunday law urges that all competition be taken away from those whom he would have keep Sunday, he is either acknowledging that Sunday lacks divine authority, and, hence, if sustained must have the power of the State, or else he is seeking to evade the path of self-denial that Christ has said all his followers must tread. Where does the great Founder of Christianity commission his ambassadors to labor to have competition removed so that men may follow him at no personal sacrifice?

But this is the logic of the whole Sunday-law theory. They want Sunday laws so that men may keep that day without any inconvenience, or loss of position, and thus make it easy for men to be Christians. The promise of Christ is, "Every one that forsaketh houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life." The man who believes that Sunday is the Sabbath, and yet his convictions are not strong enough to lead him to give up a job of work to follow Christ, would not bear up under the reverses that every Christian must meet in perfecting his character. Christ's promise is, that if we forsake the things of this world that conflict with forming the image of his character, that he will care for us. To believe what he says means to take his promises as he gives them, and render to him the most perfect obedience, without waiting for civil law to so regulate things that he will have no "competition."

There are a good many of our fellow-citizens who believe that ecclesiasticism is making the same advances and apostate progress in this country that it did in the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era. And perhaps nothing would be a more fitting conclusion to the foregoing thoughts than the following quotation from the historian Gibbon:—

The Church still continued to increase its outward splendor as it lost its internal purity, and, in the reign of Diocletian, the palace, the courts of justice, and even the army, concealed a multitude of Christians, who endeavored to reconcile the interests of the present with those of a future life.

History records the results; namely, apostasy, and there is no reason to hope that like causes will not produce like fruit now.
