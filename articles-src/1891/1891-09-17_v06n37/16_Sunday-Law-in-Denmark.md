"STRANGELY enough," says a correspondent of the Independent, "the very year that witnesses the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum in New York, witnesses also the passing of a bill by the Danish Rigsdag providing for a more reverent observance of the Sabbath in this little land. The law of April 7, 1876, placed many restrictions upon the transaction of business on Sunday. These restrictions have now been extended, and the application of the law has been clearly defined. As in our own city, the law does not apply to restaurants or confectioners, or to manufactories in which uninterrupted work is necessary. It is provided, however, that in such cases the employes shall have, at least, every other Sunday free. Barber shops, furthermore, may be kept open until noon. Under the head of manufactories that require uninterrupted labor are included gas works, electric light stations, sugar refineries, etc. Any violation of the law is punishable by a fine of from ten to two hundred kroner ($2.75 to $55). The law entered into effect June 3."
