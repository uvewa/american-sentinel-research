"JOHN," said Mr. Smith, a manufacturer of glassware, to his employe, whose work was to pack the goods for shipment, "you must pack these articles so and so (prescribing the exact manner in which the work should be done), and whatever is broken in transit will be charged to your account."

After some reflection, John, who had had considerable experience in packing glassware, remonstrated thus: "Mr. Smith, I think I know of a safer way to pack these goods, and if I am to be held responsible for the breakage, I think I should be permitted to use my own judgment as to how the work should be done."

But Mr. Smith was inflexible, and informed John that he was capable of running his own business, and intended to do so.

All can see at once that the requirements of Mr. Smith were unjust and unreasonable, yet many respectable and conscientious citizens of our country are acting upon the self-same principle in using their influence to induce law-making bodies to legislate upon religious subjects, to pass laws regulating the conduct of individuals in things pertaining only to God.

Many fail to realize that each and every person has a private account to settle with "the Judge of all the earth," a personal responsibility which cannot be removed by legislation. And in view of this solemn fact it is evident that every man should be left free to act according to the promptings of his own conscience, and to bring his actions into harmony with what he understands to be the will of God concerning him, as long as his course of action does not interfere with the rights of his fellow-men.

If it were possible for the civil government to assume the responsibility and to bear the consequences of the wrong actions of the individual toward God when such actions were compelled by its laws, then, and then only, could it with any degree of reason and justice define the duties and pass laws regulating the conduct of individuals in religious affairs.

The National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and all others who are seeking for the enactment, or favoring the enforcement of Sunday laws, are working in accordance with the foregoing principles.

There are people who believe that the seventh day should be kept holy in accordance with the commandment found in Exodus, chapter 20, and that "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," is a God-given privilege (yes, duty) with which no person, organization or government has a right to interfere; and that God will hold each and every one responsible for the course he pursues in this, as well as in other matters.

And while the seventh-day keeper must stand the breakage, the Sunday-law advocates insist that the glassware shall be packed according to their own ideas. National Reformers and others who are trying to coerce people in religious matters, a method wholly foreign to the scriptural way, will probably find as much responsibility connected with their own cases in the "day of judgment," as they will care to bear, without being entangled in the misdeeds of others.
