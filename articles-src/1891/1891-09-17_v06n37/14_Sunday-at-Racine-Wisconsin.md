**Sunday at Racine, Wisconsin.**

THE Sunday-closing movement at Racine, Wisconsin, is taking on new features. The Ancient Order league has been arresting some saloon keepers for opening their places of business on Sunday. The saloon keepers have taken it upon themselves to refuse to sell any kind of drink on that day, with a view to creating a sentiment that all other kinds of business places should likewise be opened. It is reported that Saloon men were offered free, for boot and whisky on Monday, August 25, all to no effect. Even the drug stores had fallen into line and refused to sell any kind of strong drink. It has stirred the old topers up, and they are threatening that there may be another Haymarket tragedy.

They seem to understand that those who advocate Sunday laws know what can become of the ministers' pleasure. The experience that they have been getting a taste of what a very strict "civil Sabbath" is, and that may happen to them.

It may be some consolation that they were actually saving their lives, it would certainly be commendable, and they should have the sympathy, the parity, and help of every philanthropist. But if they did so they assume the closing of saloons on Sunday would settle the difficulty, they learn only, what is gained? Those who are laboring to destroy their lives with drink, if the Sunday saloons were stopped, just as much business would be done in the other days of the week as in the entire seven. Why would it not hold just as good in the temperance direction as the rest of that argument that any merchant—provided all would close on Sunday—would get as much trade in six days as in seven? But of course the temperance argument in regard to the saloon would have to be the same. But the saloon would want to take into account the help the temperance cause a particle and more when all is counted. Stand on the solid foundation of prohibition—working in the world, and in carrying this insurance into effect take whatever consequences may come. And in the result it will be a far greater safeguard than the insurance companies or any institution of its kind.
