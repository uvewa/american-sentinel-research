THE sentiments quoted in THE SENTINEL of September 3, from the Youth's Companion, and the Christian Advocate, that "the flag represents religion," call to mind a lecture given years ago by a popular clergyman in Concord, New Hampshire, to a "full and delighted audience," who manifested their approbation by "frequent applause." Said he:—

The flag and the cross is my theme to-night. The cross is the symbol of our religion. It reminds us of the fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of man, the sacrifice of Christ, the redemption of the world. The flag is the emblem of our nationality, the symbol of liberty and order. They should be associated, intertwined about our altars. There is no desecration in the act. . . . There is little danger of too intimate union between Church and State. If our religion be not brought into contact with politics and business, and all the every-day concerns of life, it is not a blessing, but a curse. The assumption that Christian ministers should not intermeddle with affairs of State, is a great and dangerous heresy. . . . We have undertaken, as a Nation, to divorce the flag and the cross. . . . Would we have our Nation prosper, we must solemnize anew the union between the cross and the flag.

The lecturer complained that as a Nation we had undertaken to divorce the flag and cross—the State and the Church. Of course the bill of divorce is our national Constitution. To solemnize anew the union, would be to subvert that noble charter of our liberties, under which we have enjoyed unparalleled prosperity for the past century. He speaks his mind quite plainly. He had not learned to dissemble and prevaricate like later advocates of "National Reform," disclaiming all desire for a union of Church and State, and only pleading for "civil" law to enforce a religious institution. It would be more manly, not to say more like Christians, to state plainly what they want; and not use deception and fraud to attain a professedly holy end.
