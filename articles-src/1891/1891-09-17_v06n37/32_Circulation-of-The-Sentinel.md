Rev. J. P. Mills, District Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is credited with the following statement concerning the National Religious Liberty Association, and THE SENTINEL:—

This Association publishes a paper called THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. They started it in California, but soon wanted to take it to New York. They found it would cost $30,000 to move it, and made a call for that sum, and the money just came rolling in; and now it is right in the heart of New York City. It started with only a few thousand subscribers, but soon bounded up to half a million, then to a million, two million, and now it has two and a half million subscribers.

We are sorry to say that the statement is somewhat exaggerated in regard both to the cost of removing THE SENTINEL to this city, and to the circulation of the paper. We will say frankly that our subscription list falls considerably below the figure given by Mr. Mills. We would not, however, impeach his veracity in the least. His estimate was doubtless based upon the influence of THE SENTINEL.
