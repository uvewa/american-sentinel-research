The Sunday-closing movement at Racine, Wisconsin, has taken on a new phase. The Law and Order League has been arresting some saloon-keepers for opening their places of business on Sunday. The saloon-keepers have taken it upon themselves to refuse to sell any kind of drink on that day, with a view to creating a sentiment that will compel the authorities to allow the saloons to be opened. It is reported that fabulous sums were offered them for beer and whisky on Sunday, August 23, all to no effect. Even the drug stores had fallen into line and refused to sell any kind of strong drink. It has stirred the old topers up, and they are threatening that there may be another Haddock tragedy, unless they are allowed their beer on Sunday. The ministers have been getting their lives insured so as to be prepared for anything that may happen to them.

If it were to secure prohibition that they were thus risking their lives, it would certainly be commendable, and they should have the prayers, sympathy, and help of every philanthropist. But if they die to secure the closing of saloons on Sunday only, what is gained? Those who are laboring to secure Sunday laws tell us that if all Sunday traffic were stopped just as much business would be done in the other six days of the week as is now done in seven. Why would it not hold just as good in the case of the saloon? If it be a correct statement that any merchant—provided all would close on Sunday—would get as much trade in the other six days as he does in the whole seven, the conclusion in regard to the saloon would have to be the same. Then closing the saloon on Sunday will not help the temperance cause a particle, and men who are ready to die in such a cause are taking useless risks. Stand on the solid foundation of prohibition seven days in the week, and in carrying this measure into effect take whatever consequences may come. And in such a warfare God will be a greater safeguard than the insurance companies or anything of the kind.
