[292]

GOD destroyed the antediluvian world because the wickedness of man was great in the earth. Gen. 6:5, 7. He rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah because there were not ten righteous persons in them. Gen. 18, 19. Christ said, "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man." Also: "as it was in the days of Lot, ... even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed." Luke 17:26-30; Paul said, "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." 2 Tim. 3:13.

Mr. Moody evidently believes these statements, and accepts the situation. He [293] gave him the power to will and to do good or evil, it is manifest that any day which, in reference to moral and spiritual things, deals with man as a moral agent, deals of God or in harmony with God.

As far as this movement is wrong, as much conclusion can only be bad. It involves the establishment of a national religion; this is to be enforced according to the interpretation of certain religionists, this claim to depend wholly upon which come under its application. All conflicting views and practices will of necessity, of old, be branded "heresy." The heretics will yield, the stubborn be bent, and the refractory be summarily dealt with. This is the logic of the case, and these the tributable results,—as trampling upon the rights of conscience of many, and the conversion of no one.—*Religious Liberty Leaflet.*

THIS may seem a queer heading for an article in this paper. But the times are that statements are seriously made which justify it, it would be quite in place to offer an apology for writing on such a subject; yes, it would be quite improper to do so on moral and a logic of law.

This movement involves two fundamental errors; first, that the great masses of men by human means are going to become better and better, while the girl actually of Christianity and its grandest apostles declare that they are going to grow worse and worse, not better, at least on the whole; and secondly, the means of extending the work of the gospel and spiritual welfare, is by forming certain religious rites and customs on them by law, which, in the contrary to the very nature of a free moral agency and the spirit of the gospel, as applied to the heart, the conscience, and the understanding, and says, "Whosoever will."

If all the world were to become freely, of themselves, converted to Christianity, this is not the way it would or can be accomplished. To commence a man is to change his heart, and not merely his actions. His actions will naturally change after his heart has been changed. But only by the preaching of gospel truth accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit, and not by civil enactments, change be wrought (Rom. 10:14-16; John 1:1-3), and not by civil enactments enforced by the sword. Free moral agencies and the development of character require freedom of action, an opportunity to choose, a chance to exercise the will. If God had deemed that man should be simply a machine, governed only by external forces, he would have made him that way in the first place. But as he did not, but
