COMMENTING upon certain arguments in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the Chicago Journal, of the 4th inst., says:—

Dr. Henson simply trifled with the subject. This city is to entertain in July and August, 1893, thousands and thousands, perhaps millions, of visitors. Every hotel and private hostelry will be filled to repletion, and the weather may be very warm. Yet Mr. Henson proposes that on Sundays the multitude be invited to "take a rest"! That is, he would have them sit all day in their narrow and overcrowded lodgings and fan themselves instead of seeking recreation and refreshment in Jackson Park. The idea is totally void of reason or good sense, and savors of religious bigotry.

Even the proposed religious and educational gatherings do not meet the case at all. There will be countless people here who take no more pleasure in such meetings, especially in warm weather, than Dr. Henson takes in a game of euchre; and there is no more justice nor propriety in excluding them from their chosen form of recreation than there would be in excluding Dr. Henson from the pulpit. The coolness with which the Sabbatarians profess to make everybody a Christian in 1893 by force of law is injurious to the cause of religion, and is beginning to excite some indignation.

Still, it should be understood that the Journal is conservative on this subject. There may be due something of respect to ultra-religious sentiment. But a different line of argument, if there is one, should be adopted by the Sabbatarians, in their efforts to enforce their views. Thus far they have presented little but fallacies.
