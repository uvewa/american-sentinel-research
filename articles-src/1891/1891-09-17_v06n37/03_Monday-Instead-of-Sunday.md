THE World suggests that if the Fair must be closed one day in each week, let it be on Monday, as in the case of "the Louvre and the Luxembourg, for cleansing, and for the recreation of the attendants." "Monday," says the World, "is always the day when visitors to a great exhibition are fewest in number. Sunday is the day when they are always most numerous. To close the Fair on Monday would be a rational proceeding; to close it on Sunday would be to defeat its best usefulness. If a day of rest for the employes cannot be provided without closing the Fair for one day each week, in the name of right and reason let the great American washday be the one selected for that purpose."

What can the "civil Sabbath" advocates say to this proposition? Why would not Monday rest meet all physical necessities just as well as Sunday rest?
