[291]

"JOHN," said Mr. Smith, a manufacturer of glassware, to his servant, whose business it was to pack goods for shipment, "you must pack these articles so and so." After some remonstrance on the part of John (describing the exact manner in which the work should be done), and whatever is broken in transit will be charged to your account."

After some reflection, John, who had considerable experience in packing glassware, remonstrated thus: "Mr. Smith, I think I know of a safer way to pack these goods, and if I am to be held accountable for the breakage, I think I should be permitted to use my own judgment as to how the work should be done."

But Mr. Smith was self-willed, and informed John that he was capable of running his own business, and intended to do so.

Both methods are tried and the requirements of Mr. Smith were found not unreasonable, yet many respectable and conspicuous men of the world, are still urging upon the self-same principle, in using their influence to induce law-making bodies to legislate upon religious subjects, or to pass laws regulating the conduct of individuals in things pertaining only to God!

Many fail to realize that each and every person has a private account to settle with "the Judge of all the earth," a personal "responsibility" which cannot be re- [292] moved by legislation. And it is very evident that every man should be left free to act according to the promptings of his own conscience, and to bring his action into harmony with what he understands to be the will of God concerning him, as long as his course of action does not interfere with the rights of his fellow-men.

If it were possible for the civil government to be responsible for, and to bear the consequences of the wrong actions of the individual toward God when such actions were compelled by its laws, then, and then only, could it with any degree of reason and justice dictate the duties and pass laws regulating the conduct of individuals in religious matters.

The National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and all others who are seeking for the enactment, or favoring the enforcement of Sunday laws, are working in accordance with the following principles:

There are people who believe that the seventh day should be kept holy in accordance with the commandment found in Exodus, chapter 20, and that "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work," is a declaration giving provision (two days) with which no person, organization or government has a right to interfere; and that God will hold each and every one responsible for his course he pursues in this, as well as in other matters.

If, therefore, any who wish to understand the breaking, the Sunday-law advocates insist that the glassware shall be packed according to their own ideas. National Reformers and others who are trying to coerce people in religious matters, a method wholly foreign to the scripture way, will probably find upon trial the responsibility connected with their own cases in the "day of judgment," as they will care to bear, without being enlarged in the misdeeds of others.
