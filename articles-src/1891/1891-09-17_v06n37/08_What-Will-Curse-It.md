COLONEL SHEPARD is reported as saying that if the doors of the World's Fair are opened on Sunday, "the Lord will curse the enterprise." Upon this the World remarks that—

This ridiculous person who professes to hold such intimate relations with the Almighty prophesied a descent of the Divine wrath upon the Metropolitan Museum should the Trustees vote to open the doors of that institution on Sunday. The beautiful and refining collection of art has now been open to public inspection for many weeks. Yet none of the pictures have shrivelled in their frames; the mummies have not burst their ceremony and walked forth; the noble marbles and casts have not been hurled from their pedestals by an earthquake. The Museum has simply more nearly fulfilled its mission as an educator of the people and has had more orderly and interested visitors on Sunday than on all the rest of the week.

The fact that no evil has as yet befallen the Museum proves nothing; but the disposition shown by Colonel Shepard and his co-laborers in their so-called "Sabbath reform," does prove that they are utterly unworthy to be trusted with any power whatever over their fellow-men. Men who are so ready to invoke the wrath of God against those who do not please them, are just as ready to supplement that wrath with civil penalties in case it seems to them to be too long delayed. It is the threatened Christian (?) boycott that is to curse the Fair in case its gates are opened on Sunday.
