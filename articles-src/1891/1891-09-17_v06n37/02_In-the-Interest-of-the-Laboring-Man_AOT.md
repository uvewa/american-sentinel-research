IT is very popular nowadays to try to have the laboring man shoulder the responsibility of all the pet schemes and theories that various so-called reformers are trying to get through various legislative turns. Just at present the American Sabbath Union is supposed to be in danger. The workingmen of America are led into an advocacy of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair by offering them free use of certain grounds upon certain other days. All kinds of so-called social and patriotic material are introduced, trying to regulate our rest, religion, recreation, and various other things. Some can never seem to learn that people will get along just about as well when you give them a chance to use their own brains as when you try to make the Legislature do the brain work for the whole Nation.

Recently, Parliament was about to pass a bill prohibiting women from using a heavy forging implement known as the "oliver;" whereupon a deputation of these laboring women went to London to protest against the passage of the act.

At London they were questioned at length upon the manner of their employment, by the Home Secretary—an officer whose position in the British Government is much the same as that of the Secretary of the Interior in this country. Between Mr. Matthews, the Secretary, and a chain-woman the following dialogue took place:—

Mr. Matthews: And what is the precise nature of the employment in which you are engaged?

Chain-woman (looking up): I don't want to have my work taken away from me!

Mr. Matthews (hastily): Pardon me, that is not quite the point on which I desire information. If you will explain exactly to me the nature of the work in which—

Chain woman (firm, though flustered, and determined not to be circumvented): I don't want no [290] London for us! It never done us no harm, at us! Besides, Mr. Secretary, if you will suspend your observations long enough to allow—

Chain woman: I likes the 'eavy work, an' so I does my mates, and look what they've came for!

This appeal, coming as it did, was more in the nature of a surprise to all; but to Mr. Crafts and his party it was a "clincher." It immediately reached to so many of them, and so profoundly seemed in behalf of "the poor workingmen who are so cruelly to toil on Sunday," that the advocates of utilizing the Church's gallant efforts to liberate them from Sunday toil could not suppose that the men did not happen to suggest that which would more closely express the perfect helplessness of the plea that is made by the American Sabbath Union, that this Sunday movement is in the interests of the work people, than did this unprecedented and wholly unauthorized appeal.

This was worse for the theory of the chain-woman's strictures on the British. The *New York Sun* truly says of the workingman "that a what is asked for in his behalf what he most responsibility." This is true, as THE SENTINEL has before remarked, and of nothing is it more true than of the demand for Sunday laws made in the name of the laboring man.

Although this constantly making these claims that the laboring men are the sanction for those laws, still the contrary of the affairs has been frequently a matter of complaint on the part of the leaders in the movement. Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, who has in one picture or another been the leading worker for Sunday legislation, offering after this or the other causes to his decisions which seem always to be what he deems conclusion of evidence of the benefit of compulsory Sunday observance, says:

> During the great facts, a Short Lecture Union Code of New York in 1887, adopted a page from the trade union device. "We learn, however, from the chairmen that the petitions are pending hands with tyranny and repeal for the purpose of suspending all these petitions and memorials from leading representatives of many labor organizations, which seem to have been secured as the a-b-c of political action, and were thrown in with so much ignorance of the entire meaning of liberty that they mistake its champions for enemies.

> Even educated men sometimes make the same blunder from their initial prejudices. John Stuart Mills characterizes "Sabbatarian legislation as an irrational interference with the rights of individuals for what they please;" and with strange individual perversion he adds—that "no great ground on which it can be set is that it is religious wrong." For he claims to say that they are religiously wrong.—*Sabbath for Man, p. 250.*

For the last millennium the world has already been learning the lesson that it is better to let individuals manage their private affairs, rather than have the government attend to it for them. Will the lesson, ever be learned?

The Emperor of China has published a decree that no religion shall be able to subject their brethren who have embraced Christianity to live in peace, and forbidding all persecution for conscience sake. The American Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association, the State of Tennessee which is expected by the great majority of and the Illinois justice who find that Longecker, recently, should make a note of this and go and do likewise.

Not long ago in our own capital the Sunday-rest advocates tried to get through a law "in the interests of the laboring man," prohibiting Sunday work (although in the foregoing anecdote the "laboring man" were women), and very plausibly laid their case before the Congressional Committee; but unfortunately for the Sunday-law advocates when the vote on solicitation for the "laboring man," the master workmen of the labor unions and the Knights of Labor was present, Mr. Millard F. Hodel, and by a few words their elaborate consideration was crossed off.

He said:

> But when this came before the Federation of Labor, and signed this bill, and that body refused to let it come before them, it was signed by individuals, members of the Knights of Labor (which is made up of all the Knights of Labor of the entire country and the District of Columbia, and that body has not so indorsed it. There is a petition to that body by a member of that body, but so far as an organization bodies are concerned it is not indorsed, and members are wholly opposed to the passage of it, and I want you to understand that we have not to be having anything to do with it, and it comes to us before us worship on this day, but as for the other (the religious) feature of the bill, they do not want to look at it nor have any feature of it, and I believe there is quite a lot of the members of the other who believe as I believe if they want rest on Sunday or any other day, they can get it already. Their labor organizations take care of that.

There are over thirty unions of Knights of Labor, and there has been only one petition here, individual—it is an individual member that presented it. I think they want to remain silent about rest.

As for the "civil Sabbath," there can be no such thing. Sabbath observes rest on one day or another, because of God, and not to man, it is a subjective matter entirely; while if rest is what is claimed, it could be given to the laboring man on Friday or Wednesday as well as Sunday; yes, it would be quite impossible to put down competition so that they may choose things largely their own way.

But Christianity asks no such favor. The true Christian realizes that the power is all-powerful does rest on the forces of human agencies. When his Master commissioned him to represent him, and to stand as a light in the world, he did not tell him that "in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." "Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles." "And ye shall be hated of all men [291] for my name's sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." "Then shall they deliver you to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake." "They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." "And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

In contrast with these statements of Scripture read the following from *No. 7 of the Sabbath Reforms*, a quarterly, edited by Rev. W. F. Crafts, and published by the Authors' Publishing Company:—

> To officers and owners of railroads. We urge all Christians and lovers of humanity and true agents of railroads, especially and jointly, to address railroads to ministers for wholesome rest, only real obstacle in the complete suspension of railroad trains, namely, competition, by securing laws forbidding all Sunday trains, except in cases of necessity and mercy.

In another article in the same paper,

> The only real obstacle to suspending Sunday trains is competition, which competition and every railroad removes speedily if such a man as a Cornelius Vanderbilt would add his powerful influence to the petition at Washington.

When an advocate for a Sunday law urges that all competition be broken away from those who would be rich through Sunday, is it either a direct or implied threat, Sunday is either divine authority, and therefore not a code of morals; it is a divine scheme for the moral elevation of men who have no code of morality. It not only teaches men how to live, but it gives them life. If mankind must have the power of the State, he is seeking for the church of God to wield that church law and its followers must trust. Where does the great Founder of Christianity commission his ambassadors to labor to have compensation in so personal a matter they may compel him his own permission every day.

But this is the logic of the whole Sunday-law theory. Every man said Sunday law, and then and very many that keep the day of the recreation, and none of persons that make it easy for men to be Christians.

The promises of Christ are: "Every one that forsaketh houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life." The man who believes that Sunday is the Sabbath, and yet says his convictions are not strong enough to lead him to give up a job of work to follow Christ, would not keep an enforced the advocates of Sunday theirs is every Christian must meet in perfecting his character. Christianity promises that if he forsake the things of the world that conflict with forming the image of his character, that he will care for us. To believe what he says means to take his promises as he gives them, and render to him the most perfect obedience, without waiting for civil law to so regulate things that he will have no "competition."

There are a good many of our fellow-citizens who believe that ecclesiasticism is making the same advances and apparel [292] program in this country that it did in the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era. And perhaps nothing would be a more fitting contribution to the foregoing thoughts than the following quotation from the historian Gibbon:—

> The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister; a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity.

History records the results: namely, apostasy, and there is no reason to hope that similar causes will not produce similar fruit in these times.
