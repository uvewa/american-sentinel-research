As for the "civil Sabbath," there can be no such thing. Sabbath observance is a duty we owe to God, and not to man; it is a subjective matter entirely; while things civil have to do only with the State, and our relations man to man. In God's law it finds a place where the duties toward him are defined, and in no other relation can it be placed, while things which we call civil are in that part of the law where man's relations to man, society, and the State, are defined. The laws of our land rightly may have to do with stealing, adultery, murder, false witness, etc., as these are civil matters; but I deny, sir, that they can have anything to do with idolatry, blasphemy, or Sabbath observance, as these are not civil matters, and have to do only with the relations between man and his Maker.
