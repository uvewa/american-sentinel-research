THE *Christian Advocate* (formerly Herald of Gospel Liberty, August 27) devoted its second page to a report of the question of Sunday opening of the Fair, contributed by Dr. J. M. Buckley, editor of the *Christian Advocate*, in which he seems to have been devoted entirely to answering questions as to "the Fair must be opened or the Fair must be closed," as a matter that "the people must be drawn." Among others we find the following:—

Question.—Since the churches in Chicago will be open all day Sunday, will not those who desire to be present at the World's Fair, will not the day of rest be spent in the same way as it would be if closed on that day?

Answer.—The person who wrote that question evidently does not know what he is talking about. A brief statement of that question may be found in the works of Joel, and whose observations were originally heard from the pulpit. If the man will go to Jackson Park on some afternoon. A man who enters an oath in the morning at 7 and is not finished with his work before 6 is not the man who will attend church. He has taken the nation of God in vain in the morning, and it is asking him too much for the rest. I am not opposed of his part.

Question.—Does the Fair be a right and does not that make closing for it a right and does not that make a great interest in closing of the religious missions during the day. We are opposed to the fair being opened on Sunday. We want the authority of the Government.

Question.—Should the Fair should be open merely for artistic purposes?

Answer.—We, as we ask Dr. Buckley, would the day be devoted to visiting the art department of the Fair? The gates were closed Sunday, last everybody wanted to take excursion, to go to the places about Chicago, who goes out Sunday morning for looking for an opening, is he not already engaged in Sunday desecration? How so much better are the people going to be if they don't open it.
