It has ever been the custom of persons who have been fighting to maintain the crumbling theories of Church and State, to call their opponents "atheists." It is done to-day (especially by Sunday-law advocates) and it was done by the enemies of American institutions a century ago. Our good old "fathers,"—Washington and his co-laborers—had to receive the appellation over and over again.

Madison, in one of his essays, gives an illustration of the common anti-constitutional style of argument then, which sounds very like that of the religio-political reformer of to-day:—

"You are destitute, I perceive," says the anti-republican, "of every quality of a good citizen, or rather, a good subject. You have neither the light of faith nor the spirit of obedience. I denounce you to the Government, as an accomplice of atheism and anarchy."

And so saying he (the anti-republican) let the argument drop, presumably because he thought that calling American principles "atheism and anarchy" was at once both the strongest argument and severest chastisement that he could give them.
