UNDER the heading of "Natural Rights," the *Clarion*, of Dickinsol, Iowa, has an article in its issue of September 3, to the effect that it would be well for those who are working for Sunday laws and kindred religious legislation to study and practice. The *Clarion* says:—

Lorenzo Dow, a man who, giving his views on these natural rights, which all of us might use for our own good if we so desired. In this way, we find this: "Moral rights are the personal rights of individuals, such as faith, and opinions; these belong to a man's conscience, and are as clear, as no one is concerned but God, the giver of these rights; they cannot be legislated upon. For what right hath any man to meddle with my faith? None that would be entertained in the divine prerogative alone; and rash had it been of the civil authority to take upon itself to touch it, therefore, in a religious sense, this inherent, but not of man, has a right to infringe upon; therefore any legislation interfering therewith, a rational creature, must be convinced of the fact that it is entirely unnecessary, and an error of the universe. Consequently, colonization of religion, the right of man, taking it from a rational view and religious, is nothing but an empty show, a piece of deception practiced upon the ignorant for the purposes of priestcraft. Governmental interference has been a curse to mankind and a pest to society, while it has produced nothing good in return, but on cost one tittle of evil."

Our God is the great creator, is one God, whose powers are immense beyond conception. If neither pick his pocket nor breaks his leg, why should he persecute him? Persecution is manifestly [293] the symbol of license and civil order. "They should be considered, sheltered about our allies. There is a danger too serious to be neglected. Church and State, if our religion be not beyond contact with policies and business, and all the every day concerns of life, is not a blessing, but will be the curse of the day."

The lecturer complained that as a Nation, we had undertaken to divorce the flag and cross—the State and the Church. Of course the bill of divorce is our national Constitution. To acknowledge some the nation, would be to subvert that noble charter of our liberty. A Nation that would have enjoyed unsurpassed liberties for the past century. He speaks the most pathetically. He had no warrant to distinguish and persecute like these latter-day advocates of "National Reform." Ultimately it means a union of Church and State, and only by looking "for" civil law to enforce a religious institution. It would tend in a pronounced way to plant what they want, to make its state plainly what they want; it with one deeprooted and fraud to attain its objects.
