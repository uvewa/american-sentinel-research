The principle of persecution, to the extent of burning heretics, is inseparable from the union of Church and State, which makes a crime against the Church, also a crime against the State, to be punished according to human law. If Americans hate anything it is the principle and practice of religious persecution, and if they love anything it is civil and religious liberty.
