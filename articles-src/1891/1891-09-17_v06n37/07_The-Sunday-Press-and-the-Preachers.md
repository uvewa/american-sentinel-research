THE following will illustrate the relationship between the Sunday press and the preachers:

The Rev. Dr. Merrill, a gentleman belonging to the Methodist body, and calling himself a bishop, he added his spirit to the cause of pedantical Sunday observance. With a bold departure of the past week, rendered notably Asbury Park and Ocean Grove, Mr. Dr. Merrill has undertaken to prevent the coming of all newspapers to any one on Sunday, "the Sabbath" he calls it; and he has secured a notable defense in the arrest of all Sunday carriers, and also his Sunday notices delivered the journal to his abode at the next Monday and tried a ranking shot at the residents of his neighbors for their position. For he purposely gave utterance to the following very foolish and illogical sentiment:—

> The man who sits in this practice and requires a service for his Sunday morning paper, stands in the same category as the man who opens his store and sells from behind the counter on Sunday.

Let us further continue to imagine what would have been the feelings of this divine had he not seen his morning's portion of the Sunday morning following. His indignation would have known no bounds, and would have exposed itself in a tirade against the want of enterprise displayed by the paper and its correspondents. That is to say, he inevitably would have been scandalized the day before he found not being guilty of the very act he had pleased him to call sin—collective getting out of the Sunday newspapers. It sometimes happens that we set up in type without a further violation of the same character. We can easily imagine, however, that Dr. Merrill would have the paper scorched if he came out with such an act. But the inconsistency did not end there. The preacher branded the reporter as a "sinor," the cause he was "plying his vocation." The reporter was doing no more than that the slave of the quill probably earned about dollars by "plying his 'vocation'" in reporting the sermons, while Dr. Merrill would not if he were to give his name prior city a hundred times for nothing for the pure love of men preaching for nothing for the purpose of its true ministry, and the thought comes to us that when he was not only absent from his legitimate post of duty—Kinnelick—but also was actually only enjoying what the reporter so wisely got, a chance to visit, at something of pleasure at the seaside, and also making money as a "star preacher." his spiritual inferiority accrued roughly of a fair share.
