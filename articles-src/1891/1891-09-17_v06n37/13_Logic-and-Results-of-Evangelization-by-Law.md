God destroyed the antediluvian world because the wickedness of man was great in the earth. Gen. 6:5-7. He rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah because there were not ten righteous persons in them. Gen. 18, 19. Christ said, "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. . . . Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot, . . . even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed." Luke 17:26-30. And Paul adds, "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." 2 Tim. 3:13.

Mr. Moody evidently believes these statements, and accepts the situation. He says:—

It is no use attempting to work for this world.

The old ark is going to sink, and the only thing to do is to get as many of the crew and passengers out of her as possible, and let her go down.

But many professed Christians appear to be laboring under the impression that the ship can be saved. They seem to be ignorant of the fact that the heavens and the earth which are now, are, by the same word which created them, and destroyed the world once by a flood, kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 2 Peter 3:5-7. Seeing that wickedness abounds on every hand, they think that something must be done to check the powerful tide of evil. But instead of working upon the principle that the gospel is the only remedy for sin; that men can receive forgiveness of sin, be made righteous, and finally be saved only by repentance, conversion, and faith in Christ, they proceed upon the theory that these may be accomplished, to a large degree, at least, in a sort of wholesale manner, by civil legislation. Hence they propose as a remedy for the numerous evils and increasing wickedness of the times, that the name of God be put in the Constitution; that Jesus Christ be declared the Ruler of nations; that rigid Sunday laws be enacted; that religion be taught in the public schools; that the Bible be recognized as the supreme authority in civil affairs; and, lastly, that all Christian laws, institutions, and usages be placed upon an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land.

This movement involves two fundamental errors; first, that the great masses of men by some means are going to become better and better, while the great Author of Christianity and its greatest apostle declare that they are going to grow worse and worse, and be worst of all at last; and secondly, that the means of extending the work of the gospel and making men better, is by forcing certain religious rites and customs on them by law, which is contrary to the very nature of free moral agency and the spirit of the gospel, which appeals to the heart, the conscience, and the understanding, and says, "Whosoever will."

If all the world were to become converted to Christianity, this is not the way it would or could be accomplished. To convert a man is to change his heart, and not merely his actions. His actions will naturally change after his heart has been changed. But only by the preaching of gospel truth accompanied by the power of the Spirit of God, can this miraculous change be wrought (Rom. 10:10-14; John 3:1-8), and not by civil requirements enforced by the sword. Free moral agency and the development of character require freedom of action, an opportunity to choose, a chance to exercise the will. If God had desired that man should be simply a machine, governed only by external forces, he would have made him that way in the first place. But as he did not, but gave him the power to will and to do good or evil, it is manifest that any theory which, in reference to moral and spiritual things, deals with man as a mere machine, is not of God or in harmony with God.

As in theory this movement is wrong, its results can only be bad. It involves the establishment of a national religion: this is to be enforced according to the interpretation of certain religionists, the class to depend solely upon which ones are dominant. All conflicting views and practices will of necessity, as of old, be branded "heresy." The timorous will yield, the stubborn be bent, and the incorrigible be summarily dealt with. This is the logic of the case, and these the inevitable results,—a trampling upon the rights of conscience of many, and the conversion of no one.
