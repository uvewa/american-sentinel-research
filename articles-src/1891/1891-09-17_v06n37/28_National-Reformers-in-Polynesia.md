A SAN FRANCISCO paper tells of a captain in the British navy who, not long since, found two tribes on the Polynesian Islands carrying on a fierce war; one tribe, having become converted to Christianity, was trying to force the other to contribute to the purchase of an organ for public worship. The whole tribe must be National Reformers.
