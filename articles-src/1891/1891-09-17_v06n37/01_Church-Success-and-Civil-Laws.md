IN the New York Christian Advocate, Rev. D. W. Huntingdon, D.D., says:—

Public vices present fearful opposition to the work of the Church, and in civil laws and their execution; in the character of public officers and in the good order of society generally the Church has much of her success at stake.

How about the Church in the days of the apostles when both the civil laws and those who administered them were bitterly hostile to Christianity? Is there not some mistake about the Church being in any measure dependent for success upon civil laws?
