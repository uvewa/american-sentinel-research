IN the *New York Christian Advocate*, Rev. D. W. Huntington, D.D., says:—

> Passive power seems hardly enough, to the work of the Church, and to civil laws and their execution, in the character of public officers and in the good order of society generally the Church must rank all her errors and stakes.

How about the Church in the days of the apostles when both the civil laws and those who administered them were bitterly hostile to Christianity? Is there not some mistake about the Church being in civil laws? Is it not dependent for success upon something else altogether?

THE *World* suggests that if the Fair must be closed one day in each week, let it be on Monday, as in the case of "the Louvre and the Luxembourg, for cleaning, and for the recreation of the attendants." "Monday," says the *World*, "is always a day when visitors to a great exhibition are fewest in number. Sunday is the day when they get a chance to go. To close the Fair on Monday would be a rational proceeding; to close it on Sunday would be to defeat its best usefulness. If a day of rest for the employes cannot be provided without closing the Fair for one day each week, in the name of right and reason let the great American wash day be the one selected for that purpose."

What can the "civil Sabbath" advocates say to this proposition? Why would not Monday rest meet all physical necessities just as well as Sunday rest?

ON the 7th inst, the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Fair voted thirty-six in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday.

THE idea that men and women would be occupied in all day on all their walks through the settlement quarters items than "descanting on a settlement on Sunday in the parks" is entirely worthy of the Sunday-law cause. It would not have been unworthy of the Spanish Inquisition in the days of the Inquisition.

A SAN FRANCISCO paper tells of a couple in the British navy who, not having found a true patron on the Portuguese Islands surpassing a fine race, got into live, having become converted to Christianity, starting for purchase for establishment in the purchase of an organ for public worship. The whole results must be Deserved Believers.

MISS FRANCES WILLARD is credited with the assertion that the comet has filled men with previous waking. Here, then, is a grand opportunity for those philanthropists to let the playground of their fellow human beings that they demand laws requiring everybody to rest, for that falling body will hardly be evaded even by the civil-liberty-law advocates that interpose to a greater evil world than dispersed of Sunday or we have Willard to say that in that wearing exercise is a greater evil still. Should they not then smell the greatest of the three rather than the least one?

If it is proper for the State to legislate upon the subject of rest, requiring men to abstain from labor one day in seven, for their physical good, why would it not be equally proper to require everybody to dress healthily?

Now can it be truthfully urged that the evil effects of Sunday-breaking are any greater in the community than are the ill consequences of corset wearing. The home and the family are the hope of our civilization. Corset wearing tends to destroy body. What is home with a poorly, sickly wife, and weakly, sickly children? Nothing but a perpetual incentive to frequent the grist-mill and the gambling den. Then, why should we not have a purely civil law requiring dress, and especially forbidding corsets as the very core of all offending in the matter of attire, the archenemy of the home, the ally of the saloon and of the undertaker.

In view of these facts, should not Mr. Crafts instead of travelling and lecturing in behalf of Sunday rest from a "civil" standpoint, in the interests of lengthened life and increased happiness for mankind, devote himself to a crusade against corsets!

THE *Catholic Review* notes a report "that the Pope is preparing an encyclical on the different forms of government, with the intention of showing how much the nations are indebted to the Church for confirmatory settlement of differences arising from changes of government forms;" and then adds: "If this be true or has a noble subject." Not only but a subject that would require less manipulation and falsifying of history would be: "What the Pope has learned from republican America, and what the Pope and all his illustrious, from Mr. Crafts to the National Reform Association, have still to learn of natural, God-given human rights."

It is stated that a Sunday-closing debate has been proceeding recently at Panama, "the one gay and rollicking Bahia place of the Isthmus." "The new law provides that all places of business, with a few exceptions, shall be closed on Sundays. The exceptions are the railroad and steamship offices, for urgent business only hotels, drug stores, restaurants, bakery hotels, barber shops and the like, however all the exempted places that not all spirits are required to post a big placard notifying the public—not to sell at half-past 11 p. m., when the prohibition comes. The market, grocery stores, and barber shops may be open not until 1 as the civil day papers," remarks the *Sun*, "continue to advocate the stirring practices in the Sunday drawings of the Panama Lottery, so presumably this lottery is exempted as a necessary business."

IT is stated that Dr. Brockmann, who has been compiling statistics in Germany relative to mine accidents, has brought to light the fact that of the eight hundred and eighty fire-damp explosions which have occurred during twenty years in the Dortmund district, more than twice as many occurred on Monday as on any other day. If the advocates of a "civil" Sunday law for the benefit of the "poor working men" are sincere, they might certainly try to demand a law requiring all mines to work on Sunday and close on Monday, or else workmen continuously seven days a the week, so as it is manifest that rest produces nothing greater when the mine is not worked or for a day.

NOT many ages ago an Ohio woman was fined in cash for drivers that her husband sent corset and knocked him down for driving a croquet on Sunday, and he himself frequently indulged in old todges, cutches, and poker on that day. At first reading, this man's actions seem a little inconsistent, but they are so merely on their Sunday regulations generally. The line must be drawn somewhere, and this man drew it at croquet. The authorities of some of the resorts near this city, and no one as the recreation situation, draw it at dancing. There is just as good reason for one as for the other. No is it any different, any less striking when we come to calculate that right of the man to inflict summary punishment on his wife for the for the Sunday offense while he himself had no physical power to enforce his arbitrary rule; the State has just as little right to do same. There is no more moral right in the one case than in the other.

REV. J. P. MILLS, District Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is credited with the following statement: The *American Sentinel*. That started in California, but soon wanted to take it to New York. They went to New York. The Catholics would not call for that sum, and the money just came rolling in! Seventh-day Adventists were behind New York City. It started with only a few thousand subscribers, but soon founded on it as a million, then to a million, two million, and now it has had to half million subscribers.

We are sorry to say that the statement is somewhat exaggerated in regard both to the cost of removing THE SENTINEL to this city, and to the circulation of the paper. We will try and readily find that
