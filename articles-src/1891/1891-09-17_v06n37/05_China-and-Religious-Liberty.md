THE Emperor of China has published a decree requiring his subjects to permit their brethren who have embraced Christianity to live in peace, and forbidding all persecution for conscience' sake. The American Sabbath Union, the National Reform Association, the State of Tennessee, and the Illinois Justice who fined David Longnecker, recently, should make a note of this and go and do likewise.
