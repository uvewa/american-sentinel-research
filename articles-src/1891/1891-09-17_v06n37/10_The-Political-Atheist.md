[291]

IT has ever been the custom of persons who have been fighting to maintain the irreligious theories of Church and State, to call their opponents "atheist." It is done to-day (especially by Sunday law advocates) just as it was done by the enemies of American institutions a century ago. Our good old "fathers,"—Washington, and his co-laborers—had to receive the epithet over and over again.

Madison, in one of his essays, gives an answer to the charge, with his characteristic style of argument then, which sounds very like that of the religious-political reformer of to-day—

"You are deistians, I perceive," says the anti [292] republican; "if every civility attend us in natural justice, canonization at a measure of power which, no mortal can claim, it being the divine right only to judge in such cases. Universal right of conscience is given by our Creator of justice; whatever is beyond is tyranny and oppression, and such liberty of conscience ought to be established."

In reply this brilliant young thinker, holding liberty of conscience, toleration assumes nothing to itself, and takes from others the power to take away from others which is not their nature. "Toleration places itself not between one man and man—between the being who worships and the being that is God, of the divine man to pay for worship, it presumptuously and blasphemously set itself up between God and man, and is mighty to receive."

If these writers who held by all professing Christians of all shades, were heard before going in turn to Congress, requesting it to enact laws for themselves.
