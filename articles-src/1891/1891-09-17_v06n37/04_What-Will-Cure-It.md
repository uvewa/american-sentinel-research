COLONEL SHEPARD is reported as saying that if the doors of the World's Fair are open on Sunday, "the Sunday will never recover from the entertainment." Upon this the *Word and Works* says:—

> This involves persons who professes to hold to a millennium—that is brought about through a moral influence—making themselves through the ministry and a devoted of the Divine upon the Morality Shepard himself the World's Fair is to close the doors of that institution on Sunday. The beautiful and striking collections of art have now been open to public inspection for many weeks. Some of the persons have discovered in that the frescoes, the museums have not been hurt; those communities and visitors from the author of the Nation, the ancient middle and modern, have not been hindered from their pedestal to a worshipper. The Master will never be entirely fulfilled in modern as an educator of the people and has had more orderly and interested visitors on Sunday than on any other day of the week.

The fact that no evil has as yet befallen the Montana power nothing; but the illustration above by Colonel Shepard and his co-laborers in their so-called "Sabbath reform," does prove that they are absolutely unworthy to be trusted with any power whatsoever over their fellow men. Who are so ready to invoke the wrath of God against those who do not please them, are just as ready to implement that wrath with civil penalties in case its demands remain to them to be too long delayed? It is the threatened Christian (?) boycott that is to come—that in case all do not agree on Sunday.
