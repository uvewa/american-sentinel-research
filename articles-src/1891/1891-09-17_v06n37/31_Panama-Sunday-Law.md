It is stated that a Sunday-closing decree has been promulgated recently at Panama, "the once gay and godless Babylon of the Isthmus." The new law provides that all places of business, with a few exceptions, shall be closed on Sundays. The exceptions are the railroad and steamship offices, for urgent business only; hotels, drug stores, restaurants, cook shops, bakeries, and the ice houses. But the exempted places that sell spirits are required to post a big placard notifying that no drinks will be sold before 4 P.M., when the prohibition ceases. The market, grocery stores, and barber shops may be open until 11 A.M. "The newspapers," remarks the Sun, "continue to announce the winning numbers in the Sunday drawings of the Panama Lottery, so presumably the lottery is exempted as a necessary business."
