It is stated that Dr. Brockman, who has been compiling statistics in Germany relative to mine accidents, has brought to light the fact that of the eight hundred and eighty fire-damp explosions which have occurred during twenty years in the Dartmund district, more than twice as many occurred on Monday as on any other day. If the advocates of a "civil" Sunday for the benefit of the "poor workingman" are sincere, they ought certainly now to demand a law requiring all mines to be worked continuously seven days in the week, as it is manifest that fire-damp gathers more rapidly when the mine is not worked for a day.
