THE question whether the World's Fair at Chicago shall be opened on Sunday is making serious trouble for the managers of the enterprise. They are asked to decide it as a question of moral and religious duty only, and not with reference to the pecuniary profits, of which the Exhibition will be in sore need.

The prevailing sentiment of the Protestant churches, as expressed in the deliverances of their assemblies, conventions, and conferences, is undoubtedly opposed to the Sunday opening. Delegations have been appointed to proceed to Chicago to protest against it as a violation of the commandment of God, which would outrage Christians convictions and tend to increase the popular disregard for the sanctity of the Lord's day. Religious papers are exhorting the managers to seek the approval of the Almighty rather than the favor of men, and to show to the whole world the depth and sincerity of their own piety and the piety of this country. When the Independent sought the views of bishops and leading clergymen on the subject, the Protestants were almost unanimous in condemning the policy of Sunday opening, and some of the Roman Catholics also opposed it as a dangerous innovation. This feeling too, seems to be growing under the stimulus of apparently concerted efforts for its cultivation, and from this time forward the managers of the Exhibition will feel its pressure steadily.

Meantime, we do not hear of any organized movement on the other side. The only loud appeals which they hear come from those who would shut the gates on the first day of the week without regard to pecuniary loss and without reference to the public convenience. It is God's will, cry the religious enemies of opening, and God must be obeyed. The spiritual gain of obedience, they declare, will far transcend in importance any material profit which disobedience might bring in.

The addition to their expected functions which is thus imposed on the Fair managers is of enormous weight. Besides looking after the secular interests of the Exhibition they are required to settle a controverted question as to the proper observance of Sunday. They must mix up business and religion, theology and finance, when they are at their wits' end to provide ways and means for carrying on the enterprise. Sunday opening would increase their receipts, and yet, much as they will need the money, they are called upon to give it up as a tribute to the religious sentiment of the Union, and as exemplars of Christian conduct and champions of a theory of Sunday observance which is rejected by the great majority of the people of Christendom, and of this country also. If the question as to the Sunday opening of the Fair were put to popular vote, undoubtedly it would be decided in the affirmative, in a very emphatic way. If the gates are opened on Sunday more visitors will enter than on any other day of the week. Yet the managers are urged to shut them as a religious duty overriding every consideration of profit or public convenience. The responsibility of honoring or dishonoring the commandment of God rests on their shoulders, according to the united declaration of Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian conventions.

The managers of the Chicago Fair are, therefore, in a situation full of difficulty and embarrassment. They are made the arbiters between two great parties in the religious world, and between the majority of the public who want to enjoy Sunday as a day of leisure, and the minority who would treat it as a fast-day, on which all amusement is forbidden by divine command. When the same question came up here in the discussion as to the Sunday opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it was decided contrary to the views of the Sabbatarians, and probably at Chicago they will be no more successful, for in principle the two cases are precisely alike. If it is allowable to visit a picture gallery on Sunday, it is proper to look at the collections of a World's Fair.
