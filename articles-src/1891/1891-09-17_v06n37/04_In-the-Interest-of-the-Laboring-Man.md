It is very popular nowadays to try to have the laboring man shoulder the responsibility of all the pet schemes and theories that various so-called reformers are trying to get through various legislatures. Just at present the American Sabbath Union is attempting to bribe the workingmen of America into an advocacy of the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair by offering them cheap rates of admission upon certain other days. All kinds of socialistic and paternalistic bills are introduced, trying to regulate our rest, religion, recreation, and various other things. Some can never seem to learn that people will get along just about as well when you give them a chance to use their own brains as when you try to make the Legislature do the brain work for the whole Nation.

Recently, Parliament was about to pass a bill prohibiting women from using a heavy forging implement known as the "oliver;" whereupon a deputation of these laboring women went to London to protest against the passage of the act.

At London they were questioned at length upon the manner of their employment, by the Home Secretary—an officer whose position in the British Government is much the same as that of the Secretary of the Interior in this country. Between Mr. Matthews, the Secretary, and a chain-woman the following dialogue took place:

Mr. Matthews: And what is the precise nature of the employment in which you are engaged—

Chain-woman (breaking in): I don't want to have my work taken away from me!

Mr. Matthews (blandly): Pardon me, that is not quite the point on which I desire information. If you will please explain to me the nature of the operation in which—

Chain-woman (firm, though flustered, and determined to get out what she had come all the way to London to say): It never done me no harm, sir!

Mr. Matthews: But, my good woman, if you will suspend your observations long enough to communicate some idea—

Chain-woman: I likes the 'eavy work, sir; an' I says, Let each one do what they can!

Not long ago in our own capital the Sunday-law advocates were trying to obtain a law "in the interests of the laboring man," prohibiting Sunday work (although in the foregoing anecdote the "laboring man" were women), and very plausibly laid their case before the Congressional Committee; but unfortunately for the Sunday-law advocates who were so solicitous for the "laboring man," the master workman of the whole federation of the Knights of Labor was present, Mr. Millard F. Hobbs, and by a few words blew their nicely concocted schemes into atoms. He said:

Mr. Crafts came before the Federation of Labor, and argued this bill, and that body refused to indorse the bill. He came before the District Assembly of the Knights of Labor (which is made up of all the Knights of Labor of the Assemblies of the District of Columbia), and that body has refused to indorse it. There are parties in that body who believe in the bill as it is; others believe in a certain portion of it, and others are wholly opposed to it; and the Knights of Labor, as a whole, have thought best not to have anything to do with it. Some of them do not believe in working on Sunday, but as for the other [the religious] feature of the bill, they think it best not to appear here in favor of it; and I believe there is quite a lot of the members of the order who believe that if they want rest on Sunday, or any other day, they can get it through their labor organizations, and that it is best not to try to get it through Congress by a sort of Church movement.

There are over thirty unions of Knights of Labor, and there has been only one petition sent here. They have remained silent upon this subject, and I think they want to remain silent upon it.

One of the gentlemen present, speaking of the effect of the speech said:

This speech, coming as it did, was more or less of a surprise to all; but to Mr. Crafts and his party it was a "stunner." It instantly crushed to atoms the whole pet theory which they had so nicely framed, and so pathetically presented in behalf of "the poor workingmen who are so cruelly oppressed by being forced to labor on Sunday;" and of the Church's gallant effort to liberate them from "the Egyptian bondage of Sunday slavery." Nothing could have happened that would more clearly expose the perfect hollowness of the plea that is made by the American Sabbath Union, that this Sunday movement is in the interests of the workingmen, than did this unpremeditated and wholly unsolicited speech.

This was worse for the theory of the American Sunday-law agitator than was the chain-woman's strictures on the British bill. The New York Independent truly says of the workingman "that a great deal is asked for in his behalf for which he is not responsible." This is true, as THE SENTINEL has before remarked, and of nothing is it more true than of the demand for Sunday laws made in the name of the workingmen.

Although thus constantly making these claims that the laboring people are so anxious for these laws, still the contrary state of affairs has been frequently a matter of complaint on the part of the leaders in the movement. Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, who for the past few years has been the leading worker for Sunday legislation, after setting forth in his recent work what he deems conclusive evidence of the benefit of compulsory Sunday observance, says:—

Blind to these great facts, a Shoe Lasters' Union in Brooklyn, at the publication of the new Penal Code of New York in 1882, adopted a paper which thus describes the Sabbath laws: "We learn with regret that the churches are joining hands with tyranny and capital for the purpose of suppressing liberty and oppressing the laborer"—sentiments representative of many labor organizations, which show that holiday Sundays prevent those who follow them from learning the a-b-c of political science, and keep them in such ignorance of the true meaning of liberty that they mistake its champions for oppressors.

Even educated men sometimes make the same blunder from infidel prejudices. John Stuart Mill characterizes "Sabbatarian legislation as an illegitimate interference with the rightful liberty of the individual," and with strange intellectual perversity affirms that "the only ground on which restrictions on Sunday amusements can be defended must be that they are religiously wrong."—The Sabbath for Man, page 226.

For the last millennium the world has slowly been learning the lesson that it is better to let individuals manage their private affairs, rather than have the government do it for them. Will the lesson ever be learned?
