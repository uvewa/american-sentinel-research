The Chautauqua Assembly Herald, of August 18, 1891, devotes its second page to a report of the meeting held in the Amphitheatre, August 10, conducted by Dr. J. M. Buckley, editor of the Christian Advocate, of New York City. This meeting was devoted entirely to answering questions which had been written and placed in the "question drawer." Among others we find the following:—

**Question.**—Since the churches in Chicago will be insufficient to accommodate the crowds that will be present at the World's Fair, will not the day be less desecrated if the gates of the Exposition be opened on the Sabbath to the public, rather than closed on that day?

**Answer.**—The person who wrote that question may be as good a Christian as I am; but the keynote of that question may be found in the words of a certain person which are recorded in the book of Job, and whose utterances were originally heard in the Garden of Eden. You seem to think that a man, who has not repented, is worse at one time than another. A man who utters an oath in the morning and swears every five minutes during the day, is no worse at sundown than the man who has taken the name of God in vain in the morning, and not once after that during the day, and has not repented of his sin. The man who goes out in the morning looking for a fight and does not find one, is as bad as if he had found one every five minutes during the day. We are opposed to the opening of the gates during the day, because, in that event, the day would be desecrated under the sanction of the Government.

But suppose the gates of the Fair should be open on Sunday and nobody should go in on that day; how, we ask Dr. Buckley, would the day be desecrated in that event? And suppose again that the gates were closed Sunday, but everybody wanted to go in then; how far from desecrating the day would they come in this case? Is not the man who goes out Sunday morning looking for an open Fair gate and does not find one, as bad as if he had found one open every five minutes during the day? So how much better are the people going to be if the Fair is closed on Sunday?
