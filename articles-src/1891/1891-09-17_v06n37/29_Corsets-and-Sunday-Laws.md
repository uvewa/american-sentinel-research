Miss Frances Willard is credited with the assertion that the corset has filled more graves than whisky. Here, then, is a grand opportunity for those philanthropists (?) who are so profoundly concerned for the physical good of their fellow human beings that they demand laws requiring everybody to rest, for their health. It will hardly be denied even by the civil Sunday-law advocates that intemperance is a greater civil evil than disregard of Sunday; and we have Miss Willard's word for it that wearing corsets is a greater evil still. Should they not then assail the greatest evil of the three rather than the smallest one?

If it is proper for the State to legislate upon the subject of rest, requiring men to abstain from labor one day in seven, for their physical good, why would it not be equally proper to require everybody to dress healthfully?

Nor can it be truthfully urged that the evil effects of Sunday-breaking are any greater in the community than are the ill consequences of corset wearing. The home and the family are the hope of our civilization. Corset wearing tends to destroy both. What is home with a peevish, sickly wife, and weak, rickety children? Nothing but a perpetual incentive to frequent the gin-mill and the gambling den. Then why should we not have a purely civil law regulating dress, and especially forbidding corsets as the very sum of all offending in the matter of attire, the archenemy of the home, the ally of the saloon and of the undertaker.

In view of these facts, should not Mr. Crafts instead of traveling and lecturing in behalf of Sunday rest from a "civil" standpoint, in the interest of lengthened life and increased happiness for mankind, devote himself to a crusade against corsets?
