The Herald, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, has the following, which illustrates the controversy between the Sunday press and the Sunday preachers:—

The Rev. Dr. Merrill, a gentleman belonging to the Methodist body, and calling himself a bishop, has added his quota to the mass of puritanical absurdity and inconsistency that has, during the past week, rendered Asbury Park and Ocean Grove the targets for the scoffs of the irreligious, and the contempt of all common-sense Christians.

He was enlarging on the subject of keeping holy the "Sabbath day," and in the course of his somewhat perfervid address, he turned his guns on the press and fired a raking shot at the members of the "fourth estate." Facing the reporters' table, he gave utterance to the following very foolish sentiments:—

The man who sits on this platform and reports a sermon for a religious or secular newspaper is as big a sinner as the man who plows his field on Sunday. One man plies his vocation as well as the other.

We hardly venture to imagine what would have been the feelings of this divine had he not seen his sermon in print on the Monday morning following. His indignation would have known no bounds, and would have vented itself in a tirade of abuse against the want of enterprise displayed by the local papers and the press correspondents. That is to say, his mortified vanity would have reproached those very men whom he had so fiercely attacked the day before for not being guilty of the very act which it had pleased him to call sinful—reporting his sermon—which, by the way, could not have been set up in type without a further violation of what he improperly styled the Sabbath. We suppose, however, that Dr. Merrill would have the divine law suspended in his case, and in his only.

But the inconsistency did not end there. The preacher branded the reporter as a "sinner," because he was "plying his vocation": The reporter was doing no more than the preacher. The only difference was that the slave of the quill probably earned about three dollars by "plying his vocation" in reporting the sermon, while Dr. Merrill would put as money in his purse some fifty or one hundred dollars for the delivery of it. Had the man been preaching for nothing, for the pure love of saving souls, we should be the last to blame him. But when he was not only absent from his legitimate sphere of duty in Kansas, when he was not only enjoying what the reporter so seldom gets, a vacation without any stoppage of his salary, but was also making money as a "star preacher," his utterances certainly savored naught of the divinely commissioned messenger of salvation. They were redolent simply of Pharisaism and hypocrisy.

Of the two men, the reporter and not the preacher was best observing the Sunday by doing his duty faithfully.

It is evident that the Sunday press and the Sunday preachers are at one in practice—that is, they both work for money on Sunday—they are, at least, a thousand miles apart in opinion.
