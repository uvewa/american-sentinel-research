AN officer of the American Sabbath Union, recently stated before a Chicago audience that, "It would be better, a thousand times better, for us to have the Puritan Sabbath again, with all its rigor, than the continental Sabbath."

The continental Sabbath is a day in which those who so desire, attend church, and those who prefer worldly pleasures (and this class is usually in the majority), spend the day accordingly.

The Puritan Sabbath "with all its rigor" compelled attendance at church, fines and imprisonment being the penalty for disobedience.

The American Sabbath Union, if correctly represented by this officer, "would prefer, a thousand times" that men should be forced to attend church by threatened fines and imprisonment than permit them to spend the day in pleasure seeking.
