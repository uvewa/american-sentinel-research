THE following editorial under heading, in the *Chicago Evening Post*, of August 31, 1891:—

The Rev. L. McLean has been mentioned before in these columns in connection with the work of the so-called American Sabbath Union, of which he is secretary. Mr. McLean attracted the attention of the *Evening Post* by the rather the direction of his adversary practice and the violence of his aspersions upon those who do not assent to those views. It was intimated, in all charity, that such advocacy injured rather than assisted the cause of rational Sunday observance—in which cause, be it remarked, the *Evening Post* is as much interested in the Rev. L. McLean or any other of that stamp.

At the Wabash Avenue Methodist Church last night, Mr. McLean read, proclaimed, dedicated or recited more of his favorite themes. The following sentences are extracted from this latest paper of his address:—

> They are he claims to be able to manage the affairs of their own family without any interference from a lot of ministers of Christ who live several miles away. Some say my apology for a major part of church and pray. I think them what is well a to did it. We didn't want that kind of a moral, Our foreman, moved. It's not an inspiration and a disgrace to have such at hand. I had a place to rest that is the with where to stay.

We join the great majority of Chicago's citizens in the hope that this latest prayer may not be granted. Mr. Washburne, besides having been lawfully elected mayor of this city, has attended pretty closely to his functions ever since his election. Having fulfilled these requirements, it is not essential of him that he should satisfy in all particulars an impertinent body of fanatics. Thus, the mayor has the assurance of the city, but he is doing he not only has warranty of law, but has followed the example of many gentlemen of Mr. McLean's cloth, though with this difference. While the mayor has kept in constant communication with his office for the transaction of necessary business, the vacation preachers lock their doors and give the key to the devil. There is not the slightest necessity for it, and when we come to consider the demands of Mayor Washburne's absence from those who have the most right and interest to complain.
