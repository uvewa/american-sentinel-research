Under the heading of "Natural Rights," the Clarion, of Richland, Iowa, has an article in its issue of August 28, which contains some principles that it would be well for those who are working for Sunday laws and kindred religious legislation to study and practice. The Clarion says:—

Lorenzo Dow, in a very plain, quaint way, gives his views on these natural rights, which all of us might profit by carefully considering.

In reading the life of this teacher of the better way, we find this: "Moral rights are the personal privileges to think, and judge, and act for one's self in point of moral duty. This is the more plain and clear, as no one is concerned but God, the Judge, and the individual man as the responsible agent. For what right hath any man to meddle with that which does not concern him?

"Moral duties are the result of moral law, which is the divine prerogative alone; and man hath no right to invade the moral duty of another, for his is the right of the divine government. No man, therefore, nor set of men, has a right to infringe upon, or bind, the conscience of another. Man, therefore, a rational creature, must be convinced before he can be converted, in order to act consistently as an agent accountable to the supreme Governor of the universe. Consequently, submission of will to a compulsory power, in matters of religion, in repugnance to the dictates of tender conscience, is nothing but an empty show, a piece of hypocrisy, without any mixture of moral goodness or genuine virtue. All churches established by law have been a curse to mankind and a pest to society. Law religion will cause people to be hypocrites, but can not cure them of error.

"Suppose that one man believes in one God, another believes in ten; what is that to the first? It neither picks his pocket nor breaks his leg, why should he persecute him? Persecution is contrary to natural justice, inasmuch as it assumes a power which no mortal can claim, it being the divine right only to judge in such cases. Universal right of conscience is given by the Author of nature, who is the moral Governor of the human family; and such liberty of conscience ought to be established in every land.

"Intolerance assumes to itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience; toleration assumes the right of granting it. Both are despotisms in their nature. Toleration places itself not between man and man, nor between church and church, nor between denomination and denomination, but between God and man—between the being who worships and the Being who is worshiped; and by the same act of assumed authority by which it tolerates man to pay his worship, it presumptuously and blasphemously sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it."

If these views were held by all professing Christians at the present time, there would be no petitions sent to Congress, requesting it to enact laws establishing certain religious institutions.
