COMMENTING upon certain arguments in favor of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the *Christian Statesman* of the 5th inst., says:—

Dr. Herrick simply trifled with the intelligence of this country. This city is to celebrate in July and August, 1893, thousands and thousands, perhaps millions of visitors to the city—hotel and private hostility will be filled to repletion, and the weather may be warm! What a thrilling picture this is, that on the Sundays the multitude be invited to stay home on a "rest." That is, he would have them all in all day in their narrow and overcrowded lodgings and halls in the possible foestation of seeking recreation and refreshment at Jackson Park. The idea is wholly devoid of reason and comfort, and wholly of religious bigotry.

Even the proposed religious and educational gatherings do not meet the case satisfactorily. There will be countless people here who care to take no more pleasure in such meetings than in the theatres. Indeed there will be some who, like Dr. Herrick, would prefer the religious meetings. Dr. Herrick takes it as a game of cuchre; and there is no more justice nor propriety in shutting them out from these sources of recreation, than there would be in excluding Dr. Herrick from them. Public rights cannot be measured with a tape line.
