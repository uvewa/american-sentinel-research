THE Radical, of Janesville, Wisconsin, has this to say of the King case:—

An American citizen, named R. M. King, was arrested recently in Union County, Tennessee, for the horrible crime of plowing quietly on Sunday, after having worshiped God on Saturday. Tennessee has a Sunday law, and in that State a man has no right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, which right the Constitution of the United States guarantees to every one. This is union of Church and State, and we hope to see Tennessee beaten in the game.
