A few days ago an Ohio woman testified in suit for divorce that her husband had once knocked her down for playing croquet on Sunday, although he himself frequently indulged in old sledge, euchre, and poker on that day. At first thought this man's actions seem a little inconsistent, but they are no more so than are Sunday regulations generally. The line must be drawn somewhere; and this man drew it at croquet. The authorities at some of the resorts near this city, and on some of the excursion steamers, draw it at dancing. There is just as good reason for the one as for the other. Nor is the analogy any less striking when we come to consider the right of the man to inflict summary punishment on his wife for the forbidden amusement; he had the right of physical power to enforce his arbitrary rule; the State has the same power, but no more. There is no more moral right in the one case than in the other.
