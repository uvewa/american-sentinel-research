The following editorial under heading, "Uncharitable Sabbatarians," appeared in the Chicago Evening Post, of August 31, 1891:—

The Rev. L. McLean has been mentioned before in these columns in connection with the work of the so-called American Sabbath Union, of which he is secretary. Mr. McLean attracted the attention of the Evening Post by the zeal rather than the discretion of his advocacy of his peculiar views on Sunday observance and the violence of his aspersions upon those who do not assent to those views. It was intimated, in all charity, that such advocacy injured rather than assisted the cause of rational Sunday observance—in which cause, be it remarked, the Evening Post is as much interested as the Rev. L. McLean or any other of that ilk.

At the Wabash Avenue Methodist Church last night, Mr. McLean preached, lectured, declaimed or scolded once more on his favorite theme. The following sentences are extracted from the newspaper reports of his address:—

The papers assure us that we have a mayor. They say he claims to be able to manage the affairs of this great city while enjoying himself hundreds of miles away. Some say this apology for a mayor will stay away, and for my part, I think it would be as well if he did. We don't want that kind of a municipal head. . . . Our German mayor. It's an imposition and a disgrace to have such a mayor, and I pray to God that he will stay where he is!

We join the great majority of Chicago's citizens in the hope that this impious prayer may not be granted. Mr. Washburne, besides having been lawfully elected mayor of this city, has attended pretty closely to his business ever since his election. Having fulfilled these requirements, it is not exacted of him that he should satisfy in all particulars an inconsiderable body of fanatics. True, the mayor has spent the summer out of the city; but in so doing he not only has warrant of law, but has followed the example of many gentlemen of Mr. McLean's cloth, though with this difference: While the mayor has kept up constant communication with his office for the transaction of necessary business, the vacation preachers lock their doors and give the key to the devil. There has been no considerable complaint of Mayor Washburne's absence from those who have the most right and interest to complain.

It is possible that Mr. McLean has been misquoted in the papers. If he has, he is relieved from the unpleasant imputation of having abused a well-intending mayor, and insulted from the pulpit the 300,000 German-Americans in Chicago, who yield nothing to him in point of good citizenship, and most of whom might give him valuable instruction in that charity which lays at the base of all Christian conduct. As we have remarked before, Sunday observance loses much and gains nothing by such ill-considered and uncharitable diatribes of abuse.
