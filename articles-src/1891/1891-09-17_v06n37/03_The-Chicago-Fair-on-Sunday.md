THE question whether the World's Fair at Chicago shall be opened on Sunday is making serious trouble for the managers of the enterprise. They are asked to decide it as a question of moral and religious duty only, and not with reference to the pecuniary profits, of which the Exhibition will be in sore need.

The prevailing sentiment of the Protestant churches, as expressed in the deliverances of their several assemblies, conventions, and conferences, is undoubtedly opposed to the Sunday opening. Delegates have been appointed to proceed to Chicago to protest against it as a violation of the commandment of God, which would cost religious Christians everywhere and tend to increase the popular disregard for the sanctity of the Lord's day. Religious feeling is evidently to have a strong hand in the approval of the Almighty rather than the favor of men, and to allow to the world at the depth and absurdity of their own piety and the piety of this community.

When the Federspiel sought a matter of bishops and leading clergymen upon the subject, the Presbyterians were almost unanimous in condemning the policy of Sunday opening, and some of the Roman Catholics also opposed it as a dangerous innovation. This feeling too, seems to be growing under the stimulus of specially earnest efforts for its cultivation, and from this time forward the managers of the Exhibition will feel its growing pressure.

Meanwhile, we do not hear of any organized movement on the other side. The only hope expressed which their place from those who would that the gates on the first day of the week without regard to pecuniary loss and without reference to public convenience. It is God's will, cry the religious enemies of opening, and God alone be obeyed. The pecuniary gains of obedience, they declare, will be transcended in importance by any material profit which disobedience would bring to the whole Nation.

In addition to their expected offerings which is the biggest impost the fair managers is of enormous weight. Besides looking after the secular interests of the Exhibition they are required to settle a controversial question as to the proper observance of Sunday. They must pass on business and religion, theology and law, know when they are at their post and to provide ways and means for carrying on the enterprise. Sunday opening might increase their receipts, and yet, much as they will need the money, they may establish upon it to give it up as a tribute to the religious sentiment of the Union, and as an employes of Christian conduct and character, place a theory of Sunday observance which is expected by the great majority of the people of Christendom, and of this country also. If the question as to the Sunday opening of the Fair were put to [291] popular vote, undoubtedly it would be decided in the affirmative, in a very emphatic way. If the gates are opened on Sunday, other visitors will come than on any other day of the week. Yet the managers may see in that no reason for the opening. Many such considerations of pecuniary duty override every consideration of profit or public convenience. The sentimental of honouring or dishonouring the commandment of God rests on their shoulders, according to the united declaration of Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian committees.

The managers of the Chicago Fair are, however, in a situation full of difficulty and embarrassment. They are made the arbiters between two great parties in the religious world, and between the majority of the public who want to enjoy Sunday as a day of leisure, and the minority who would treat it as a fast-day, on which all amusements and recreations should be banned. When the same question came up here in the discussion as to the Sunday closing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it was decided contrary to the views of the Sabbatarians, and probably at Chicago they will be no more successful, for precisely the same two reasons prevailed here. If it is allowable to visit a picture gallery on Sunday, it is proper to look at the wonders collected in a World's Fair.—*N. Y.* Sun, *September 10*.
