Sunday-Law Ideas of Protection.

[209] The second question and answer in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Leaflet No. 11, the first of which we noticed last week, is as follows:—

> Question 1.—Is the demands of our Constitution—or the State—compatible, enabling Americans to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity. Would in just what liberty to dismiss a free people what do they keep holy?

> Answer directly—not only the civil rights considered holy should be protected from desecration, and in order to establish justice and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity we must protect the rights of all at a day of rest.

This answer, like the one that preceded it, is a queer mixture. First it confesses that certainly it would not be in justice and liberty to declare to a free people what day they worship as holy; and then immediately nullifies that declaration by declaring that it is necessary to declare in order to establish justice and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. This is precisely what the same amounts to. It declares that though it would not be justice and liberty to dictate what day to keep holy, yet it demands that "the day generally considered holy" should be protected. Notice, it is the day that is to be protected, and not the people. It is the day as a *holy* day that is to be protected, and not the people. That is, the Government is legislatively and legally to declare that Sunday is a holy day; and then is to protect from interference, that holiness. That is, the Government is to allow nothing to be done on that day which would be out of keeping the character of holiness which the Government, to please a certain class of people, shall have declared attaches to the day. Just as surely as the Government does such a thing as that, the very doing of it does declare to a free people what day to keep holy. It even goes further than this; it actually compels them to keep it holy; for not to allow a people to do on a certain day declared to be holy, things that are inconsistent and out of harmony with the declared holy character of the day, is to compel them to conform to the declared holy character of the day; and therefore does actually compel them to observe the day as a holy day.

But why should a day generally considered holy be protected by the Government as a holy day? What right has the Government to take into its hands and impose upon the people the ideas of holiness which are held by a part of the people? What right has the Government to compel the other part of the citizens to conform to the ideas of holiness entertained by another part of the people? This is simply to ask, What right has part of the people to compel conformity of the other part of the people to the ideas of holiness? What right have I to compel my neighbor to adopt my ideas of holiness, or his, and compel him to observe them as though they were given? Does not this make me a judge in matters of religion, and to force conscience to put myself in the place of God who alone has right to be the judge?

I add to this the claim of the right of every neighbor to its conformity to our ideas of holiness, then I have not only made myself a promoter of God, but I have begun to exercise that of the devil.

Questions of holiness are to be settled by God alone for the individual; each individual is to decide for himself before God, and as God may enlighten his conscience, what is required of him in the way of holiness. No government has any right whatever to exert its authority in behalf of anybody's ideas of what things are holy.

[210] Taking those statements as the truth, it appears that the overwhelming majority of the American people are not only in favor of Sunday observance, but that they observe the day as a rest day.

Now it is not rather singular, and a doctrine altogether new in a government of the people, that the majority need to be protected? From whom are they to be protected?—From themselves, most certainly, because by their own representatives they are as really in the majority that it would be impossible for them to do anything to hurt anybody's holiness but their own! If it be the majority of the people, the majority who are oppressing themselves, how can they legislate? When it is done by the very men who are carrying on the oppression? If it be then an impression in new, we could cite, entirely for their benefit, the words of the Supreme Court of Ohio, that the protection guaranteed in the Constitution and laws is "protection against the acts of the government itself," "protection of the individual against the arbitrary action of the majority." The majority need no protect itself. Constitutions are made for the purpose of protecting the weak against the strong, the few against the many.

The observers of Sunday are not the ones to ask for any protection, because they are really the majority itself, and with their own presentation of the case they are really the majority itself, and they can protect them let themselves. There is not rightly any reason to protect it, and it is not to make everybody who should not ask for it, preach in detail the Government, which is not holy, and to unholy means to preserve it—to compel respect to the claimed character of holiness.

From the latter part of Mrs. Bateham's answer, however, it seems to be implied that the object of Sunday laws is not to protect the right to observe the day as a holy day; but that such means is needed, because an excuse in detail the right to observe the day as a holy day. This the reformers know; and they always say so, except when they have hopes of getting sympathy by presenting the idea that it is otherwise. Not only is this true as to the abstract idea of the right of all to observe as such, but it is true with regard to the persons who observe it; they need to be protected in such observance; for, during the hearing before the Senate Committee on the national Sunday rest bill, Mrs. Bateham stated that there were employed in the movement only "the daily newspaper press, the railroad managers, steamboat companies, saloonists and their classes, a class of foreigners who are not the Christianized Sunday and the very sect of Seventh-day Baptists."

O. T. Eck, in his remarks, said that "not more than three millions of our population work on Sabbath, and most of the number are unwilling workers." He said that "the laborer, or more than fifty-seven millions of our population almost put toil on the Sabbath."

[211] That is all it would be, and it would be utterly inconsistent. And we risk nothing in saying that these Sunday-law legislation people themselves would be the first to denounce it as intolerable and be the same. But if thus would be in the case of a minority who actually wished to be protected from the proposed protection of the Sunday-law workers, then what ought not to be thought of those people who claim to be the overwhelming majority, in their madness for Congress, asking for laws to compel every body to rest on Sunday for their sakes?

All gentle reader, it is not protection, but *power*, that they want. It is not protection for themselves, but power against those who do not agree with them in their ideas of Sunday holiness—this is what they want.
