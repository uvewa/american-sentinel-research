The Pope's Encyclical.

[210] The Pope's encyclical on the condition of labor, the full text of which has not yet been published in this country, contains much that is true, and advocates not only good morals, but also good economics. Among the good things, it presents the following:—

> That the civil government should, at its own discretion, penetrate and pervade the family is a great and pernicious error. True, if a family finds itself in great difficulty, utterly friendless, and without prospect of help, it is right that extreme necessity should be met by public aid; for each family is a part of the commonwealth.

> In like manner, if within the walls of the household there occur grave disturbance of mutual rights, the public power must interfere to force each party to give the other what is due. But the rulers of the State must go no further; nature bids them stop here. Paternal authority neither can be abolished by the State nor absorbed; for it has the same origin as human life itself.

This is good; but that the Pope did not mean by it quite what we would, appears from a subsequent portion of the encyclical, as follows:—

> We hold that the law should have no further reach than is necessary; for the proper purpose of government is to make men good.

Not so; the purpose of government is not to make men good. The purpose of civil government is to protect men's [212] natural rights. It is the purpose of the gospel to make men good, and as the gospel is purely persuasive the government has nothing whatever to do with making men good. It is the province of religion to make men good, and not the province of the civil government. But the Pope does not recognize this distinction, since the Papacy does not recognize any difference between the Church and the civil power. In the papal scheme the civil government is but an arm of the Church, to be used in carrying out its decrees.

This is utterly mischievous. If the State is to govern with a "solicitude which reaches to detail," if these details include the carrying out of family life in accordance with God's laws, and the maintaining of a high standard of morality "public and private," it must attend both the individual and the family. It is not a matter of government, however, but of the gospel. The paternal theory of government; it is thoroughly papal; its weakness is that Protestants are found defending and propagating a theory which is so utterly subversive of human liberty.
