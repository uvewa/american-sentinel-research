THE Pope, it is stated, has requested several competent men to furnish him with detailed memoranda for an encyclical letter which he proposes issuing in favor of a reunion of the Eastern and Western churches. The Vatican has been under the belief that European diplomacy would favor the maintenance of the status quo, and therefore gave every opposition to the desired rapprochement. The Pope intends to give instructions to the representatives of the Latin church in the East to modify their attitude towards the rival church, and to strictly avoid any actions of an inimical nature, in order that a more friendly spirit may be generated between the two churches.
