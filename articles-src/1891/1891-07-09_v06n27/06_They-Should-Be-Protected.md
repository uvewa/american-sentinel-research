The Evening Wisconsin, a Milwaukee paper, complains of the hostile attitude of the police of that city toward the Salvation Army, and says:—

The first attitude of the police department toward the Army was not unfriendly. . . . The report is current that the official hostility toward the Army is due to the theological zeal of one or more persons high in official authority, and grows out of a belief that the Army's practice of singing songs on sacred subjects to frivolous popular airs is a species of sacrilege. If this report is true it should occasion grave concern among lovers of liberty. There is no Milwaukee official authorized by law to exercise in a direct or a remote way the slightest particle of religious censorship over any of his fellow-citizens. If that sort of thing were to be tolerated there is no knowing where it would end. Odium theologicum is bad enough when clipped of its teeth and claws as it is by the liberal and wise laws of the United States and of the State of Wisconsin. It would be insufferably obnoxious if officially exercised by chiefs of police or mayors or other officials of the Government, city, State or nation, small or great.

It may seem to some people altogether wrong to praise God in such songs as those in which the Salvation Army praises him. But there is not a church in Wisconsin in which preaching and practice are everything that people adhering to other churches think they ought to be. There are those who sniff at the Baptists' belief in immersion; those who sneer at the Episcopalian clergyman's surplice; those who think that prayer-books are a hindrance to devotion; those who make merry over the earnest supplications, revealing personal idiosyncrasies, which are a feature of Methodist prayer-meetings. The elaborate ceremonies and symbolism of the Roman Catholics, equally with the stern simplicity of the Quakers, are criticised and questioned by those who do not believe in them. But under the Constitution of the United States the right of every citizen to worship God in his own way is inalienable. The police force of Milwaukee exists for the purpose of protecting law-abiding residents in the orderly pursuit of their avocations. . . . This is not Russia, but America. Under our free Government it is not necessary, as a preliminary to demanding the protection of the law, that a citizen should adjust his religious faith and practices with reference to the predilections of the chief of police or the mayor.

The protection of the members of the Salvation Army in their legal rights is a matter which concerns people of all religious and people of no religion at all. It behooves Milwaukeeans irrespective of creed to join in demanding police protection for the Army's meetings as long as it may be needed.
