THE INDEPENDENT, of Helena, Montana, in its Sunday issue of June 14, devotes half a page to the opinions of various men in regard to the way Sunday should be spent. If this were an isolated case it would not be worthy of note; but as one of many it shows how the secular press is taking the subject up and the interest that is manifested in its discussion.
