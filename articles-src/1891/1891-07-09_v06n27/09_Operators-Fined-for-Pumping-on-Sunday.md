Operators Fined for Pumping on Sunday.

[213] JENAS WORKS, of Pittsburg, has received a decision or June 29, against Wm. M. Gillespie and Albert Varnot, oil operators, for violating the laws of Pennsylvania in regard to doing unnecessary work at their wells on Sunday. The firm argued that it was necessary to keep some of these pumps going on Sunday, or their wells would be greatly damaged. The Judge said that the testimony of other operators satisfied him that if the pumping was stopped during the twenty-four hours of Sunday that the wells would not be damaged. In his decision the Judge said:—

> The Sabbath is defended by the statute a day of rest, of cessation from toiling for their usual worldly employments. This is in a day of worship and religious services. That it may be properly observed as a day of rest and worship by citizens who desire to observe it as such, it is necessary that all citizens abstain from their usual worldly employment.

By the order of Mr. Rockefeller, the pumps of the Standard Oil Company are to be run on Sunday hereafter. Whether this is a continuation of business policy and Sunday observance—to reduce the over-production and keep up prices—does not yet appear.
