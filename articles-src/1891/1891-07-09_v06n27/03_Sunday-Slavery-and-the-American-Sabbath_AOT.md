An enthusiastic meeting was held on Sunday evening, June 14, at the Church of the Covenant, North Halsted Street, Chicago, in the interest of better Sunday observance. Many of the prominent citizens of the North Side were present. Hon. C. C. Bonney, President of the World's Congress Auxiliary, and Rev. Herrick Johnson, were among the chief speakers.

Mr. Bonney dwelt upon the idea that when a man is forced to work seven days in the week, he becomes practically a slave. Dr. Johnson's burden was for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. He said there was not a single reason that could be given in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday, except the greed for the "almighty dollar." He gave the following reasons against Sunday opening, which to him were conclusive:—

1. The Sabbath is an American institution and should be exhibited as such.
2. Sunday opening would bring a rabble into the city on that day, that would make pandemonium of our streets.
3. The after effects of Sunday opening would be to give unbridled license to amusements of all sorts.

Where in all the wide land are men "forced" to work seven days in the week? If any man conscientiously desires to keep Sunday, and another undertakes to force him to work on that day, there is not a court in the United States but will deliver him from such oppression. But that is not the point. What Mr. Bonney wants is to force men to rest on Sunday, whether they want to or not. If it be said in reply that these men are forced to work on Sunday or lose their position, let them yield their position rather than violate their principles of right and duty, if it is from conscience toward God that they want to keep the day.

But that "American institution" which Dr. Johnson talks about, is more puzzling than anything else. It is variously called the "American Sabbath," the "civil Sabbath," and the "Christian Sabbath." This triangular Sabbath is first called Christian; then, since the American Christians keep Sunday that makes it American. And, lastly, since most of the States had enough of the old elements of a union of Church and State in them to lead them to incorporate Sunday into their statutes, that makes it civil. But if the religious idea was not at the very foundation, the rest of it would never have been thought of. Hence this talk about an "American" and "civil" Sabbath is simply to blindfold us so that we may not see the religious element which is the sum and substance of the entire "American Institution."

Apply this logic to another institution of the Christian Church. Baptism is an ordinance in which all the Christian churches believe; that of course makes it Christian. Most of the American Christians believe in it as strongly as they do in Sunday. Then why not call baptism American, too? Having done this, just one step more is needed to make it civil. Let it be recognized and enforced by law, and the structure is complete. Calling Sunday either "civil" or "American" does not make it such. It is a religious institution and nothing more, call it what we may. If simply recognizing Sunday in the laws of our land makes it civil, any religious institution or belief could be made civil in the same way.

This "American Institution" is to be "exhibited," so says the Doctor. But how? And which side is to be seen? Perhaps the State will exhibit the "American" and "civil" sides by closing the Fair on that day, and that will leave the ministers free to exhibit the religious side. Christianity needs no such help.

In regard to the Doctor's second proposition is it not true that the Fair itself will bring to the city all the "rabble" that can get there? Would a single ruffian stay away simply because the Fair was not open on Sunday? The rabble would be chiefly attracted by the opportunities afforded for theft and kindred crimes. The advantages will be as great in this direction on one day as on another; and whoever may stay away, the "rabble" will be there. And if to keep from having pandemonium on the streets is the object sought, it might be well to let a few of them go to the Fair on Sunday, and not have so many of them on the streets.

The final reason given for closing the Fair is that the "after effects of Sunday opening would be to give unbridled license to amusements of all sorts." If a man finds no entertainment or pleasure in the exercise of religion, why should Christians object to his seeking amusement of some kind on Sunday? If the heart is destitute of the grace of God, and the desire is there for some form of amusement, a simple law putting the amusement out of his reach on Sunday will not change his heart. And if the heart is not changed the man is morally none the better for abstaining from something which his very soul was on fire to get, but which the law had made it impossible for him to obtain. Christianity should labor to induce men to reject worldly amusements from principle, and that on every day as well as on Sunday. The State has no right to make anything a crime on Sunday that is fully sanctioned on every other day of the week. If the exhibitors desire to close the Fair on Sunday, they have a perfect right to do so, and we would not object in the least. But what we do object to is the idea of constantly trying to get the State to close it by law, and thus foster the idea of religious legislation. The principle is wrong, and should be opposed by every lover of either civil or religious freedom.
