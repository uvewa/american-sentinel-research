YIELDING to the irresistible logic of facts, the Mail and Express now admits that the working people of New York do wish to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that they have intelligence to appreciate the various works of art on exhibition there, and that they may be benefited intellectually by seeing such things; but it still insists that they should not see them on Sunday. Instead of Sunday opening our contemporary now proposes early morning opening. It says:—

The clearest light in which to enjoy pictures is that of the early morning. The concensus of painters, connoisseurs, learned and unlearned, is to this effect. The best morning light is now to be had before 7 o'clock. Therefore the time to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art is before 7 o'clock in the forenoon.

How this would benefit the workingmen is thus explained by the genius who presides at once over both the Mail and Express and the American Sabbath Union:—

The workman's day begins at eight. If he were to spend an hour or two in the galleries he would still have an hour in which to get to his work, and that would enable him to attend to his work in time anywhere in New York or Jersey City.

Then follows an extended panegyric upon early rising, ending in this remarkable manner:—

The majority of our workingmen do not sleep more than seven hours daily—from 11 p. m. to 6 a. m. They would be healthier and live longer if they would move this sleeping part of the day up the sliding scale of the darksome night, instead of still further exhausting their tired frames by the endeavor to stave off

Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep.

If they would retire at 9 o'clock, they could rise at 5, and thus add one hour to their daily rest, and also have an hour or two in the Museum before beginning toil. Every economic consideration is in favor of this proposed regimen. The workingmen would sleep sounder and be stronger—that would benefit them; and be brighter and spryer—that would benefit their employers; and be more conversant with the works of nature, and with their own children—that would benefit their families.

Give the workingmen the best time to visit the Museum, and the whole Sabbath, and you will educate, elevate, and Christianize them. This is what is needed by the Poles, Hungarians, Italians, Russians and all the people. Open the Metropolitan Museum at 5 o'clock a. m. six days in the week, for one season, and so give experience the opportunity to test its desirability.

This proposition though most absurd is entirely logical. First the Sunday-law advocates assume to say that the workingman shall rest one day in seven for his health; then they very consistently set about the task of seeing that he goes to bed at a proper hour, and that he rises betimes in the morning. It is just as proper that these pseudo-philanthropists should dictate to the workingman in one of these particulars as in the other. The Mail and Express says that "every economic consideration is in favor of this proposed regimen;" it follows that the economic reasons for Sunday rest are no greater than are the reasons for retiring at 9 o'clock and rising at 5; therefore if the State had a duty in enforcing Sunday rest for economic reasons it would have an equal duty to see that people take sufficient sleep.

But the fact is that the whole thing is an impertinence, and a most unwarranted interference with individual rights. Every man has the natural civil right to work as many days per week as he pleases, and to sleep as many or as few hours as he sees fit, and neither the State nor anybody else has any right to interfere in any way with this liberty. The Mail and Express should attend to its own business and allow the workingman to retire when he pleases, get up when he likes, and spend Sunday as he sees fit. The New York workingman has given notice that in the matter of rest he is able to take care of himself, and every consideration of common sense is in favor of permitting him to do it.
