THE Wine and Spirit Gazette, of April 25, published an editorial on "Our Sunday Laws and Catholic Priests," in which it was stated that "it is the people in our large cities and not the liquor dealers who want the liquor stores kept open on Sunday. If a canvass was made to-morrow among the liquor dealers of New York, fully three-fourths of their number would vote to abide by the existing laws, provided all dealers do the same, and are made to obey the law." It follows that stranger things have happened than that the liquor interests of the country should array themselves upon the side of Sunday laws.
