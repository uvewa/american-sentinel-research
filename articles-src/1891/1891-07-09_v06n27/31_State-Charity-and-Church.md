THE Catholic Review makes the death of a poor woman a few days ago in this city, through the heartlessness of State charity officials, the occasion to attack State charity. It says:—

State charity is not only a failure, it is an abomination. Whatever the erratic may think of the union of Church and State in other matters, in this it is imperative that both should work in harmony, the State supplying the funds, and Christianity supplying true vocations for nursing the sick, and caring for the helpless. Humanitarian burthings have long ago demonstrated that while they can write books on charity, they cannot run an hospital on any other than a money-making basis.

State charity is indeed cold, and is seldom honestly administered, but only evil could possibly result from a union of Church and State even in this matter. State funds could only corrupt the Church even if they were charity funds.
