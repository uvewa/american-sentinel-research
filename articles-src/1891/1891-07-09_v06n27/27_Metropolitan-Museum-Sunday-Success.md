THE Sun of this city, notes the fact that "the experience of every successive Sunday in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, since it was opened to the public on Sundays, has been entirely satisfactory. It has justified the hopes of those who advocated the Sunday opening, and dispelled the apprehension of those who deprecated it. The demeanor of the crowds of visitors every Sunday has been as perfect as could be desired, and it has been evident that they found both enjoyment and instruction in the Museum. Its doors will doubtless be kept open every day of the week hereafter."
