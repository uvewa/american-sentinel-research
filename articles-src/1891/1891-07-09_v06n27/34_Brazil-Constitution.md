THE new Congress of Brazil has failed to pass laws putting into effect the new Constitution, and so that instrument has been shorn of its effectiveness. The new Constitution provides for the complete separation of Church and State, yet the Administration has just refused to admit that ecclesiastical property is subject to the common law. It takes the position that the pre-existing body of laws was not annulled, ipso facto, by the adoption of the Constitution, and that until they are specifically repealed and others enacted in their places, they must remain in force. Popular opinion, however, is wholly to the contrary, and it is a matter of much public complaint and indignation that the Executive is not putting the Constitution in force.
