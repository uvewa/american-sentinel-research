A SUNDAY bill is again before the Parliament of Canada. "It has," says a correspondent of the Observer, "attracted much attention, and will no doubt in due time provoke considerable discussion." The bill forbids all labor except the most necessary; sales, recreations, drinking of intoxicants, brawling or profane language on public streets or in the open air; shooting, fishing, firing of firearms; printing, publication or delivery of newspapers or other literature. It also aims at the suppression of all railway traffic, except that of mail and milk trains, and certain specials in case of serious illness. The bill provides also that

At such time as the laws of the United States shall make corresponding provision, no through freight in transit from one point on the frontier of the United States to some other point on the said frontier shall be allowed to pass over Canadian roads on the Lord's day, except live stock and perishable goods.

The bill is said to have "the strong sympathy of the Protestant churches of Canada."
