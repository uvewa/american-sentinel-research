IN A RECENT DISCOURSE UPON the subject of Christian lawyers, Rev. E. B. Rogers, Burlington, Iowa, said:—

The Sabbath question, too, that must be settled. It is a God-ordained American institution, and we want it, and what is more, we will have it.

What is the authority for the statement that God ordained Sunday as an American institution? It is certainly not so stated in the Bible; and if the United States should incorporate Sunday into every statute and legal document, that would not prove that God ordained it. A great effort is being made at the present time to imbue the people with the idea that Sunday is an American institution, and that we are not patriotic unless we defend it as a part of our civil and political system. If the public can be led to believe and act on this idea, it will open the gate for bigotry and intolerance to assert itself, and carry us a long way back toward the evils of a Church and State union.
