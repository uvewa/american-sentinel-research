THE BOSTON GLOBE, of June 8, has the following news item from Lynn, Massachusetts:—

Although it had been expected that something definite would be done in relation to the Sabbath closing of business places yesterday, City Marshal Wells, after visiting several places to obtain an idea of the volume and nature of the trade, was as yet unprepared to take any specific action. It is stated that next week it will be determined if there is anything to be done and if so something of a definite nature will probably result.
