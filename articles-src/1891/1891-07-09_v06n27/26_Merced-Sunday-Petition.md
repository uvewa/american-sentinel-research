THE Merced, California, Express says that a petition is being circulated among the Merced merchants to secure the closing of stores on Sunday, and ventures the opinion, that "one day out of the seven should be observed as a day of worship or recreation according to the dictates of a person's own conscience, and Sunday should be the day." No law should be made compelling any religious observance.
