A Logical Proposition.

[211] This proposition though must always be entirely logical. First on the Sunday-law advocates to say that the workingman shall rest one day in seven for his health; they very comfortably set about the task of seeing that he goes to bed at a proper hour, and that he rises betimes in the morning, and in that case these pseudo-philanthropists should dictate to the workingman in one of these particulars as the other. The *Mail and Express* says that "every economic consideration is in favor of this proposed rest." It follows that the economic reasons for Sunday rest are no greater than are the reasons for retiring at 9 o'clock and rising at 6; therefore if the State has a duty in enforcing Sunday rest for economic reasons it would have an equal duty to see that people take sufficient rest.

But the fact is that the whole thing is an imposition, and a most unwarranted interference with individual rights. Every man has the natural right to work at whatsoever lawful occupation he may choose, and sleep as many or as few hours as he sees fit; and the statute of the law can not justly interfere in any way with this liberty. The *Mail and Express* should attend to its own business and allow the workingmen to retire when it pleases, get up when it likes, and spend Sunday as he sees fit. The *New York* workingman has given notice that the matter of rest he is able to take care of himself without the assistance of the busy-bodies who are anxious to use this means in favor of permitting the Christian Sabbath.
