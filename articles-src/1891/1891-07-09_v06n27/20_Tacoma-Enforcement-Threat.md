THE AMERICAN SABBATH QUOTES Rev. Dr. Patterson, of Tacoma, Wash., as saying, at a recent Sunday-law meeting:—

Do we pay a mayor and chief of police to sit by and see the law violated? Do we pay a prosecuting attorney who says that public sentiment is against the enforcement of the law, and who blocks the carrying out of its provisions? Let us tell him that we have one thousand grave diggers for every public officer who refuses to do his sworn duty.
