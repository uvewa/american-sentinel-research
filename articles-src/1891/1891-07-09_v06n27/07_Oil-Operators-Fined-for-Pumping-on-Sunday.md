JUDGE WHITE, of Pittsburg, Penn., rendered a decision on June 22, against Wm. M. Gillespie and Albert Varner, oil operators, for violating the laws of Pennsylvania in regard to doing unnecessary work at their wells, on Sunday. The firm argued that it was necessary to keep some of their pumps going on Sunday, or the wells would be greatly damaged. The Judge said that the testimony of other operators satisfied him that if the pumping was stopped during the twenty-four hours of Sunday that the wells would not be damaged. In his decision the Judge said:—

The Sabbath is declared by the statute a day of rest, of cessation from ordinary labor and work. It is also a day of worship and religious service. That it may be properly observed as a day of rest and worship by citizens who desire to observe it as such it is necessary that all citizens abstain from their usual worldly employments. This is the more important where such employment or business is carried on at such places and in such manner as to seriously interfere with the purposes for which the Sabbath day is set apart. I think it is a great mistake to suppose the statute was passed simply to conserve the health and physical vigor of the laborer. The man who pursues his worldly vocation on the Sabbath day is not fined because he has committed a sin, but because his conduct and example are pernicious in their tendency and effects.

This decision ought to satisfy the most ardent National Reformer that lives. This is "civil Sabbath" with religious emphasis. The union of Church and State always brings about just such decisions from the civil courts. Any National Reformer would avow that the Judge rendered a decision that was not in the least wrong. But he has read history to no purpose, who can not see in this decision an exact repetition of the course pursued during the fourth century, that resulted in the union of Church and State, with all its evil influences.

The Judge says that "it is a day of worship and religious service. That it may be properly observed as a day of rest and worship by citizens who desire to observe it as such, it is necessary that all citizens abstain from their usual worldly employments." What does worship have to do with civil matters? When a law demands that we cease from employments that are worldly the only thing left for us is that which is religious; or, in other words, that pertaining to another world than ours. Of course it is claimed that this is purely civil, and no union of Church and State in it. But the same argument that would prove this would prove also that there has never been a union of Church and State on the face of the earth.

The man who will defend such doctrine is on the high road to defending all the iniquitous practices of the Dark Ages; because it was never, even then, claimed that Church and State were united, but the Church simply rendered decisions and asked the State to carry them into effect. That was all that was done then, and Judge White is not doing any less now.

But a new departure is introduced that we have not seen in all the previous meanderings of the National Reform advocates. The Judge says, "The man who pursues his worldly vocation on the Sabbath day is not fined because he has committed a sin, but because his conduct and example are pernicious in their tendency and effects." That is to say, the man will not be fined for sinning himself, but because his example is so pernicious that it leads others to commit sin. This is some hair-splitting casuistry that might have occupied the attention of the bishops who waited upon Constantine the Great. If the Government is going to punish men for sin, why not punish the sinner for his own sin instead of punishing him for the sins he leads other men to commit?
