A COUNTY SURVEYOR from the State of Arkansas, under date April 14, writes:—

I have received a copy of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL for several months. Have read it closely. Only wish that we had one hundred thousand papers engaged in the same cause. Would be thankful for any light in that direction. I stand opposed to religious legislation in all its forms. Wishing you success in your enterprise,

I remain, —
