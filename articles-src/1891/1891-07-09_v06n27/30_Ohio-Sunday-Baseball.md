THE courts of Ohio have decided that Sunday baseball playing is illegal; "and now comes a singular state of affairs," says the Christian at Work. "The baseball umpire decides that a game of baseball consists of nine innings, and that eight innings cannot constitute a game. A report comes from the West that the courts have not been able to upset this queer decision, and that the eight-innings game on Sunday goes on. Eight innings are quite satisfactory for a Sunday diversion, and as it is one inning short of being a violation of the law, the baseball fraternity are willing to put up with it until they can get the Sunday law repealed."
