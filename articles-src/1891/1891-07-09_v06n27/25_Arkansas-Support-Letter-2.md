A COUNTY and probate judge from the same State, in a letter dated April 12, writes:—

I have been reading THE AMERICAN SENTINEL I am well pleased with the bold stand it has taken in defence of the American Constitution. My mind and time are both engaged in the affairs of my courts. I am opposed to the amalgamation of Church and State. I am a Baptist, and I try to look at that matter from a scriptural standpoint. I would be pleased to read the leaflets you refer to, if you will be so kind as to send them.
