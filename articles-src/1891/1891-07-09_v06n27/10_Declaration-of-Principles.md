3. Civil government has no authority over the religion of the citizen.
4. Religious organizations shall not use the civil power.
5. Religion shall not be used as a political factor.

By the order of Mr. Rockefeller, the pumps of the Standard Oil Company are to be run on Sunday hereafter. Whether this is a continuation of business policy and Sunday observance—to reduce the over-production and keep up prices—does not yet appear.

At a meeting held in Bloomington, Ill., a protest to the Sunday opening of the Exposition was passed on the ground that the infection of the State Sunday law would set a dangerous example before foreign bodies and encourage immigrants of law breakers and anarchists.

At the Methodist Conference, in Toronto, June 11, Rev. H. S. Mathews, President, for the steering year, in his speech of acknowledgment said, they should all do their utmost to engage the Sabbath observance movement. Which means, of course, to secure the enforced observance of Sunday by civil law as soon as possible.

The *Indianapolis*, of Helena, Montana, in the Sunday issue of June 14, devoted half a page to the opinions of various men in regard to the way Sunday should be spent. If this were an isolated case it would not be worthy of note; but as one of many it shows how the secular press is taking the subject into the interest of that is manifested in its discussion.

The *American Sabbath* greets Rev. PATTERSON, of Tacoma, Wash., as saying, at a recent Sunday-law meeting:—

> Is there no way that public sentinels and good citizens of getting it up and see the law violated? Do we pay a government to enforce whatever it is that any that public institution—wherever and whoever blocks the enforcing of the provision? Let us tell him that we have one thousand gross figures figuratively for every officer who refuses to do his sworn duty.

In a recent paper upon the subject of Christian lawyers, Rev. E. B. Rogers, Burlington, Iowa, said:—

The Sabbath question, too, that must be settled. In a God-ordained American, and then we will not wait, let and what is more, we will take no for any.

What is the authority for the statement that God ordained Sunday as an American Institution? It is certainly not so stated in the Bible; and if the United States should incorporate Sunday into every statute and legal document, that would not prove that God ordained it. The great effort is being made at the present time to imbue the people with the idea that Sunday is an American institution, and that we are not patriotic citizens unless we regard it was a part of our civil and political affairs. If the public can be led to accept such a conclusion, we shall see political legislation. If the public can be led to accept such a conclusion, we shall see the gate for bigotry and intolerance to crowd beneath the walls of a Church and a State power.

The *Boston Globe*, of June 6, has the following news item from Lyon, Massachusetts:—

Although it had been expected that something definite would be done to enable the Sabbath-coming of balance places yesterday, City Marshal Wells, after giving a more careful and serious idea of the volume and nature of the trade, was unable to suppress and to stay any matter, and it is announced that next work it will be determined if a continuance of the course should be of an indefinite nature will probably made.

A COUNTY and probate judge from the State of Iowa, in a letter dated April 16, says:

> I have been taking THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and was pleased with the bold stand it has taken in defense of the American Constitution. My work and time are both engaged in the affairs of my country. I am enlisted to the American cause and have no fears of the church and State power. I am a Baptist, and I try to look at that stand-up of the great religious question, I would be pleased to read the leaflets you refer me, if you will be so kind as to send them.
