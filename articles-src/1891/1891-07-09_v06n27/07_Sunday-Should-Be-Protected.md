Sunday Should Be Protected.

[212] The *Evening Telegram*, of Milwaukee, a paper, complaining of the hostile attitude of the police of that city toward the Salvationist meetings, very truly says:—

> The first attitude of the police department toward the Salvationists is a grave error.

The report is correct that the locality formerly used by the Army prior to the brotherhood and of one or more persons high in official authority, and grew out of a belief on the part of the proprietors that staging songs on street subjects to frivolous subjects are a species of nuisance. If this report is true it should occasion no astonishment. The fact remains. There is no Milwaukee official authorized to suppress any religious gathering in any way the slightest particle of religious oversight over any of his fellow-citizens. If that sort of thing were to be tolerated there is no knowing where it would end. Religious liberty may be free but when it is clipped of its teeth and claws as it is by [213] the internal and wise laws of the United States and of the State of Wisconsin. It would be fearfully abhorrent if officially exercised by chiefs of police or may or other officials of the Government.

The advantages will not be as great in this direction on any stay on our soil that wherever men may stay, the "rabble" will be there. And if to keep from furthering godlessness on the part of the objects ought, it might be well to let a few of them out, and not have so many of them on the streets.

The final reason given for closing the Fair is that the "after effects of Sunday opening would be to give subsidized license to amusements of all sorts." If it man finds no entertainment or pleasures in the excursion of religion, why should Christian object to his seeking amusement of some other sort? These acts are not subversive of the grace of God, and the desire in them for some form of entertainment, it bears the putting the amusement out of his reach on Sunday, will not draw him closer to Christianity.

And if the heart is not changed the man is merely come the better for abstaining from something which his very soul and was on a fire to get, but which the law had made it impossible for him to obtain. Christianity should to labour to induce men to reject sinful amusements of their own choice, and that on every day as well on Sunday as any other. It does not make anything a crime on Sunday that is fully sanctioned on every other day of the week. If the saloonists desire to close the Fair on Sunday, they have a perfect right to do so, and we would not object in the least. But what we do object to is the idea of the saloonists trying to get the State to close it by law, and thus foster the idea of religious legislation. This history would be wrong, and should be opposed by every lover of either civil or religious liberty.
