"Sunday Slavery" and the "American Sabbath."

[211] An enthusiastic meeting was held on a recent Sunday evening, in the Church of the Covenant, North Halsted Street, Chicago, in the interest of better Sunday observance. Many of the prominent citizens of the North Side were present. Hon. Mr. Bonney, President of the World's Congress Auxiliary, and Rev. Herrick Johnson, were among the chief speakers.

Mr. Bonney dwelt upon the idea that as man is forced to work on Sunday for his employer, and that the loss of Sunday rest in the work, he becomes practically a slave. He gave two cogent reasons for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. He said there was not a single reason that could be given in favor of opening the Fair on Sunday, except the greed for the "almighty dollar." He gave the following reasons against Sunday opening, which to him were convincing:

1. The Sabbath is an American institution and should be established and guarded as such.

2. Sunday opening would bring a rabble into the [212] city on that day, that would make disturbances likely.

3. The effects of Sunday opening would be to lower standards before all the world.

"Where is all the writs laid are not 'forced' to overwork seven days in the week? If any man consciously desires to keep Sunday, and another volunteer to forego the Sunday rest, is his work to rest on that day, there is room for both in the United States but still deliver him from such oppression. But that is all it is."

What is that Mr. Bonney wants is to force men to rest on Sunday, whether they want to or it is the one thing to do. It is true that these men are forced to work on Sunday or lose their position, let them seek some other master, rather than violate principles of right and duty, if it is from conscience toward God that they want to rest the day.

"That an 'American' institution" which Dr. Johnson talks about, is more passing into another estate. It is, he says the "child of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, and the 'Christian Statesman.' The Christian Statesman is first and called Christian, then, since adopted the name of American; keeping in mind that the name on it is American, that is, the Americanized Sabbath. It is the Sabbath of all the old elements of union of a Christian State to them to be born as one for this government.

But let the Reformed Presbyterian State. But if the religious idea was not at the very foundation, the rest of it would never have been thought of.

Hence this talk about an "American" institution "is totally nothing but a pretext to us that we may see the religious grounds on which the institution was really established. And the advocates are the very men who are not slow to avow their religious objects at all for Sunday protection. From the Torrent Spread of the Anglican Church,

> speaks to those resolutions in regard to the Sabbath. He says that the day is changed to the other hand, whatever may hold it, the advocates themselves in "the Rev. Christian Citizen." So says the *Toronto Mail*, of June 17, "such coercion in refer to the term 'anti-Sabbatarian,' as was applied by some people towards clergymen who favored the submitting to the people generally the question of Sunday. He himself had been referred to as an 'anti-Sabbatarian;' but he would remind his hearers that in the New Testament there was nothing to the effect that the Sabbath should be kept on Sunday and not on Saturday. The idea of keeping the Sabbath at present arose from an only Christian custom. For his own part he would allow no one to dictate to him as to the manner in which he should keep the Sab- [213] bath. Even in the matter of Sunday street cars for the workingmen to rest, he should be allowed to dictate to others. He would not say that cities that had street cars were very bad heathenish and less Christian than 'this most self-complacent and self-satisfied city of Toronto.'"
