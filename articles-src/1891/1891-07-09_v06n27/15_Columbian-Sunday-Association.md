THE COLUMBIAN SUNDAY ASSOCIATION of Chicago has sent out an "address to the weekly press of the country," containing about fifteen hundred words, giving the objects of the Association and saying that it "commends especially the American Sabbath Union and its auxiliaries, which organization is in closest co-operation with this Association. It is contemplated starting a systematic correspondence with all weekly newspapers friendly to the movement and we propose to furnish printed copy embracing from a half column to a column of the freshest 'Day of Rest' matter of a varied character. . . . We shall only require that any paper willing to co-operate shall mail regularly to this office copies marked indicating matter bearing on Sunday-rest questions."
