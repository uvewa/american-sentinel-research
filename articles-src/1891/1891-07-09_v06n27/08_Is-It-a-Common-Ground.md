The duty of educating into the Christian Church belongs, not to the public school, but to the church, the Sunday-school, the religious home. In those European countries in which this duty is shifted to the schools, the Sunday-school, if it exist at all, is less efficient than in America; the church is not, to the same extent, a working church, and the home does not, to speak moderately, approach nearer to the Christian ideal than does the American home.

An excellent opportunity to observe the practical workings of the teaching of "religion" as a branch of the public school curriculum is to be found in the German schools, where it has always occupied a central and commanding place. . . .

The Prussian Government has recently laid before the Landtag the draft of a public school law, the provisions of which may be regarded as the best possible arrangements for such instruction, if it is to be satisfactory to the denominations in question. The clergy are to be consulted in the selection of the text-books, and are given an absolute veto. They are intrusted with the examination of teachers as to religious qualifications. They have the right to visit the school while the religious teaching is in progress, and after close of school hours to "correct" the teacher in any errors which they may observe. It is, of course, implied that the teacher will be bound to act in accordance with the correction.

It will be noted that no attempt has been made in Germany to find a common ground for Catholics and Protestants, but that the schools are delivered unconditionally into the hands of the sect which, through force of numbers, government favor, or other circumstances, has secured control. We see here the strange spectacle of a State pouring money into one set of schools to pay for instruction in the Catholic religion, and into another set of schools for the purpose of counteracting their teaching. A careful study of the working of this plan, based on a personal visit to a large number of schools, leads me to believe that to introduce religious instruction into American schools would be an error fatal to religious life and activity, as well as an enormous injustice to the religious denomination not represented in the teacher. . . .

Further, I do not believe—and this is a vital point—that the interests of true religion would be served by the introduction of the new branch of study into the public schools. Notwithstanding the fact that the German people have all been taught "religion" in their youth, the indifference of the educated classes and the open hostility of the members of the most numerous political party of the empire to the religion of Christ are two most notorious facts.—Edward T. Devine, in Christian Union.
