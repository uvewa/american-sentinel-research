[209] If the State is bound to provide religious education, it has the right and the power to determine in what religious education consists, and to say what shall be taught as religious truth, and what shall be rejected as religious error.

What we special to our law is to tell us we are not to do on Sunday. A law that is good enough for six days of the week is surely good enough for the other. It is not the day on which the act is performed makes it criminal: it is the act. If it is bad on one day, it is equally bad on every day. It is not made criminal by civil act of Parliament. If Christians make idolatry recreation and glasswork a crime now, do they know that in the outer, when Freemasonry shall have gained power, revelation may not cease? And if not? It would be worse than natural life to do it. It is said that like begets like. They are the persecutors now. They are working as we are. May they not sow the whirlwind?—*President of Victoria, E. Bradshaw.*

The United States of America was founded, and is still supported, by a people comprising four great classes of belief—the Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew, and the atheist. Our Constitution was so prepared that if all, and now one, came, we protect the rights of every religious creed and interfere with not a single form of worship. According to that grand and beautiful instrument, which alone is our believer, one Jew, one Protestant, or but one Catholic in the Nation, he can hold his rights in the face of sixty millions; it is impossible, while the Constitution stands unaltered, to check the performances of a single day that he finds due his God, be it his gold, his cattle, or anything else he chooses to worship, regardless of the time, day or reason his devotions take place.—*Moral and Scientific Companion.*

[210] Therefore when the Christians, acknowledging and observing the true ideas of holiness which Jesus Christ had given them, disregarded as the unholy things which they were, all these things which were so "generally considered holy" and refused to protect the holiness of which the government exerted its utmost power, destroyed, this alone, it was which caused the persecutions, even to death, and for so long a time, the first followers of Jesus Christ. It in the face of all the exertions of all the power of the government the Christians steadily and positively refused to recognize any such of holiness, or to submit to the governmental power in its exertions to "protect" the things so "generally considered holy." And by their devotion to the genuinely Christian ideas of holiness as announced by Jesus Christ, they compelled the Roman Empire to recognize the ideas of protection to the things so generally considered holy, and to leave every man free and unhindered to practice his own ideas of holiness and to observe for himself things as he might consider holy.

Then when the Papacy was armed upon the power of the empire and raised up by these professions to be political leaders, as these people are now trying to do to "protect" the day and the things "generally considered holy;" there was again brought the spirit of persecution and the principles which produced the fires of Ages and the fearful despotism that reigned in those. And when the Reformation came, again holding before the world the true ideas of holiness and of holy things as announced by Jesus Christ, the Christians again compelled the overturning of the dominion of those who claimed to dominate the governmental ideas of holiness and holy things, and by the persecutions which just as God has inflicted at the first upon those who chose to decide for themselves before God what was required of them in the way of holiness and holy things; and our fathers who framed this new Nation, setting the long current of ages in the attempts of government to protect things and institutions generally considered holy, declared that this Government should not be cursed with any such thing, and therefore declared that "no religion shall ever be required as a qualification to any office of public trust under this Government," and that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and as they rightly decided to keep holy things in the interest so as to protect themselves.

In fact this is all any government can really profitably do. No Government can really protect anything that is really holy. If it be indeed holy, whatever connection the government has with it will just as certainly make it readily to the extent that this connection is recognized by anybody—even if the whole matter is just the idea. If a thing be really holy, it is fully able to support its own character of holiness, and it no more suspect for itself as such. If it is not really holy, then it ought not to be protected at all, for the sooner the falsehood is exposed and the unholy power destroyed, the better for all concerned. The government can not protect a thing that is really holy and to protect a thing that is unholy is to compel men to unfairness to, and thus to make men worse than they could possibly be otherwise. If the Sunday institution has not enough holiness to sustain itself, so as to compel the respect and observance of the people, then let this fact be known, let the fraud be exposed, and let the thing stand forth in the true character of unfairness, and the sooner this is done the better. And that Sunday does lack the character of holiness is evidenced by the very fact that those who most claim that it is holy are compelled to resort to the Government, which is not holy, and to unholy means, to preserve it, and to compel respect to its claimed character of holiness.

YIELDING to the irresistible logic of facts, the *Mail and Express* now admits that the working people of New York do wish to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that they have intelligence to appreciate the various works of art on exhibition there, and that they may be benefited intellectually by seeing such things; but it still insists that they should not see them on Sunday. Instead of Sun- day exercise they are condemned by newspaper-men to an insensible nothing only nurtured moving in opposition to them.

The current habit is wide to pay attention to the early evening. The costumes and positions contemplated, herein is also the office. The fact burning light at same to reduce it clearly. Therefore one less to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art is better than one who does.

How this encouragement to wickedness is then explained by the genius who presides at once over both the *Mail and Express* and the *American Sabbath* Union, the everyday day begins at night. If the people visit the galleries in the evening, they will have an hour in which to get to his work, and consequently do not visit on the Saturday as the same time was once observed.

This follows on extremely pungent upon early rising, ending in this remarkable paragraph.

"If the experience of our workingmen on that day—their daily lives—there is no way to act. They would be healthier and live longer if instead of seeking the darkness night and day and going up the seeking of the darkness night, the Christian authorities have claimed their hour to be riotous relative to others."

The *Wine and Spirit Gazette*, of April 7, published an editorial on "Our Sunday," which stated that "it is the people in our large cities and not the liquor men who want the liquor stores kept open on Sundays." If a canvass was made to secure the opening, the liquor dealers of New York fully three-fourths of their number would be able to tolerate by the existing law, ever willing, and all dealers to the same, and not only try to close the law. It followed with that stranger things have happened than that the liquor interests of the country should range themselves upon the side of Sunday observance.

A Sunday bill is again before the Parliament of Canada. It is "a bill" to the commencement of the Governor," "attracted much attention, and will no doubt in the time provoke considerable discussion." The bill forbids all labor except the most necessary: sales, recreations, drinking of intoxicants, breaking or profane language on public streets or in the open air; shooting, fishing, bird of firearms; printing, publication or delivery of newspapers or other literature. It also aims at the suppression of all railway traffic, except that of mail and milk trains, and certain special cases in case of serious illness. The bill provides also that

> It should time as the laws of the United States shall then consecutive provision, as through freight trains from the towns and the main the fortnight them shall be allowed to pass over Canadian roads, or that such freight shall wait and be delayed.

The bill is said to have the strong sympathy of the Protestant churches of Canada.

Two courts of Ohio have decided that Sunday baseball playing is illegal," and now comes a singular state of affairs," says the *Christian at Work*. "The base-ball season is well on, as the contest in the ball consists of nine innings, and that eight innings cannot constitute a game." A recent comes from the West that the courts have not been able to spend this power checking, and that the eight-innings game on Sunday goes on. Eight innings may give occasion for as faithful a Sunday diversion, and as it is one inning short of being considered an illegal game, the owners are willing to put up with it until they can get the Sunday law repealed."

The *Catholic Review* makes the death of a man a recent few a few days ago with this city, through the boathouse of the American city, notably, the occasion to denounce Statue: charity.

> Whatever the character may think at this time it is imperative that both should work in harmony for the relief of the mass. . . . Charity is intended for the sick and those who need and cannot for the helpless. Benevolent societies, however, do a vast amount of good. Those hospitals in our city that are to our relief through them are not however as they are to us with the provision made by the State. No hospital on any other than a money-making basis.

State charity is indeed cold, and is seldom honestly administered, but only evil could possibly result from a union of Church and State in charity; because State funds could only corrupt the Church even if they were charity funds.
