To Vote or Not to Vote.

[212] The editors of the *Christian Statesman* have been especially prominent in the action of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, at Pittsburg, where six ministers were expelled for demanding right of franchise and so, in that regard, fulfilling their duty as American citizens. The *New York Times*, of May 26, reports Rev. David McAllister as asserting that it is a principle of his church that it is a sin to vote, and when asked whether he thought the church element would be sufficiently strong to force the principles, Dr. McAllister described the principles.

The National Reform Association is the child of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the *Christian Statesman* is the organ of the National Reform Association, and its editors are ministers of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, nevertheless in the issue of June 18, the *Christian Statesman* publishes on its editorial page drawings of several national emblems, drawn by W. T. Stroad, the first an American shield.

The old obstacle still lingers in some antiquated quarters that Christians have nothing to do with the affairs of this world, that this world is the devil's, and that to vote they have which they have to hurry with their time grinded into the dust and see the Lord's day turned aside excepting so far as to conserve its due worth, and still then it is unlawful to vote.

In the issue of May 28, there is republished from the *Herald, Forward* without unfavorable comment an article by Henry Rankin White, formerly president of the American Institute of Civics, in which are the following passages:

> Others justly their neglect of civic duties on the great and timeless the relations between religious and the State may be vicious they should not be suffered. The neglect of any civic statement that since root in the activities of the promise as evil that may criticise crimes by

[213] erited on the power of God is excreted,—with a falsely scientific which and only golden the whole, the man's reasons to deviate are evil.

> Now seeing the interests of the public are of private individuals, are those that person, and a good soul should be mentioned, that family life should be carried on in accordance with God's laws and those of nature, and that a high standard of morality should prevail in public and private life.

This is utterly mischievous. If the State is to govern with a "solicitude which reaches to detail," if these details include the carrying out of family life in accordance with God's laws, and the maintaining of a high standard of morality "public and private," it must attend both the individual and the family. It is not a matter of government, however, but of the gospel. The paternal theory of government; it is thoroughly papal; its weakness is that Protestants are found defending and propagating a theory which is so utterly subversive of human liberty.

The Judge says that "it is a day of rest and worship for Christians and may be properly observed as a day of rest and worship by citizens who desire to observe it as such, it is necessary that all citizens abstain from their usual worldly employment." What this shows plainly is this: to do with civil matters? When a law demands that we must rest from business for the day it is imperative that both should work in harmony; that worldly the only thing left for us that which is religion; and in other words, that pertaining to another world leaves it that which is of this world alone, this is purely civil, and no union of Church and State in it. But the same argument would give this world all, and proves that there has never been a union of Church and State on the face of the earth.

The man who will defend such doctrine is on the high road to defending all the abuses of Church and State in times past; because it was never, even then, claimed that Church and State were united, but the Church simply rendered decisions and asked the State to carry them into effect. That was all that was done then, and Judge White is not doing any less now.

But a new departure is introduced that we have not seen yet. In the previous manipulation of the National Reform advocates. The Judge says, "The man who refuses to worship would violate a Sabbath day is not fined because he has committed a sin, but because his conduct and examples are pernicious in their tendency and effects." That is to say, the man is not to be fined for criminal himself, but because his example is so pernicious that it leads others to commit sin. This is some hair-splitting casuistry that might have escaped the attentions of the bishops who waited upon Constantine the Great.

If the Government is going to punish men for sin, why not punish the sinner for his own sin instead of punishing him for the sins he leads other men to commit?
