AT THE METHODIST Conference, in Toronto, June 11, Rev. H. S. Matthews, President-elect for the ensuing year, in his speech of acknowledgement said, they should all do their utmost to support the Sabbath observance movement. Which means, of course, to secure the enforced observance of Sunday by civil law as soon as possible.
