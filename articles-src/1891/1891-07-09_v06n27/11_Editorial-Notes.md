[216] NEW YORK, JULY 9, 1891.

THE Merced, California, *Express* says the petition is being circulated among Merced merchants to secure the closing of stores on Sundays, and the following opinion, that one day out of the seven ought to be observed as a day of worship or recreation, according to the dictates of every man's own conscience, and that Sunday should be the day." No law should be enforced regarding any religious observance.

The Son of this city, notes the fact that —the experience of every successive Sunday the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when it was opened to the public on Sundays, has justified the hopes of those who aided the building in the hope of the great Sunday opening, and displayed the appreciation of those for the education. The frequency of the crowds and their deportment every Sunday has been as perfect as could be desired, and it has been evident that no fraud, and holograph, and instruction in the Museum. Its doors will be kept open every day, and instruction should be kept open every day.

The *Wine and Spirit Gazette*, of April 7, published an editorial on "Our Sunday," which stated that "it is the people in our large cities and not the liquor men who want the liquor stores kept open on Sundays." If a canvass was made to secure the opening, the liquor dealers of New York fully three-fourths of their number would be able to tolerate by the existing law, ever willing, and all dealers to the same, and not only try to close the law. It followed with that stranger things have happened than that the liquor interests of the country should range themselves upon the side of Sunday observance.

A Sunday bill is again before the Parliament of Canada. It is "a bill" to the commencement of the Governor, "attracted much attention, and will no doubt in the time provoke considerable discussion." The bill forbids all labor except the most necessary: sales, recreations, drinking of intoxicants, breaking or profane language on public streets or in the open air; shooting, fishing, bird of firearms; printing, publication or delivery of newspapers or other literature. It also aims at the suppression of all railway traffic, except that of mail and milk trains, and certain special cases in case of serious illness. The bill provides also that

> It should time as the laws of the United States shall then consecutive provision, as through freight trains from the towns, the fortnight them shall be allowed to pass over Canadian roads, or that such freight shall wait and be delayed.

The bill is said to have the strong sympathy of the Protestant churches of Canada.

Two courts of Ohio have decided that Sunday baseball playing is illegal," and now comes a singular state of affairs," says the *Christian at Work*. "The baseball season is well on, as the contest in the ball consists of nine innings, and that eight innings cannot constitute a game." A recent comes from the West that the courts have not been able to spend this power checking, and that the eight-innings game on Sunday goes on. Eight innings may give occasion for as faithful a Sunday diversion, and as it is one inning short of being considered an illegal game, the owners are willing to put up with it until they can get the Sunday law repealed."

The *Catholic Review* makes the death of a man recent a few days ago with this city, through the boathouse of the American city, notably, the occasion to denounce State charity.

> Whatever the character may think at this time it is imperative that both should work in harmony for the relief of the mass. . . . Charity is intended for the sick and those who need and cannot for the helpless. Benevolent societies, however, do a vast amount of good. Those hospitals in our city that are to our relief through them are not however as they are to us with the provision made by the State. No hospital on any other than a money-making basis.

State charity is indeed cold, and is seldom honestly administered, but only evil could possibly result from a union of Church and State in charity; because State funds could only corrupt the Church even if they were charity funds.

Even in the matter of Sunday street cars for the workingmen to rest, he should be allowed to dictate to others. He would not say that cities that had street cars were very bad heathenish and less Christian than "this most self-complacent and self-satisfied city of Toronto."

The past president has received several competent men to furnish him with detailed memorandums for an un-called Charter, which he proposes tending in favor of a reunion of the Eastern and Western churches. The Vatican has been under the belief that European diplomacy would favor the maintenance of this status quo, and the desired rapprochement. The Pope intends to give instructions to the generals of the Latin church in the East to modify their attitude towards the rival church, and to strictly avoid any infusion of its mission, in a condition to obtain at least more friendly spirit of being between the two churches.

The new Congress of Brazil has finished its pass laws putting into effect the new Constitution, and as that instrument has a complete provision for religion as the Constitution provides for the complete separation of Church and State, yet the Administration has just refused to admit that ecclesiastical property is subject to the common law. It takes the position that the pre-existing body of laws was not annulled, *ipso facto*, by the adoption of the Constitution, and that until they are specifically repealed under existing rules their remain in their places, they must remain in force. Popular sympathy, and the tendency of the new laws, are contrary and it is a matter of much explicit complaint and indignation that the first act in cutting the Constitution in force.
