The editors of the Christian Statesman have been especially prominent in the action of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, at Pittsburg, where five ministers were expelled for defending their right of franchise and so, in that regard, fulfilling their duty as American citizens. The New York Times, of May 26, reports Rev. David McAllister as asserting that it is a principle of their church that it is a sin to vote, and when asked whether he thought the liberal element would be sufficiently strong to effect a revision of this feature of the church's principles, Dr. McAllister ridiculed the idea.

The National Reform Association is the child of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the Christian Statesman is the organ of the National Reform Association and its editors are ministers of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, nevertheless in the issue of June 18 the Christian Statesman publishes on its editorial page without criticism, extracts from an address by Wm. T. Stead, the first paragraph of which reads:—

The odd doctrine which still lingers in some antiquated quarters that Christians have nothing to do with the affairs of this world, that this world is only to be regarded as a wilderness through which they have to hurry with their loins girded up, caring nothing for the fate of those on the wayside excepting so far as it concerns the next world,—all that is a damnable bersey.

In the issue of May 28, there is republished from the Boston Journal without unfavorable comment an article by Henry Randall White, President of the American Institute of Civics, in which are the following sentences:—

Others justify their neglect of civic duties on the ground that because the relations between religion and the State may be vicious they should have no relations; a proposition as logical as the statement that since men in the activities of life are prone to evil they may cultivate virtue by sloth. . . .

There is grievous wrong in the conditions which separate the men of the sanctuary from the men of the caucus. . . . There is surely need for sober thought as to the remissness of Christians in their duties toward the State.

The actual strength of the elements which are professedly representative of the highest principles which can be applied to human affairs is clearly shown by comparative statistics.

In 1890 there were in the United States not less than 10,480,000 members of the Christian churches, exclusive of Roman Catholics, . . . leaving in round numbers 4,331,000 church members who were of voting age.

Number of male church members as compared with persons of voting age who exercised the right of suffrage in 1888, more than twenty eight per cent.

The number of regular attendants upon church services, not communicants, . . . including Roman Catholics, . . . in the male population which exercised the right of suffrage in 1888, not less than seventy-five per cent.

It is plainly evident that if Christian citizens were united and persistently devoted to the work of exemplifying in citizenship the principles of their faith, without the intrusion of ecclesiasticism in affairs of the State, but by individual devotion to duty—they could at once exercise a power for the purification of politics which would be simply irresistible. . . . Religious men are not to be omitted in taking the census of political sinners.

There can be no other inference when more than 6,000,000 of adult citizens so regularly listen to the teachings of religion, and so miserably fail in that united and faithful application of these teachings which is alone needed to make them potent in the councils of the Nation.

The editors of the Christian Statesman have been the most active factors in the public dismissal and disgrace of worthy and able ministers for publicly expressing their disagreement with the doctrine of "political dissent," and have put themselves upon record that in so doing these ministers committed a heinous sin; yet in the paper which they edit they aid and abet in counselling and advising others to vote, and so themselves commit this same heinous sin.
