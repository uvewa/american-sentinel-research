THE Toronto Synod of the Anglican Church, in session at Toronto, June 13, passed some resolutions in regard to the observance of Sunday in that city. In speaking to these resolutions "the Rev. Professor Clark," so says the Toronto Mail, of June 13, "took occasion to refer to the term 'anti-Sabbatarian,' so was applied by some people towards clergymen who favored the submitting to the people generally the question of Sunday cars. He himself had been referred to as an 'anti-Sabbatarian,' but he would remind his hearers that in the New Testament there was nothing to the effect that the Sabbath should be kept on Sunday and not on Saturday. The idea of keeping the Sabbath as at present arose from an early Christian custom. For his own part he would allow no one to dictate to him as to the manner in which he should keep the Sabbath. Even in the matter of Sunday street cars for the workingmen no man should be allowed to dictate to others. He would not say that cities that had street cars were very heathenish and less Christian than 'this most self-complacent and self-satisfied city of Toronto.'"
