The Pope's encyclical on the condition of labor, the full text of which has only recently been published in this country, contains many good things, but also many pernicious things. Among the good things, is the following:—

The idea that the civil government should, at its own discretion, penetrate and pervade the family and the household, is a great and pernicious mistake. . . . If within the walls of the household there occur grave disturbances of mutual rights, the public power must interfere to force each party to give the other what is due. . . . But the rulers of the State must go no further; nature bids them stop here. Paternal authority can neither be abolished by the State nor absorbed, for it has the same source as human life itself.

This is good; but that the Pope did not really mean it is evident from a subsequent portion of the encyclical, as follows:

We have said that the State must not absorb the individual or the family . . . nevertheless, rulers should anxiously safeguard the community and all its parts. . . . The gift of authority is from God, and is, as it were, a participation of the highest of all sovereignties; and it should be exercised as the power of God is exercised—with a fatherly solicitude which not only guides the whole, but reaches to details as well. . . . Now among the interests of the public as of private individuals, are these: that peace and good order should be maintained; that family life should be carried on in accordance with God's laws and those of nature; that religion should be reverenced and obeyed; that a high standard of morality should prevail in public and private life.

This is utterly mischievous. If the State is to govern with a "solicitude which reaches to details," if these details include the carrying on of family life in accordance with God's laws, and the maintaining of a high standard of morality "public and private," it must absorb both the individual and the family. It is not a matter of surprise, however, that the Pope advocates the paternal theory of government; it is thoroughly papal; the wonder is that Protestants are found defending and promulgating a theory which is so utterly subversive of human liberty.
