SENATOR CARLISLE says: "It is the duty of the Government to administer public affairs, and not the duty of the people to manage their own private affairs."

According to the *Union Press*, Mr. Clemens in his talk on "The European Monarchies," condemned by the rulers in order to appease the people. They call it personal liberty, say the people; they call it personal liberty, story, that *the people clamor for slavery* themselves.

All questions of political economy and of party politics—our insignificant complications, the great question of personal liberty, the maintenance of our public schools and the perpetuation of religious freedom in these United States.—*Rev. E. L. Rexford, in M. E. Ministers' Meeting*.

A master is usually by mastering the servant, lost both his sceptre and his freedom. [CARLISLE, 29: 15.] A bootblack the little to be served may be the lot of the American people who hold the sovereignty of power, if they, in the person of their representatives, shall attempt to unite in the combined action of the organized Church and State.—*Col. Richard M. Johnson*.

JEFFERSON'S doctrine was that all men are created free and equal. Of course he did not mean that the Congress negroes, as we find them in Africa, are equal in ability or attainment to the Anglo-Saxon as he is to-day. Our understanding of Jefferson's declaration has always been, that in political and religious matters every citizen had made all men equal, but that human pride and selfishness had made distinctions and privileged classes. Jefferson asserted the essential doctrine of democracy. Stated in other words, it means that every American citizen should have an equal chance, as far as our laws affect him.—*Press, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin*.
