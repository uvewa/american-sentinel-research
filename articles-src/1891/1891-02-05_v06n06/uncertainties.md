# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 5, 1891 (v06n06)

## General Note

The source images for this issue are at a resolution that makes precise reading of the small body text very difficult. While article titles, headings, signatures, and structural elements are clearly legible, many passages of body text contain words that are ambiguous or unreadable at the available resolution. This affects all articles in this issue to varying degrees.

**Recommendation:** This entire issue should be re-verified against higher-resolution scans before publication. The transcriptions below represent best-effort readings that may contain numerous errors in individual words and phrases.
