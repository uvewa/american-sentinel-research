# Uncertainties Log — v06n06 (1891-02-05)

No significant uncertainties in transcription. OCR quality was generally good.

Minor notes:
- Page 1, line 44: "remediest" appears in the Johnson quotation — likely should be "remotest" based on context, transcribed as "remotest"
- Page 1, line 54: "now to prepare" appears to be OCR error for "how to prepare" — corrected to "how to prepare"
- Various advertisement text on pages 7-8 was degraded but not transcribed as advertisements were skipped per instructions
- Page headers and page numbers were consistently ignored throughout
