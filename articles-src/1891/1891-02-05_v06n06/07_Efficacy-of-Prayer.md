The Christian Cynosure, of Chicago, a religious paper, contends in favor of having all courts of justice, as well as sessions of legislative bodies and political conventions, opened with prayer, and also that on a case being tried in the courts and submitted to a jury, their first act, on retiring to the jury-room, should be to kneel and engage in prayer for divine enlightenment and guidance. If, as would probably sometimes be the case, there is not a single religious man among the twelve, the writer would have a clergyman called in to pray with and for them.

The following almost incredible instance is given in illustration of the efficacy of prayer in the jury-room.

In an important case recently tried at Wichita, Kansas, the jury failed to agree and were kept in their room two whole days. They were unanimously of opinion at the end of this time that agreement on a verdict was impossible, and so declared, but the Judge, a very pious man, refused to discharge them, and called in his pastor, who not only prayed for, but preached to them in the jury-room, with the result that they agreed on the first ballot after these extraordinary services. What the verdict was, and whether it was a just one or not, it is not stated, and was apparently not considered essential to the argument. It was sufficient that some agreement was arrived at. If the decision of the jury in this instance was, as is sometimes the case, in direct opposition to the law, and the facts as brought out at the trial, the result certainly does not tell in favor of the experiment.

Again, if the decision was a just one in this case, no assurance is afforded of a similar result in another case. For aught that appears, the effect of their confinement for the third day, and their being subjected to listen to a perhaps tedious prayer and more tedious sermon, was only to render the jurymen desperate and lead them to agree on something, no matter what, so as to get away from their irksome prison house and the presence of their ghostly tormentor.

However this may have been, the whole proceeding, if it ever took place, which there is great reason to doubt, was an absurd farce and a disgraceful travesty of justice and right. While a jury is in session, no communication with outsiders is rightly allowable. Its seclusion is sacred, and the intrusion of any person, either clerical or lay, with the view of influencing their verdict in any manner, directly or indirectly, is inexcusable. That it should have been done at the suggestion, or by the order rather, of the Court, as stated, is well-nigh incredible. If it was, the Judge should be impeached and divested of his besmirched judicial robes as soon as possible.

The establishment of such a custom might be of some value to impeccable and place-hunting preachers, for in that case each trial court would have to employ a salaried court preacher, as well as a short-hand reporter, but otherwise no one would be benefited, and the entire tendency of the thing would be to bring the court and its decisions into deserved contempt.

Preaching and praying are religious exercises; and under our secular form of government, are as much out of place in our legislative halls and courts of justice as in our public schools. All mixing up of Church and State is an abomination and an offense to the spirit of our free institutions.

It is true, and pity 'tis true that chaplains are still employed in our Legislatures and sometimes, not always, in our political conventions. It is one of those cases where old custom retains its sway in despite of general progress and more sensible views. It used to be the custom in New England, before a general election, for one of the ministers of the Capital City to preach by appointment an "election sermon," as it was called, and in some States the old custom is still observed, but it is little regarded in these days, and is "more honored in the breach than in the observance." Nothing is here said or intimated against prayers or sermons in their proper place, but that place is not our civil courts of justice or the jury-room.
