A JEWISH monarch by grasping the holy censer, lost both his scepter and his freedom. [2 Chron. 26:19.] A destiny as little to be envied may be the lot of the American people who hold the sovereignty of power, if they, in the person of their representatives, shall attempt to unite in the remotest degree, Church and State.—Col. Richard M. Johnson.
