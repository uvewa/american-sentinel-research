Two weeks ago, in answer to a question from the Pastor of the Independent Church at Bloomington, Illinois, we briefly gave our views upon this subject. The matter is again called up by another letter from the same gentleman, who writes as follows:—

Bloomington, Jan. 16, 1891.

To the Editor: I was quite surprised to find in the last issue of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL that my brief note of ten days ago had called for unfavorable comment, or for that matter, any comment at all.

I am free to confess that I certainly did not "understand the position" of THE SENTINEL on the public school question as touching the inculcation of morals in our common schools.

If I now understand you, it is to the effect that morals should be taught in the family, in the church, in the parochial school, but not in the public or common school.

If the youth of the State should be taught morals,—if it is desirable they should have any ethical training,—why not give them these advantages in the common school?

THE SENTINEL answers by saying that morals cannot be taught without teaching religion—without the recognition of Christian authority—the Bible—or the God of the Bible. And this cannot be done without connecting religion and State.

Will THE SENTINEL permit me to say that the purest forms of morality—the purest and noblest qualities of it—were among men centuries before the Pentateuch was given by Moses? That five hundred years before Jesus, our Lord, was born, the very highest and safest excellence of moral character existed among the various nations of the earth? That among all men, in all epochs of history, in all grades of civil and moral culture and religious character, the very essence of morality has existed and has been the safeguard of the people? Morality is authority, because it is best; just as moral and physical purity carry with them—is inherent in them—the very highest qualities of authority. Therefore it is not necessary, in order to moral character, that either Moses, Jesus, Osiris, Brahma, Mohammed, Buddha, Odin, or any other written authority, shall be recognized, for among them all the same moral excellence has been recognized—a moral excellence which is the common property of mankind—as the idea of God in many forms is the common property of man.

Again, will THE SENTINEL, which recognizes that morals should be taught the youth, and specifies the church school, the private school, and the family, as the necessary instructors, please tell us where that very large class of children, who have no moral homes, no church, no private tutelage, are to receive the necessary moral instruction, in order that they may be qualified to discharge the duties of citizenship safely? Somebody must teach them, or the State will be endangered by ignorance and immorality.

I did not anticipate that I would be called upon to justify my short note to THE SENTINEL. I am glad, however, that you have been entirely frank in the statement of your views, and trust that THE SENTINEL will come to see that morals can be taught without recognizing the religion or creed of any sect or denomination. Meanwhile, I heartily indorse the aim of THE SENTINEL to oppose all legislation on the Sunday question, or forcible entrance of religion in our common schools—that is, as long as religion is held to be indissolubly joined to creed.

H. O. HOFFMAN.

We are afraid that we must disappoint the hopes of our correspondent, for we are not at all likely to "come to see that morals [in any but a restricted sense] can be taught without recognizing religion." Morals must have a sanction; therefore, to teach morals is not only to teach rules governing actions but to teach also the reasons for those rules; and our position is that the only adequate reasons for the most fundamental moral principles are found in the law of God. That this conclusion is justified by usage is easily shown.

Webster defines "morality" thus:—

The relation of conformity or non-conformity to the true moral standard or rule; the quality of an intention, a character, an action, a principle or a sentiment, when tried by the standard of right; the quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principle of morals.

"Moral," used as an adjective, is defined by the same authority, as follows:—

1. Relating to duty or obligation; pertaining to those intentions and actions of which right and wrong, virtue and vice, are predicated, or to the rules by which such actions and intentions ought to be directed; relating to the practice, manners, or conduct of men as social beings in relation to each other, as respects right and wrong, so far as they are properly subject to rules.

2. Conformed to rules of right, or to the divine law respecting social duties; virtuous; just.

The definition of "right," as applied to morals, is:—

Conformed to the constitution of man and the will of God; never deviating from the true and just; according with truth and duty; unswerving; just; true.

In answering the question, "What is the difference between religion and morality?" the Christian Union says:—

Religion is defined by Max Muller as being such a manifestation of the Infinite as produces an influence upon the moral character of man. In a less generic but more practical sense, religion is the maintenance of such relations between the soul and God as promote life and character that are righteous. Accepting either of these definitions, there is evidently no true religion which does not promote morality, and, in our judgment, there is no permanent, enduring morality which is not rooted in and dependent upon religion.

We are well aware that the word "moral" is used to signify no more than outwardly correct deportment, civility, a recognition of natural rights, and the like, but as we have seen, it means much more than this; it means "conformed to the divine law." It follows that that which Mr. Hoffman wants to have taught in the public schools is not morality but utilitarianism—"the doctrine that virtue is defined and enforced by its tendency to promote the highest happiness of the universe." The nearest approach that it is possible to make to genuine morality without reference to the law of God, which, according to Webster, is "the true moral standard," would be to teach civility and civil justice upon the basis of the self-evident truth that all men are by nature endowed with certain inalienable rights; but this should not be taught as the sum of morals, neither should it be taught that this truth, though self-evident, is the ultimate basis of all moral obligation.

To teach utilitarianism is to establish in the mind of the pupil a purely human standard of action, and to teach him not only that it is a standard, but that it is the standard. This would at once place the State in antagonism to Christianity. The effect on the pupil would be, as we remarked in a former article, to place him in a position where it would be impossible for the teaching of the gospel to reach and elevate him at any subsequent time, because he would be unable to comprehend the existence of anything higher or more desirable than his own conceptions of right, to recognize any obligations higher than what might appear to him to be his self-evident obligations to his fellow-men.

Because it is desirable that moral instruction should be given to all children it does not follow that the State should give it. A failure on the part of the State to teach morals would neither lessen the quantity nor injure the quality of the moral instruction given to the youth of the land. Indeed, the effect of the State's tampering with such things is to paralyze spontaneous home Christian missionary effort. The less the State professes to give of moral and religious instruction, the more will be given by Christian benevolent institutions of all kinds—given as it should be given, and by those who should give it. The State is the poorest possible dependence in such a matter.

We are well aware that much—we think too much—has been claimed for the morality of the ancient pagans. True, the world has always had some knowledge of correct moral principles, but this has been because it has never been utterly devoid of the moral law. History shows that as any people have lost sight of the principles of that law they have retrograded morally. We do not entertain the idea that God left the world without witness till the time of Christ, nor even till the giving of the law at Sinai. And as far as correct morals were ever practiced among the heathen, their existence was, we hold, due to the fact that the people still retained some knowledge of the moral law. Of the heathen who had not the written law, the Apostle Paul said: "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another." Rom. 2:14, 15.

The boasted morality of even the most enlightened heathen philosophers did not approach the morality of the divine law, and is not to be compared with it. It is well known that the Spartans taught their children to lie and steal. According to Professor Stuart, "both the Epicureans and the Stoics allowed and defended sodomy and incest, numbering these horrid crimes among the things indifferent." Horne says: "Pride, and the love of popular applause were esteemed the best and greatest incentives to virtue and noble actions; suicide was regarded as the strongest mark of heroism." "Acts of the soul—the adultery of the eye and the murder of the heart—were little regarded.* On the contrary, the philosophers countenanced, both by arguments and example, the most flagitious practices. Thus theft, as is well known, was permitted in Egypt and Sparta; Plato taught the expediency and lawfulness of exposing children in particular cases; and Aristotle, also, of abortion. The exposure of infants, and the putting to death of children who were weak and imperfect in form, was allowed at Sparta, by Lycurgus." "Customary swearing was commended, if not by the precepts, yet by the example of the best moralists among the heathen philosophers, particularly Socrates, Plato, Seneca, and the Emperor Julian." "The unlimited gratification of their sensual appetites, and the commission of unnatural crimes, was common among the most distinguished teachers of philosophy, and was practiced even by Socrates himself." Gibbon testifies that "the devotion of the pagans was not incompatible with the most licentious skepticism."

That these things are true of even the best heathens is not strange, when we consider that their morality and religion were alike utilitarian. Their gods were of like passions, with themselves, and their highest incentives to virtue were "pride and love of applause." And now it is seriously proposed, not only by Freethinkers but by not a few Christians, to teach morality in our public schools in a way that will make pride and love of applause the highest incentive to virtue, in the minds of the rising generation. The children are to be taught to be good that they may be happy and highly esteemed, to be honest, because, forsooth, it is "the best policy," to be truthful that they may be respected, to be virtuous that they may be admitted into good society! God forbid that such morality should be taught in our public schools!

"Virtue will surely be rewarded, but one who seeks virtue for the sake of reward can never find it, because the end at which he aims is not virtue but the reward. He makes virtue a secondary consideration, and no one can obtain it who does not make it first."

*Many advocates of "natural morality" in our own day attach but little importance to thoughts and intents of the heart. Only a few days since a prominent Freethought editor said to the writer: "Covetousness is not immoral; it is the spring of all progress." And yet covetousness is the root of theft, as but is of social vice.
