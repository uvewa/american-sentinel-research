## Evils of Paternalism.

MRS. SALLY JOY WHITE has written a book, on cookery in the public school, and a Western paper comments upon the fact as follows:—

> Much of the misery and unhappiness in woman's life is caused by her ignorance in the most simple things in domestic life. Mrs. White advocates a kitchen in every girls' school, a place for practice according to the public school which will give the child an idea, in a commonsensical way. Two thousand girls may go through the highest schools of a city, and yet a girl cannot know woman's work if not taught, a boy cannot do the work outside. What a boy or a man's work should the girl be taught to do a man's work? And the answer is, for the same practical schooling in keeping with the age in which we live, and for her own sake to avoid false pride of caste among the rising generation of both sexes.

It is true that ignorance of how to prepare healthful and palatable food is deplorable, but it does not follow that the State should undertake to give instruction in cookery. "Boys are taught in technical schools to do men's work," and very properly so, but "the cases are by no means analogous. Few homes afford the facilities for giving a mechanical and business education, such as is demanded by boys, but every home does, or at least should, afford facilities for giving instruction in common household duties of a practical cooking; and it is in the home and by the mother, or at least under the supervision of the mother, and under her influence, that girls should receive such instruction.

There would be nothing radically wrong about the State giving such instruction, if there would be in its teaching religion. The evil in it is that it is right in line with the paternalism that seems to be rapidly gaining ground in this country, that the parents owe no duty to their children after they arrive at a school age, except to feed and clothe them. Indeed, it is seriously proposed to practically turn the children over to the State at a still more tender age than formerly. A recent member of the *Goethe Review* notes the fact that "the kindergarten is becoming paternal in this country, and a society has been organized in the city of New York to establish independent kindergartens, which may in time become the property of the public school-system." "There is," says the *Review*, "more significance in this movement than appears on the surface. And the significance is in the trend which we have indicated. It shows that the tendency of the times is to increase the influence of the State upon the life of the child and to minimize that of the parent; to make the State everything to the child and the parent nothing. Judging from present indications it will not be long until the only duty of parents, as such, will be to beget and bear children for the State, teachers in the employ of the State to do the rest."

This evil is a wide-spread and growing one, and has already attracted itself to the attention of Congress. In a speech in the House, January 16, Mr. Clements, a member of the Committee on Appropriations, said:—

> People come about our committee rooms full of sentiment. They tell us that it is better to provide a school-house and free school books and free uniforms of that kind than to spend money in maintaining forts and military and prisons. That is a very charming sentiment. It sounds very well; and it is all right. But as I see it, I have come to believe that it does not necessarily follow that because a man is to be educated therefore he does not deserve to go to the penitentiary. [Laughter.] We have been spending and depending upon education as a cure-all for this country. . . . I do not intend to make any assault upon education or to criticize its grand individuality; to buy his books and food for him, to get to school and to take care of himself he will most probably make a virtuous and industrious citizen.

> At the same time he had before the Committee a request to establish schools on the kindergarten basis in the city of Washington. I do not propose to make any criticism upon the measures now before Congress.

[42] would this enterprise, nor do I criticize the system of kindergartens. They are all right. But the argument was that we should provide money to the mother of the child at the age of three, taking him to the street and making a good citizen of him; that it is better to support such a system as this rather than to maintain prisons and penitentiaries.

But statistics not only of this country but other countries fail to substantiate these propositions to the schools and kindergartens which are to do everything. This proposition involves all these things. The children for the first four or five all long years and putting him entirely under the influence of a public school education, of others than the parents. But there is a total neglect of what is a very necessary branch of education. The child is taught from the start that he must look to the Government for everything; that is paternalism.

The idea of self reliance is entirely eliminated. It is taught to look to the Government for clothing, food, and everything. Not only that, but he is set upon one of by the public instinct, or the Government through its agents, and to this extent certain influences are removed from him, the great lesson of morality and religion, those principles of morality and religion, the government of the life of a man or woman, and which, in the government of the life of the person, are almost entirely neglected. The great evil in the management of the public schools in this especially looking to the intellectual side of the child, and besides he is taken a young child from school to school from school attendance to the development of the muscle, giving games about physical movements and various things of exercise. I make no objection upon those ever at that. I think it all very well, but I fear in the course of human events that while we educate the intellect and the muscles to the entire neglect of the home teaching of the home, the instruction in morality, thrift, honesty, industry, self-reliance. Those are all wiped out by the parental argument.

MR. CLEMENTS has clearly pointed out some of the evils of this system of laying all the State burdens and responsibilities that should be borne by the individual. Parents can do for their children vastly more in the way of aiding them to form right characters than it is possible for the State to do, and they owe to them the most solemn obligation to do it. They make a fatal mistake when they seek, at the hands of the State, relief from the responsibility which rests upon them as long as they are parents. It is right that schools should be established for the instruction of the youth of both sexes in those things that cannot be better taught at home; but the idea that children of tender age must be taught in public kindergartens and that girls must be taught the culinary art in public schools and at public expense, when the instruction could be given so much better in the home, is most uncharitable. It shows a dangerous tendency on the part of the parents to shirk duties that should be held sacred and courteously discharged, and also an equally dangerous tendency upon the part of the State to undertake work that naturally belongs to the home. The homes and home influences should be preserved at all hazards, parents' care and parental influence should be preserved and strengthened rather than weakened. But let us go
