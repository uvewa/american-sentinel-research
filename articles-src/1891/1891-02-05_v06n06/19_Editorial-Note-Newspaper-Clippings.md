WE are thankful to our friends who have sent us newspaper clippings, etc., giving items of interest more or less closely connected with our special work. We are not always able to use these things directly, but they are generally suggestive, and so helpful to us. Papers when sent should be marked; the clippings should be accompanied by the name and date of the paper from which they are taken.
