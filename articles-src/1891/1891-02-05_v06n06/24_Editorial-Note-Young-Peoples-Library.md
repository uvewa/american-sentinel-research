ONE of the best numbers of the "Young People's Library" yet issued, is "Jottings from the Pacific No. 2, the Tonga Islands and Other Groups." This book, though one of a series, is like its companions, complete in itself, and is a most readable and instructive book. Parents will do well to cultivate in their children a taste for such reading. A year's subscription to the "Young People's Library" costs only $2.75, or $5.50, according to binding, for twelve numbers of one hundred and sixty pages each. Those who desire to secure not only unobjectionable but really instructive books for their children, cannot do better than to order this library for a year. Address, Pacific Press, 43 Bond St., New York, or, Oakland, California.
