JEFFERSON's doctrine was that all men are created free and equal. Of course he did not mean that the Congo negroes, as we find them in Africa, are equal in ability or attainment, to the Anglo-Saxon as he is to-day. Our understanding of Jefferson's declaration has always been, that in political rights and privileges our Creator had made all men equal, but that human pride and selfishness had made distinctions and privileged classes. Jefferson asserted the essential doctrine of democracy. Stated in other words, it means that every American citizen should have an equal chance as far as our laws affect him.—Farm, Field, and Stockman.
