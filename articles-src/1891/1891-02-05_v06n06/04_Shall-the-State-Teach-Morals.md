## Shall the State Teach Morals?

Two weeks in, in answer to a question from the Pastor of the Independent Church at Bloomington, Illinois, we briefly gave our views upon this subject. The matter is again called up by another letter from the same gentleman, who writes as follows:—

> Bloomington, Jan. 18, 1891.

> To the Editor:—I was surprised to learn from the last issue of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL that any letter of the day had called for refusal argument, comment, or for that any comment at all.

> I am free to confess that I certainly did not understand the position of THE SENTINEL on the public school question at the reading of the "Morality" article in November.

> I heartily co-endorse it. It is to the effect that moral truth should be taught in its purity, in the church, in the household, and in the school.

> If the youth of the State should be taught morals, and if it is desirable they should have some advantages in knowledge—why not give them these advantages in the common school.

> THE SENTINEL answers by saying that morals cannot be taught without teaching religion—without the recognition of Christian authority—the Bible—or the God of the Bible. And this cannot be done without contending religion and State.

> With THE SENTINEL, permit me to say that the potent forms of morality—the potent and solemn qualities of law-sense—so long as they arise from the considerations given by Moses. That "God hath treated yoke burden upon, dear Lord, 'was but love, the wonderful work of the Divine character,—a character existed among the various nations of the earth.' That among all men, in all epochs of the

[43] State Grange of Michigan in its annual meeting, last month, gave its voice upon this question in the following plain statement of several principles:—

We expect that National Grange, the Farmers' Alliance, and other organizations of farmers have refused the proposition in one form or another held up by the Government or the people, against the loaning of one billion of treasury notes direct to the people, either directly and as much, or at a rate of interest, would lead to a very dangerous monetary measure.

These systems could be devised at its operation as guarded as to prevent partiality and favoritism in distribution. Not by farming to agents as banking agent, next to its political associations, every thoughtful man must have seen.

That it would create a feeling of religious dependence upon Government and if put them in a disposition to regard to benefit, thereby enticing their individual upon, destroying their energy and self-reliance and rendering them helpless pendencies of Government agents and functionary of human nature.

That it would lead to the fictitious improvidence relying upon Government aid, or Government forbearance, by whose stock it seeks to handle, would be conducive to the habit of reckless expenditure. The evidence that we are surprised that the National Grange should take this position. It is clearly in the chance of those who hope to gain for themselves a competency, rather than trusting in and submitting to the ignorant or improvident debtor, and we warmly accept them.

Yet as sound as these principles are, the lessons they imply will not, apparently, be easily understood by all who can read. It is clear very much whether either the Farmers' Alliance or the National Grange will accept them.

life, in all grades of civil and moral culture and social character, the very essence of morality has existed and has been the subpoint of the greatest power. Morality is authority, because it is but just moral and physical purity carry with themselves, in themselves. In them, very highest qualities of authority. Therefore it is not necessary, in order to moral character, that either Moses, Jesus, Christ, Brahma, Mohammed, Buddha, Odin, or any other religious authority, shall be recognized, for among mankind, moral excellence which is the common experience of the conscious moral evolution among human itself is the constant force of morality in the common possession of the human race."

Apart from THE SENTINEL, which recognizes that morals should be taught the youth, and specifies the church the school the private faith and the family, as the necessary instances, please tell me where there lay that type class of children, who have no moral homes, no church, no private tutelage, or have no access to the necessary moral instruction, in order that they may be qualified to discharge the duties of citizenship under? I sincerely ask to be most removed from his or her Station, by the State.

I did not anticipate that I would be called upon to justify my position, I must affirm that the apparent approach, that you have now entirely back in the standard of your own views, and even that THE SENTINEL is correct—that morals cannot be taught at all without recognizing the religion or creed of any religious sect. And I have been asking for years from the state of THE SENTINEL, to oppose all efforts at religious education in the public schools, position of religion to our common schools—that is, as long as religion is to be understood—it should be raised to make it first."

H. O. Havemeyer.

Our article fully and clearly answered the hopes of our correspondent, for we are not at all likely to "come to see that morals [in my text] as a matter of fact can not be taught without recognizing religion." Morals should have a morality. . . .

therefore, to teach morals is not only to teach right, giving earnest attention to faith also the reasons for those rules; and our position is that the only adequate ultimate reasons for the most fundamental moral principles are found in the law of God. That this position is justified I purpose to easily the authorities:—

Webster defines "morality" thus:—

> The relation of conformity or non-conformity to the true moral standard or rule. . . . The quality of an act which renders it morally good; according to the true standard of right.

The quality of an action in a character, a sentiment, or a principle of right, the quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principle of morals.

"Morals," used as an adjective, is defined by the same authority, as follows:—

> Relating to duty or obligation; pertaining to those intentions and actions of which right and wrong, virtue and vice, are predicted, or to the rules by which such actions and intentions are to be directed; relating to the practice, manners, or conduct of men as social beings in relation to each other, as respects right and wrong as far as they are properly subject to rules.

> A conforming to rules of right, or to the divine law respecting social duties.

The definition of "right," as applied to morals, is:—

> According to the constitution of man and the will of God; never deviating from the true and just; accordant with truth and duty; conformed to the divine law.

In answering the question, "What is the difference between religion and morality?" the *Christian Union* says:—

> Religion is defined by Sir MacKenzie as being the manifestation of the finite or perfection in influence upon the moral character of man. In a law sense these two more practical, religion is the maintenance of such relations between the soul and its promotion of his and character of mind. . . . Accepting either of these definitions, religion may be considered without which morals may not morality, and, in our opinion, there is no personal morality worth which is not rooted in and founded upon religion.

> We are well aware that the word "moral" is used to signify no more than the externally correct deportment, such as is naturally correct deportment, which represents a recognition of natural rights, and the like, but we so use it, we mean something less than it; it means "conformed to the divine law." If children taught in the public schools is not morality but mere Mr. H. refuses what is to know them what of public schools is not morality but stillness—"a doctrine that leads to indifference and enforced by its tendency to promote disregard of human nature and immortality."

We do not attempt that the true position is the honest approach that it is possible justify the interpretation that morals cannot be taught contrary to the law of God, which, according to Welshley, is "the true moral and civil justice upon the basis of the self-evident truth that all men are created equal, and endowed with certain inalienable rights; which cannot be set taught in the man in our public schools. And so stating of Church and State is an abomination alien to the spirit of our free institutions.

It is true, and joy "to free that those laws are enforced only through legitimate and legal institutions," and, not always, or even universally, yet and contravention. It is one of those causes whose old customs retains its every in every society. It is so strongly entwined with all classes. It used to be the common school and every citizen.

New England, is a point grandly gained, for one of the insistence of the Capital of peace, to the principles which in Congress, it was earned, it was called, the State then the old custom is still observed, but it is little regarded in these days, and it really is more the breach than in the observance of institution.—*Writings from an historical source.*

It is only to ask who would act the tyrant that would oppress or make it final for a single generation to be deprived the action of one form that such prayer cannot rightly be "only 'seven-tenths of one per cent.'" Stuart Mill pronounce that this is the most signal, and in the light that every child's also stand regards it all. "that the government is solely with the people, and with notice before of claiming any power of coercion, in agreement with what it concerns to be preserved. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, even by a voice or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government is no more title to it than the worst.

It is not so serious, or even tending, when exerted in accordance with public opinion."
