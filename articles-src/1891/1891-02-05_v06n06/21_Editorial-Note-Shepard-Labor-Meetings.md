AT THE LATE Sabbath Union meeting in Philadelphia, Colonel Shepard bewailed the fact that by the workingmen of New York, and other cities, Sunday is very generally utilized as a day for meetings of labor organizations of various kinds. He thought that such things ought not to be. Of course just now such friends and patrons of labor as the valiant Colonel have not the power to prohibit orderly assemblies of laboring men on Sunday, but that is just what they want, and what they will have ere long, unless the workingmen refuse to be charmed by the siren song of the American Sabbath Union. Colonel Shepard and his co-workers promise the workingmen liberty; they would give them slavery.
