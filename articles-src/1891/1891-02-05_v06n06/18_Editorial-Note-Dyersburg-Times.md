THE Times, of Dyersburg, Tennessee, has the following to say about Sunday laws:—

All Sunday laws are oppressive, unjust, tyrannical, unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of our Government.

It is fundamental with us, that there can be no union or association between Church and State. The State has no religion. The same is true of the Federal Government. In no sense can either be said to be a Christian Government. By the Constitution of each, no preference can be given to any religion, or mode of worship; the State was founded for civil affairs, for worldly business; the Church was organized for spiritual affairs. To the State all religions are equally sacred, and entitled to equal protection. All Sunday laws that have been passed for religious purposes, have in them the religious idea; they are intended to favor a day because it is claimed as sacred by Christians, they are intended to give preference to the "Christian mode of worship." No candid or fair-minded man can say that Sunday laws, and especially those of this State and of the town of Dyersburg, were not so intended, or that the ordinance lately passed, was not in response to what was believed to be, the religious sentiment of the church members of the state.

This is significant, coming as it does from a county adjoining that in which Mr. King has been so persistently persecuted by means of an iniquitous Sunday law.
