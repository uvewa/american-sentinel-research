These Sabbatarians are "only seven-tenths of one per cent.," exultingly asserts the Sunday advocate, and thinks that on account of their being in such an insignificant minority the contemplated Sunday laws might just as well be pushed through and enforced, as not. "What difference does it make if such a few as that are imprisoned?" he continues, "for if they can't think and interpret the Bible the same as the dominant church, they ought to go to jail." This is the kind of a spirit that we meet to-day after a century of unexampled prosperity under our incomparable Constitution—under the Constitution that was framed especially to protect these insignificant minorities. In a letter to Dr. De La Motta, a Jewish rabbi, Madison made the following declaration with special reference to the Jews, and that, too, when they were in a much more insignificant minority than they are now:—

Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights which it secures to every religious sect, and it is particularly pleasing to observe in the good citizenship of such as have been most distrusted and oppressed elsewhere a happy illustration of the safety and success of this experiment of a just and benignant policy. Equal laws, protecting equal rights, are found, as they ought to be presumed, the best guarantee of loyalty and love of country; as well as best calculated to cherish that mutual respect and good-will among citizens of every religious denomination which are necessary to social harmony, and most favorable to the advancement of truth. The account you give of the Jews of your congregation brings them fully within the scope of these observations.—Writings of James Madison, vol. iii, pages 178, 179.

It is only he who would act the tyrant that would oppress or make it hard for a certain class of citizens because they are only "seven-tenths of one per cent." John Stuart Mill presents this in its true light, and in the light that every American should regard it. "Let us suppose," says he, "that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it, If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind."—On Liberty, chapter 2, paragraph 1.

The truth of the matter is this: The person who parades the "seventh-tenths of one per cent." argument virtually says: "We must have Sunday laws anyhow. If the opposition is too large, we must modify our demands; but as the Sabbatarians are only seven-tenths of one per cent., we will ignore them entirely,—no matter how much it interferes with their rights."

Every independent thinker knows that an appeal to reason is the only way to arrive at the truth; and the fact that the seventh-day observers are in the minority gives the majority no right to interfere with their working six days and then resting one, which right they have just as truly as does the majority. This principle is set forth as follows, in a note in "American State Papers bearing on Sunday Legislation," pages 189, 190:—

This important principle [that the right guaranteed by our Constitution to acquire property is just as sacred as the right to protect and possess it; and that the right to acquire must include the right to use the proper means to attain that end, which includes the right to our time] is not infrequently overlooked when the question of the constitutionality of Sunday laws is under consideration.

"All men are created equal." All men have a right to use their time to acquire property. The Legislature can no more deprive a person of the free use of part of his time, than it can deprive him of the use of his time altogether. And because the Sabbatarian has enough independence of thought and enough strength of character to differ from the majority in Sabbath observance, it is manifestly unjust to deprive him for that reason of one seventh of his time, to which he has an inalienable right. The innate sense of every man asserts that he has the same right to his opinion that others have to their opinion; that he has the same right to work on such day as he wills, that others have to work on such days as they will. The question is one of individual rights, not a question of whether you do or whether you do not agree with the dominant religious party. Any laws interfering with the right to acquire property, like the laws interfering with the rights to life and personal liberty, are a flagrant violation of the individual's natural rights.

The principle is as follows: An individual's rights cannot be infringed because he belongs to the minority. If I have a right to work six days, and then rest one, all others have the same right; and if I choose the first day on which to rest, no one has a right to molest me; and if my friend chooses the seventh day on which to rest, no one has a right to molest him. If I work on the day on which he rests without molesting him, no one has a right to stop or hinder me in my work; and, likewise, no one has a right to stop or hinder him if he works on the day on which I rest. This is justice and equality. But it is neither justice nor equality to deprive my friend of one day (Sunday) for work in every week because he chooses the seventh day on which to rest—thus giving him only five days in which to work for a livelihood.

"But," argues the advocate of Sunday laws, "the minority are not compelled to work on their Sabbath, but simply to refrain from working on our Sabbath." But if the Legislature may compel the minority to "refrain from working" one day in the week, why not two? and if two, why not three? and if three, why not six? Thus there is no time to which the minority has a right; and the Legislature (the servant of the people) is empowered to entirely deprive the people of the use of their time, and thus of the very means of sustaining life itself. To this absurd conclusion do the positions of Sunday-law advocates lead us.

In order to understand the relation of majorities and minorities, we must inquire into the nature and object of government. For it is true, as Madison says, that "the sovereignty of the society, as vested in and exercisable by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members; the reserved rights of individuals (conscience, for example) in becoming parties to the original compact being beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however viewed." It is not the size of the majority that entitles them to act; but the fact that in the very nature of government the majority must rule:—but only in those things that come within the sphere of government. Madison mentions this point. And among the things that are outside the sphere of government is to dictate whom, when, or how we shall worship, what we shall eat, drink, or wear, when we shall rest or go to bed (as was originally regulated by ringing the curfew bell) and such like. In an essay on "Railway Morals and Railway Policy," published in the Edinburgh Review for October, 1854, Herbert Spencer had occasion to deal with the question of a majority's power as exemplified in the conduct of public companies. The same principle is true of governments, or of any other organizations. Mr. Spencer says:—

Under whatever circumstances, or for whatever ends, a number of men co-operate, it is held that if difference of opinion arises among them, justice requires that the will of the greater number shall be executed, rather than that of the smaller number; and this rule is supposed to be uniformly applicable, be the question at issue what it may. So confirmed is the conviction, and so little have the ethics of the matter been considered, that to meet this mere suggestion of a doubt will cause some astonishment. Yet it needs but a brief analysis to show that the opinion is little better than a political superstition. Instances may readily be selected, which prove by reductio ad absurdum, that the right of a majority is a purely conditional right, valid only within specific limits. Let us take a few. Suppose that at the general meeting of some philanthropic association, it was resolved that in addition to relieving distress, the association should employ home missionaries to preach down Popery. Might the subscriptions of Catholics, who had joined the body with charitable views, be rightfully used for this end? Suppose that of the members of a book club, the greater number, thinking that under existing circumstances rifle practice was more important than reading, should decide to change the purpose of their union, and to apply the funds in hand for the purchase of powder, ball, and targets? Would the rest be bound by this decision? Suppose that under the excitement of news from Australia, the majority of a Freehold Land Society should determine, not simply to start in a body for the gold-diggings, but to use their accumulated capital to provide outfits. Would this appropriation of property be just to the minority? and must these join the expedition? Scarcely any one would venture an affirmative answer even to the first of these questions: much less to the others. And why? Because every one must perceive that by uniting himself with others, no man can equitably be betrayed into acts utterly foreign to the purpose for which he joined them. Each of these supposed minorities would properly reply to those seeking to coerce them: "We combined with you for a defined object; we gave money and time for the furtherance of that object; on all questions thence arising, we tacitly agreed to conform to the will of the greater number; but we did not agree to conform on any other questions. If you induce us to join you by professing a certain end, and then undertake some other end of which we were not apprised, you obtain our support under false pretenses: you exceed the expressed or understood compact to which we committed ourselves; and we are no longer bound by your decisions." Clearly this is the only rational interpretation of the matter. The general principle underlying the right government of every incorporated body, is that its members contract with each other severally to submit to the will of the majority in all matters concerning the fulfilments of the object for which they were incorporated; but in no others. To this extent only can the contract hold. For as it is employed in the very nature of a contract, that those entering into it must know what they contract to do; and as those who unite with others for a specified object, cannot contemplate all the unspecified objects, which it is hypothetically possible for the union to undertake; it follows that the contract entered into cannot extend to such unspecified objects. And if there exists no expressed or understood contract between the union and its members respecting unspecified objects, then for the majority to coerce the minority into undertaking them, is nothing less than gross tyranny.

And, subsequently in another essay, he added:—

Naturally, if such a confusion of ideas exist in respect of the powers of a majority where the deed of incorporation tacitly limits those powers, still more must there exist such a confusion where there has been no deed of incorporation. Nevertheless the same principle holds. I again emphasize the proposition that the members of an incorporated body are bound "severally to submit to the will of the majority in all matters concerning the fulfilment of the objects for which they are incorporated; but in no others." And I contend that this holds of an incorporated nation as much as of an incorporated company.

Mr. Spencer also in his "Social Statics" refutes the idea that majorities have the omnipotence so generally conceded to them. On pages 232, 233, he says:—

Of the political superstitions, lately alluded to, none is so universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent. Under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require power to be wielded by some party, the moral sense of our time feels that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest part of society. It interprets literally the saying that "the voice of the people is the voice of God," and transferring to the one the sacredness attached to the other, it concludes that from the will of the people, that is of the majority, there can be no appeal. Yet is this belief entirely erroneous.

Suppose, for the sake of argument, that, struck by some Malthusian panic, a Legislature duly representing public opinion were to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be drowned. Does any one think such an enactment would be warrantable? If not, there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority. Suppose again, that of two races living together—Celts and Saxons for example [or in America the Saxons and the Negro] the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves. Would the authority of the greatest be in such case valid? If not, there is something to which its authority must be subordinate. Suppose once more, that all men having incomes under fifty pounds a year were to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount, to their own standard, and appropriating the excess for the public purposes. Could their resolution be justified? If not, it must be a third time confessed that there is a law to which the popular voice must defer. What then, is that law, if not the law of pure equity—the law of equal freedom? These restraints, which all would put to the will of the majority, are exactly the restraints set up by that law. We deny the right of a majority to murder, to enslave, or to rob, simply because murder, enslaving, and robbery are violations of that law—violations too gross to be overlooked. But if great violation of it are wrong, so also are smaller ones. If the will of the many cannot supersede the first principle of morality in these cases, neither can it in any. So that, however insignificant the minority, and however trifling the proposed trespass against their rights, no such trespass is permissible.

Professor Francis Lieber touches upon the same point in his work "On Civil Liberty and Self Government" (London, 1853), page 15:—

Liberty has not infrequently been defined as consisting in the rule of the majority; or, it has been said, where the people rule, there is liberty. The rule of the majority, of itself, indicates the power of a certain body; but power is not liberty. Suppose the majority bid you drink hemlock, is there liberty for you? Or, suppose the majority give away liberty and establish a despot. We might say with great truth, that where the minority is protected, although the majority rule, then, probably, liberty exists. But in this latter case it is the protection, or in other words, rights beyond the reach of the majority, which constitute liberty,—not the power of the majority. There can be no doubt that the majority ruled in the French massacres of the Protestants; was there liberty in France on that account? All despotism, without a standing army, must be supported or acquiesced in, by the majority. It could not stand otherwise.

Hence, we must remember that if we would maintain our free institutions, we must protect the rights of minorities, and insure to them every privilege and immunity that is accorded the majority, and that every man's rights must be protected whether he stands alone or with the Nation. We must remember, too, the tendency of mankind to enforce upon others their opinions and their customs.

"Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers," says John Stuart Mill, "there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation; and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens, to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever kept under constraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase."—On Liberty, chapter 1.

If, then, we would guard against the evil, rather than suppress Sabbatarianism, whose advocates form only "seven tenths of one per cent." of our population, it would be better to act in accordance with the principles established in the Declaration of Independence and American Constitution, and which was written out as it bears upon the question of Sunday legislation in Colonel Johnson's celebrated Sunday Mail Report, in the House of Representatives, in 1830:—

The principles of our Government do not recognize in the majority any authority over the minority, except in matters which regard the conduct of man to his fellow-man.

Congress acts under a Constitution of delegated and limited powers. The committee look in vain to that instrument for a delegation of power authorizing this body to inquire and determine what part of time, or whether any, has been set apart by the Almighty for religious exercises. On the contrary, among the few prohibitions which it contains, is one that prohibits a religious test, and another which declares that "Congress shall pass no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

The Constitution regards the conscience of the Jew as sacred as that of the Christian, and gives no more authority to adopt a measure affecting the conscience of a solitary individual than that of a whole community. That representative who would violate this principle would lose his delegated character, and forfeit the confidence of his constituents.
