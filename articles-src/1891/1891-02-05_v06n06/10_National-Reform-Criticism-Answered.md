Some weeks since, the Daily Times of Oakland, California, contained an article criticising the National Reform movement and Rev. N. R. Johnston one of its chief promoters in the Golden State. Mr. Johnston did not see the article until he read it in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. He at once replied to it sending his communication to the Times, in which it was published together with the following editorial comment:—

To all these criticisms we reply: The Israelites, to whom the original law of Sabbath-keeping was given by Moses, were under a theocratic form of government. Our form of government is democratic. Many of the laws which Moses gave as divine, Mr. Johnston, himself does not pretend to observe. While Sunday is called the "Christian Sabbath," and Christians generally recognize it as a holy day, it must be remembered that Americans are not all Christians in their belief, and that there are several denominations of Protestant Christians who observe the seventh day of the week, instead of the first, as the Sabbath. What justice in the Government taking sides with the Sunday-keepers against the Sabbath-keepers—the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and Seventh-day Adventists? Then Mr. Johnston is wrong, we think, in his declaration that all classes of people, and especially laboring men, would be benefited by a law enforcing Sunday rest. As a rule, and without any law, laboring men rest on Sunday as they do at night, of their own free-will and because they feel their need of it; but how would Mr. Johnston look upon a law forbidding all labor from six o'clock at night until six o'clock in the morning? Would laboring men be benefited by such an arbitrary law?

Notwithstanding Mr. Johnston's demurrer, we repeat our proposition that the United States Constitution does not favor penal Sunday laws, and is in spirit against them. If not, why are Mr. Johnston and his fellow-members of the National Reform Association laboring so hard to get the Constitution amended? Rev. Dr. McIlvaine, a member of the same Association, states expressly that they want this amendment to afford a basis which they have not now in the fundamental law of the land for Sunday laws and Sunday law enforcement. Finally, while we do not go to THE AMERICAN SENTINEL for instruction on this point, we fully agree with it in its contention that the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association are virtually striving to overturn the religious liberty of the Nation, and establish a virtual union of Church and State, and we heartily commend it for the loud note of warning it has raised.

And the Times is right; the success of the National Reform movement would certainly destroy religious liberty in this country, and, at the very best, substitute for it religious toleration.
