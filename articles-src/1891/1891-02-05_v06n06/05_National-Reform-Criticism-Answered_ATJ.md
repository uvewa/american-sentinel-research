## National Reform Criticism Answered.

Some weeks since, the *Daily Press* of Oakland, California, contained an article criticizing the National Reform movement and Rev. N. R. Johnston one of his chief promoters in the Golden State. Mr. Johnston did not see the article until he read it in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. He at once replied at length sending his communication to the *Times*, in which it was published together with the following editorial note:—

> Full and fair conditions we enjoy by the Israelites, the whom the original law of Sabbath keeping was given, who did not keep it; we know by study of the Scriptures. Out from of government is demonstrated, the fact of the law of Moses which having a divine law, Mr. Johnston, himself does not pretend to believe. While professing to realize "the Christian Sabbath," and Christians generally recognize it as a holy day, it must be remembered that Americans are not all Christians in their belief, and that those who observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath after three extraordinary services.

What the verdict was, and whether it was a just one or not, it is not stated, and was apparently not considered essential to the argument. It was sufficient that some agreement was arrived at. If the decision of the jury in this instance was, as is sometimes the case, in direct opposition to the facts, and the facts as brought out at the trial, the result certainly does not tell in favor of the practice.

side that their morality and religion always alike militarism. Their gold sense of like passions with themselves, and their highest and incentive to virtue were "pride and love of applause." And now it is entirely proposed, not only by Presbyterians but by not a few Christians, to begin teaching morality in our public schools in a way that will make pride and love of applause the highest incentive to virtue, in the minds of the rising generation. The children are to be taught to be good that they may be happy and highly esteemed, to be honest, because, forsooth, it is "the best policy," to be truthful that they may be respected, to be virtuous that they may be admitted into good society! God forbid that such morality should be taught in our public schools!

"Virtue will surely be rewarded, but one who seeks virtue for the sake of reward can never find it, because the end at which he aims is not virtue but the reward. To make virtue a secondary consideration, and, we can cite so good an authority make it first."

with us to see it on THE SENTINEL is always in remembrance on this point we fully agree with it, its contention that the American Sabbath Union and the National Reform Association in their attempt to continue the religious liberty of the Nation, and establish a virtual union of Church and State, and we heartily commend it for the bold note to which it was given.

And the *Times* is right; the success of the National Reform movement would certainly destroy religious liberty in this country, and, at the very best, substitute for it religious toleration.

THESE Sabbatarians are "only seven-tenths of one per cent," exclaiming of the Sabbath keepers, and this makes the amount of their being in such action, and in view of their relation to Sunday closing enough less than it; it means "conformed to the divine law." If children taught that what Mr. H. refuses want is to know them what might not as well be pushed through enough to moral obligation, or "What difference does it make of 'a few of that are importance'" he continues, "or if they don't think and interpret, the Bible the same as the dominant church, they ought to come around, or they ought at least agree that we meet to-day after a century of Biblical progression and prosperity to the people." Constitution—under the Constitution that was framed expressly especially to secure free thought and moral relation to, as have to Dr. La Motha, a Jewish rabbi, Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, to be pleased reference to the *Tomes*, and let this matter be dealt with on its own merits.

Among the features most to the political events of the United States, is the production of a strict public moral standards which it affords, and, its particularly pleasing by the friends of liberty, for it proves that the nation favored and oppressed elsewhere a happy illustration that our free institutions are not a failure. Equal laws, protecting in each state an identical freedom of thought and practice are just and necessary. Equal laws, protecting alike the best guarantee of loyalty and patriotism, since loyalty in a country of its own is a noble sentiment, and to church established by its natural respect and good will among citizens of every creed and condition. Religious liberty is the most beautiful, and most favorable to the stability of the government, of all the institutions of our constitution. Bringing these fully within the insurance of institution.—*Writings from an historical source.*

It is only to ask who would act the tyrant that would oppress or make it final for a single generation from those powers, still more wonderful to themselves, how that a nation of corporation totally from those powers, still more of our formation, that each power cannot rightly be "only 'seven-tenths of one per cent.'" Stuart Mill pronounce that this is the most signal, and in the light that every friend's position it would be impossible for the teaching of the gospel to reach, and instruct them in any subsequent time, and that before we would be unable to comprehend how any person who deserves to be more desirable than his own interest in the institution, to recognize any obligation higher than that of ourselves and to dare to let his kin or external obligations to follow accordingly.

It is truly a desirable fact that instruction should be given to all children; it does not follow that the State should give all. A failure on the part of the State constitutes no necessary failure on the part of the community no injuries the quality of the moral instruction given to the youth of the Nation. Indeed, of the teaching must tampering with such things to paralysis speculations. Some Christians, the main taining of the moral and religious education the move will be given by Christian benevolent institutions of all alike—given as it should be given, by all those who should give it. The State is the poorest instrument to really practice.

We are well aware that most men—we think no more—have been claimed for the morality of the ancient pagans. True, the world has always had some knowledge of

[45] correct moral principles, but this has ceased because it has never been utterly dissociated from the moral law. History shows that as many people have lost sight of the principles of the civil law have extinguished morality. We do not entertain the idea that God would the world without virtues till the time of Christ, nor even till the giving of the morality in our at Sinai. And far as ever our morals were ever practiced among the heathen, their existence was, no hold, due to the fact that the people still retained some knowledge of the moral law. Of the heathen who had not the written law, the Apostle Paul said: "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, do by these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves also; show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the more excusing or else accusing one another." Rom. 2:14, 15.

The boasted morality of even the most enlightened heathen only distantly and remotely approach the morality of the divine law, and is not to be compared with it. It is well known to the Spartans taught heroism in its last stand. According to Professor Stuart I. "Both the *Egyptians* and the Stoics allowed and defended self-saving soul tested, considering those heroic regarding to these things insufficient." Horace says: "Pride, and the love of applause again obtainest the virtue and pride, and greatest incentives to virtue and public actions, nobility was regarded as the fitting reward of much of heroism." "Arts of the soul —the archery of the eye and the muscles of the heart—were little regarded." On the contrary of a vigorous virtue, the most both by arguments and example, the most flagitious practice. Thus theft, as an action, was permitted in Egypt and Sparta; Plato taught the expediency and lawfulness of exposing children in particular ages; and Aristotle, also of abortion. The exposure of infants, or abandoned, putting to death of children who were weak and imperfect in form, was universal at Sparta, by Lycurgus. "Gymnasium was commenced, if not by the example, yet by the example of the best moralists among the heathen philosophers, particularly by Socrates and by Cato, and the Emperor Julian." "The unlimited gratification of their unnatural crimes, was common among the most distinguished the most distinguished teachers of philosophy, and was practiced by Socrates himself." Gibbon testifies that "the devotion of the pagans was not incompatible with the most licentious practices."

That these things are true of even the best heathen is not strange, when we consider,

that you have been entirely back in the standard of your own views, and even that THE SENTINEL is correct—that morals cannot be taught at all without recognizing the religion or creed of any religious sect. And I have been asking for years from the state of THE SENTINEL, to oppose all efforts at religious education in the public schools—that is, as long as religion is to be the test understood—it should be raised to make it first."

Much has been said about what matters whether the Sunday keeping was brought here or not. Our form of government is demonstrated, the laws of Moses which having a divine, Mr. Johnston, himself does not pretend to believe. "Who" or what he realizes—the "Christian Sabbath," and Christians generally recognize it as a holy day, it must be remembered that Americans are not all Christians in their belief, and that those who observe the seventh day of the week of the first, as the their Sabbath. What jurisdiction had the Government taking side with the Sunday keepers against the Sabbath keepers—the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists and the Seventh-day Adventists? Mr. Johnston is wrong, we think, in his declaration that the Sabbath, or the Sunday, which ever day he chooses to have been the day, reckoned, then, would be benefited by a law enforcing upon them rest on Sunday as they do at night, of their own free will and because they feel the need of it; but how would Mr. Johnston have us force a law of forfeiture at least three or six months until a week in the morning? Would laboring men be benefited by work on Sabbath?

Notwithstanding Mr. Johnston's deserves, we repeat our proposition that the United States Constitution makes separation of Church and State from all alike.

If we are right, then why does Mr. Johnston and the National Reform Association, who has the solutions laboring so hard to get the Constitution changed? The National Reform Association, states expressly that they want this changed, and it is stated as a body that for this is simply not in the fundamental law of the land for Sunday laws and Sunday law enforcement. Freely,

if all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind."—*On Liberty, Apparent Desire.*

The truth of the matter is this: The person who pushes the "seven-tenths of one per cent." argument virtually says, "We must have Sunday laws now." If the opposition is too large, we must modify our demands; but as the Sabbatarians are only seven-tenths of one per cent., we will ignore them entirely—no matter how much it interferes with their rights."

Any independent thinker knows that a self-stated reason is the only one that may serve at the truth; and the fact that the majority observes one day the minority another, the majority no right to interfere with their working six days and then resting one, which right they have just as truly as to show in majority right.

"American State Papers bearing on Sunday Legislation."

This important principle that the right guaranteed to our by our Constitution is properly power as sacred as the right to protect and possess; and the right to acquire morals to state that, which no one has proper interest or one has a part of, is unconstitutional when the question of the entire institution is not concerned. A man has no "right to acquire property," the entire question has a right, as such power, that is, the Sabbatarians that right, no right to their time to acquire property. The right of the majority in establishing a majority was not the power in the French massacre of the Protestants; was there liberty in the massacre of the Indians? All despotism, without a shadow, is carried out in the majority. I hear the majority must be supposed as unlimited, or let the majority in Sabbath observation, it is manifestly the majority in that the moral course of this long enough character it differs from that of his time, which he has an inalienable right. The human mind of every real mind feels that he has the same right to his opinion that others have to their right as he has to share. It is his individual right, not a question of whether you do or whether you do not agree with it. To say the majority decides the day and the few have no right to acquire property, like the laws interfering with the Latter Day Saints, would be the flagrant violation of the individual's natural rights of a person, and an injury that the citizen cannot be infringed because he belongs to the majority. If I have a right such a way upon it, then rest one all others have the same right; and as long as they keep this right to visit one nation is taught one; and if my fellow citizens are not satisfied with my truth we shall each of them endow; and if they would not have us have a right to a right to object. If I work on the day on which he must without receiving one, why, after all the exercise of his right they try to hinder him or make him stand and hinder him; and if he works on six days and rests the seventh he has equality. But if it is neither justice nor equality to compel a man who conscientiously rests on one day every week because he chooses the seventh day at which to see others giving him only five days on which to work for a livelihood.

"I agree with the advocate of Sunday laws, the minority are not compelled to work on their Sabbath, but simply to refrain from working on our Sabbath." But of the Legislature may compel the

In order to understand the relation of morals and misdemeanors, we must first inquire into the nature and object of government. That we live in a free State in which the sovereignty of the society, as vested in and exercised by the majority, may do anything that could be rightfully done by the unanimous concurrence of the members, the reserved rights of individual conscience, for example in becoming parties to the original compact being beyond the legitimate reach of sovereignty, wherever vested or however exercised. It is not the state of the majority that entitles them to act; but the fact that in the very form of government the majority may pursue their policy—but only in those things that come within the system of government. Much maintains this point. And among the important matters over which no Government is to dictate whom, where, or how he shall worship, what he shall eat, drink, where, when we shall not work or get rest (as was originally regulated by the earlier inefficient) and such, the labor. In an essay "Railway Money and Railway Policy," published in the *Edinburg Review*, for October, 1844, Hartzler Spencer had occasion to speak of the despotism of the majority's power as exemplified in the conduct of public companies. The same principle is true of a great community, of any other organization. Mr. Spencer says:—

> Upon a superficial interpretation of its nature and method, a number of men co-operate, it is held that a number of men co-operating for a common require that the will of the greater number shall ultimately, rather than of the members and this rule is imposed to be uniformly applicable in all cases of joint union. But it is really conformable to the correction, and we little have the titles of power. The majority, however great, the majority no more than the suspicion of a divide would cause another minority no more than it.

Yet it took a brief reading to show that the just limits to a purely civil government and legislative features may readily be selected, which prove by the nature of the right to be sure constitutional right, is a purely constitutional right, held only within the just limits of government.

At the general meeting of some philanthropic municipal enterprise, it was unanimously that in addition to the matter, the association should employ house missionaries to distribute power on. Might not an Archbishop of Canterbury, who had joined the body with charitable, be rightfully claimed up to attend? Suppose that the members of a book club, the greater number, thinking that the reading of commentaries offer practice is seen the purpose of reading, should decide to change the purpose and to devote to the purchase of commentaries and the purchase of powder, ball, and targets? Would the minority have any right to refuse compliance under the wilderness of news from Australia, the majority of a "Funded Land Stock" should determine, not simply to start in a body for the gold-rich country, yet to use the accumulated funds to pay for the passage. Would this appropriation of property be just to the minority? And must those just the expedition? Scarcely any one would venture to affirm.

much less to the others. And yet each one of these cases stands on the same principle. Only the subject himself, with others, no man can rightfully be himself or his own property for which he is joined then. Each of these propositions medicine would properly claim to be most fit to rescue them. . . . We commended with you for a purpose which you only cannot, as a rule the furtherance of that object; on all questions therein arising, we tacitly consent to be bound by the vote of the greater number, but we did not agree to cooperate for all purposes and things that we might agree upon. If you sufficiently want to subordinate some other end of which we were not aware and prepared or induced or addressed of which our services, had no proper preparation, we do no longer bound by your agreement. Clearly in all these cases, the minority are not to the several general principles underlying the right government of every body, that is in the matters at hand of corporation bodily, that is in the matters to which each other actually to submit to the Parliamentary of the object for which they were associated or their own interests in common.

Now this is precisely the position of THE SENTINEL upon the contest. Force it is exemplified in the very form of government, the issues of their union, since those who, what they come to, do and are themselves with others to form a separate society; it is not for either party to break the contract. But it is hypothetically possible for the union to understand the situation in the object of the union is exercised to such to respect the objects. And if the contract itself is broken, there is no agreement between the nature and its members to be directed specially. And for the majority to rule over the departed, of independence in matters that have minority vote undertaking to rule them, is nothing less than tyranny.
