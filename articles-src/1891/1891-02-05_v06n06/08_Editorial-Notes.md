# Editorial Notes

*New York, February 5, 1891.*

**Note.**—Any one receiving THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is our invariable rule to send out no papers without pay in advance, except by special arrangement, therefore, those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it simply because they take it from the post-office.

*The Loyal Americans* think that "the men who are foreordained to stand up for civil and religious liberty because it might offend loyal business, or interfere with political advancement, are not built like the men who signed the Declaration of Independence."

COLONEL SHEPARD'S donation to the American Sabbath Union during the last fiscal year, of that Association, amounted to $7,255. The total receipts for the year were $10,045.63. Perhaps it is not surprising that the Colonel was glad to buy his own successor in office.

---

THE *Catholic Review* criticizes the *Independent* for advocating the compulsory taxation of church property, but admits that the exemption of such property "certainly contributes to the support of the Church." And it certainly does, for by it the State indirectly contributes to the support of the Church.

---

COMMUNION upon the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in taking its vote by the young ministers, because they say that it is not a sin to vote, the *Catholic Review* very justly remarks that "The genius of our Constitution and things of the past century has not been regarding it simply means that every sort of permission. The narrow spirit still restricts the rights of citizenship of any who wishes to use them is certainly not un-American."

THE TIMES of Dyersburg, Tennessee, has the following to say about Sunday laws:

All Sunday laws are oppressive, unjust, tyrannical, unconstitutional and contrary to the principles of our Government.

It is fundamental with us, that there can be no union of association between Church and State. The State has no religion. The state is free of the Federal Government. In no sense can one either be said to be a Christian Government. By the usual understanding of articles or mode of worship; the State was founded and organized for neither; on any exclusively Church was organized for spiritual affairs. To the State all religions are equally sacred; and entitled to equal protection. All Sunday laws that have been passed for religious purposes, have in them the religious idea; they are intended to force a day because it is claimed as sacred by Christians; they are intended to give preference to the "Christian mode of worship." So-called or fair-minded men say that Sunday laws, and especially those of this State are, in the words of Dyersburg, were so intended, or that the ordinance body passed, was not to comprise by what was believed to be, the religious sentiment of the church members of the town.

This is significant, coming as it does from a county adjoining that to which Mr. King has been so persistently prosecuted by means of an iniquitous Sunday law.

WE are thankful to our friends who have sent us newspaper clippings, etc., giving items of interest more or less closely connected with our special work. We are not always able to use those things directly, but they are generally suggestive, and so helpful to us. Papers sent should be marked; the clippings should be accompanied by the name and date of the paper from which they are taken.

The lower branch of the Wyoming Legislature recently passed the following as part of the school law of that State:—"All religious exercises, such as reading the Bible, praying, etc., are hereby prohibited in the public schools or any educational institutions in the State of Wyoming, which is supported by and is under control of the State, creating the sessions of each school or educational institution. The teacher or principal of any school or educational institution violating the provisions of this section shall be immediately removed from his or her position, by the Board of school trustees."

AT the late Sabbath Union meeting in Philadelphia, Colonel Shepard betrayed the fact that by the workingmen of New York, and other cities, Sunday is very generally utilized as a day for activity, of labor organizations of various kinds. He thought that such things ought not to be. Of course just now such friends and patrons of labor as the valiant Colonel have all the power to prohibit whatever amenities of laboring men on Sunday, but that is just what they want, and what they will have ere long, unless the working people refuse to be dominated by the song of the American Sabbath Union. Colonel Shepard and his co-workers promise the workingmen "liberty," they would give them slavery.

The "Pearl of Days" of January 16, has some items of interest for both... *Loyal Americans*.

The Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union, held an important meeting, in New York, January 12. The following managers were present: Messrs. Brearley, De Witt, Strong, Simmons, Rev. Joachim Elmendorf, D. D., the Rev. George S. Baker, D. D., Alexander, Roberts, Rev. Dr. Leighton Williams, the Rev. James H. Darlington, the Rev. T. A., Col. Elliot F. Shepard, A. also under S. Bacon and Secretaries Knowles and Taylor. The earnest harmony pervaded throughout the meeting, and the decisions on unanimously reached by the Board will lead to broader and strengthen the society's operations for the defense of our civil and Christian Sabbath.

The nature of the plans is not stated, but the "Pearl of Days" continues to confide them in the future. That "the utmost harmony prevailed" is not to be wondered at when we remember that the element disposed to make trouble was effectually silenced in Philadelphia.

THE pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, is quoted as follows, by the *Independent*, upon the question of the Bible in the public schools: "We would express our earnest hope that all distinctive teaching of religion in the maintenance of each relation between the soul and its promotion of the free schools. The reading of the Bible is of the nature of distinctive religious teaching in our own land. And because there are tax-paying Jews and infidels, who object to the Bible, I would urge, on the ground of fair play, in the next generation that all such teaching be informed to the home, the Church, and the Sunday-school."
