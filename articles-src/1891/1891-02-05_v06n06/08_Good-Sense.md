One of the principles of the Farmers' Alliance, which has of late become a power in politics, is that the Government shall issue a sufficient quantity of treasury notes to enable the business of the country to be transacted on a cash basis, and that these notes should be loaned to the people on any good security at a rate of interest not to exceed two per cent. This is a very taking proposition to people who want money, and do not think enough to know how real money only can come. The National Grange has fallen in with the Farmers' Alliance on this point; and the State Grange of Michigan in its annual meeting, last month, gave its voice upon this question in the following plain statement of sound principles:—

We regret that the National Grange, the Farmers' Alliance, and other organizations of farmers have indorsed the proposition in one form or another to make loans by the Government to the people.

That the issuing of one billion of treasury notes and loaning it to the people, either directly or indirectly, at a low rate of interest, would lead to a wild clamor for credit, every intelligent person must admit.

That no system could be devised or its operation so guarded as to prevent partiality and favoritism in its distribution, first to personal friends of the loaning agent, next to his political associates, every thoughtful man must foresee.

That it would create a feeling of helpless dependence upon Government aid by those whom it is designed to benefit, thereby relaxing their individual effort, destroying their energy and self-reliance and rendering them helpless mendicants of Government charity, every observer of human nature must know.

That it would lead to thriftless improvidence, relying upon Government aid, or Government forbearance, by those whom it seeks to benefit, and prove a curse instead of a blessing, is so plainly evident that we are surprised that the National Grange should allow itself to be carried away by the clamor of those who hope to gain for themselves public preferment by holding out a scheme so enticing to the ignorant or improvident debtor, and scheming speculator.

Yet as sound as these principles are, and though they be so plainly stated as to be easily understood by all who can read, we doubt very much whether either the Farmers' Alliance or the National Grange will accept them.
