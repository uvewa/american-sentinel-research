## Efficacy of Prayer.

THE *Christian Cynosure*, of Chicago, a religious paper, contains, in favor of having all courts of justice, as well as legislative bodies and political conventions, opened with prayer, and also that when a case being tried in the courts and submitted to a jury, their first act, on retiring to the jury-room, should be to kneel and engage in prayer for divine enlightenment and guidance. It would probably sometimes be the case, there is not a single religious man among the twelve, the writer would have a clergyman called in to pray with and for them.

The following and almost incredible instance is given in illustration of the efficacy of prayer in the jury-room:

> In an important case recently tried at Wichita, Kansas, the jury failed to agree and were kept in their room three whole days. They were summaries of opinion at the end of this time that agreement on a verdict was impossible, and so they claimed, but the Judge, a very pious man, refused to discharge them, and called in his pastor, who not only prayed, but in fact, preached to them in the jury-room, with the result that they agreed on the first ballot after three extraordinary services. What the verdict was, and whether it was a just one or not, it is not stated, and was apparently not considered essential to the argument. It was sufficient that some agreement was arrived at. If the decision of the jury in this instance was, as is sometimes the case, in direct opposition to the facts, and the facts as brought out at the trial, the result certainly does not tell in favor of the practice.

However this may have been, the whole proceeding, if it ever took place, which there is great reason to doubt, was an absurd farce and a disgraceful travesty of justice and right. While a jury is in session, its communication with outsiders is rightly allowable. To be sure the clerk, and the instructions of any person, either clerical or lay, with the view of influencing their verdict in any manner, directly or indirectly, is inexcusable. That it really has been done as the surgeons, or by the order rather, of the Court, as stated, is scarcely credible. If it was, the Judge should be impeached and disrobed of his beautiful garments before an astonished nation.

C. P. B.

Again, if the decision was a just one in this case, to ascertain is afforded of a result merely in another case. For right must appear, the effect of their combined effort for the third day, and their being subjected to listen to a perhaps tedious prayer and more tedious sermon, was only to render the jurymen desperate and lead them to agree on something, no matter what, as so to get away from their ridiculous prison house and the presence of their ghostly tormentor.
