MRS. SALLY JOY WHITE has written a book, on cookery in the public school, and a Western paper comments upon the fact as follows:

Much of the misery and unhappiness in woman's life is caused by her ignorance in the most simple things in domestic life. Mrs. White advocates a kitchen in every girls' school, at public expense. Anything in the public school which will give the child an idea, is commendable. Two thousand girls are receiving training in kitchens now, in Boston. A girl cannot know woman's work if not taught, and as boys are being taught in technical schools to do men's work so should the girls be taught to do women's work also. The world is becoming more practical, schooling is in keeping with the age in which we live, and to it we must look for a higher grade of morals among the rising generation of both sexes.

It is true that ignorance of now to prepare healthful and palatable food is deplorable, but it does not follow that the State should undertake to give instruction in cookery. "Boys are being taught in technical schools to do men's work," and very properly so too, but the cases are by no means analogous. Few homes afford the facilities for giving a mechanical and business education, such as is demanded for boys, but every home does, or at least should, afford facilities for giving instruction in common household duties including practical cooking; and it is in the home and by the mother, or at least under the supervision of the mother, and under home influences, that girls should receive this instruction.

There would be nothing radically wrong in the State's giving this instruction, as there would be in its teaching religion. The evil in it is that it is right in line with the mischievous idea, that seems to be rapidly gaining ground in this country, that the parents owe no duty to their children after they arrive at a school age, except to feed and clothe them. Indeed, it is seriously proposed to practically turn the children over to the State at a still more tender age than formerly. A recent number of the Catholic Review notes the fact that "the kindergarten is becoming popular in this country, and a society has been organized in the city of New York to establish independent kindergartens, which may in time become the property of the public school system." "There is," says the Review, "more significance in this movement than appears on its surface." And the significance is in the trend which we have indicated. It shows that the tendency of the times is to increase the influence of the State upon the life of the child and to minimize that of the parent; to make the State everything to the child and the parent nothing. Judging from present indications it will not be long until the only duty of parents, as such, will be to beget and bear children for the State; teachers in the employ of the State to do the rest.

The evil is a wide-spread and growing one, and has obtruded itself even upon the attention of Congress. In a speech in the House, January 15, Mr. Clements, a member of the Committee on Appropriations, said:

People come about our committee rooms full of sentiment. They tell us that it is better to provide school-houses and free school books and everything of that kind than to spend money in maintaining penitentiaries and prisons. That is a very beautiful statement. It sounds very well; and it is all right. But so far as I have been able to observe, it does not necessarily follow that because a man or a woman is educated therefore he does not deserve to go to the penitentiary. As a gentleman near me suggests, something may depend upon whether a child is educated at the public expense; for if he has struggled individually to buy his books and find time to go to school and to take care of himself, he will most probably make a virtuous and industrious man.

In the same line we had before the Committee a proposition to establish about ten kindergartens here in the city of Washington. I do not desire to make any criticism upon the estimable ladies who represented this enterprise, nor do I criticise the system of kindergartens. They are all right. But the argument was that we should provide means by which the Government may become the father or the mother of the child at the age of three, taking him out of the street and making a good citizen of him; that it is better to support such a system as this rather than to maintain prisons and penitentiaries.

But the statistics not only of this country but other countries fail to sustain the argument that in proportion to the schools and kindergartens which are established the prisons and the penitentiaries are less necessary. This proposition involves all along the idea of taking the child at the age of three years and putting him entirely under the influence of public-school teachers; of others than the parents. In this idea there is a total neglect of what is a very necessary branch of education. The child is taught from the start that he must look to the Government for everything; that is the first principle.

The idea of self-reliance is entirely eradicated; he is taught to look to the Government for clothing, food, and everything. Not only that, but he is taken care of by the public instructor, by the Government through its agents, and to this extent home influences are removed from him, the great lesson of morality and religion, those principles which are necessary in the government of the life of a man or a woman to keep him or her out of the penitentiary or the prison, are almost entirely neglected.

The thing that we call progress in the public schools includes especially looking to the intellectual training of the child; and besides we have a lot of teachers going from school-house to school-house attending to the development of the muscles, giving lessons about physical movements and various forms of muscular exercises. I make no objection whatever to that; I think it is all very well; but I do not believe in governmental control and education of the intellect and the muscles to the entire neglect of the home teaching of the heart, the instruction in morality, fidelity, honesty, industry, self-reliance, religion. These are all wiped out by the paternal system of government.

Mr. Clements has clearly pointed out some of the evils of this system of laying upon the State burdens and responsibilities that should be borne by the individual. Parents can do for their children vastly more in the way of aiding them to form right characters than it is possible for the State to do, and they are under the most solemn obligations to do it. They make a fatal mistake when they seek, at the hands of the State, relief from the responsibilities which come to them because they are parents. It is right that schools should be established for the instruction of the youth of both sexes in those things that cannot be better taught at home; but the idea that children of tender age must be taught in public kindergartens and that girls must be taught the culinary art in public schools and at public expense, when the instruction could be given much better in the home, is most mischievous. It shows a dangerous tendency on the part of the parents to shirk duties that should be held sacred and conscientiously discharged, and also an equally dangerous tendency upon the part of the State to undertake work that naturally belongs to the home. The home and home influences should be preserved at all hazards; parental care and parental influences should be preserved and strengthened rather than weakened. Did we for a moment believe that as a people we were dependent upon public school training for a higher grade of morals in the rising generation of both sexes, we should despair of the future of our country. If good morals and correct habits cannot be taught in the home, and if American home influences are so impotent and depraved that they cannot be trusted to teach moral principles and domestic duties, the evil is indeed great; so great that the State, which cannot possibly be morally superior to the individuals that compose it, cannot correct it, even by such heroic methods as public kindergartens and State-supported kitchens.
