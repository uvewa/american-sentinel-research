THE pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, of Chicago, is quoted as follows, by the Independent, upon the question of the Bible in the public schools: "We would express our earnest hope that all distinctive teaching of religion might be forbidden in the free schools. That the reading of the Bible is of the nature of distinctive religious teaching no one can deny. And because there are tax-paying Jews and infidels, who object to the Bible, I would urge, on the ground of fair play, that it be not read, but that all religious teaching be intrusted to the home, the Church, and the Sunday-school."
