THE "Pearl of Days," of January 16, says:—

The Board of Managers of the American Sabbath Union, held an important meeting, in New York, January 12. The following managers were present: Bishop John F. Hurst, of Washington, D. C., the Rev. Joachim Elmendorf, D. D., the Rev. George S. Mott, D. D., the Rev. R. M. Sommerville, the Rev. Leighton Williams, the Rev. James H. Darlington, Ph. D., Col. Elliott F. Shepard, Col. Alexander S. Bacon and Secretaries Knowles and Taylor.

The utmost harmony prevailed throughout the meeting, and the decisions so unanimously reached by the Board will tend to broaden and strengthen the society's operations for the defense of our civil and Christian Sabbath.

The nature of the plans is not stated, but the "Pearl of Days" promises to outline them in the future. That "the utmost harmony prevailed" is not to be wondered at when we remember that the element disposed to make trouble was effectually silenced in Philadelphia.
