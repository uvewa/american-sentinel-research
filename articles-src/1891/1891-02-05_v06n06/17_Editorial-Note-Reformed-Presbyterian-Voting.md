COMMENTING upon the action of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in taking steps to try five young ministers, because they insist that it is not a sin to vote, the Catholic Review very justly remarks that "The genius of our Constitution, as evinced through the past century has not been agnostic; it has simply made provision for every sort of persuasion. The narrow spirit that restricts the rights of citizenship of any one who wishes to use them is certainly most un-American."
