BELIEVING that our readers will be interested to learn of the progress of the religious liberty work in California, we give the following report:

That all may be apprised of the situation, we would state that a movement was set on foot in the fall, by the American Sabbath Union, and strenuous efforts have been made to secure the passage of a Sunday law in the State Legislature (now in session). Petitions were circulated throughout the State, asking that such a law be enacted.

Early in November, a Council met at Oakland, and after carefully weighing the matter, decided that the State Society should prepare literature especially adapted to meet the demand, and that this matter be placed in the hands of the branch societies throughout the State, and they be requested to give it a wide circulation by sending it through the mails to localities in their district that could not be reached by other means. It was also recommended that a call be made by the State Society for funds to defray the expense of printing this literature.

When the matter was presented to the societies by letter, we received the most hearty responses, in which we were assured that they would co-operate with us, and that they stood ready to circulate the literature as soon as it should arrive.

An eight-page tract, entitled, "Shall California have a Sunday Law?" was first prepared, and 40,000 copies printed. These were apportioned to the different societies, according to their working force and the population of the city or town in which they were located. The societies were given the privilege of ordering more in case a sufficient number had not been sent to meet the demand. We soon found it necessary to print 25,000 more. About this time a second tract of four pages, entitled, "Religion Enforced by State Law," was written, and 40,000 printed. We are constantly receiving orders for more of the tracts, and the reports from the societies relative to the work are most encouraging. Up to the present date $369.26 has been received on the fund, and other societies are yet to remit.

When the copy was put in the hands of the printers, they were so driven with work that it was impossible to get the tracts as early as we felt we must have them; so it was arranged that the Tract Society should assist in the folding. Our Tract Society rooms presented a very busy scene during these days. Some of our friends left their work at home and came in to help in this emergency, and many thousands of the tracts were soon ready for the mails.

The Oakland Tract Society also rendered valuable assistance. For two successive weeks, at the close of the regular programme and during the time of the workers' meeting, all the members that could be well accommodated at the tables, worked on the tracts, some staying until a late hour. We felt that we in Oakland were doubly privileged, as we not only had the opportunity to distribute the reading but also to help prepare it to send to others to circulate.

Our State Society has mailed to all of the Senators and Assemblymen of California as well as to the executive officers, a copy of the pamphlet, entitled, "The Breckinridge Sunday-rest Bill," accompanying each with a letter expressing the hope that they would find it convenient to peruse the arguments it contained before sanctioning a Sunday law for this State. We have received several good responses to these letters, in which we are assured that they will be glad to examine the documents. The State Society has also sent to the above named officials and to the county officers, as far as their names were obtained, copies of the tracts.
