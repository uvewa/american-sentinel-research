## Religious Liberty Work.

BELIEVING that our readers will be interested to learn of the progress of the religious liberty work in California, we give the following report.

That all may be apprised of the situation, we would state that a movement was set on foot in the fall, by the American Sabbath Union, and strenuous efforts have been made to secure the passage of a Sunday law in the State Legislature (now in session). Petitions were circulated throughout the State, and there is an effort to be enacted.

Early in November, a Council met at Oakland, and after carefully weighing the matter, decided that the State Society should prepare literature especially adapted to meet the demand; and this matter should be placed in the hands of the branch societies throughout the State, and they be requested to give a wide circulation by sending it through the mails to localities in their districts and by distribution, and by other means. It was also recommended that a call be made by the State Society for funds to defray the expenses of printing this literature.

When the matter was presented to the societies by letter, we received the most hearty responses, in which we were assured that they would co-operate with us, and that they stood ready to circulate the literature as soon as it should arrive.

An eight-track report, entitled, "Shall California have a Sunday Law?" was first prepared, and 40,000 copies printed. These were apportioned to the district societies, according to their working forces and the population of the city or town in which they were situated. The societies were given the privileges of ordering more in case a sufficient number had not been sent to meet the demand. We soon found it necessary to reprint 30,000 more. About this time a second tract of four pages, entitled, "Religion Enforced by State Law," was sent out, about 40,000 printed. We are constantly receiving orders for more of the tracts, and the reports from the societies relative to the work are most encouraging. Up to the present date $149.65 has been received on the fund, and other amounts are yet to reach us.

When the copy was put in the hands of the printers, they were so driven with work that it was impossible to get the tracts as early as we felt we must have them. It was arranged that the Tract Society should assist in the folding. Our friends have attended promptly and willingly on securing these things. Some of our friends left their work at home and came early to help in this emergency, and many hundreds of the tracts were soon ready for mailing.

The Oakland Tract Society also received valuable assistance. For several weeks the work was done almost exclusively by our workers, at the close of the regular proceedings, on each weekly Tract Society meeting, all the members that could remain, working to accomplish the most, the tracts staying until quite a late hour. We felt that we in Oakland should not only probably do the most, as we could, and had the opportunity to distribute the most but also to help interest in it to press on for others to circulate.

Our State Society has mailed to all of its Senators and Assemblymen of California as well as to the executive officers, a copy of the pamphlet, entitled, "The Breckinridge Sunday-rest Bill," accompanying each with a letter expressing the hope that they would find it instructive to press that the argument is examined before sanctioning a Sunday law for this State. We have received several good responses to these letters, in which we are assured that they will be glad to examine the documents. The State Society has also sent to the above named officials and to the county officers, as far as the names were obtained, copies of the tracts.
