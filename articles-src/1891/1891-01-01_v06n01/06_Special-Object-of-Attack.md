Until within a few years past there has been little or no attempt to enforce the Sunday laws on the statute books of the States of the Union. Practically men have been free to labor if they chose, or travel on the first day of the week, as if there had been no Sunday law. But there has been a change practically in the Southern States; Tennessee, Georgia, and Arkansas, have inaugurated a persecuting enforcement of these laws against the Seventh-day Adventists, and now Missouri follows suit, and William Fritz and Robert Gibb, two Seventh-day Adventists, have been indicted and arrested for laboring on their farms on the first day of the week, after resting all day on the seventh, according to their understanding of the commandment. Who are the prime movers in this raid? and why are the Seventh-day Adventists singled out for attack?

The answer to these questions is this: A National Sabbath Union has been formed within a few years, with the object of revivifying and enforcing the old Sunday laws and securing the enactment of new ones. Most of the religious denominations, if they have not indorsed this Sabbath Union, have taken no ground against it. The Seventh-day Adventists are a notable exception. On the broad ground of a complete separation between Church and State, and not because they desire to have the observance of the seventh day (Saturday) enforced by law, they have vigorously opposed the National Sabbath Union. . . . The arrest of Seventh-day Adventists in four different States of the Union, not for dissipation, but for honest farm labor on Sunday, looks like an act of revenge, mean and contemptible beyond expression. The result to be hoped for is the repeal of these obnoxious laws. — Oakland (Cal.), Daily Times.
