ARCHBISHOP IRELAND, in his now famous address before the school teachers at St. Paul, after protesting his love for the American public school, and his regret that certain peculiarities in it forbade Catholics to use it, offered two compromises one of which would, in his view, obviate the Catholic objections. Let us briefly consider the two:—

I would persuade the regular State school with the religion of the majority of the children of the land, be it as Protestant as Protestantism can be, and I would, as they do in England, pay for the secular instruction given in the denominational schools according to results. That is, each pupil passing the examination before State officials, and in full accordance with the State programme, would secure to his school the cost of the tuition of a pupil in the State school. This is not paying for the religious instruction given to the pupil, but for secular instruction demanded by the State, and given to the pupil as thoroughly as he could have received it in the State school.

It was a slip of the tongue by which the Archbishop says this would not be "paying for the religious instruction given to the pupil" in the denominational schools. If the State school is made "as Protestant as Protestantism can be," then the teacher is paid for making it so—that is, is paid for teaching religion; and by parity of reasoning, the teacher in the denominational school, is, and ought to be paid for his religious teaching.

But to begin with, this is not a modification, but a revolution. We Protestants cannot accept it. We do not want the State to make our public schools "as Protestant as Protestantism can be." We do not trust the State enough for that. We do not want the State to interfere with our religious matters. We cannot depend on the State to provide the sort of teachers always to whose religious instruction we are willing to commit our children. We know too well what that means. If the State can see to it that in its schools the children are taught its own Protestant religion, then it can say that this is a Protestant country, and that we do not want any but Protestants to come here; that other religions are foreign and un-American, unpatriotic and seditious; that Catholic parochial schools are a menace to our Protestant institutions, and if Catholic schools, then Catholic churches; and the step is not a long one, and is a most logical one, to persecution. A State Church means persecution. There is always a quarrel until you have either an absolute persecuting State Church, or an absolutely free Church. The Protestant State Churches of Europe are rapidly becoming free Churches. So far as they are not free the religion of the minority is practiced under a disadvantage-Catholics and Dissenters even in England now suffer under serious disadvantages, which are not persecution simply because England is moving perceptibly toward complete disestablishment. Archbishop Ireland knows very well how the interference of the State works with the Church in Italy or France or Spain, three most Catholic countries, or in Mexico or Brazil or the Argentine Republic, three leading American-Catholic countries; and does he wonder that we Protestants do not care to trust the State to have any control of our religious matters? Does he not remember how he and his friends, at the late Catholic Jubilee in Baltimore, praised the Amendment to the Constitution which forever separates Church and State, as the Magna Charta of Catholic rights and the condition of Catholic prosperity in this country, which has made this the happiest country in the world for Catholics, as it is for Protestants? And now would he have us Protestants throw away our independence and make our public "schools as Protestant as Protestantism can make them"? For ourselves, in our own self-defense, we reject the proposition, and we refuse to let the State teach any religion, whether Protestant in the State schools or Catholic or Jewish in the religious schools.

The Archbishop's other proposition is this:—

I would do as Protestants and Catholics in Poughkeepsie, and other places in our country, have agreed to do, to the great satisfaction of all citizens and the great advancement of educational interests. In Poughkeepsie the city School Board rents the buildings formerly used as parish schools; and from the hour of 9 A. M. to that of 3 P. M. the school is in every particular a State school—teachers engaged and paid by the Board, teachers and pupils examined, State books used, the doors always open to the Superintendent and members of the Board. There is simply the tacit understanding that so long as the teachers in those schools, Catholic in faith, pass their examinations and do their work as cleverly and loyally as other teachers under the control of the Board, teachers of another faith shall not be put in their place. Nor are they allowed to teach positive religion during school hours. This is done outside the hours for which the buildings are leased to the Board. The State, it is plain, pays not one cent for the religious instruction of the pupils. In the other schools let Protestant devotional exercises take place, in fullest freedom, before the usual school hour.

This, on the face of it, is more plausible. It is based on the supposition that Protestants want their schools to begin with Protestant devotional exercises or instruction, and that Catholics ought to have the same privilege. That is right, so far. Just as long as Protestants insist against all their principles of separation of Church and State, that there shall be religious exercises in the public schools, they have no argument against the Catholics. The reading of the Bible or prayer in public schools is a relic of barbarism, such as we used to have; and the fear of dropping it lest religion should suffer, is the survival of the cowardice which used to make the Church think that it would perish if it lost the support of the State.

In further reply to the Archbishop's alternative proposition, we make, on one side the answer that we do not want the "Protestant devotional exercises." It opens the way for them to be required, at any rate required of the teacher if not of the pupil, and we do not trust the State to provide teachers of devotion. For our part we repudiate and reject the privilege which this allows us.

On the other side the State is asked to provide and pay for Catholic religious instruction. It is absurd to say that these Catholic teachers are not to be paid for teaching religion. They are paid full salary, more, probably, than the teachers in the Catholic parochial schools now receive; and, thus paid by the State, they are required by somebody, practically by the State, to teach religion. If they do not teach religion, and this particular religion, they are dismissed. Further, they are employed only on condition that they shall be Catholics and teach Catholicism. Now, if that is not going back on the fundamental principle of our American institutions, and of the First Amendment so much extolled at the Baltimore Jubilee, then we fail to understand what a contradiction is. How would the Archbishop like his own proposition in practice? Here is a Catholic school on the Poughkeepsie plan. Ten Catholics apply for examination to the School Board, five of them brothers of an order approved by himself and five of them admirers of Dr. McGlynn and members of the Anti-Poverty Society. The School Board decide that the latter are good enough Catholics and would make the better teachers. What a row would be immediately started! But that is just the infelicity constantly arising in a union of Church and State.

The fact is, there is no compromise possible. It is either free Church or enslaved Church. Our institutions are based on the free-Church system, and Catholics like it, and we must defend them and ourselves against any other. It works well. Sir Charles Dilke says that Russia and the United States are the two most religious countries in the world, and for this reason the most dangerous in war. If we want to keep a people religious, we must trust the Church to teach them and not the State; and this is equally true for Catholics and Protestants. — Independent.
