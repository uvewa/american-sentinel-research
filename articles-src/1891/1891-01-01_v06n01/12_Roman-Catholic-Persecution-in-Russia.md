An English paper says that the "Roman Catholic priests near Warsaw have been exiled to Siberia for the crime of 'Catholic propaganda.' The Russian authorities have also forbidden the erection of new Roman Catholic Churches, or the repairing of old ones. Our Roman Catholic contemporaries very properly denounce this as religious persecution. What would they have to say, however, about Protestant propaganda in Spain or Mexico, which has been attended with similarly anti-Christian intolerance on the part of Romanists? After all, the rule of Rome is that every one should tolerate her, and that she should tolerate no one. Only when she is herself persecuted does she feel the iniquity of this policy. So, too, many who call themselves Protestants exhibit the spirit of rendering to Romanists and others what they have themselves received at the hands of Rome in the past. The Golden Rule, and not the Roman rule, is the Christian's line of action."
