THERE are, it is said, signs that France is slowly but surely returning to the observance of Sunday. "In the Chamber of Deputies recently, during a debate upon the bill regulating the hours of labor for children and women, the Deputies decided that one day in seven should be a rest day, and a section of the Chamber nearly succeeded in getting a clause passed to make that day of rest Sunday, two hundred and ten Deputies voting in favor of it. Although this result was not attained by legislation, it is thought that most employers will select Sunday as the 'one day in seven.'" But even this consummation would come very far short of the desires of the Sunday-law advocates in this country; here they demand not only that the people may rest but that they must rest. No advocate of a Sunday law in this country would be satisfied with such a law as that passed by the French Deputies. That is practically the present status of Sunday in California; in that State Sunday is a holiday, factories and shops are closed, and mechanics and laborers are free from toil. But this does not satisfy those who want Sunday laws; they demand the prohibition of Sunday extrusions and everything of that kind. In short, they propose to restrict people to choose between spending Sunday at home or going to church.
