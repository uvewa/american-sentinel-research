### Item 1
- **Location:** Column 3, "The Situation as It Is To-day," Blair Sunday Bill description (item 1)
- **Original scan shows:** Library stamp ("ANDREWS UNIVERSITY / BERRIEN SPRINGS, MICHIGAN / HERITAGE ROOM") overlays text
- **Initially transcribed as:** 'secure the "observance" of Sunday as a day of "worship."'
- **Corrected to:** 'secure the "due observance" of Sunday as a day of "rest and *worship*."'
- **Reason:** Closer examination of original reveals "due" before "observance" and "rest and" before "worship"; "worship" appears in italics in original

### Item 2
- **Location:** Throughout document
- **Original scan shows:** Some quotation marks appear as Hebrew-style typographical marks (״)
- **Transcribed as:** Standard quotation marks (" ")
- **Reason:** These are typographical artifacts from the original 19th-century printing/scanning process, not intentional Hebrew characters. Standard quotation marks preserve the intended meaning.

### Item 3
- **Location:** "Sunday-Law Doctrine," speech excerpt
- **Original scan shows:** "011 Sunday"
- **Transcribed as:** "on Sunday"

### Item 5
- **Location:** Congressional report, long quotation
- **Original scan shows:** "was" appears as "\\^as" in one instance (Cataline passage)

### Item 6
- **Location:** Editorial Notes, Evangel of Rest quotation
- **Original scan shows:** "inap-propriately" with line break and hyphen
- **Transcribed as:** "inap­propriately" (preserved as it appeared, a line-break hyphenation)
- **Reason:** This appears to be an intentional hyphenation due to column width in original
