CARDINAL GIBBONS thinks that first of all, Sunday should be devoted to religion. Presupposing that a certain portion of the day is set apart for religious exercises, he thinks that "any recreation that will contribute to the physical, mental, and moral enjoyment of the masses should be encouraged. Baseball playing is inconsistent with a proper observance. The church desires the Sabbath to be cheerful without dissipation, grave and religious without sadness and melancholy; and prescribes the golden mean between rigid sabbatarianism on the one hand and lax indulgence on the other." This is all well enough for the Catholic Church; it has a perfect right to require its members to observe Sunday in this way if it so elects, but neither that church nor any other has any right to ask the State to compel people to either do or forbear any act on Sunday simply because the church holds it to be improper upon that day.
