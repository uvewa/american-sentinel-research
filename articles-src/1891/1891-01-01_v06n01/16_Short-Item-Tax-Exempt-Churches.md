If a census could be taken of the Americans who will not sit in an untaxed church and listen to a gospel whose Founder ordered his followers to "Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's," and paid his taxes like an honest man to pagans, it might astonish many who think they are Christians, and do justice to an army of tax-payers who are compelled to pay increased taxes to make up the deficiency caused by exemption of religious property. We advise Christians to give this some attention.—*Loyal American.*
