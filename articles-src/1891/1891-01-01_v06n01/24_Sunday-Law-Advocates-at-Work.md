Now that Congress is again in session the Sunday-law advocates are hard at work trying to secure from that body some substantial recognition of Sunday sacredness. The Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia is, we are informed, to be pushed through if possible. In addition to this, Congress will be asked to take some action in regard to closing the Columbian Exposition, Sunday. Past failures have in nowiss discouraged the National Reform cohorts.
