THE Nebraska State Journal says that "the Bellamy boarding houses that have been started in different parts of the country since the appearance of 'Looking Backward,' do not flourish more than a few months as a rule. . . . The cost of living was actually reduced by cooperation, but gradually the people drifted back to their own little tables at home and a profitable membership could not be maintained. If there is anything that is prized in these days it is personal freedom. No saving in expense will quite reconcile a man to the obliteration of his individuality. No family will be content to live under rules not made by itself for its own convenience. And so these co-operative bubbles are pricked as fast as they rise."
