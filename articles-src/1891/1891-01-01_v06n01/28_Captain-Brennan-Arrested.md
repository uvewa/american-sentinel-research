CAPTAIN MICHAEL BRENNAN, of Company A, Sixty-ninth regiment, has been arrested in this city on the charge of parading his company to music on Sunday, while returning from a funeral. The arresting officer testified to ordering the Captain to stop the band, but was driven off at the point of the bayonet by the members of the company. The arrest was made the next day, and the Captain was held in one hundred dollars bail for trial at General Sessions. This case will be a test of the rights of the militia to parade with music on Sundays.
