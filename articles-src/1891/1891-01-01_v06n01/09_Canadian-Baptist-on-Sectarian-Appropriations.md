THE Canadian Baptist, of November 6, 1890, has the following: "The appropriation of public moneys to sectarian uses by State Legislatures is exciting much and increasing discussion in the United States. Thoughtful and far-seeing citizens in the different States are coming to see more and more clearly that such use of the public funds is wrong in principle and pernicious in practice."
