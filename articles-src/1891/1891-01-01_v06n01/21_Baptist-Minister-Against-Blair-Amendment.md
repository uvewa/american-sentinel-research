A LETTER from Burden, Kansas, informs us that Rev. G. F. Colvin, pastor of the Baptist Church at that place, preached a sermon recently, in which he took strong ground against the Blair Educational Amendment, as also against teaching religion in the public schools. He declared that such measures savor strongly of a union of Church and State.
