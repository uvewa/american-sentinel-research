AN exchange remarks that "it has been the rule that unless one member of a Jewish family in Russia belong to the State Church, none of the family may either do business or work for pay. Now a new ukase has been issued ordering that the whole family must join the church or all starve together. As might be expected, under this pressure many Jewish converts to Christianity are reported." This is a sample of law-made Christians!
