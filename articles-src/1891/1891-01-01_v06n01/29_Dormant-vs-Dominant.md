We have been criticised by an exchange for saying "dormant religious sects," and it has been suggested that "dominant" would have been the better word. So we thought when we wrote the note in which the word occurred, but the compositor had a different idea of the fitness of things, and the error was overlooked in proof-reading. We admit that, as our critic says, the sects are very wide awake and active in some directions. They have scented National Reform, and though dormant spiritually, politically they are as lively as the proverbial cricket.
