# The Rights of Conscience.

The *Truth Seeker* appears to misapprehend our position upon the rights of conscience. Some weeks ago, in answer to a question, we made the following statement concerning seventh-day Christians who oppose Sunday laws:—

> They oppose, not rightful authority, but a most unwarranted usurpation by the State of power that belongs alone to God. They "render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's," and refuse to obey the State only when, like the magistrates referred to in Acts 4:5-19, it commands that which involves the violation of the law of God. We utterly repudiate the pagan theory that the State is supreme in all things.

This, the *Truth Seeker* thinks, is simply "the Catholic position of the Church above the State—the Pope above the President, the priest above the legislator. And it must necessarily be the position of any true Christian church, or of any church or religion founded upon alleged supernatural events or authority." This conclusion is, we think, an error. In the first place it should be clearly understood that the Church and the State occupy wholly different fields. There can properly be no conflict between them, for at no point do their domains touch. The one is wholly spiritual, the other wholly temporal; the one relates wholly to this world, the other wholly to the world to come. The proper function of civil government is to protect the person, property, and reputation of its citizens; to preserve the equal rights of all without infringing upon the rights of any. To do this it must let religion alone. Nor are we dependent on the Bible for this knowledge; *it is self-evident*. Every man knows that he has, so far as his fellow-men are concerned, an inalienable right to worship when, where, and what he pleases. In discussing this question, Thomas Paine said:—

> Who art thou, vain dust and ashes! by whatsoever name thou art called, whether a king, a bishop, a Church, or a State, a parliament or anything else, that obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his Maker? Mind thine own concerns! If he believest not as thou believest, it is a proof that thou believest not as he believest, and there is no earthly power that can determine between you.

And not only do we agree with the great deist, but we go beyond him, in this, that we learn from the Scriptures that it is our sacred duty, a duty enjoined by our divine Master, to do unto others as we would that they should do unto us; to freely award to others all the liberty that we claim for ourselves; therefore with us it becomes doubly a matter of conscientious conviction; to our inherent sense of justice is added the sacred obligations of religion.

But in all this there is nothing to destroy individual responsibility and liberty of action. The Christian instructed by the Bible is just as free as the infidel instructed by his philosophy. The Christian instructed by divine revelation refuses to obey a man-made law forbidding certain acts which he feels in duty bound to do, just as the unbeliever refuses to perform certain acts of worship required by the same law because he does not recognize the right of his fellow creatures to require them at his hands. To illustrate: Suppose the State of New York should enact a law requiring everybody to become members of the Roman Catholic Church, would the editor of the *Truth Seeker* obey it? Certainly not. But why not? Simply because such a requirement would be an infringement upon his rights as a man. And he would be fully justified in refusing to obey such a law; all right-thinking men would honor him for it whether they agreed with him in his belief or not. Why then should our unbelieving neighbor attempt to turn against religion the exercise of like discretion and like liberty on the part of the Christian? The *Truth Seeker's* view is too narrow; it should come up to the point of conceding to others all that it claims for itself. In short, the whole question, instead of being one of the truth or falsity of Christianity, is one so broad that it covers every religion and every right growing out of the natural obligation resting upon all men to be true to themselves, to their own convictions of duty, to their own conceptions of Deity.
