THE President outraged the feelings of the National Reformers by omitting from his recent Thanksgiving proclamation all recognition of the Lord Jesus Christ. Even the familiar words, "In the year of our Lord," were omitted from the date line. The Christian Statesman calls it not "only 'an unchristian,' but an anti-Christian document, and Secretary Wylie says, in derision, that its author was evidently profoundly ignorant of the Christian religion.
