SUNDAY afternoon, December 7, Rev. Mr. Crafts, well known to our readers, spoke to a Philadelphia Sunday school, upon his favorite theme, giving seven reasons for Sunday keeping. Of course Mr. Crafts has a perfect right to have seven reasons, or seventy reasons, for keeping Sunday or any other day. He also has a perfect right to tell those reasons to any number of Sunday schools. But his manner of doing it upon this occasion was not such as to commend him to the esteem of people generally. He had spoken only a few minutes when his remarks degenerated into a tirade against observers of the seventh day. He complained that these people could not be silenced unless they were "knocked on the head with a club," and then transported while unconscious to some uninhabited island, where they would be compelled to remain, cut off from all intercourse with others for the remainder of their natural lives. This idea, however, is too nearly akin to the National Reform scheme for disposing of infidels, namely, to banish them to some wild, desolate island, and compel them to remain there as long as they live, to be considered original. This plan may appear to some to be scarcely practicable in this enlightened age, but it may fittingly be termed, though in the worst sense, "a knock-down argument."
