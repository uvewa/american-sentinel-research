One of the absurd uses to which an absurd law may be put was illustrated in the Westminster County Court last week. A dentist sought to recover fees for professional work, which, it transpired, was largely done on Sundays. The defendant contended that this brought the dentist within the Sunday Observance Act. The judge said the defense was a shabby one, and laid down that a dentist did not come within the Act. The man who has highest regard for the Sunday should be first to protest against a law making such contentions possible. Would any believer in the Lord's Supper desire to see that ordinance bandied about the courts again as it was in the olden time? The loudest protest would come from those who truly regarded Christ's last institution as sacred.
