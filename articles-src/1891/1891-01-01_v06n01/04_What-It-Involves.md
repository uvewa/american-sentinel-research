A LEGAL Sabbath involves, in a country where there are classes which disagree, a decision as to what day is the Sabbath. In so doing, it discriminates against religious classes on one side or the other. It involves the adoption of a religious institution held as sacred by more or less people. It thus places a religious dogma in the statute law, and therefore unites religion with the State. It elevates that branch of the Christian church which keeps Sunday, by establishing a religious tenet held by them, and it brings hardship upon those who disagree with them. Thus it would be with seventh-day keepers if Sunday were established. And this hardship would not come to the Jew by virtue of his relation as a citizen, but by virtue of his religion, which comes not in conflict with the rights of his fellow-citizens, but in conflict with a religious dogma enforced by civil law. No sophistry can evade this conclusion. Sunday legislation means religious legislation, religious tyranny, religious persecution.—Signs of the Times.
