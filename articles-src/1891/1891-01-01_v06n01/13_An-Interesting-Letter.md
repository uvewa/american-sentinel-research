A well-known minister and professor in an academy in Washington County, Pennsylvania, writes thus to a friend who sent him some copies of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL:

I have to thank you for copies of the paper sent me. I have read it with interest. I am glad to see my sentiments so well expressed in some of the articles. . . . I had so little time at my disposal in the address I made at the County Institute that I could only touch upon the subject of religion in our public schools. I take it that you were present when I spoke. I would like to have an opportunity to discuss that subject sometime, I could then give it the attention it deserves. As I said, there is a strong movement on foot now by different organizations, to force the teaching of religion in our public schools. In my opinion this is greatly to be deplored, not that I do not think that religion is important, but because I don't believe that the various sects can agree on that subject. It would be to introduce sectarianism into our schools, and so soon as that is done, it overthrows our public school system. . . . Besides, the State has nothing to do with religion, further than to allow all citizens freedom before the law to have such religion as they may choose. The State has no soul, and it cannot have a religion. It cannot have a choice between the different religious theories that divide Christendom; and further, if one religion were admitted into our schools, common fairness would demand that all forms have a hearing, for the public schools are supported by all shades of beliefs. The only safe and fair position to assume is that the State must not teach any religion.
