The American Sabbath Union, whose chief aim is a national Sunday law, is just now giving special attention to California. Every effort is to be made to secure a State Sunday law for "poor California" this winter. The Union displays on its publications this threefold motto: "Arouse the people; educate the people; combine the people."

The great concern for California is due to the fact that it is the only State in the Union that has no Sunday law. The Territories of Alaska, Idaho, and Arizona, have no Sunday laws, but California is the only State that is delinquent in this respect. It is not claimed that Sunday is more respected in most of the States than in California, in fact, it leaks out once in a while that there is a greater degree of Sunday reverence in this State than in many places where laws exist for the compulsory observance of the day.

But it would seem from some of the arguments advanced that it is the idea of not having a law, a legal backing for the worship common to the day, that is so much to be regretted. We are confronted with the impression, somehow, that the worship on that day falls short of the mark because it is not compelled by the State. Yet these people who want a Sunday law stoutly deny any desire for a Church and State Government. But every species of worship under provision of law is a Church and State principle just as far as it goes. And it is a principle that never says, "It is enough." It is bred of an appetite that is never satisfied,—the more it is fed the more it craves its favorite food.

We are told that a Sunday law is not intended to compel people to worship on that day, but only to compel them to close their places of business and stop secular work. The people are not so much concerned about what is intended as they are about what is accomplished by such legislation. All closing of business or cessation of labor on Sunday is worship. If it be not worship of God, it is worship of Sunday, which is idolatry. It may be compulsory; those who are thus compelled to observe the day may not desire to do so; then it becomes compulsory legal worship.

There is no denying the fact that all Sunday observance and all Sunday laws are based on the religious idea that Sunday is a sacred day. But for that idea, there would be no Sunday observance of any kind, and no Sunday laws. Men who care nothing for the day personally, close business or stop work out of respect for the custom which a religious influence has brought about; or it may be on account of the religious impressions which they received in youth; and some seem to suppose that that much show of religion will, in a measure, make up for other religious short-comings. In either event, the act is a religious concession, at least, that the day is sacred.

Sunday-law champions may talk around the point all they can in public; they may appeal as loudly as they can in behalf of the workingman, or they may attempt to cover up their effort with temperance or sanitary plasters, ever so thick; in their own councils, or before religious audiences, it is always the desecration of the sacred day that is specially bemoaned. And everywhere and all the time it is on Sunday that the saloon is a curse; it is on Sunday that the laborer needs rest; it is on Sunday that men should be with their families; and if men are so obtuse that they cannot see that Sunday is the day of all others on which to worship God, they must be made to see it by the law of the land.

We are told in one breath that the Sunday law does not say what men shall do, or shall not do, on Sunday, only that they shall not work or keep open any place of business,—all that is wanted is a day of rest and recuperation. But in the next breath the sanctity of the "American Sabbath" must be sustained, and the "continental holiday" must be kept down. We must have such Sunday laws as will keep out the German Sunday, when only two per cent. go to church and the remainder to the picnic. In one breath, we are told that the grand effort is for a "civil holiday," that men may have their liberty on that day; in the next breath, it is because of the holiday customs in some places that a Sunday law is so strongly urged.

If the people would but compare and duly weigh the many-sided arguments in favor of Sunday laws, they could not fail to see the aim and the logical end of such legislation. We are pointed to the liberties of the people in States where Sunday laws exist, to show that there is no danger of the consequences which we predict; but it must be remembered that there is great complaint, on the part of the Sunday-law abettors, of the inefficiency of many of such statutes. These must be made stronger in their provisions and penalties. And there is also complaint that the Sunday laws of the States cannot be properly enforced because the general Government does not sustain them. Herein lies the ground of appeal for a national Sunday law, in order that the State laws may be more rigidly enforced. That secured, then will follow the matter of strengthening the weaker State laws until they come up to the ideal of the most ardent National Reformer.

It is well to consider these inevitable results before they are fastened upon us.—W. N. Glenn, in Signs of the Times.
