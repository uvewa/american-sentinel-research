In a recent Sunday-law case on trial before a Spokane Falls, Washington, Court, an effort was made by the prosecuting attorney to exclude all Jews from the jury. To this the attorney for the defendant objected, as follow:—

The suggestion of the attorney would come to this: they would summon all Presbyterians or all Methodists and exclude all Jews. This is what the Constitution expressly prohibits. It provides that no religious test whatever shall be made in this country, and Colonel Moore wants to challenge a man because he is a Jew. Is not that a religious test? It seems to me outrageous to exclude a man because he is a Hebrew. We might as well exclude a man because he is an Irishman, or an American, or because he believes in nothing.

It is simply impossible to separate religion and religious tests from Sunday laws and their enforcement.
