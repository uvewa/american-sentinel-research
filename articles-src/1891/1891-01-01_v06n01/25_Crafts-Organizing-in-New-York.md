MR. CRAFTS is actively at work organizing local Sunday associations in this State. December 14, he was at Rome, New York, where he secured donations to the amount of $275.67 to be devoted to the distribution of Sunday literature, etc. A temporary organization was effected, and according to the published report, "a committee of pastors and laymen was appointed to report a Constitution and list of officers to a future meeting of the newly enrolled members. The society is not as yet allied to any State or national organization, but is independent and will probably devote itself wholly to local Sabbath reform."
