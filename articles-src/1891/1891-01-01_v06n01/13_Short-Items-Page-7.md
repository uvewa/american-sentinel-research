One of the absurd uses to which an absurd law may be put was illustrated in the Westminster County Court last week. A dentist sought to recover fees for professional work, which, it transpired, was largely done on Sundays. The defendant contended that this brought the dentist within the Sunday Observance Act. The judge said the defense was a shabby one, and laid down that a dentist did not come within the Act. The man who has highest regard for the Sunday should be first to protest against a law making such contentions possible. Would any believer in the Lord's Supper desire to see that ordinance bandied about the courts again as it was in the olden time? The loudest protest would come from those who truly regarded Christ's last institution as sacred.—*Present Truth, London, England.*

There are, it is said, signs that France is slowly but surely returning to the observance of Sunday. "In the Chamber of Deputies recently, during a debate upon the bill regulating the hours of labor for children and women, the Deputies decided that one day in seven should be a rest day, and a section of the Chamber nearly succeeded in getting a clause passed to make that day of rest Sunday, two hundred and ten Deputies voting in favor of it. Although this result was not attained by legislation, it is thought that most employers will select Sunday as the 'one day in seven.'" But even this consummation would come very far short of the desires of the Sunday-law advocates in this country; here they demand not only that the people *may* rest but that they *must* rest. No advocate of a Sunday law in this country would be satisfied with such a law as that passed by the French Deputies. That is practically the present status of Sunday in California; in that State Sunday is a holiday, factories and shops are closed, and mechanics and laborers are free from toil. But this does not satisfy those who want Sunday laws; they demand the prohibition of Sunday excursions and everything of that kind. In short, they propose to restrict people to choose between spending Sunday at home or going to church.

The *Nebraska State Journal* says that "the Bellamy boarding houses that have been started in different parts of the country since the appearance of 'Looking Backward,' do not flourish more than a few months as a rule. . . . The cost of living was actually reduced by co-operation, but gradually the people drifted back to their own little tables at home and a profitable membership could not be maintained. If there is anything that is prized in these days it is personal freedom. No saving in expense will quite reconcile a man to the obliteration of his individuality. No family will be content to live under rules not made by itself for its own convenience. And so these co-operative bubbles are pricked as fast as they rise."
