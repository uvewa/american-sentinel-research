THE Farmers' Alliance, in session at Ocala, Florida, unanimously passed this resolution: "We, the national Farmers' Alliance of America, believing that obedience and veneration for the laws of God are the conserving and saving force of human government, do hereby respectfully request that the directors of the great national Fair, to be held in 1892, do not desecrate the American Sabbath by keeping open the gates to the same on the Lord's day."
