THE *Evangel of Rest*, the official organ of the Sabbath Association of Iowa, has, in its December number, the following misrepresentation of the position of this paper:—

The self-styled *American Sentinel*, a very inap, propriately named little sheet of sadly warped and squinted view, which condemns the use of the Bible in schools, the protection of the wage-worker's right to rest on the Sabbath, the prevention of polygamy or of any crime by law because it would unite Church and State, shows its intellectual grasp in the following review.

We can regard this statement only as a malicious attempt to excite prejudice against THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, for the reason that we spoke in no uncertain tone upon the question of the prohibition of polygamy, no longer ago than September 4, 1890. At that time we said: "The State must forbid polygamy in every case, or else fail of the very object for which governments are instituted among men, namely, to preserve rights." Again, we said in the same article: "Polygamy does necessarily invade natural rights; therefore the State cannot sanction it, but is in duty bound to prohibit it." The editorial article from which we quote these two sentences contained nearly six columns strongly condemnatory of polygamy, and justifying its suppression by law. Subsequently we printed two contributed articles, both of considerable length, and both defending the right of the State to forbid plural marriages. In view of these facts we think it is putting it very mildly to say that the *Evangel's* statement is a most unwarranted misrepresentation.
