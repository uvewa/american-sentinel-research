The plain truth is that the present political activity of Catholics in America and in France, as shown by Catholic federation for political purposes in this country and the organized and systematic efforts for control of elections by the Assumptionist monks of France, while on the surface appearing to be the result of local and particular conditions, has far deeper inspiration. It naturally and inevitably follows from the underlying and unchanging principles of the Catholic system, and is strictly in accord with the avowed policy of the present head of that church toward the two countries in question. In 1897, writing in the Revue des Deux Mondes (Paris) on the question, "To what extent can the Roman Catholic church accept the republican principles on which French institutions have been based since the Revolution of 1789?" the Duc de Broglie said:

"It is evident, for example—as the least reflection is sufficient to warn us—that the church can never give her approval to the principle of an absolute equality between all forms of religious thought."

"Without ever lowering the standard of her ideals, she has always shaped her demands within the limits of what it was possible to hope for, or even of what it would be useful to obtain. On two points only has she been immovable—liberty to preach the gospel and freedom of conscience for the faithful."

"Peace can be made between modern France and the church when it pleases France to accept the conditions."

"I know of nothing more significant than the satisfaction which he [the Pope] has several times publicly expressed on learning of the growing strength of Catholicism in the United States. Assuredly he is far from approving the principles of the American Constitution, with its absolute separation of church and state in matters of religion."

The Duc de Broglie is well informed on this subject, and it is not at all likely that he misrepresented the position of the church, for he is a distinguished Royalist and in years past has made more than one attempt to force monarchical government upon France. He says, speaking with especial reference to France and the United States, that the church can never give her approval to the principle of an absolute equality between all forms of religious thought, and that her policy always has been to shape her demands only within the limits of what it was possible to hope or useful to obtain. This makes perfectly plain the outcry of Bishop McFaul and others who are pushing Catholic federation. They have been made, in a few instances, to recognize that to which their church "can never give her approval"—"the equality of all forms of religious thought"—and it grieves them terribly. They know that it will be "useful" to obtain the removal of this outrage, and no doubt believe this to be "within the limits of what it is possible to hope for." Hence federation and the shaping of their demands.
