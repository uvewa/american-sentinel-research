A PROMINENT paper asks: "Why doesn't Italy protest to England against the 'excessive liberty' accorded to anarchists? The most flamboyant 'red' may enjoy the freedom of Hyde park of a Sunday and talk anarchy till he is black in the face under a red flag and the protection of the police. The same apostle caught spouting in New York or Chicago or Paterson, N. J., would be locked up before he could declare war against a single monarch."
