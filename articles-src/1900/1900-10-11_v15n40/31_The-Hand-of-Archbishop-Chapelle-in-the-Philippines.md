From the Michigan Christian Advocate.

The Philippine Commission has been giving a final hearing to the Filipino Catholics, on the one hand, and Archbishops Nogaleda and Chapelle and the Catholic friars, on the other, on the vexed question of title to properties held by the friars and their future status in the islands. The findings of the commission have not at this writing been given out.

Harold Martin, the representative of the Associated Press at Manila, gives some valuable testimony in a letter to the Independent. Twelve months' residence and touring in the islands has not brought him in contact with a single native who does not wish the friars expelled. "They do not ask for the curtailment of the friars' power, nor for their regulation, but always emphatically for their expulsion," he says. Yet Mr. Martin admits that under the treaty of Paris, which he says Archbishop Chapelle claims that he shaped, the United States can not bodily expel the friars; but he claims that it can prevent their return to their former parishes and limit their work to the larger cities of the islands. He reports that the natives, though as loyal Catholics as ever, look upon Archbishop Chapelle as "one friar more," so ardent an advocate of the friars' claims has he become.

In this connection an extract from a letter in the New York Evening Post is valuable, as showing the spirit and course of Archbishop Chapelle. Says the correspondent: "Archbishop Chapelle is taking an active hand in affairs, and now claims that he secured the recall of Otis. He has warmly championed the side of the friars, but church matters have not progressed except for several decrees from Otis depriving the priests of immunities and privileges they had enjoyed under Spanish laws. He and Chapelle had an animated correspondence, Chapelle reminding Otis that it was most important to President McKinley that matters be adjusted satisfactorily to the Catholics before election, and Otis replying (the best thing he ever did): 'You are a priest and I am a soldier. I did not know that it was the business of either to concern himself about elections.'"

If this be true, it should raise Gen. Otis measurably in public esteem.
