No fair-minded person will oppose Catholics because they are Catholics, nor will he hold the present communicants of that church responsible for deeds of violence and blood in which they had no participation. But the real situation is this—the article of Bishop McFaul, and not that of Mr. Malone, reveals the actual and consistent Catholic position. A few years since Pope Leo announced to this country that the church "would bring forth much more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority," Now, Bishop McFaul and his associates are simply proceeding upon the boldly avowed policy of Leo as contained in his encyclical made public early in 1895. Equality before the law is not sufficient; they must have "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority," in order that abundant fruits may appear. What Bishop McFaul and others mean when they say that Catholics do not enjoy their Constitutional rights "in their integrity," is that they are not allowed to have everything that they demand. When they are allowed free access to the public treasury and are in full control of legislation, they will then be enjoying their Constitutional rights "in their integrity." And this is the fruitful liberty which Leo has so long ardently wished the church might enjoy in this country.

It would seem to be in order, and especially so since the appearance of this excellent article of Mr. Malone's, for those Catholics who have not been enjoying their Constitutional rights to begin the exercise at once of this privilege in which they are fully protected and out of which they have been cheated only by their inordinate desire for unconstitutional privileges. Be happy, gentlemen, in the session of your liberties; do not allow the enjoyment of Constitutional rights by others to spoil your enjoyment of the same.
