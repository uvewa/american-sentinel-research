WRITING for the Saturday Evening Post, Leonidas Hubbard, Jr., while commending the teaching of patriotism in the public schools, makes this excellent suggestion:

"Care must be taken that the right sort of patriotism be taught. The young American must not come to believe that patriotism consists solely in the risking of life to repel invaders. He must be taught that it consists no less in guarding the interests of the state in time of peace. That it consists not so much in physical courage as in unselfishness and honesty."
