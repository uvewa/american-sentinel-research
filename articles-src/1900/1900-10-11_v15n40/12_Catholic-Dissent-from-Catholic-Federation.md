Rev. Thomas H. Malone, member of the Colorado State Board of Charities and Corrections, is a Catholic who sees no necessity for the federation of Catholics for political purposes, and who dissents entirely from the positions taken by Bishop McFaul of Trenton in his recent articles written in justification of this movement, entitled "Catholics and American Citizenship." In the October *North American Review*, under the heading "Catholic Citizens and Constitutional Rights," Mr. Malone considers the article of Bishop McFaul, which he says "breathes a spirit hostile to this modern practice [the separation of politics and religion], and his recommendations could scarcely claim justification even on the ground that the disabilities which he alleges Catholics suffer, have undeniable existence. Even on such an extreme supposition, it is questionable if political unity, having religion as its basic principle, would not accentuate, rather than ameliorate, the disagreeable conditions."

As to the contention that Catholics are not permitted in the United States to enjoy their Constitutional rights "in their integrity," Mr. Malone says there can be but one answer, which he gives in these words:

"In America, more than in any other country in the world, Catholics are permitted to enjoy, without interference or molestation, their full Constitutional rights, while they are guaranteed the freest exercise of their religion in every State in the Union."

As to the complaint, endorsed by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishops Ryan and Kain, at the discontinuance of the Government subsidy for Catholic Indian schools, he says that "it is difficult to understand how any one could find reason to conclude that the Government 'would not reverse its recognized and successful [he is quoting here the language of the complaint] policy of subsidizing these schools.'" He regards this conclusion as especially unwarranted because of the fact that the Government gave five years' notice of its intention to take this action. On this point of Government support, Mr. Malone well says:

"As long as Catholics are not discriminated against in this matter, we certainly have little cause to complain. I quite agree with a distinguished Catholic author that it would be much better if both Catholics and Protestants would cease accepting money from the state for any purpose. It is a habit not calculated to strengthen the religion that makes a practice of leaning on the state for support."

In concluding his paper Mr. Malone says that whatever may be the intentions of Bishop Mr. Faul, his efforts can result only in "a Catholic political party," and that the charge of "political unity along religious lines," which these efforts have called forth, has been justified.
