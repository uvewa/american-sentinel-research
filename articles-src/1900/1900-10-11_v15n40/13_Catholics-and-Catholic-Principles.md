This article of dissent is good, and, coming from the source it does, it affords especial pleasure. If Catholics as a general rule spoke such words and took such positions it would only be fair to agree with the statement made by Mr. Malone in his article that Catholics have kept up with the advancement of the world and are no more dangerous to free institutions than are other people. Indeed no fair-minded person would contend that a Catholic is any different "under the skin" from any other person, or that the people constituting the great body of the Catholic membership are by nature more inclined to bigotry and intolerance than peo-of other persuasions. But, unfortunate as it may be for many liberty-loving Catholics, every fair-minded person knows that the principles of the Catholic Church are more intolerant and oppressive than are the principles of any other organization, religious or political, in the world. And it follows that those who are constantly engaged in supporting and propagating these principles—the Catholic clergy—can not as a body be noted for any great fervor or affection for popular liberty. On the contrary, with very few exceptions, among which it is a pleasure to note that of Mr. Malone, they have been found in abundant instances to be the most dangerous and subtle enemies of civil and religious freedom.
