In an article in the October Century, Bishop Potter expresses the opinion that there could not be a more stupid or shameless policy than the partitioning of China among the great Powers. A nation, like a man, the bishop says, has a right to be until she has demonstrated her incompetence to administer her own affairs with equal justice to all; and this China has not yet done, in spite of the stained record of her dishonored and corrupted officials.
