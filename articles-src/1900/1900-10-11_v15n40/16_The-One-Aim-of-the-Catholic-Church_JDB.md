An eminent Catholic writer has declared in the United States that religious liberty is merely endured until the opposite can be carried into effect. That church has but one aim in every country, and that is to gain supremacy. This is her fixed policy, and she adopts any methods that promise this result. This is her plain and avowed policy to-day as it has been throughout her history. She may be inconsistent as to her means, but never as to her aim. Michelet, writing upon the conduct of the church in France, says that "in one single century, the sixteenth, Rome changed three times, throwing herself now to the right, now to the left, without either prudence or decency. First, she gives herself up to the kings, next she throws herself into the arms of the people; then again, she returns to the kings. Three lines of policy, but one aim." This aim is "the standard of her ideals" which is never lowered.

Until the Catholic Church becomes satisfied with the fruits of liberty, and approves in very word and deed "the principles of the American Constitution, with its absolute separation of church and state," it will be necessary to conclude that such men as Mr. Malone, are far, very far in advance of the organization with which they are identified, and that he is mistaken in supposing that the church has made advancement commensurate with the enlightenment which has for a time removed the world from the intellectual and moral darkness of church-and-state absolutism.
