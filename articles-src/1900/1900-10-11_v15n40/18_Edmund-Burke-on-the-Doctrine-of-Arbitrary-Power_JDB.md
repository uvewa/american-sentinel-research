*(Concluded.)*

Men, professing to be the representatives of republican government, are astounded to-day when told that they can not succeed to arbitrary power by treaty, purchase and conquest *without the consent of those whom they are to rule*. How much greater would be their astonishment should they hear such words as these of Mr. Burke:

"The title of conquest makes no difference at all. No conquest can give such a right; for conquest—that is, force—can not convert its own injustice into a just title by which it may rule others at its pleasure. . . ."

"No, my lords, this arbitrary power is not to be had by conquest. Nor can any sovereign have it by succession, for no man can succeed to fraud, rapine, and violence, neither by compact, covenant, or submission, for men can not covenant themselves out of their rights and their duties, nor by any other means can arbitrary power be conveyed to any man. Those who give to others such rights perform acts that are void as they are given, good indeed and valid only as tending to subject themselves and those who act with them to the divine displeasure, because morally there can be no such power. Those who give and those who receive arbitrary power are alike criminal, and there is no man but is bound to resist it to the best of his power wherever it shall show its face in the world. It is a crime to bear it when it can be rationally shaken off. Nothing but absolute impotence can justify men in not resisting it to the utmost of their ability.

"Law and arbitrary power are in eternal enmity. Name me a magistrate and I will name property; name me power and I will name protection. It is a contradiction in terms, it is blasphemy in religion, it is wickedness in politics to say that any man can have arbitrary power. In every patent of office the duty is included. For what else does a magistrate exist? To suppose for power is an absurdity in idea. Judges are guided and governed by the eternal laws of justice to which we are all subject. We may bite our chains if we will, but we shall be made to know ourselves, and be taught that man is born to be governed by law, and he that will substitute will in the place of it is an enemy of God.

"Despotism does not in the smallest degree abrogate, alter, or lessen any one duty of any relation of life or weaken the force or obligation of any one engagement or contract whatever. Despotism, if it means anything that is at all defensible, means a mode of government bound by no written rules and coerced by no controlling magistracies or well-settled orders in the state. But if it has no written law, it neither does nor can cancel the primeval, indefeasible, unalterable law of nature and of nations, and if no magistracies control its exertions, those exertions must derive their limitation and direction either from the equity or moderation of the ruler, or from downright revolt on the part of the subject by rebellion, divested of all its criminal qualities. The moment a sovereign removes the idea of security and protection from his subjects, and declares that he is everything and they nothing, when he declares that no contract he makes with them can or ought to bind him, he then declares war upon them. He is no longer sovereign; they are no longer subjects. . . ."

"No man, therefore, has a right to arbitrary power."

"Arbitrary power never did in any case, nor ever will in any case, produce any one of the ends of just government."

As to the value of precedent in this matter, which was set up in justification then as now, Mr. Burke said:

"My lords, we all know that there has been arbitrary power in India; that tyrants have usurped it, and that, in some instances, princes otherwise meritorious have violated the liberties of the people, and have been lawfully deposed for such violation. I do not deny that there are robberies on Hounslow Heath; that there are such things as forgeries, burglaries, and murders, but I say that these acts are against law, and that whoever commit them commit illegal acts. When a man is to defend himself against a charge of crime it is not instances of similar violation of law that is to be the standard of his defense. A man may as well say I robbed upon Hounslow Heath, but hundreds robbed there before me. To which I answer, the law has forbidden you to rob there, and I will hang you for having violated the law, notwithstanding the long list of similar violations which you have produced as precedents. No doubt princes have violated the law of this country; they have suffered for it. Nobles have violated the law; their privileges have not protected them from punishment. Common people have violated the law; they have been hanged for it. I know no human being exempt from the law. The law is the security of the people of England; it is the security of the people of India; it is the security of every person that is governed and of every person that governs. There is but one law for all, namely, that law which governs all law, the law of our Creator, the law of humanity, justice, equity, the law of nature and of nations. So far as any laws fortify this primeval law and give it more precision, more energy, more effect by their declarations, such laws enter into the sanctuary and participate in the sacredness of its character. But the man who quotes as precedents the abuses of tyrants and robbers pullutes the very fountain of justice, destroys the foundations of all law, and thereby removes the only safeguard against evil men, whether governors or governed—the guard which prevents governors from becoming tyrants and the governed from becoming rebels."

What may be learned from the words of Mr. Burke aside from the truth that "it is a contradiction in terms, it is blasphemy in religion, it is wickedness in politics to say that any man can have arbitrary power"? Comparing them with the utterances of those who sneer at the Declaration of Independence, this may now be seen: That in the closing year of the nineteenth century the claims and arguments of men, speaking for a republic and from the standpoint of republicanism, are such as were arraigned in a monarchy more than a century ago by statesmen, claiming to speak only from the standpoint of just monarchical government, as beyond the rightful claim of any earthly authority. That is to say that the English monarchy was more republican in its fundamental principles and laws a century ago than is the American Republic to-day according to the utterances and claims of those who profess to speak for it.

By way of illustration: Mr. Burke said that no man or any number of men could rightfully govern others according to their will and pleasure. Within the present year it has been declared in the Congress of the United States by men speaking of people for whom they were at the time framing a government in disregard of the protests of that people, "We will govern them as we please."

Mr. Burke declared that not only was it impossible to receive or obtain arbitrary power by conquest or compact, but, taking his stand squarely upon the doctrine of *inalienable* rights, said that such power could not be had over a people even though they themselves were perfectly willing that it be exercised, for "men can not covenant themselves out of their rights." For simply going so far as to say that it was unjust and tyrannical to receive or claim such power as the result of compact and conquest United States senators have been denounced as "traitors in law and traitors for whom no sentimental sympathizers would go bail," and with others as "rebels" and "fomenters of armed rebellion." Had they gone the length that Mr. Burke went, and the length that the Declaration goes, their conduct would no doubt have been deemed flagitious beyond the power of language to describe.

From the fact that the true principles of the English monarchy in the closing years of the eighteenth century were more liberal and tolerant of the rights of men than are the principles avowed for the American Government as it starts on the eve of the twentieth century on its career as a "world-power," it is perfectly plain that as far as republican principles are concerned in this country a time of retreat and repudiation has arrived. To-day in the Republic of the United States the principles of Protestant, republican, and constitutional government are of far less value in the estimation of the avowed friends of republicanism than were those principles more than a century ago in the estimation of the citizens of a monarchy.
