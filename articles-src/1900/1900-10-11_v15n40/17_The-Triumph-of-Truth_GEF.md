(Concluded.)

Last week we sought to make plain the fact that truth triumphs in this world only through persecution and crucifixion; that it is sometimes down in the utmost apparent defeat, but that it inevitably triumphs at last, if never fully before, at least in the final day when the "hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters overflow their hiding place." It follows from this that he who stands by the truth when it is down in the utmost apparent defeat, when the multitudes are crying "Crucify him, crucify him," he only is really a truth worshiper, and entitled to any share in the glory of the final triumph. All others are like those of old who forsook Him and fled in the hour of his crucifixion. The only hope for them is that they also, like those of old, return repentant, and stand faithfully by rejoicing even in the ignominy of the cross till it triumphs.

In the fourth century the truth of the gospel was subverted and crucified, the republican brotherhood of the early church was gradually transformed into the papal imperialism, the spirit of sacrificing, serving love was lost out of the church organization and only lingered in the hearts of the faithful, persecuted few. In the multitude of professed Christians this spirit was succeeded by the spirit of proud and arbitrary dominion. Speaking of this time Draper well says: "To the reign of Constantine the Great must be referred the commencement of those dark and dismal times which oppressed Europe for a thousand years."

## Powerful Voices Heard in Protest.

It must not be thought, however, that all this change took place without a protest. D'Aubigne truly says: "There is always a protest in the human heart against evil."

Neander says: "It is true powerful voices were heard protesting against this confusion of political and spiritual interests, as, for example, Hilary of Poitiers, who remarked well and beautifully to the Emperor Constantius: 'It is for this purpose that you govern and watch that all may enjoy sweet liberty. The peace of the church can no otherwise be restored, its distractions can in no other way be healed than by permitting every man to live wholly according to his own convictions, free from all slavery of opinion. Even though such force should be employed for the support of the true faith, yet the bishops would come before you and say: God is the Lord of the universe; he requires not an obedience which is constrained, a profession which is forced. He does not want hypocrisy, but sincere worship.'" (Torrey's Neander, vol. II, p. 134.)

It was the council of Nicea which laid the foundation for all this superstructure of tyranny, oppression, and darkness. This council condemned Arius as the arch heretic. There is reason to believe that this man, whose history has come to us only through the hands of his bitterest enemies, whose teachings, like the teachings of Jesus, were afterward perverted by his professed followers, was not only not a heretic, but that he was the one who in that council made the mighty stand for primitive Christian truth which made the council tremble. The very fact that that council which subverted the truth condemned him as the greatest heretic is evidence that he was the one man who made the greatest and most telling protest against the iniquity of their proceeding.

There were other warning voices besides those of Arius and Hilary, but Neander says: "These isolated voices could accomplish nothing in opposition to the great mass, and they proceeded mainly from those who had been made sore by oppression."

## The Protest Continues.

The Sentinel to-day has to make just such an apparently hopeless protest. It is said also to-day that those who make this protest are only the few "sore heads," who, being in the minority, are oppressed by the enforced will of the triumphant majority. It is easy to see that, should the system of intolerance now forming in this country control history for a thousand years, as it might if Christ did not come to cut it short, those who are making this protest would go down in such history as the greatest heretics of the age. But still the worshiper of truth and right must not flinch or draw back. He knows, too, that his honest protest against the evil will not be lost, but that it will be made powerful by the divine Spirit to the salvation of the honest in heart. The protest in the fourth century was not lost. It was that faithful protest, that noble standing by the crucified truth, that kept the truth alive in the hearts of the honest, faithful ones through all those centuries of darkness and oppression, awaiting the time when it again found expression in the fearless, burning words of Luther, who said: "Christians fight not with sword and musket, but with sufferings and the cross." "If truth was of the nature to triumph by force God would never have committed it to fishermen." The fact is no honest word spoken for the truth is ever lost, no life crucified with the crucified truth is without its glorious victory.

## Truth Triumphs in Apparent Defeat.

No life in all earth's history ever went out in more utter and hopeless apparent defeat than did the life of Jesus. After all his speaking "as never man spake," only a few fishermen believed on him, and these all forsook him and fled in the hour of his trial. It was the very people for whom he had labored most who mocked him at the foot of the cross. Yet that life was a victory which is to prove the salvation of the world. It is not always a disgrace to die on the scaffold or in jail. In Mt. Auburn cemetery, near Boston, lies buried a young man on whose simple tombstone is recorded the fact that "He died in jail." At first the writer wondered at this inscription. Could not hatred or vengeance be satisfied without following their victim thus openly beyond this life? So I sought the facts, and found that he was a Boston boy who, in the ante-bellum days, having weak lungs, went to live in Maryland to escape the severe winters of the North. He found a poor colored man, a slave, struggling for that liberty which was his by divine right. He assisted him to liberty, and for so doing was cast into jail. He was kept there until his health failed and he was about to die of tuberculosis. His parents and friends in the North made every effort to secure his release. They said: "If he has done wrong he has already suffered enough for it; let him come home and die with his loved ones; he is only a boy." But the governor of Maryland said, "No, let him die in jail." So there he died, and the fact was recorded on his tombstone, not as a disgrace, but as an honor. No such life is wasted if the purpose was sincere and honest. God makes the death more potent than the life could have been to bring about the triumph of truth and right.

## The "Abolition" Truth.

In those old days when the "abolition" truth was persecuted and crucified, a young minister of the gospel left the State of Maine and went to Illinois, securing a charge there in one of the growing towns. He had somehow been trained that it is the duty of the minister of Christ to speak the plain truth, and to cry out against oppression and wrong sanctioned by the church. So he spoke of the terrible wrong of slavery, and presented the truth that all men by divine right should be free. He was waited on by a committee who told him that if he persisted in saying such things he would surely be killed, and they besought him, for his life's sake, to be silent. The noble answer of Lovejoy, for this was his name, was, "I can die, but I can not refuse to speak the truth for my Master." So, as he continued to speak the truth, one night they murdered him, and he was buried in an unmarked grave on the silent hillside above the town. The unbeliever may say, "Another wasted life. What had he accomplished? Who had believed on him?" But wait. When the news of his murder and dishonorable burial reached Boston the citizens of Boston assembled in Faneuil Hall to enter their protest against such crimes and such methods of silencing the voice of truth. The mayor of Boston sent a protest against that meeting, and requested that they quietly disperse, saying that it would not do to hold such a meeting as that even in Boston, for it might lead to mob violence. In that hall, listening to that protest and request from the mayor and city council of Boston, was a young man till then unknown. He had just graduated from college. He was talented, educated, refined, and cultured. His soul was full of noble purposes and lofty, holy ambitions. He was just looking around to find a life work worthy of him and of his Master. As he heard that protest of the mayor, and knew the truth of this murder in Illinois, his soul was stirred within him. He reflected that here was a truth that was being crucified as had been his Master, a truth in the success or failure of which was wrapped up the destiny of a race. He said in his heart, "Here is a work worthy of the consecration of my life." He arose to speak, and so that night the people heard for the first time the wonderful eloquence of Wendell Phillips, the "silver-tongued orator" of abolition. Who says now that Lovejoy died in vain when his death secured the consecration of such a life to so holy a cause? The world well knows now how well and nobly Wendell Phillips gave his life to that cause. At first he was persecuted and hooted at and rotten-egged whenever he attempted to speak, and then the world listened, and finally the truth to which he had given his life was triumphant, and through a terrible baptism of blood the slaves were freed.

When Phillips died his body lay in state in Faneuil Hall for days, and multitudes thronged to do honor even to the lifeless clay of the fallen hero. Such is the way of the world to crucify the dawning truth of its own age, and at the same time glorify the now triumphant truth of the age before. Yet, grand as Phillips always was, he was never so noble and heroic as when, in the early days, he was giving his life for the crucified truth. The world needs men to-day who dare to consecrate their lives to the crucified truth. God grant these simple but truthful words may be an inspiration to such lives, teaching them that no such sacrifice is ever in vain.
