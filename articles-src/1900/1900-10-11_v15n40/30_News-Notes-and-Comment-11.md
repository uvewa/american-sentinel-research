It is stated that "over ten thousand persons visited the French Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist in New York in a single day to view what purports to be a bone from the arm of St. Anne." Most of these persons were there seeking relief from ills of various sorts and of course there were many so-called wonderful "cures." Commenting upon these facts the Christian Advocate says:

"But a great many Protestants are unable to point the finger of scorn at this performance. There is Simpson, a past master in this kind of quackery, and Dowie, the difference between the two being that the former has magnetic persuasiveness and the latter overwhelming bumptious domination; and Schlatter, with his head, hair, and face resembling the traditional portraits of Christ, and Sanford, of Maine, and the Mormons, all curing diseases and all having the same limitations and relapses, and all their performances perfectly explicable upon natural principles. And there are the Christian Scientists, the most superstitious of all. That God may heal diseases in answer to prayer can not be successfully disproved by any one, but to reject the use of means is an insult to the God who established the relation of cause and effect."
