IT is said to cost $25,000,000 to elect a President in the United States. Most of the money is provided by protected interests and office-holders, or by those who, in event of a change of administration, hope to become office-holders or dispensers of official patronage. Much of the money is, of course, used in a perfectly legitimate way in paying speakers, printing and distributing literature, etc.
