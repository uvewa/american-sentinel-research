Tuesday, September 18, the public schools of Lowell, Mass., were closed on account of the funeral of a Catholic priest, "Father" O'Brien. The action was taken by vote of the school board on the evening of the previous day, and pupils and teachers in many instances did not know that the public schools were to be made to do honor to one of their chief enemies until they learned the fact from the closed doors which debarred them from the buildings.

One clergyman, the Rev. S. T. Ford (Baptist), dared to speak out from his pulpit in condemnation of this un-American procedure, and, in language temperate yet forcible, presented the principles by which the school board should have been governed. The Lowell *Citizen* quotes him as saying:

"Because an ecclesiastic dies the State has no right to divert its funds to any memorial service, for that is what was done. It costs a great deal of money to run our schools. There was a diversion of the public funds in the interest of a memorial service connected with the church. We ought in our public institutions to be very careful that there shall be no intermingling of church and state.

"Another thing. I noticed in the report in the newspapers that the vote to close was unanimous, and it was said that Father O'Brien was a prominent educator. I want to ask you if you are convinced that Father O'Brien was a distinguished advocate and supporter of the public schools. There is the vital question. He had in connection with his own parish a private school. He had the right to do it. It was said in the address at his funeral that he had been zealous in this work in other cities. He then represented a movement which, if I understand it correctly, is, to speak it mildly, not in sympathy with the public schools. Now, for the public schools of a city to close to pay tribute to a man who believes that there is a better way, and who himself sought to build up schools at the sacrifice and to the detriment of the great public schools of our country, was an unjustifiable tribute."

Such action on the part of the school board of Lowell is consistent only with the idea that the public schools ought to be closed altogether and the parochial school system instituted in their place. There is no difference in principle between closing the schools one day out of deference to this priest's system of education and closing them the whole year round for the same reason. That system is just as worthy of deference at one time as at another; and for the public schools to honor their antagonist is in itself an admission that they ought not to exist.
