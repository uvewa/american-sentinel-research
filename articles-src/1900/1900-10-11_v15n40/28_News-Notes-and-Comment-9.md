L. S. HALL of Hartford, Conn., died some time since leaving a will, which, after making some minor bequests to the amount of about, $3,000, left the residue of his estate, about $10,000, to the Advent Christian Publication Society of Boston, for the purpose of combating the doctrine of natural immortality of the soul. The heirs ask that the will be set aside on the ground that it "would be contrary to public policy to allow a bequest to stand which is made for the purpose of attacking a doctrine universally believed by Christian peoples, and which is a cornerstone in civilization." This is the same ground upon which the will of Stephen Girard was attacked in Pennsylvania seventy years ago, but without avail. The result in the present case will be awaited with interest by lovers of religious liberty everywhere.

Besides the principle involved in this Hartford case, it is a mistake to assume that the belief in natural immortality is universal among Christians. Besides individuals in nearly all denominations who do not believe this doctrine, it is rejected not only by the Advent Christians who number about 25,000 in this country, but by other bodies of Adventists numbering all told probably in the neighborhood of 100,000 souls.
