FORCED out of the colleges and universities endowed by the rich, as they express it, several leaders of Socialistic thought in the United States and England have determined to organize educational institutions of their own, and in connection with them settlements are to be established where the believers in the ideas of Socialism may make their homes. Plans were disclosed a few days since for such a school in Yorkville County, Michigan. The settlement is to be known as Golden Rule Park. The educational institution is under the direction of Prof. George D. Herron, formerly of Iowa College at Grinnell, Ia. The college is to be called "A School of Applied Christianity." Behind the movement and working in conjunction with the National Christian Citizenship League, with headquarters in this city, are Mayor Samuel Jones, of Toledo, Ohio; N. O. Nelson, the St. Louis manufacturer; Mrs. E. D. Rand, who endowed the chair formerly filled by Professor Herron at Iowa College, and A. M. Todd, "the peppermint king" of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Leaders of Socialistic ideas from all parts of the world will be invited to attend the opening session of this school.

While Professor Herron doubtless means well enough, his applied Christianity is only applied paganism. It is a fit companion of "Christian citizenship."
