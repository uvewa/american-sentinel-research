THE theory that civil government must have something to do with religion, and that it must in some degree at least enforce the divine law, is radically opposed to the teaching of Divine Revelation. The Scriptures plainly declare that "every one of us shall give account of himself to God," not to civil government.

Our accountability to God includes every act of our lives. It includes every relation of life. The divine law not only requires that we love God supremely, but also that each soul shall love his neighbor as himself. Hence any disregard of the rights our fellowmen is a violation not only of just civil law, but, first of all, it is violative of the divine law, and is sin. But civil law does not, or at least should not, undertake to punish sin, but only crime.

Sin pertains not only to the outward act, but has its beginning in the secret thought, in the hidden motive, deep down in the heart. And while the act affects our fellowmen, while it may be an invasion of human rights, the sin is without qualification against God, for it is his law that is violated, and it is He who "shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil."

God is the only moral governor. To him, and to him alone, every soul is morally responsible. In the very nature of things this could not be otherwise, because to permit any power whatever to come between the soul and God would be to destroy individual responsibility to God.

But man is a social as well as a moral being, and as such he is endowed with "certain unalienable rights." To him God has committed the preservation of these rights by means of civil government. This truth is thus expressed in the American Declaration of Independence:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

To disregard these rights or to trample upon them is to wrong our fellowmen and so to sin against God. The sin, if not repented of and forgiven, God will punish in his own time; the wrong may be dealt with by our fellows in their organized capacity as a state; and it is this fact that restrains from deeds of violence and injustice many who have not the fear of God before them. This safeguard to liberty and natural rights the God who sends his rain upon the just and upon the unjust has given to the race. Its benefits accrue alike to the righteous and to the wicked. The powers of civil government are exercised alike by and for Jew and Gentile, pagan and Christian. Hence civil government is not in any sense Christian, but is humanitarian—that is, it is given, like marriage, for the good of mankind.

Man has been made the guardian of his own civil rights, not by an arbitrary arrangement on the part of the Creator, but for wise and beneficent reasons which we can readily discover and comprehend. God committed to men, not the administration of his law, nor any part of it, but the maintenance of those rights which reason teaches that all intelligent moral beings should enjoy in common, those self-evident rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence.

Had God made civil government Christian and commissioned men to administer his law, and to require of their fellows the discharge of duties due to the Divine Being, or even to administer the divine law as regards the duties which, as social beings, we owe to one another, it would necessarily have destroyed moral responsibility to God.

Again, it is obvious that had God not committed to men the power to regulate to some extent their social relation in order that their natural rights might be preserved, but had himself administered civil justice, either vengeance would have been so swift and certain as to defeat the very design of God in making man a free moral agent, or else punishment would have been so long delayed as to afford no protection to those in need of it. It was absolutely necessary that man should be the guardian of his own rights in this world, and for the temporary concerns of this world, but that this should in no way affect his individual moral responsibility to the Creator. Nor should men make it a pretext for assuming to exercise authority which belongs alone to God.

That the principle here stated is the correct and spiritual one is clear from the words of Christ when the Pharisees sought to entangle him in his talk. They asked him the question: "Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?" But he, understanding their purpose, said: "Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." In this Christ plainly separated between civil and moral duties. The paying of tribute was simply a civil matter. They were living under Caesar's government and it was right that they should contribute to the support of the government; and yet this was not an absolute moral duty, but rather one growing out of the surroundings, and in some cases even something to be done merely to avoid offense. It was for this reason that Christ himself paid the temple tax, as we learn from Matt. 17: 24-27.

Civil government is not Christian, neither is it anti-Christian; it simply has no religious character, and, like other men, the Christian must live under it and is privileged to enjoy its protection.

Quietness and peace are essential to the enjoyment of life and liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness, which the Declaration of Independence enumerates as among those unalienable rights which governments are instituted to preserve. This truth is inculcated by the apostle when he exhorts that prayer be made for those who are in authority "that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty."

It follows as a logical conclusion from the principles laid down that the Christian's true attitude toward civil government is submission in all things civil; rendering to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's. But to do this, that is, to render to God that which belongs to God, he who would render it, must, in the things rendered to God, be absolutely independent of any human authority. In those things his allegiance must be to God alone. As a matter of history, we find that this has always been the attitude of the servants of God. This was the case with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who, for refusing to bow before the great image in the plain of Dura, were cast into the fiery furnace. It was also the case with Daniel, who, though prime minister of the empire, disobeyed a "law" of the king. It was also the case with Peter and John, who, when commanded by the magistrates contrary to the word of the Lord, answered, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we can but speak the things which we have seen and heard."

In all these cases the civil rulers sought to usurp authority which belonged alone to God, and the servants of God refused obedience and submitted to the punishment inflicted, protesting, however, against the injustice, and maintaining their innocence while declaring boldly their purpose not to yield to Cæsar the things that belong to God.

The same course was pursued by Christians until apostasy began to corrupt the primitive simplicity of the gospel. The followers of Christ ever yielded cheerful obedience to all in authority in all civil matters, but they went to the block and the stake rather than yield an iota of their soul-liberty. So persistent were they in maintaining individual responsibility directly to God, that their teaching upon this subject so permeated the Roman Empire that by the year A. D. 319, the most perfect religious freedom that ever existed under any government except our own, was granted in Rome, and was enjoyed by all, both pagans and Christians, until apostate Christians themselves sought to established in Rome a man-made theocracy and denied to others the very rights which only a few years before they had claimed for themselves. And in so doing they violated not only the principles for which they had formerly contended, but they set at nought the fundamental law of Christianity itself, as laid down by its Author: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
