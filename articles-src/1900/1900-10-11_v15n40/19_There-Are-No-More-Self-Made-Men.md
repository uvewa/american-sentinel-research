### At Least They Must Conceal the Fact if They Are and Claim High Descent.

"From the highest home to the lowest in America this idea of caste has entered, destroying our old, high ideals and making us pretentious and vulgar," writes "An American Mother," of "How We Can Lead a Simple Life," in the October *Ladies' Home Journal*. "The idle rich man covets high social place with a hunger that is both ridiculous and tragic. If he has money enough he buys a titled husband for his daughter. He tries to establish a precedence for himself over his neighbors by claims of high descent. Nor is this appreciation of rank confined to the leisured class in this country. It is universal. No candidate for office finds it necessary now to pose as a self-made man or to put his respectable ancestors out of sight. The self-made man is no longer the popular hero. On the contrary, noble ancestors are in such demand that if we do not have them we invent them as we do air-brakes or motors, or anything else necessary to our well-being and comfort. The rich American finds it as easy to have a coat-of-arms and a pedigree as to have a dress-coat. He seldom goes to Burke or the Heralds' College for these things. He plants and grows his own family tree as does his maple at the front door."
