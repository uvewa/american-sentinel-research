IN the Rock River Methodist Conference, sitting in this city October 5, Bishop Hartzell said that President McKinley should place the young emperor of China upon the throne and keep him there. Possibly the bishop did not take into consideration the size of the army that would probably be necessary to discharge what to him appears to be "only our plain duty."
