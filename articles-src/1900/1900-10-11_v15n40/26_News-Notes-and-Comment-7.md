A ROMAN Catholic paper charges that the new king of Italy, Victor Emanuel III., if not an out-and-out atheist is at least an agnostic or freethinker. It is also said that the queen has no real sympathy for the Catholic Church. "But, then," suggests an exchange, "anybody is an 'atheist' or 'freethinker,' from a zealous Catholic's standpoint, who does not concede the right of the Pope to temporal power."
