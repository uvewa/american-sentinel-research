A RECENT Methodist conference in the State of New York passed a resolution in favor of closing the Pan-American Exposition on Sunday. There is sure to be a strong effort made in this direction in due season. The agitation of the matter will afford an excellent opportunity to place the truth concerning the principles involved before tens of thousands of interested people.
