THERE is a possibility, if not a probability, of new and more stringent Sunday legislation in the State of Illinois at an early date. As noticed in these columns last week, an agitation is now being carried on for Sunday closing of business places in this city, and while persuasion has been the means employed thus far for its accomplishment, the natural tendency of such efforts is to seek recourse to legislation. This agitation has been conducted intermittently in this city for several years, and the failure to attain the desired end by moral suasion must strongly suggest to its promoters the expediency of securing legislation as the only way of accomplishing practical and lasting results.

Considerable prominence is given to the movement by the Chicago Record, which, in an editorial on "Seven-day Slavery," says:

"With few exceptions the members of the grocers', bakers', butchers', and milkmen's associations which are endeavoring to secure Sunday closing may count on the support of the public. The work in which they are now engaged has been prosecuted under discouraging circumstances for years, but its failure in the past has been due chiefly to the attitude of a few dealers and storekeepers who insisted on taking advantage of all opportunities for Sunday sales. These do not comprise a large proportion of the whole number, but the menace of their competition has broken the force of the Sunday-closing movement, the dealers in a given neighborhood being reluctant to shut their stores if thereby a considerable amount of trade is to be diverted to one or two competitors."

The Record argues in favor of Sunday closing as being necessary to prevent "slavery" among those affected by Sunday business. "Conceding," it says, "that a majority of those who are engaged in these industries desire a day of rest in the week, it is obviously unjust that they should be compelled to work on Sundays simply because a few of the number insist upon remaining open. Not only the store proprietors, but the employees have to be considered, and of these there are many in Chicago who now suffer the evils of seven-day slavery. The clerks who work hard from Monday morning until late Saturday night, only to resume their employment Sunday, getting only a short half-day for rest, and sometimes not even that during the week, have rights to be considered. On the whole, there are probably but few thinking persons among the consumers who would not willingly agree to make all the necessary purchases Saturday evening if they but stopped to consider what the Sunday purchasing habit entails upon thousands of hard-worked men and women."

The *Record* is entirely right in deprecating a week of continuous labor, but in its statement of the case it commits two errors. First, it designates as "slavery" work which is entirely voluntary, for neither shopkeeper nor clerk is forced to work on Sunday against his consent. Slavery is not voluntary work, but involuntary servitude. Second, it assumes that Sunday opening of stores is an invasion of personal rights, which is not true, since every person thereby employed has an undisputed right to Sunday rest: And here is an important point that should be noted: while Sunday opening of business places can never interfere with personal rights, Sunday closing, when it is by law, always does interfere with such rights. In the one case each individual is *free* to either work or rest as he may choose; in the other case he is *forced* to rest, be his choice in the matter what it may. In this as in every other matter the sole duty of the law is to preserve rights.

The *Record* hints, in conclusion, that legislation is being sought to suppress the few who have persisted in Sunday opening of their stores, thus securing an unfair business advantage, it is asserted, over those who would observe the day. It observes that "whether or not the advocates of Sunday rest succeed in securing legislation which will enable them to attain their aims they should be assured of the support of public sentiment. Seven-day slavery is obnoxious to American institutions and to American ideas as to what constitutes fair industrial conditions."

It is to be observed, finally, that this "seven-day slavery," which is so prominently put forward as an argument for Sunday closing, only balances up against a slight financial loss which might be incurred under the present optional arrangement. The storekeepers are not willing to close because they believe they might thereby suffer some pecuniary loss; so they remain in "slavery" because they are not willing to take the chances of making as large profits under the Sunday-closing plan as they make with Sunday opening, or are not willing to bear the small loss which might thereby be incurred. As an argument for legislation which would deprive people of the right to self-support by first-day labor, this attitude of storekeepers and other business men is clearly not entitled to much respect.
