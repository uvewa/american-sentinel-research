The secretary of the New England Sabbath Protective League, who has been active in Rhode Island for some time past, states that Sunday baseball and bicycle races have been prevalent there of late, and that "mass-meetings" have been held to awaken public sentiment against them. But public sentiment, which mass-meetings are supposed to reflect rather than to create, is evidently not opposed to these Sunday sports, since it is upon public patronage that they depend for success. The main trouble with the Sunday cause is that it affords no ground for an appeal to revealed truth.
