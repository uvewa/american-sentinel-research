An interesting incident is related by Rev. J. B. Wakley in his work entitled "Anecdotes of the Wesleys," which contains a rebuke to every Methodist preacher or any other who has and is becoming absorbed in politics (Christian citizenship movements). It reads as follows:

"Martin Rodda was an English preacher in America during the war, and by incautiously meddling with politics exposed himself to the displeasure of those in power. At a certain time he was brought before General Washington, who asked who he was. Rodda told him he was one of John Wesley's preachers. 'Mr. Wesley,' rejoined his excellency, 'I respect; but Mr. Wesley, I presume, never sent you to America to interfere with political matters, but to preach the gospel to the people. Now go and mind your own proper work and leave politics alone.'"

The rebuke given in the foregoing by General Washington should be prized not only because it was administered by him, but because it accords with the life and teachings of the Author of the gospel, for when asked on a certain occasion to occupy the place of a judge in dividing an inheritance between two brothers, he quickly replied: "Who made me a judge or a divider over you?" On another occasion, when he was going to be taken by force and made a king, "He departed again into a mountain himself alone." These incidents in the life of Christ stand as everlasting rebukes to any minister of the gospel who would leave his sacred calling and engage in politics.

The charge that the great apostle to the Gentiles gave to Timothy as he was embarking in the gospel ministry is another rebuke along the same line. Said the apostle: "No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier." May the rebuke of the father of our country, which is in harmony with these examples that have been referred to, not go unheeded. "GO AND MIND YOUR OWN PROPER WORK AND LEAVE POLITICS ALONE." K. C. RUSSELL.
