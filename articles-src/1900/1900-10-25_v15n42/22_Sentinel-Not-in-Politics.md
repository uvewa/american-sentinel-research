We shall be glad when the present political campaign is over and it again becomes possible to state a fundamental principle of just civil government, or even to refer to the Declaration of Independence, without being regarded as favoring one or the other of the great political parties. THE SENTINEL is not in politics and does not discuss any question from a political standpoint.
