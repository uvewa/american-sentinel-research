In the *Outlook* for October 6 appeared the following very pertinent inquiry from a reader of that journal—pertinent in view of the teaching of this leading American journal on the subject to which the inquiry relates:

"To the Editors of the *Outlook*:

"In yours editorial columns of September 15 you say: 'The *Outlook* does not believe that governments rest upon the consent of the governed.' May I ask, in this connection, upon whom or upon what you do believe governments justly rest? If the people do not and should not control in framing and maintaining the governments designed to rule over them, then it must be that the 'the divine right of kings,' or, what is the same thing, the right of a class, to rule is the true theory of government. Theoretically speaking, there is not a government under the sun, except dependencies, from a despotism to a republic, where the ruler did not get his power primarily from the people. It is true that in many instances the chosen ruler has usurped powers not originally granted, and on the ruins of a once free country founded a despotism; and this is the danger to all free people—is the greatest danger to America to-day."

To this the *Outlook* replied after the following manner:

"Just government rests neither upon the edict of a few strong men nor upon the consent of the many; it rests upon the law of God. No government is just which does not conform to the law of God. No edict of one, or few, or many or all can serve to make it just if it does not so conform."

In this strain the *Outlook* proceeded at considerable length.

Notice how the *Outlook*, in this reply, evades the question put by its correspondent. He inquires upon whom or what the editor of the *Outlook* believes governments "justly rest." The *Outlook* replies by defining the basis of "just government." The difference between the two is the difference between recognizing and ignoring the rights of the people. *Justly*, civil government must be by the consent of the governed, because the people have individually a natural right to do as they please, save that one must not infringe the rights of another; and civil government is bound to recognize this right. But if civil government does this it by no means follows that "just government" will be the result. It will be just in the sense of allowing civil and religious freedom; but in the broad, true sense of righteous, ideal government it will be as far from being just as the people are from being righteous. The only perfect government must be, of course, government which rests upon the only perfect law, which is the law of God; and this is "just government" in the broad, unqualified sense. So the *Outlook* can say truthfully enough that just government "rests upon the law of God." No one can say that government which rests upon the law of God is not just government. But at the same time it would be altogether *unjust* for men to attempt to institute civil government upon the basis of that law. God alone can set up a government upon the basis of his law, and he will do that when he shall have finished the work of gathering out from the world a people perfect in character—a truly "righteous nation"—to live under that government. That will be the ideal government, which is altogether impracticable in this far-from-ideal world. There can be no government of the people upon the basis of the law of God while the people themselves do not conform to the law of God. Here, the people have a right not to conform to the law of God, and it is by the will of God that they have that right. God gives every person the right to do wrong; for without freedom to do wrong there could be no development of character. So it is the will of God that civil government should protect all in the exercise of their natural rights; and civil governments "justly" rest upon the basis of the consent of the governed. This is as true in a Mohammedan or in any pagan country as in the United States.

But note the significance of the *Outlook*'s reply in the light of the work of the National Reform party and its allies. Civil government, says the *Outlook*, must rest not upon the basis of the consent of the governed, but upon the basis of the law of God. It says also in the same connection:

"History abundantly confirms De Tocqueville's sentiment, and disposes of the sentiment borrowed from Rousseau, that just governments rest upon the consent of the governed. * * This relic of an exploded philosophy is no better worthy of our reverence because it is found inserted in a parenthesis in the Declaration of Independence. An age which refuses to regard the Bible as a final and infallible authority will not consent to regard incidental phrases in the Declaration of Independence as final and infallible. Just government rests on conformity with the laws of God." (Italics ours.)

So then, in defense of the policy of foreign conquest—of government without the consent of the governed—the *Outlook* now boldly states just what the National Reform party have all along declared, and takes its position squarely with them in opposition to the system of government set up in the American Constitution.

This must indeed gladden the hearts of the National Reformers; they must rejoice exceedingly to see the American people thus ready to concede all that the National Reform movement has been contending for during the years it has been in progress. —to see the American Government thus being shifted from the basis of the Constitution, which they have denounced as "godless," to the basis of the Bible and the law of God, humanly interpreted, where they have all along wanted it. But it marks the end of civil and religious freedom, and the complete downfall of the rights of the people.

Such is the situation that exists in these United States to-day.
