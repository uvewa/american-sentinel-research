The following from the *Catholic Columbian* is going the rounds of the Catholic press:

"A young man of Elkhart, Ind., recently received from a brother, who is a soldier in the Philippines, a package of 'loot' which has a peculiar interest for Catholics. The package contains two richly gold-embroidered vestments, a silver figure about six inches long, which seems to have been taken from a crucifix, a rosary, a large iron key of distinctly foreign make, probably a church key. That the relics are genuine beyond doubt is proved by the fact that the package bears the approval of a commanding officer, Captain J. W. Porterfield, Company M, Thirtieth Infantry, U.S. V."

This item, which is rather too circumstantial to be wholly a canard, seems to bear out at least in part the reports of the looting of churches in the Philippines by American soldiers, notwithstanding official denials.
