Throughout all history those who have sought to usurp dominion over their fellows and to override the inalienable rights of men have in the last extreme resorted to one common excuse. When the mask has been torn from their designs and the baldness of their claims and usurpations placed even beyond dispute by themselves, they have never yet failed to come forward with the most miserable of all defenses and the last resort of the guilty. As long as possible they strenuously deny that they covet any unlawful dominion over their fellowmen. But when at last their claims are shown to be without warrant in reason or in justice, and it is made plain that they are attempting to bring men under their own unlimited and arbitrary authority, suddenly their position and line of argument is altered, and the language of philanthropy and benevolence flows from their lips in unceasing streams. They seem to overflow with love for the human race, and especially for that part of it over which they have been extending their usurpations. They consider it marvellous that no one has seen before that they are the very impersonations of goodness and benevolence. They wonder that people have been and are so blind as not to see that they are surcharged with all the blessings that the human race needs and craves; that it has been left to them to make the great discovery that in themselves the sources of freedom, of liberty, of justice, of civilization, and of every good thing that can lighten the heart and brighten the countenance of man, are so inexhaustible that they are fully capable of supplying all these things in abundance to all the people of the earth. They are so good! Their anxiety to obtain supreme control of men is that they may the more readily spread this goodness far and wide. The greatest blessing that can come to men is rule and control by them. They are too good to injure any one; it is so delightful, knowing that they have the power of life and death over people, to hug them with beneficent arms, and to pour upon them from the vessels filled under their own supervision, the oil of liberty and the annointment of civilization. The joy of this precludes all oppression; "we could not hurt anybody if we wanted to," say they.

Religious leaders who have sought "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority" in order to silence all dissent and to increase their power over men, have invariably set up this defense. "We are the successors of the prophets," say they. "We are too kind and too religious to hurt any one; our religion enjoins us to love men; we seek only the best interests of men. We are the friends of the workingmen; we desire to save them from the tyranny of Sunday labor. We are anxious for the preservation of property, and would save car-wheels from that rapid decay and dissolution that is sure to follow continuous revolution seven days in the week. We would close up everything on Sunday but the churches, because we would make it easy for men to do that which it is best for them to do. We desire to give men perfect liberty to do right, and to suppress everything that would injure their souls. Like Richard Baxter, we will tolerate everything that is in the right and prohibit only those opinions that are 'shockingly in the wrong.' Men may well trust to us their temporal and eternal interests; we are so good."

## A Hollow and Worthless Pretense.

The utter hollowness and worthlessness of this pretense of goodness by men holding arbitrary power over their fellowmen is brought plainly to view by the great French historian, Jules Michelet, in "An Historical View of the French Revolution." The following selection is from section IX, part II, of the Introduction:

"The illustrious Quesnay, physician to Louis XV. and to Madame de Pompadour, who lived in the house of the latter at Versailles, saw the king one day rush in suddenly, and was alarmed. Madame du Hausset, the witty femme de chambre, who has left such curious memoirs, inquired of him why he seemed so uneasy. 'Madame,' returned he, 'whenever I see the king I say to myself: There is a man who can cut my head off.' 'Oh,' said she, 'the king is too good!'

"The lady's maid thus summed up, in one word, the guaranties of the monarchy.

"The king was too good to cut a man's head off; that was no longer agreeable to custom. But he could, with one word, send him to the Bastille, and there forget him.

"It remains to be decided which is best—to perish by one blow or to suffer a lingering death for thirty or forty years.

"There were some twenty Bastilles in France, of which six only (in 1775) contained three hundred prisoners. At Paris, in '79, there were about thirty prisons where people might be incarcerated without any sentence. An infinite number of convents were subsidiary to these Bastilles.

"All these state prisons, toward the close of the reign of Louis XIV., were, like everything else, controlled by the Jesuits. They were, in their hands, instruments of torture for the Protestants and the Jansenists—dens for conversion. A secrecy more profound than that of the *leads* and *wells* of Venice, the oblivion of the tomb, enshrouded everything. The Jesuits were the confessors of the Bastille and of many other prisons; the prisoners who died were buried under false names in the church of the Jesuits. Every means of terror was in their hands, especially those dungeons whence the prisoners occasionally came out with their ears or noses gnawed away by the rats. * * *

"The lieutenant of police went from time to time to breakfast at the Bastille. That was reckoned as a visit—a magisterial supervision. That magistrate was ignorant of everything, and yet it was he alone who gave an account to the minister. One family, one dynasty, Chateauneuf, his son, La Vrilliere, and his grandson, Saint-Florentin (who died in 1777) possessed for a century the department of the state prisons and the *lettres-de-cachet*. For this dynasty to subsist it was necessary to have prisoners; when the Protestants were liberated their places were filled up with the Jansenists; next, they took men of letters, philosophers, the Voltaires, Frerets, Diderots. The minister used to give generously blank *lettres-de-cachet* to the intendants, the bishops, and people in the administration. Saint-Florentin alone gave away as many as 50,000. Never had man's dearest treasure, liberty, been more lavishly squandered. These letters were the object of a profitable traffic; they were sold to fathers who wanted to get rid of their sons, and given to pretty women who were inconvenienced by their husbands. This last cause of imprisonment was one of the most common.

## The Government of Grace.

"And all through good nature. The king was too good to refuse a *lettre-de-cachet* to a great lord. The intendant was too good-natured not to grant one at a lady's request. The government clerks, the mistresses of the clerks, and the friends of these mistresses, through good nature, civility, or mere politeness, obtained, gave, or lent, those terrible orders by which a man was buried alive. Buried—for such was the carelessness and levity of those amiable clerks—almost all nobles, fashionable men, all occupied with their pleasures—that they never had the time, when once the poor fellow was shut up, to think of his position.

"Thus the *government of grace*, with all its advantages—descending from the king to the lowest clerk in the administration—disposed, according to caprice or fancy, of liberty of life.

"Let us understand this system well. Why does such an one succeed? What does he possess that everything should thrive with him? He has the grace of God and the king's good grace. Let him who is in disgrace, in this world of grace, go out of the world—banished, sentenced, and damned.

"The Bastille, the *lettre-de-cachet*, is the king's excommunication.

"Are the excommunicated to die? No. It would require a decision of the king, a resolution painful to take, which would grieve the king himself. It would be a judgment between him and his conscience. Let us save him the task of judging, of killing. There is a middle term between life and death: a lifeless, buried life. Let us organize a world expressly for oblivion. Let us set falsehood at the gates within and without, in order that life and death be ever uncertain. The living corpse no longer knew anything about his family. 'But my wife?' 'Thy wife is dead—I make a mistake—remarried.' 'Are any of my friends alive? do they ever remember me?' 'Thy friends, poor tool, why, they were the persons who betrayed thee.' Thus the soul of the miserable prisoner, a prey to their ferocious merriment, is fed on derision, calumny, and lies.

"Forgotten! O terrible word! That a soul should perish among souls! Had not he whom God had created for life a right to live at least in the mind? What mortal shall dare inflict, even on the most guilty, this worst of deaths—to be eternally forgotten?

"No, do not believe it. Nothing is forgotten—neither man nor thing."

Thus was abundantly verified what has been said more recently, that "a government administered on arbitrary and irresponsible principles is to be judged not by the good deeds that a good man may do, but by the evil deeds that an evil man may do."

JOHN D. BRADLEY.
