Notwithstanding all the efforts put forth in Austro-Hungary even by the government itself to correct the erroneous impression, thousands and tens of thousands of people in that country still believe that the murder of Christians and the offering of their blood is a part of the Jewish ritual worship. It is charged by Count Von Hoensbroech, of Berlin, that "orthodox Protestant and the Ultramontane Catholic are zealously at work to make use of this lie to scare" the people, and to incite them to deeds of violence against the Jews. Count Von Hoensbroech is a member of one of the leading families of the German aristocracy. He was a member of the Jesuit order, but, dissatisfied with its principles, he left the order a few years ago. His brother is still a member of the Centrum, the Catholic or Ultramontane party in the German Reichstag.
