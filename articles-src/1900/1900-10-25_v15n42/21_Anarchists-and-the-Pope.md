It is said information has been secured by the police to the effect that Anarchists have condemned the Pope to death. These misguided men should remember that while they may kill Giacchino Pecci they can not kill the Pope. True, for a few days the papal chair would be vacant, but the papal system would survive, and while men die the Pope lives in the system.
