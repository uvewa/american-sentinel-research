In a lengthy review of a recent book, "The Evangelization of the World in this Generation," by John A. Mott, the *Sunday School Times* says:

"There is no lack of hindrances to the evangelization of the world in this generation. The un-evangelized are numerous and widely distributed, and in a few cases inaccessible. Oriental governments are suspicious, and so-called 'Christian powers' are most un-Christian in their treatment of alien races. Foreigners are frequently the leading source of corruption in Oriental cities."

This only emphasizes the folly of calling nations "Christian." There never has been and there never can be in this present world any such thing as a truly Christian nation.
