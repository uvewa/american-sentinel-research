The utter futility of attempting to establish the kingdom of Christ by political methods is clearly seen whenever the nature of that kingdom is understood.

The nature of the kingdom of Christ is clearly revealed in the Scriptures, not only by what is said of the kingdom itself, but by what is said of the subjects of that kingdom.

That Christ's kingdom is not a temporal, but an everlasting kingdom is plainly taught in the words of the angel to the Virgin Mary: "Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33. Of this same kingdom the prophet Daniel says: "In the days of these kings [the last earthly kingdoms] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, * * * but * * * it shall stand forever." Dan. 2: 44.

This latter text shows not only that the kingdom is eternal, but that its subjects are immortal, for "the kingdom shall not be left to other people." In this mortal state one generation passes off the stage of action and leaves its possessions to the succeeding generation; but in the immortal state it will not be so. "The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever." "The Lord knoweth the days of the upright; and their inheritance shall be forever." Ps. 37: 29, 18.

## New Testament Testimony.

Upon this subject the New Testament is, of course, in harmony with the Old. Said our Saviour, speaking of his future, glorious kingdom: "They which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection." Luke 20: 35, 36.

The words of our Lord show that the subjects of his glorious kingdom will, before inheriting that kingdom, be accounted worthy. This places that kingdom after the final judgment of "the great day." And with this agree the words of the apostle: "Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all sleep [that is, die], but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we [the living] shall be changed." 1 Cor. 15: 51, 52.

## The Hope of the Fathers.

As already seen from the quotations made from the 37th Psalm, the eternal nature of the kingdom of God was not a new truth, nor was it a truth revealed for the first time through the apostles, neither was the immortal nature of the subjects of that kingdom a new thought. As already seen, the psalmist had declared that they should "dwell therein forever," and in the Acts of the Apostles we learn that the "fathers" did not expect to inherit this everlasting kingdom in this mortal state, but that they looked to the resurrection as the time when they should enter upon the promised inheritance. When before the Jewish council Paul declared: "Of the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I called in question." Acts 23: 6. And again, when declaring his faith before Felix, he said: "This I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets; and having hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust." Acts 24: 14, 15. And, finally, before Agrippa, the apostle plainly declared his hope, the hope of the resurrection of the dead, to be the hope of the fathers; he said: "And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise of God made unto the fathers; unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?" Acts 26: 6, 7. The apostle's question, "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?" connects this unmistakably with his words already quoted from Acts 23: 6, and shows that the "promise of God made unto the fathers," could be fulfilled only by the resurrection of the dead.

## "If Ye Be Christ's."

The promise referred to by the apostle was the promise made to Abraham and to his seed, namely, "the promise that he should be the heir of the world." Rom. 4: 13. And that this was not a promise of a temporal inheritance to mortal men is made clear in the 11th chapter of Hebrews, for there we learn that those to whom the promise was made "all died in faith, not having received the promises [or, as one version has it, "the promised blessings"], but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth."

The promise was, as we have seen, the earth as an everlasting inheritance. The promise to Abraham was that he should be "the heir of the world." "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3: 16, 29.

So, then, every one who belongs to Christ is a joint heir with him to this world; not this "present evil world," sin-cursed and marred by violence, but as it will come forth the second time from the hand of the Creator, when in the presence not only of the assembled hosts of heaven, but of the throng of the redeemed as well, that promise shall be fulfilled: "Behold, I make all things new."

## How the Promise Will Be Fulfilled.

And this promise will be realized not by governmental action, but by the power of God, as graphically described by the prophet Ezekiel:

"The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: and I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

"Then said he unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus said the Lord God; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord." Ezk. 37: 1-14.

This promise is not to literal Israel, but to spiritual Israel. "Neither because they are the [literal] seed of Abraham, are they all children, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God, but the children of promise are counted for the seed." "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." "And so all Israel shall be saved."

So, then, the kingdom of Christ is an everlasting kingdom, and its subjects will be men and women saved by divine grace, and changed to immortality in that hour foretold by our Lord, wherein "the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live," and come forth glad in immortality. "And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away." Rev. 21: 4.
