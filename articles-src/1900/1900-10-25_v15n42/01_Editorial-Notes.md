God created men, but men make governments.

The divine law cannot be administered by men.

If Sunday is the American Sabbath it is not the Lord's Sabbath.

The king upon his throne has no greater natural rights than has the meanest subject in his kingdom.

The Lord does not ask civil government to deal with offenses against Him, "for God is judge himself."

It is blasphemous assumption for any civil government to arrogate to itself authority to reenact the divine law or any part of it.

The state can not stand between the divine law and the sinner in the day of judgment; therefore it it ought not to assume to put itself between the soul and God now.

Patriotism asks only equal rights; greed seeks special privileges.

The Christian must have faith in Christ; a state can not have faith, therefore a state can not be Christian.

Civil government can not be Christian, neither can it be anti-Christian while confined to its legitimate sphere; and since it can not be Christian it necessarily becomes anti-Christian the moment it takes on any religious character whatever.
