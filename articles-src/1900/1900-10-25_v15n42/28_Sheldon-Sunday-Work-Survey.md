THE Rev. Charles M. Sheldon makes the suggestion, in the interests of Sunday enforcement, that in towns and small cities "a corps of workers from different churches," or from "different Endeavor societies," "could gather statistics concerning the Sunday work being carried on" in all "departments of labor that could be found in the place," in order to see who is doing "necessary" and who "unnecessary" work on Sunday. The distinction between necessary and unnecessary labor is to be made "from a Christian point of view." He mentions that in one place where this suggestion was adopted it was found that out of 1,500 persons doing Sunday work, "at least 1,200" were doing work that was unnecessary. The possibilities contained in this suggestion when it is put into effect with a view of suppressing "unnecessary" Sunday work, are obvious. The courts would speedily be filled with discussions and arguments as to what work is necessary and what is not, and arbitrary lines of distinction between the two would be drawn by court decisions, while question is one that could never be satisfactorily settled. Such a question is not one with which the courts of law can properly or profitably meddle. Nobody wants a church committee to visit him and inform him as to what he may or may not do on Sunday as a work of necessity; but unfortunately there can easily be found people who would be pleased to serve on just such committees. Mr. Sheldon's suggestion will probably bear fruit in due time.
