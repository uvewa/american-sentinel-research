Official reports have been published in this country of the conviction by court-martial of two American officers for torturing Filipino prisoners at Mariguina. They were sentenced to be reprimanded merely. In passing upon the finding of the court, General McArthur said:

"It is obvious that a cruel and illegal assault was perpetrated by these accused officers upon certain native prisoners—an assault not only criminal in its effect under the laws of war, but in the remote consequences well calculated to inflict permanent injury upon essential interests of the nation. * * *

It is believed that the sentence of the court will be sufficiently executed by reminding Captain Brandle and Lieutenant Perkins that, by reckless defiance of the ethics of their profession, they have inflicted incalculable injury upon the interests of their country, and have also cast unwarranted aspersion upon the reputation of the United States army for sentiments of honor and humanity."

"We confess," says the Outlook, "that this sentence appears to us unwarrantably light. We hesitate to criticise without fuller knowledge, but it appears to us that a 'cruel and illegal assault' upon native prisoners inflicts a more serious blow upon the American cause than any act of cowardice, and on this ground, no less than upon the more sacred ground of humanity, deserves far more serious penalty than a mere reprimand."
