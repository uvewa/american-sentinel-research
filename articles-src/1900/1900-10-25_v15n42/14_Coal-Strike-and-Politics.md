Thinking a few days since that the efforts of one of the leading politicians of the country to settle the great coal strike had been successful, the Springfield Republican threw out these suggestions which are none the less pertinent because the supposed settlement had not been affected:

"Everybody believes that the successful ending of the great coal strike has been due to politics. Everybody believes, if everybody does not know, that if there had been no presidential election pending, this strike would have gone the way of most other strikes in recent years—the mine owners would have stood their ground, the strikers would have resorted to marching and intimidation to keep others away from the mines, the troops would have been called in, there would have been the usual collisions, and finally a rushing back to work in squads and the collapse of the strike. Indeed, troops were early called to the scene in this case, and there was marching and also the usual threatening demonstrations against those who remained at work, but from the time when the politicians took hold of the matter the troops appeared to lag superfluous on the scene, while the marching of the strikers went on without let or hindrance. Thus in the popular mind a precedent had been made, and it may prove a troublesome one to the party now in power. Strikers hereafter will begin to expect presidential interference on their behalf also, and if it is not forthcoming, woe then be unto that party among the votes of workingmen. Presidential campaigns especially are likely to become seasons of general strikes, which the party in power must settle in a satisfactory manner or take the consequences."

The very fact that this strike has been conducted as quietly as it has is evidence of the truth of what the *Republican* says. The strikers have not been less demonstrative than during former strikes, but through fear of jeopardizing the party in power the authorities have taken an entirely different course from the one pursued in the past; and it is not at all unlikely that should the strike continue until after the election threatening demonstrations against those who desired to work would no longer be permitted. The whole thing simply emphasizes one of the dangers which threaten popular government.
