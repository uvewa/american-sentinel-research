At a recent W. C. T. U. Convention at Downs, Kans., as noted by the Logan Republican, one of the questions discussed was "Shall the American Sabbath Be Preserved?" Strong ground was taken in favor of the legal enforcement of Sunday, but none of the speakers even attempted to explain the incongruity of coupling the words "American" and "Sabbath" together, thus making the term "American Sabbath."

As only the Lord has power to command men under penalty of sin there can certainly be no moral obligation resting upon anybody to pay any regard to the "American Sabbath." Indeed it is not clear that America has any "Sabbath" peculiarly her own.

There is, it is true, the Lord's Sabbath or the "Lord's day," as it is called in Rev. 1: 10, which is, as everybody knows, the seventh day of the week. But surely America has no claim on this day. Then there is the first day or Sunday, which came to us as an inheritance from the English Puritans, but it is no more American than a coat made in London, but worn in America, is an American coat.

But laying all this aside, and granting that it is well understood what is meant by the term the "American Sabbath," what right has America or any other country to have such an institution? If a weekly rest day is desired, why call it a Sabbath?

We all know something of the purpose of the Sabbath of the Lord. It was made for man, i.e., for all men, Americans as well as others, and was given to the race as a memorial of God's work of creation and of his rest at the close of creation week. But what has America done that deserves to be commemorated by a weekly Sabbath? And even if some event could be found that could be fittingly commemorated by a weekly rest, would it be just the proper thing for America to seize upon the Lord's idea and set up a counterfeit of his Sabbath, which must in the very nature of the case detract from the regard paid to His memorial?

But if it be said that the day so generally observed is called the "American Sabbath" only because it is the custom of Americans to observe it, then this name which is supposed by some to greatly add to the prestige of the day amounts to no more than saying that the thing is good and ought to observed because we Americans observe it.

Now, seriously, would it not be much better to drop all talk of the "civil Sabbath," the "American Sabbath," the "Christian Sabbath," etc., etc., and speak only of "the Sabbath of the Lord," or of "the Sabbath," as do the Scriptures?

But, then, to adopt this suggestion might result in confusion as to the day referred to, since, as before stated, in the Scriptures these terms always mean not the first day of the week, but the seventh day; and so we shall probably continue to hear these various qualifying words coupled with the word Sabbath, the use of which is, however, itself a confession that the day thus designated is not the Sabbath.
