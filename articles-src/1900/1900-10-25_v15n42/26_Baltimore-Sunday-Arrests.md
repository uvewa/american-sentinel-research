A RECENT letter from a representative of the International Religious Liberty Association who knows whereof he speaks says:

"The court records of the city of Baltimore, Md., U. S. A., show that from March 16, 1900, to October 2 of the same year, there have been 503 arrests for Sunday selling and four for 'Sunday labor' in that city. The first fifty of these defendants were declared guilty and were paroled, some on their own recognizance, others on bond of $100 each. Five out of this fifty have broken their parole and have been fined, two of them $25 and costs each, the others $25.50 each and costs. One person was fined $5 for 'Sunday labor.'"

Sixty-five cases were dismissed by the State; seven were reconsidered by the grand jury. The remainder of the original 503 remain still on the docket.
