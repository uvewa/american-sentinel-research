A SUBSCRIBER who recently secured a copy of the map of China, acknowledges its receipt in the following language: "Your fine map of China received, and certainly arrives at an opportune time, in view of the stirring, world-important events transpiring in that country. Please accept my hearty thanks."

This gentleman is one of several hundred persons who have received this map during the past three months, and like appreciation is entertained by hundreds of our subscribers.

Perhaps you anticipate securing the map, and, if so, we wish to state that it will be necessary to act promptly. Only a few copies remain, and since we shall not order a new supply, we shall cease to mention the map with this issue of THE SENTINEL. Hence your order should be sent at once in order to insure the delivery of the map.
