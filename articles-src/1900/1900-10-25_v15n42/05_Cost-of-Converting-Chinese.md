According to Pearson's Magazine, the conversion of one native Chinese costs about $450. Fifty years of missionary work on the part of the Protestant churches has resulted in the conversion of about 60,000 Chinese, at an annual outlay of $2,000,000, necessary to maintain the thousand missionaries so employed. The Roman Catholics lay claim to nearly 200,000 converts, but this number seems a trifle large. This preponderance of Catholics is due to a treaty negotiated by the French government by which Roman Catholic dignitaries rank equal with mandarins, governors of provinces, and other Chinese officials. While this does not bestow temporal power upon the clergy, it lends great dignity to them in the eyes of the office-worshipping natives.
