By the Rev. Henry S. Nash, D.D., in the Churchman.

By the danger of missions is not meant the peril of life and limb into which our foreign missionaries must from time to time run themselves. So far is that from being a real danger of missions that it contributes mightily to their health and well-being. The apostolic exhortation, "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you" (1 Pet. 4: 12), applies in full force to the foreign field. It is not strange that now and then in heathen lands heroic missionaries lose life in order to find it. It would rather be strange if nothing of this sort be-fell them.

The blood of the martyrs has always been the seed of the church. For the blood that the martyrs gladly shed expresses the depth of faith, the strength of will, and the exclusiveness of purpose which are the church's mainstay. Indeed, one is tempted in these days to think that missions have lost something of their nobility by reason of the telegraph, the steamship, and all those modern inventions that keep the missionary so near home and make escape from peril so easy. A foolish thought, no doubt. For the times and the occasions of our work are all in God's hand. Yet in our gladness over the escape of missionaries from peril, we need to remember that something far more precious than the lives of 10,000 Christians is at stake in the foreign field. The singleness and purity of the missionary motive is the great issue.

## The Danger Not Imaginary.

That the danger to foreign missions is very far from being imaginary, a glance at China will show. Nowhere else can the issue be made so plain. The storm-centre of our times is there. For a long while to come, the break-up of the old and the making of the new frame of life out there is sure to be one of the world's chief concerns. And since China is the one and sole heathen power which stands out against the influence of Christianity, somewhat as the Roman Empire stood out of old, it is the one place where the commercial and political and religious motives may most easily become confused.

"The flag" of one country or another has already, to all appearances, been substituted for the cross. The most flagrant case is the "monstrous cantle" that Germany has cut out of China as indemnity for the murder of German missionaries. It looks as if the old German law of fines for bloodshed had suddenly come to life in time to help out Germany's expansion. A Christian missionary is murdered, and the crime is paid for in land. The blood of the martyr is no longer, then, the seed of the church. It has just the same significance as the blood of a German soldier shed in Sedan. It helps on the glory of the Fatherland. The "flag" has stolen a march on the cross.

No matter whether such an action lies inside the range of America or not; and no matter what the church connections of the missionary may be, an affair like this touches us all. Is not the purity of the missionary motive in serious danger? It is certainly worth while to put the question.

## Keep the Cross Far From the Sword.

Let us clear our minds by going to the first sources of our religion. When our Lord permitted himself to be crucified, and when by his resurrection he authenticated and verified his death as God's deepest word to man, he purified and transformed the idea of God, cleansing it once and for all from the idea of force. Philosophy had not been able to do this. Neither was Judaism able. Even the prophets had not wholly succeeded. But the cross of Christ commended to men as God's greatest deed brought this to pass. Thus religion was taken out of politics. Before the Master died he took all pains to make clear the meaning of his death. "Put up they sword," he said to the apostle Peter, through whose veins the blood of the Galilean peasant and patriot ran hot. And he did not forget in his own agony and distress—he did not forget to touch and heal the ear that Peter's clumsy sword had wounded. He would not permit the spotless purity of the cross to be so much as touched by the finger-tips of force.

Our Lord, then, bids us see to it that in the missionary field the cross be kept far from the sword. In his own temptation he gloriously withstood the pressure put upon him by the Messianic ideal of his people. He refused to Cæsarize himself in the slightest degree. The church, imitating his life, comes from time to time under the same temptation which he met and overcame, and her word to herself should be: "Look to it that thou be not Cæsarized."

The apostolic age teaches us the same lesson. The noble Jewish legend regarding the Benedicite—that it was sung by the three children in the fiery furnace—is a true parable of the church's victory over the world. From the death of Stephen to the martyrdom of James, the bishop of Jerusalem, Christianity was in sore peril at the hands of the Jews. And no Christian ever dreamed of opposing force to force. From the days of Nero down many a persecution befell our religion at the hands of the heathen. And no Christian dreamed of drawing the sword. Happily there were no Christian "Powers" to deflower and degrade the purity of Christianity, no Christian "flag" to wrap around and conceal the cross. * * *

## "The Fifth Evangelist."

But when Christianity conquered the empire and became part and parcel of a great imperial establishment a tragical change began. Force commended itself to Christians as a fifth evangelist. Caesar patronized Christ. We all know how quickly a treaty of alliance was made between the orthodox faith and the power of the empire. The legionary undertook to make the splendid argument of Athanasius pointed and resistless. Constantine and his successors took the confutation of heresy to be a part of their province.

After awhile force came upon the field of missions. Charlemagne "converted" the Saxons with fire and sword. The Grand Duke of the Russians, having taken his religion from Constantinople, proceeded to club his people into the river that they might be baptized en masse. The "secular-arm" had come in to misrepresent and belie the news that the cross of Christ brought from God.

We look down upon the middle ages. We thank God that we no longer think of handing heretics over to the "secular arm," piously commanding the said "arm" to deal with them "without shedding of blood." But a brief study of recent events in connection with foreign missions may moderate our pride by suggesting that our Christianity is still entangled in that hideous confusion between the spiritual and the secular principles.

Our Government, whenever it has time and opportunity, presses upon Turkey the question of payment for the damage done to the property of American missionaries in Armenia. At first blush this strikes us favorably. It even thrills us to think of an American fleet in a quarter of the world where our flag has too long been unfamiliar. Bombard some Turkish port! Teach that pious liar, the sublime Porte, that he can not trifle with the lives and property of American citizens! But let us take a second thought. Might it not be better for American Christians to rebuild, twenty times over, the buildings which the "unspeakable Turk" has destroyed rather than make the "Oregon" and the "Kearsage" agents of the Lord Christ, of him who died for pure love of men? We do well to say that the deadliest error of Mohammedanism is its complete identification of church and state, its adulterous connection between force and religion, its perpetual alliance between the Koran and the scimiter. But is our shield altogether clean? Damages for missionary property destroyed, collected by the state, perhaps at the cannon's mouth! Is this the pure gospel of Christ?

## Example of Vicious Consequences.

The present situation in China has brought to light another striking example of the vicious consequences ensuing upon an unclear conception of the missionary motive. A recent letter, signed by many of the missionaries in China, urged upon our Government the duty of strenuous exertions in defense of all Americans in China. Thousands of letters from the friends and kinsfolks and supporters of missionaries have been sent to Washington to press the same duty. Just a little while ago a prominent official complained that the Government was expected to send a regiment or a battleship to defend every single merchant and missionary who might be in danger. Observe the fatal association—"merchants and missionaries." Men who have gone out in search of gain are put on a footing with those who have gone forth in search of souls. And apparently Christians at home will have it so, for with one voice they demand that the Government shall protect the missionaries. * * *

But are not our missionaries Americans? Are they not under the flag wherever they go? Is it not the bounden duty of America to protect them and all her citizens at all costs? Not so. Our missionaries go forth not as Americans, but as Christians. Their only flag is the cross. To demand of the state that it shall protect them by force of arms is to degrade and abase the missionary motive and to rob missionary efforts of their chief glory.

What a humiliating situation in China with English missionaries under the English flag, German missionaries under the German flag, American missionaries under the American flag, and so on. If the sublime Porte will but rouse himself and send one of his crazy warships to defend the Mohammedan missionaries in China—if there be any such—our shame will be complete.

The climax of tragic inconsistency is achieved when it is seriously asserted that the American forces should not leave China until assurance is given that the converts of American missionaries shall be protected. In this case the flag not only steals a march on the cross, but practically captures it. "Blood of the martyrs," indeed! A Chinaman converted by an American becomes in some sense an American—an American by brevet! And the "flag" must cover him! A short and easy way of laying heroic foundations for the future church in China.

America occupies a point of great vantage. Church and state are here so clearly separated that it should be easy for American Christians to clear their minds of the fatal confusion between the spiritual principle and the secular arm. It should be easy for us to see that we can better afford to lose many millions of missionary property and many thousands of missionary lives than to take a single step which shall lead the people of China to mix up the idea of force with Christianity, to confound Cæsar with Christ.
