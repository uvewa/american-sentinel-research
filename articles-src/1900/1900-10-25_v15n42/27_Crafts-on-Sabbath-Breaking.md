"CHRIST'S example teaches us that idleness as well as business is Sabbath-breaking," says the Rev. W. F. Crafts, in the organ of the New England Sabbath Protective League; and yet Mr. Crafts is laboring strenuously, as he has done for years, for the enforcement of the Sunday laws, which would compel people to spend the day he alleges to be the Christian Sabbath in idleness. "Sabbath-keeping," he says further, "requires such work as visiting the poor and sick and sinful, to do them good," and yet he would have the poor and sinful visited on the Sabbath by the police officer and dragged to the jail for doing honest work. It is very true that the Sabbath can not be kept by idleness, but demands activity in Christian work; in this Doctor Crafts speaks truly; but in this position he is altogether out of harmony with the idea of compulsory Sunday-keeping embodied in the Sunday laws. Honest work is always preferable to idleness, and if the poor and sinful are to be visited on Sunday, by all means let it be by some one seeking to do them good, and not by the policeman with his billy.
