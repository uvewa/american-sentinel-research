Kingston, N. Y., has fallen into line with the Sunday-closing movement. The order given out for the closing of all business places on Sunday was obeyed by the larger houses, but quite generally disregarded by the small shops and several arrests followed as the result. The Kingston Freeman gives this account of "the first arrest under the blue laws":

"Tuesday was a busy day in the recorder's court. Four cases were disposed of. The first case called was that of the people against Henry Butler. The prisoner was arraigned on a warrant procured by Charles Brock, charging him with violating the Sunday law. Brock claimed that on Sunday last Butler shined the shoes of a man at his place of business on the Strand. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined $3, which he paid."

"Who ever thought this would happen here in Kingston?" is the comment of a Kingston resident. Things are happening to-day which it was declared a few years ago would not be possible under this free Government, for the germ of such developments has been lying dormant; but not dead, in all the Sunday laws, however obsolete and apparently innocuous they may have seemed heretofore. The Sunday reform movement now in progress is causing these latent seeds sown far back in church-and-state times to spring up and bear the fruit of religious intolerance.

The city authorities of Kingston say that the Sunday-closing ordinance there will be strictly enforced.
