Mr. Edward Atkinson, editor of the *Anti-Imperialist*, has issued a final number of his paper, in which he expresses the opinion that the fight against imperialism is already won. Mr. Atkinson does not base his conclusion upon a conviction that Mr. McKinley will be defeated for re-election, but upon these assumed facts:

"1. The recognition of the fact that the conscience of the country has been stirred and will not permit warfare upon the people of the Philippine Islands to be continued.

"2. The physical condition of the army now in the Philippine Islands forbids a third campaign, even if the greater part of these troops were not soon entitled to be brought home and discharged.

"3. The present law does not permit new enlistments in excess of an army of about 28,000 men—no army bill can probably be passed before March 4. If such an act could be passed, no drilled force could be organized to take the place of the troops now in the East before their return, and, finally, even if the law should permit enlistments, the ghastly conditions of service in the Philippines are now so well known as to prevent the enlistment of few, but dead beats or degenerates."

The Springfield *Republican* takes issue with this view of the case, and think that imperialism will continue, which it doubtless will. The Word of God fortells that this nation is to go in the way of Rome, and it is now well started on that road. There will be no turning back.
