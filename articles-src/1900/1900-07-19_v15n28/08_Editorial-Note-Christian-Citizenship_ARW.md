Christians should hold their citizenship on high. A country is not safe till the citizens are seeking the Better Country. The supreme loyalty to one's fatherland is loyalty to one's Father in Heaven. As the spirit of mammon is the ruin of the land, so the spirit of other-worldliness is its salvation. It prevents undue wealth. It checks ambition. It avoids friction between worker and worker. It makes men faithful. It empties saloons and builds up homes.
