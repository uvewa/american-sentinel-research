In commenting upon the recent arrest and fining in North Carolina of a Seventh-day Adventist cripple for selling candy and peanuts on Sunday, the American Israelite says: "It is an acknowledged fact that these people are the best of citizens, noted for their temperance, industry and frugality. In almost every instance they have not been arrested because they were obtrusive in their Sunday labor, or in any way disturbed people who observed that day, but simply because they differ in their belief from the predominant Christian denominations. There is something besides anti-Semitism in this world."

Yea, truly there is "something besides anti-Semitism in this world,"—something radically wrong. It is the same spirit of intolerance that killed Cain, sold Joseph into bondage, crucified Christ, made millions of martyrs during the Dark Ages. And the end is not yet.
