It is stated that an order will soon be issued for the election of members of an assembly to form a constitution for Cuba. The apportionment will be on the basis of one member for each one thousand inhabitants. The chief justice of the island, two of the insular secretaries, the civil governor of Havana, and the rector of the University of Havana will sit in the convention with the elected representatives.
