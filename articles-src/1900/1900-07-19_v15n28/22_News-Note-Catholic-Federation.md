Some time since we made mention of the movement on foot for the federation of all Roman Catholic societies of this country. Recently Bishop McFaul, of Trenton, N. J., has taken occasion to urge that this be done. He says that the influence of such a union "should be felt in our State legislatures, and in the National Congress, whenever bigots attempt the invasion of our rights." Of course in the Bishop's view "bigots attempt the invasion of our rights" whenever any attempt is made to keep the Catholic Church from getting whatever she happens to demand. The Bishop says that the twelve million Catholics have no influence in the country proportional to their numbers, that few Catholics can get an office; while the sects are so united that if a legislature interferes with their smallest claim they besiege the legislative halls and frighten the lawmakers into submission. It is time, he says, for Catholics to "rush to the front," and awake from their torpor.

So far as the reports state, the Bishop did not distinctly state just what direction this new activity should take; but it has been suggested that one thing he had in mind was the American public school system—including the Indian schools. They are indignant that Congress should have decreed the end of appropriations for religious schools; they think it a great wrong to them.
