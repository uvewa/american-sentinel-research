The presence of a formidable army of U. S. troops in China, joining with the armed forces of Europe in putting down the "Boxer" movement and exacting satisfaction for the fearful outrages perpetrated in Peking, is to be looked for at an early date. It is reported that troops are now being dispatched from this country and from the Philippine islands, for this purpose. The United States will thus join the "concert of Europe" in China; but will it be as easy a matter to withdraw from that concert as to join it? Is it, in fact, a difficult thing to foresee a time in the near future when United States territory in Asia will lie side by side with that of the powers of Europe; so that American isolation from the territory of European nations, and from the political strifes of the Old World, will be a thing of the past?
