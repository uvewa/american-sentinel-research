The American Law Review is the leading law publication of this country. In its issue of May-June the American Law Review has an editorial that should be read by every American citizen. In this editorial the editor of the American Law Review paid an entirely deserved tribute to the character of the queen of England and concluded his remarks thus:

"Many of us feel that she is in a sense our queen, and whenever she wants the American boys to fight for her honor, or even for her political rights, they will embark or cross the Canadian frontier for that purpose in such numbers as will tax British resources to arm and equip them—every one of them 'spoiling for fight,' and they will acquit themselves as gallantly as their Canadian cousins have done in South Africa."

Is it not significant that such stuff as this should appear as an editorial in the leading law publication of America?

Does it not behoove the plain, everyday American to ask himself, "Whither are we drifting?"
