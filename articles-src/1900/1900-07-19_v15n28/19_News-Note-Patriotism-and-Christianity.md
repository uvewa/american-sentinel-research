"We are among those," says the Michigan Christian Advocate, "who believe that an intelligent and enthusiastic patriotism is included in our Christian religion."

If the Advocate is correct, then the Chinese Boxers must be, if not Christians at least "not far from the kingdom," for they are patriotic to the point of fanaticism.

Patriotism is a virtue only so far as it is love of correct principles. If it means no more than love of a certain portion of territory within certain boundaries, either natural or political, it is only an animal instinct, more strongly developed in some beasts and birds than in man. If it means love of the society and institutions of one's country, then it is a virtue only to the extent that that society and those institutions are worthy of confidence and support. Imagine intelligent patriotism in this sense, among the common people in Turkey, Italy, or Russia. It is impossible. But men may be just as truly Christian there as in the most favored lands. "Patriotism" is too often the sentiment of fools and the bulwark of tyrants.
