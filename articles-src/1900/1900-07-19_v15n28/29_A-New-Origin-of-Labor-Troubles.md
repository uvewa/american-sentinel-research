The editor of "Sunday Reform Leaflets" suggests a new cause of "labor troubles, strikes and riots." Strikes are not due to injustice and oppression on the part of employers, as many have mistakenly supposed, but to the low moral state of the working men, due to the general laxity of the Sunday laws!

When the labor forces come to understand this they will of course cease to strike for better wages, for the recognition of labor organizations, etc., and will strike only and always for Sunday laws that will hermetically seal everything on Sunday except the churches, prohibit the Sunday paper, and give free rein only to the Sunday preachers.
