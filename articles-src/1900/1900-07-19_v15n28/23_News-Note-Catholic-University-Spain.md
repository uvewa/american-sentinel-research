"Wearied by the useless waiting for assistance from the present government, the Catholics of Spain," says the Catholic Mirror, "have demanded from the ministry permission for the foundation in Madrid out of their own means of a purely Catholic university, similar to the one at Louvain, Belgium."

And this is just what the Catholics of Spain ought to have done in the first place. No government on earth ought to give one cent in any way either to found or to maintain sectarian institutions either educational or otherwise.
