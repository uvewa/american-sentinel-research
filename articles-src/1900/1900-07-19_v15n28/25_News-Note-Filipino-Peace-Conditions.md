At a recent meeting of leading Filipinos to consider the question of securing a satisfactory peace, a paper was prepared stating a number of conditions which they deemed essential to that end, one of which was the expulsion of the friars. Upon this point the whole assembly were unanimous and earnest. In the comments elicited by the incident the general opinion is expressed that the friars will be left undisturbed in their possessions.
