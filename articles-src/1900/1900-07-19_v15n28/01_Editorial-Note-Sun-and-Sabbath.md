The Creator gave the world only one sun and one Sabbath, and it is as possible to create another sun by legislation as another Sabbath, or to maintain one by legislation as to maintain the other. There can be only one day sanctified as the Sabbath in the same week,—only one day set apart from all other days as a day of rest. We must take the Sabbath institution as it comes to us from God's hands rather than from the legislature.
