Pastor Friedrich Naumann, who is a prominent figure in the ranks of practical Christian workers in Germany, has published a book on "Democracy and the Imperial Power," in which he shows that Christ's teachings furnish no rule for guidance in politics. Consequently the publication has produced "a deep and disappointing sensation" among those within the circle of his influence, who were looking for an opposite view to be set forth. "The author," we are told, "has been one of the most active representatives of the Christian Socialist agitation, which has seen in the application of the teachings of Christ to the social and political problems of the day the panacea for all the ills that affect humanity." Now the former "Christian Socialist" has withdrawn from the position he held as such touching the application of Christ's teaching to politics, and states the conclusion at which he has arrived, in these words:

"Jesus Christ was not a politician. The attempt has often been made to extract from the never-failing fountain of his Word the rules that should control political thought and action. Protestants, too, have made such attempts, and in former years the author of this book has joined in these efforts. But the result of all these studies has been the conviction that the moral ideas of the Master are of such a general character, being intended for application to all manners and conditions of men, and are so purely ethical and abstract in their nature, that they do not furnish a guide to conduct in specific cases nor answer such questions as, What should be our politics in the period of industrialism, or our attitude toward social democracy, or even toward aristocracy? Jesus thereby does not decrease in value for us; but we are not able to deduce our political tactics from him."

"Jesus Christ was not a politician"; that states the whole truth of the matter in a nutshell. And because he was not a politician, he did not enter into the arena of political strife, and his words and example furnish no rule by which to guide political activity. And as the life of Christ is Christianity, now as well as nineteen centuries ago, it follows that Christianity knows nothing of politics. The aims of Christianity are not to be attained by political means. Christ's kingdom is not of this world.

We commend the results of Pastor Naumann's study of this subject to all those in this country who are trying to set up the kingdom of God or establish righteousness in the earth through political reform parties or by any political agency. An earnest and candid investigation of the question in the light of the words of Jesus Christ, will, we trust, be the salvation of many from one of the most dangerous of modern delusions.
