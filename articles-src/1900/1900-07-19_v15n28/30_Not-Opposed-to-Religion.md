The writer is not opposed to religion, but is most decidedly opposed to any and all attempts to force religion upon anybody; and that is the real design of Sunday legislation.

Everybody ought to be religious. Everybody ought to keep the Sabbath. Everybody ought to go to church. Everybody ought to help to support the gospel. But nobody ought to be compelled to do any nor all of these things. The gospel is not force, but love. It does not drive men, but beseeches them. It does not threaten punishment, but offers pardon from a penalty already incurred. In all of which the gospel of the Son of God is very unlike the gospel of the legally enforced Sunday.
