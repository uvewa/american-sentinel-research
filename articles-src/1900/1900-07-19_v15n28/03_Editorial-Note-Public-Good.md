Because a certain thing may be clearly for the public good, it does not follow that its enforcement should be attempted by law. Most people will admit that the extension of Christianity is clearly for the public good, but few would advocate its promulgation by legislation. It is clearly for the public good that men should regard the laws of health, but here again law is powerless to secure the end desired. And so in a multitude of other cases.
