The Sunday School Times has a note which states a truth that should be borne in mind by every Christian. It is this: "If we could only present Christ as he really is, how surely men would be drawn to him without the pressure of our clumsy urging! Says Mr. Sankey, out of his lifelong experience, 'People come to Christ, I find, in a very simple way.' Not through argument or persuasion, so much as through simple presentation of Christ as he is, do men accept him."

Of course that which is true of "the pressure of our clumsy urging," is doubly true of our brutal attempts to compel.
