The Illinois State Epworth League, in session last week at Peoria, very sensibly tabled, with only one dissenting vote, a motion to send a telegram of greeting to President McKinley. The fact that the President of the United States is a member of some church should give that church no mortgage on him as a public official; nor should it give the President any mortgage on the vote of the denomination to which he belongs. The League did itself credit.
