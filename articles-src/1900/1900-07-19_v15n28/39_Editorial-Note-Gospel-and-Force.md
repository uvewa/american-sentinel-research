"The popular fury," says the Catholic Mirror, "which has broken loose in China is expected by some to advance the cause of Christianity and civilization by the opening which it affords to the nations of the West to divide and conquer. Had the dealings of these same nations with the heathen empire been founded upon principles of equity and justice, religion might have had opportunity to diffuse itself by its own sweet pervasive way, instead of relying upon armed force for an ineffectual conquest."

Nothing is more true than that the progress of the real gospel has been hindered rather than helped by appeal to force. It is true that conquest has opened the way for missionaries to go where they could not otherwise have gone. But were not the very obstacles which have been removed by force, due in the first place, in very large measure, at least, to the use of force?

The first missionaries of the cross had absolutely no human power to which to appeal for protection. They were not followed by traders greedy of gain. No "Christian" nation stood ready to annex the territory they penetrated. The ships that carried them to foreign lands in their cabins did not have their holds filled with death and destruction in the form of intoxicating liquors. These are a few of the things that have hindered the progress of the gospel far more than armed force has ever helped it.
