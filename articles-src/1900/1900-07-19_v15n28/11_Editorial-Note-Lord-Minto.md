Recently, Lord Minto, Governor-General of Canada, was in Toronto on Sunday. According to newspaper reports, early in the day he attended service at St. James Cathedral, and after that entertained guests at lunch. When the time for Lord Minto's departure arrived a guard of honor, consisting of the Forty-eighth Highlanders, with their band, escorted the viceregal party to the train, which left Sunday evening for Ottawa.

"The circumstance," it is said, "has caused much pain among the strict 'Sabbath-loving' people of Canada. Rev. Dr. Milligan, pastor of St. Andrew's Presbyterian church, took occasion to administer a rebuke from the pulpit, and in many quarters Lord Minto's action has been condemned."
