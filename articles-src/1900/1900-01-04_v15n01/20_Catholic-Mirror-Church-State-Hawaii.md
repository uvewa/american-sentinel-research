The Catholic Mirror mentions that this question is being agitated in ecclesiastical circles in Hawaii: "When the United States absorbs a smaller State, as it absorbed or annexed Hawaii, does a church existing in the smaller State necessarily become a branch of or a part of a similar ecclesiastical organization in the larger or absorbing dominion?" And the Mirror inquires, "If so, is not this dangerously akin to the pernicious doctrine of the union of church and state?"

It is amusing to note how both the Catholics and the National Reformers hold the union of church and state to be "pernicious" when it is something else than the union they are working to secure.
