## How to Compel a Man to Keep the Sabbath.

BY A. F. BALLenger.

Many ministers are giving their whole time to the work of influencing legislators, executive officers, to make and enforce laws compelling men to observe Sunday. All this is worse than lost time. Civil law never made a Sabbath-keeper. The Sabbath law is spiritual. Civil law is not spiritual. A carnal law cannot bear spiritual fruit. There is a way to make real Sabbath-keepers out of Sabbath-breakers. Here is the way it is done.

A minister was preaching the gospel in a Maryland town. There was in the audience a very wicked man. He was a slave to tobacco and whiskey. His hair had grown gray in sin. His sins had separated him from his family, and he was living a hermit's life in a little shanty on the bay.

At the close of the gospel sermon a call was made for men and women to forsake their sinful ways and turn to the Lord. Those who desired that prayer be offered for them were asked to raise their hands. This wicked man, this Sabbath-breaker, raised his hand. When these sinners were asked to surrender all to God and kneel down and unite in prayer for the forgiveness of sins, the wicked Sabbath-breaker knelt down. In less than five minutes the wicked Sabbath-breaker was converted into a new man. In less than five minutes the wicked Sabbath-breaker became a Sabbath-keeper. When he arose from his knees he had accepted into his life the Spirit of the great Sabbath-keeper, Jesus Christ. This wicked man did not come to the meeting expecting to become a Sabbath-keeper, but he heard the truth preached with compelling power and he yielded to its influence and became one.

After the meeting he said: "My tools were all sharpened ready to go to work to morrow (this was Friday night) but to-morrow is the Sabbath, and I am going to keep it." This man was baptized and joined the church. He was reunited with his family, and a happy home resulted. Some weeks later an unconverted son remarked to the writer that there was a great change in their home; another unconverted boy declared that since father was converted their home was like heaven. This is the way Sabbath-keepers are made. Every other process will fail. "The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Why then attempt to compel the carnal mind to be subject to the law of God when the Spirit of God says it cannot be done? But "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus," received into the heart of a Sabbath-breaker will destroy the carnal mind and set him "free from the law of sin and death" so that the "righteousness of the law" can "be fulfilled" in him. What the world needs and what Sabbath breakers need is not "the law of a carnal commandment" but "the power of an endless life,"—"the power from on high"—the Holy Spirit. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts."
