## Already They Ask for a Million Dollars.

The Sentinel some time ago called attention to the probability of a demand for indemnity by the Catholic Church upon the Government, for damage to church property caused by the war in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. From the following, which appeared in the Pittsburg Catholic, of November 29, it appears that this demand has begun to be made:

"The church authorities, represented in this country by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Chapelle, the papal delegates to the Philippines, have taken steps to get pay from the United States Government for the damages done church property by American troops in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. They have retained Dr. Jose Ignacio Rodriguez, of Washington, to represent the church.

"Dr. Rodriguez, who already represents Cubans and Spanish who have claims against this Government for millions on account of the Spanish war and the Cuban insurrection that preceded it, has had a number of interviews with Secretary Root, with whom he has filed several dozen separate claims.

"Secretary Root, it is asserted, agrees with Dr. Rodriguez, that this Government is liable for the damages caused either by the few acts of vandalism and the many acts of occupation of convents and hospitals which have been done by direction of American officers.

"Dr. Rodriguez will present a claim for rent for the occupation by American troops of a convent in Havana. The soldiers have been using this building, which, under the terms of the treaty of peace, is the property of the congregation which supports it, for many months without paying rent.

"There is a question whether the debts so contracted will have to be paid by this Government or by the Cuban republic which is to be organized.

"There is no question but that the occupation of the churches in Puerto Rico and the Philippines will have to be paid for. These islands are United States territory, to all intents and purposes, and there is no dispute but that if American troops should occupy a church in one of the States of the Union, the United States would have to pay the owners for it. The question will probably be referred to in Secretary Root's report with a recommendation that the court of claims be given jurisdiction to decide what shall be a just compensation. The claims filed amount to more than $1,000,000."
