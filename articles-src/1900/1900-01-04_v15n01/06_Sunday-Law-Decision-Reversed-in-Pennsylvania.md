## Sunday Law Decision Reversed in Pennsylvania.

Ariel, Pa., Dec. 25.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:—In August last David Edwards caused S. B. Field, a Sabbath keeper and now a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church here to be arrested for binding and drawing oats on Sunday, a notice of which appeared in the SENTINEL, of August 17.

The justice decided against Mr. Field and fined him $4 and costs. Mr. Field's lawyer appealed the case to the County Court. Last week the judge reversed the decision of the justice, thereby clearing Mr. Field.
