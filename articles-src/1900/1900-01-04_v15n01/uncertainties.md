# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, January 4, 1900 (v15n01)

## General Notes

This issue was processed from a Mistral OCR dump. The OCR source was generally clear and high quality. The following items were noted:

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "The New Interpreters of the Constitution"
- **Item:** The text reads "Archbishop Chapelle who is Apostate Delegate to Cuba" — this appears to be an OCR error for "Apostolic Delegate." The word "Apostate" is preserved in transcription as it appeared in the OCR, but this is almost certainly a misreading of "Apostolic."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Apostate Delegate" (as in source)
- **Confidence:** LOW — very likely OCR error for "Apostolic Delegate"
- **Reason:** "Apostate Delegate" is not a recognized ecclesiastical title; "Apostolic Delegate" is the correct term used elsewhere in this article and throughout the period.

### Page 10, Article "Subsidizing the Church of Rome"
- **Item:** The text reads "we are unable to see that the complainant is his bill shows that the corporation is of the kind described" — this appears to contain a grammatical error in the original, possibly a typographical error for "that the complainant in his bill shows."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "we are unable to see that the complainant is his bill shows that the corporation is of the kind described" (exactly as in source)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — preserved as printed; likely a typographical error in the original 1900 text
- **Reason:** Accuracy requires preserving the original text as printed, even if in error.

### Pages 14/16 (Editorial Column)
- **Item:** The editorial column content on pages 14 and 16 appears to be identical duplicate content in the OCR dump. This is consistent with a dual-page editorial column reprinted or a pagination artifact. Only one set of editorial column items was transcribed.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Single set of editorial notes (articles 26-33)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the duplication is an OCR/scanning artifact, not two separate editorial columns.

### Article Attribution (pages 4-5): "How to Compel a Man to Keep the Sabbath"
- **Item:** Author listed in OCR as "BY A. F. BALLenger." — the mixed capitalization (capital L mid-name) appears to be a printing artifact or OCR artifact for "A. F. Ballenger."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "A. F. Ballenger" (corrected to standard form)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — A. F. Ballenger (AFB) is a known author in this publication.
