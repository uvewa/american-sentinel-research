## Christmas and "Peace on Earth."

*"The Union Signal," Dec. 1899.*

To-day, the two nations representing the highest type of civilization, the two nations to whom have been granted such marvelous opportunities for knowing and applying the principles of Christianity, are each engaged in an aggressive war; a war with a people weaker than themselves; a war for the extension of territory and the acquisition of material gain. Surely there must be an undertone of irony as well as of woe in the Christmas carols of both England and America in this year of our Lord, 1899.

But the red-handed war upon the field of battle is not the only warfare which is being carried on in our nation and throughout the world. Indeed, there is a profound sense in which that may be called a "peaceful war" when it is compared with the industrial and economic warfare in which well nigh every human being, wittingly or unwittingly, is compelled to take a part.

Think of the cornering of industries in the hands of the few while thousands trained to gain a livelihood by means of those industries are persistently kept out of work. See how the very first right which each human being should be able to claim—the right to work—is denied to multitudes, lest through "over-production" there should be a lessening of the enormous receipts of the few. We starve in this country because of "over-production!" Is not that the devil's own logic?

Read a paragraph or two gleaned almost at random from some of the leading papers of the land: "Gatling guns are the means to cure striking mobs." "The simplest plan, probably, when one is not a member of the Humane Society, is to put strychnine or arsenic in the provision furnished to tramps. This is a warning to other tramps to keep out of the neighborhood."

"If workingmen have no vote they might be amenable to the teachings of the times."

"There seems to be but one remedy and it must come—change of ownership of the soil and a creation of class land-owners on the one hand and of tenant farmers on the other—something similar to what existed in the older countries of Europe."

And this in Christian America! And this in "God's last experiment with humanity!" And this in "the land of the free!" Surely to one who has eyes to see and ears to hear, the Christmas chimes must often sound like a great wail rising from the depths of a sorely disappointed humanity. They must mean the crying of Peace, Peace, when there is no peace.
