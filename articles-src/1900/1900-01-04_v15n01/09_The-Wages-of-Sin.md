The Wages of Sin.—The story is told of a young man who was addicted to the cigarette habit. He had smoked 1,200 packages, and wrote to the manufacturers to know what they would give for the 1,200 pictures that had come with the cigarettes. The answer of the manufacturers was right to the point—"Smoke 1,200 more and we will send you a coffin."
