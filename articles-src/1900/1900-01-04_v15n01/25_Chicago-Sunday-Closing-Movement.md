A MOVEMENT for Sunday closing is reported under way in Chicago. The News, of that city, observes that "Chicago has an unenviable fame as regards its observance—or rather, lack of observance—of Sunday;" and it is equally indisputable that Chicago's reputation as regards morality is not an enviable one. But no city ever falls so low in the moral scale as to be beyond the reach of a Sunday closing movement.

The movement seems to be proceeding along purely selfish lines, and hence does not call for any profession of regard for the religious welfare of the inhabitants. It is a matter of business between the associations of grocers, butchers, bakers, etc. The clerks in grocers' and butchers' shops have to work early and late through the week, and Sunday work in addition to this is too much; so these associations are going to settle the matter of Sunday work by voluntary agreement in favor of Sunday closing. If any members refuse to close on that day, they will—according to precedent—be prosecuted under the Sunday law; not because of any religious regard for the day, but because such action is considered unfair to the others and a proper cause of discipline by the trade unions.

Very much of the sentiment for Sunday closing rests upon this basis; but it works to the same end as that sought by those who would unite church and state.
