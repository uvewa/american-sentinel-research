THE idea that the kingdom of God is to be set up on the earth through the agency of earthly governments, is a strange as well as a dangerous delusion. Several portions of Scripture speak very plainly upon this point. One is the prophecy of Daniel 2, in which a stone (the kingdom of God) smites the great image (earthly kingdoms) upon the feet and sweeps the whole image away like chaff, and becomes in its place a mountain filling the whole earth. Another is the prophecy of Revelation 19, which portrays the coming of Christ to the earth to set up his kingdom, and declares that at that time the kings of the earth and their armies will be gathered together to make war against him, and will be overcome and slain. The prophecy of Psalms 2 is equally plain: "Thou [Christ] shalt rule them [the heathen and uttermost parts of the earth] with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."

A rude ending it is to the dream of world-wide peace and righteousness to be established by the "benevolent assimilation" of the earth by the "Christian" nations; but it is what time is destined to bring forth, as certainly as that the Word of God is true. And as this is the truth, to entertain the other and more popular view is to follow a delusion which leads only toward destruction.
