## Servitude Under Our Flag.

*New York "World."*

HAWAII is now a part of the United States. The Constitution of the United States forbids "slavery or involuntary servitude, except for crime," in any territory controlled by this country.

Yet in Hawaii there are 100,000 men held in involuntary servitude, and the act annexing the islands provided for a continuation of this unlawful condition of things.

The American Federation of Labor in session at Detroit has entered protest by unanimous vote. Its action is timely and necessary. If it were true, as asserted, that the Hawaiian sugar plantations cannot be successfully worked without some form of slave labor, then the Hawaiian sugar plantations should be left to grow up in weeds.

No "interest" on the face of the earth can compensate for slavery. No consideration of gain can justify or excuse involuntary servitude. Better a wilderness anywhere than a land fructified by the sweat of slaves.

But it is not true that the sugar plantations cannot be cultivated without slave labor. The like was said of our Southern cotton fields. Yet never in the history of slavery did those fields produce more than one-half the cotton crop that they now yield from free labor every year.

Our first national duty is to make an end of the bondage of men wherever our flag floats, whether in Hawaii or Sulu.
