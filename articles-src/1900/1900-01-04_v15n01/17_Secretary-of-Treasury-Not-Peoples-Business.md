THE Secretary of the Treasury was quoted recently as saying, when asked for an explanation of some financial dealings between himself as agent of the Government and a certain bank, that it was wholly a matter between the Government and the bank, and did not concern the people at all. If this is so, then it must be that the Government has come to be something apart and distinct from the people, so that the concern of the one is not the concern of the other; and it is time for a new definition of government in the United States.
