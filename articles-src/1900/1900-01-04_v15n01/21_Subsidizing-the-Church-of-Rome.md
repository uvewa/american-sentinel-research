## Subsidizing the Church of Rome.

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: I inclose a copy* of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States determining the law of eleemosynary corporations and sectarian appropriations. I wish to call special attention to the sentence, "All that can be said of the corporation itself is that it has been incorporated by an act of Congress, and for its legal powers and duties that act must be exclusively referred to." And again, "In respect too, of its creation, organization, management, and ownership of property, it is an ordinary private corporation, whose rights are determinable by the law of the land, and the religious opinions of whose members are not subjects of inquiry."

This shows how wise President Madison was in refusing his assent to a bill making a church an ordinary private corporation. He used the veto power to defeat a bill to incorporate a church in this district on two grounds:

1. "Because the bill exceeds the rightful authority to which governments are limited by the essential distinction between civil and religious functions, and violates in particular the article of the Constitution of the United States which declares that 'Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.'"

2. "Because the bill vests in the said incorporated church an authority to provide for the support of the poor and the education of the poor children of the same; an authority which, being altogether superfluous if the provision is to be the result of pious charity, would be a precedent for giving to religious societies, as such, a legal agency in carrying into effect a civil and public duty."

One week afterward another bill was vetoed by him. The latter provided "that there be reserved the quantity of five acres of land, including Salem meeting-house, in the Mississippi Territory, for the use of the Baptist Church at said meeting-house." He refused to approve it: "Because the said bill, in reserving a parcel of land of the United States for the use of said Baptist Church, comprises a principle and precedent for the appropriation of funds of the United States, for the use and support of religious societies, contrary to the Article of the Constitution which declares that 'Congress shall make no law respecting a religious establishment.'"

These two cases of contemporaneous construction of the Constitution by the very man who wrote the First Amendment are only casually referred to by the Supreme Court, and then only as if they were the effusions of an ignoramus; for the court says that the phrase "a law respecting a religious establishment" is not synonymous with that used in the Constitution, which prohibits the passage of a law "respecting an establishment of religion." But clearly the men who framed the Constitution regarded it as synonymous. Many of them were in Congress when Mr. Madison's veto messages were discussed and sustained by that body; and no such criticism as that now made by the Supreme Court was made by any one at that time. They supposed the First Amendment to prohibit all interference or meddling with religion, either in the abstract or in the concrete. Alexander Hamilton had defined the phrase "an established religion," to be "one with regard to the support of which the law is active and provident;" and the only difference between an established religion and an establishment of religion is a mere participial difference, referable only to the category of time, and not to substance, or quantity, or quality, or place, or action, or passion, or possession.

There is no logical opposition between the two phrases at all. If framed into propositions they would stand opposed neither as contraries, subcontraries, contradictories, nor subalterns. There was no "established religion" of the United States when the First Amendment was passed by the First Congress; and that body, supported by the whole American people, solemnly determined that there should be no "establishment of religion" in futuro.

The first great struggle between political parties after the adoption of the Constitution arose over the construction of the First Amendment, in consequence of the alien and sedition laws. This struggle gave rise to the Virginia Resolutions, written by Mr. Madison in 1798, in defense of the freedom of conscience and of the press. Then the attack had been made on the freedom of the press, but it was declared that the freedom of conscience was equally endangered, and hence the whole nation was aroused. Sections 6 and 7 of these resolutions show conclusively that the State and people of Virginia never could have intended to delegate to Congress the right to take money from any citizen of that State to be applied in the propagation of opinions which he disbelieved; and that they were determined to maintain the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment at all hazards. These two sections are as follows:—

"6. That this State, having by its convention which ratified the Federal Constitution, expressly declared that, among other essential rights, 'the liberty of conscience and the press cannot be canceled, abridged, restrained, or modified by any authority of the United States,' and from its extreme anxiety to guard these rights from every possible attack of sophistry and ambition—having, with other States, recommended an amendment for that purpose, which amendment was in due time annexed to the Constitution—it would mark a reproachful inconsistency and criminal degeneracy if an indifference were now shown to the most palpable violation of one of the rights thus declared and secured, and to the establishment of a precedent which may be fatal to the other.

"7. That the good people of this Commonwealth having ever felt, and continuing to feel, the most sincere affection for their brethren of the other States, the truest anxiety for establishing and perpetuating the union of all, and the most scrupulous fidelity to that Constitution, which is the pledge of mutual friendship and the instrument of mutual happiness, the General Assembly doth solemnly appeal to the like dispositions in the other States, in confidence that they will concur with this Commonwealth in declaring, as it does hereby declare, that the acts aforesaid are unconstitutional, and that the necessary and proper measures will be taken by each for co-operation with this State in maintaining unimpaired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved to the States respectively or to the people."

Now, if the Constitution is to be construed and administered at all times according to its meaning and intention when it was framed and adopted, where is the justification for acts which violate the freedom of conscience by taxing the people of the several States—compelling them to furnish contributions of money—for the propagation of the religious opinions of the church of Rome? Let the advocates of popery and arbitrary power answer this. Let them say whether the policy of subsidizing the church of Rome does, or does not, subvert both the general principles of free government and the particular organization and mandatory inhibition of the Federal Constitution? But are we subsidizing that church? Let us see.

In his history of the Catholic Church in America (p. 489), O'Gorman says:—

"A complete history of the religious orders would be of the highest value, for their history is the history of Catholic education and charities. Our parochial schools, colleges, academies, and charitable institutions are in their hands." If this be true, is not a subsidy to the institutions owned and conducted by these orders unconstitutional? Are not all contracts made by the Government with them or their representatives unconstitutional? Do they not compel men to make contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which they disbelieve? And are they not therefore sinful and tyrannical? Jefferson spoke of taxation for such purposes as "unrighteous compulsion," and as "spiritual tyranny" (1 Jeff. Works, pp. 36–37).

I may supply other contemporaneous authorities in a future article. For the present I close.
