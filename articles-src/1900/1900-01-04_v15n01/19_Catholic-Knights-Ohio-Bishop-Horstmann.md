RECENTLY there was a convention of the Catholic Knights of Ohio in Delaware, O., at which a "ringing speech," says the Catholic Mirror, was made by Bishop Horstmann. The purport of the bishop's speech was that Catholics in America ought to unite to secure greater prominence in politics. At the same time he said, "We thank God that we are the only church that has kept out of politics."

He pointed to the record made by four leading Catholics in the German parliament: "Why—those four men brought Bismarck with all his blood and iron down to their feet (applause). They stirred up all Germany; and you know to-day that King William has to hold out his hand to the Catholic Centrum, or otherwise he cannot hold his power. They thought the last election would settle it, but the Catholics sent back not only their own power but increased it by ten. They have now a surplus of one hundred and thirteen, and nothing can be done without their consent. That is what united Catholic Germany can do."

And the like of this is just what the bishop wants "united Catholic America" to do in the United States. And yet the Catholic Church would not for anything go into politics! He even "told President McKinley once that if a priest should preach politics he would be signing his own death warrant!"

And this conception of the nature of politics and of what constitutes going into politics, is not at all confined to this bishop or to the Catholic Church. It is a Catholic conception that has come to be generally held by Protestants. But the truth is that any church goes into politics just to the extent that its members go into politics; for in politics a church member is not separated from his religion.
