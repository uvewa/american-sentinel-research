The London Daily Mail, in a reference to the ill fortune of the British arms in South Africa, mentions that "More than one correspondent traces our recent reverses to the fact that the engagements were begun by us on Sunday."

But if this proves anything for the British with regard to the rightfulness of Sunday fighting, what does it prove for the Boers who won the victories? And besides, with the history of the Spanish-American war fresh in mind, in which the English-speaking race won brilliant victories on Sunday, can the English commanders be blamed for regarding Sunday as an opportune day for beginning a battle?

"This shows," remarks an English exchange, "the folly of trying to prove a thing evil by certain results. The only standard of right and wrong is God's Word."
