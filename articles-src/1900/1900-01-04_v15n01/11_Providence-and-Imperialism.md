# Providence and Imperialism.

By Thos. C. Hodgson.

IMPERIALISTS are prone to charge upon providence the responsibility of our present troubles in the East. This is an old dodge. No nation ever yet did a mean thing without blaming providence for it. Napoleon used another term but he meant the same thing when he excused all his crimes against other nations, and his own, too, under the plea of "destiny." Great statesmen are very fond of hiding behind this subterfuge.

Now if it be true that providence has ordained that the United States must become a "world power," then there is nothing for us to do but "take up the white man's burden." But one can't help wondering why providence didn't throw Canada into our lap. Since providence made the world and fashioned the continents it would seem that it must have designed Canada for the United States, or *visa versa*; and since we have discovered so recently that the consent of the governed is not necessary, why not take over Canada? Her territory is much needed to round out our American farm.

But alas! These shrewd statesmen have discovered that providence always takes the side of the heaviest guns. If England were only as weak and decrepid as Spain how soon would Canada be ours, and that, too, in the interests of humanity, and for their good as well as ours! Modern statesmanship is about as hard to understand as "the ways of providence." "Be not deceived," we have as much human nature in us as any other nation. We have more of the spirit of aggrandizement than earlier nations ever had, and when we want to extend our dominion it is not hard to find a pretext for jumping upon some weak and helpless people.

That we should go half way around the globe to pounce upon a people that never injured us, nor gave us the slightest pretext for invading their territory, is so preposterous on its face that it is not strange we should seek to saddle the responsibility entirely on providence.
