By the seizure of several flourladen ships whose cargoes were thought to be destined for the Transvaal, on the ground that food stuff intended for one of two belligerents may be regarded by the other as "contraband of war," Great Britain has established a precedent which threatens no power so much as herself; since in a European war she would have to depend almost wholly upon America for supplies of food.
