THE "understanding" between England and the United States, in which it appears Germany also has some interest, has been gravely guaranteed by its projectors to insure the peace of the world. Yet now, only a few weeks after this bombastic announcement, England finds herself facing the grave possibility of the breaking up of her empire, and the precipitation of world-wide war. The spectacle of two nations grasping hands to insure the world's peace, while both are engaged in war and one is even fighting to maintain her place as a world power, is a curious spectacle, and one which well illustrates the folly of human wisdom.
