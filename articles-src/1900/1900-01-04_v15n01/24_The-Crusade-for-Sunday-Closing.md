## The Crusade for Sunday Closing.

The New York Journal, of December 18, gave this summary of the situation as regards the Sunday-closing crusade in this vicinity:—

"The Sunday atmosphere in the country about this city is rapidly assuming the hue of the sky. Blue laws are being revived everywhere.

"Up in Mount Vernon the Christian Endeavorers are active. Chief of Police Foley announces that in deference to them he will endeavor to close Mount Vernon as tight as a drum on Sunday.

"Men with thirsts in Mount Vernon yesterday were compelled to suffer or come to New York for alleviation. Relays of Christian Endeavorers watched the saloons with eagle eyes and none dared open a door. The police paid attention to merchants of Hebrew faith who contend that since they observe Saturday as their Sabbath they may do business in their stores on Sunday.

"Morris Greenwald is one of these. He was behind his counter yesterday morning when Policeman Gilroy, in plain clothes, entered and purchased an umbrella. The scandalized Gilroy immediately arrested Greenwald. Policeman Masterson bought a necktie of Jacob Federman and arrested him for violation of the Sunday law. Two other merchants were arrested. . . .

"New Haven, which has hitherto been as cheerful a place to spend Sunday in as any Connecticut town can be, slipped back to the Blue Law observance of 200 years ago yesterday. The city was like a cemetery. Not a store nor a barber shop was open. The merchants and barbers have decided to make the place so blue on Sundays that the people will rise up and clamor greedily for a change of color. The only diverting incidents of the day were furnished by barbers who skulked through the streets carrying suspicious looking bags containing the necessaries for shaving the visage of their customers at their own homes.

"Paterson, N. J., was closed up so tight that trains passed through with a hollow rumble as if running over a covered bridge. Paterson has been closed up for several Sundays. An effort has been made to open the barber shops, and Recorder Senior will decide to-day the delicate question of the necessity of a Sunday shave. There is no precedent on the New Jersey statute books.

"In case the decision of the Recorder is against the barbers, who are fighting for open shops, they threaten to enforce every provision of the New Jersey blue laws. Under these a Patersonian who walks or rides or whistles or sings or kisses his wife on Sunday is guilty of a crime.

"Ice cream and candy stores in Englewood, N. J., which have been closed on Sundays for some time, were open yesterday. The crusade against them was dropped because of its unpopularity."
