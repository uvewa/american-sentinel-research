BECAUSE an opera house which had recently been rebuilt in Newark, N. Y., was to be opened Thursday evening, on which evening the usual church prayer meetings are conducted in that town, the proprietor of the opera house was severely scored by a Newark clergyman from his pulpit, as having given "an affront to the Christian churches of this village."

This is treating the theater as a rival of the church; but a church which is in a condition to suffer from the rivalry of a worldly institution, is certainly not in the right condition spiritually. The opera house, considered with reference to the exhibitions usually given, is against the church all the time, just as all worldliness is against the church; and if church members go to the opera on an evening when no church services are held, it is just as bad as regards their efficiency as Christian workers as if they went on prayer meeting evening. If church members lose from their hearts the vital power of godliness, at any time during the week, they are unfitted for efficiency in the church to which they belong, and their connection with it is only a hindrance rather than a help.

When a church has reason to fear the rivalry of worldly show-giving institutions, it is evidence that the church is on a worldly level. On the high plane of spirituality no worldly institution can be planted; and while the church remains on that plane, as it is her high privilege constantly to do, attractions will be offered her adherents with which worldly allurements have no power at all to compete.
