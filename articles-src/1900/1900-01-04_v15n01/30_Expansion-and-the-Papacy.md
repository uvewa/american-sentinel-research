THAT "expansion" has opened a wide field for the papacy, in which to conduct operations for strengthening her hold on the United States, is one of the plainest facts that enter into the present outlook for this country. The papacy is given the opportunity of presenting many claims upon the United States, the recognition of which by this Government must do much to strengthen her authority, and to establish a more intimate and cordial relationship between this country and the Vatican. And meanwhile the United States, by the action of its executive and judicial departments of government, is giving Rome every encouragement to present all her claims with boldness.
