# What Would Jesus Do?

BY W. N. GLENN.

This is the proposed motto of a proposed "United Christian Party." The name implies the purpose of such a party, even without the express design of having "Christian voters all united at the ballot box." The subject is the establishment of religious politics, or political religion. The call for the organization of such a party verbally disavows a union of church and state, but its success could mean only that, nothing less. Why would Christians seek to unite all their force at the ballot box (for the ballot is just so much of the force principle upon which civil governments are based)? Would not the purpose manifestly be to force control of political matters, hence control of the Government?

Such a party would assume to be Christian. If all Christians should sustain this party, as the call suggests, would not it be a church party? If it should succeed at the polls, would not the Government virtually pass into the hands of the church? The officers elected, if true to their pledges, would be obligated to carry out the principles—in other words, to obey the behests—of the Christian party, which party would be the church. Thus the logic of the proposed "United Christian Party" is church domination of the state, or practical church and state union.

Well, would it not be well to have the Government taken out of the hands of wicked men, mere selfish politicians? The United Christian Party proposes to put only "God-fearing men" into office; would not that be a grand consummation? Yes, this all sounds well from the rostrum, and reads well on paper; but it never can be accomplished by professed Christians organizing for power to control their fellow-men by force. Control by civil government is control by force; and the party that seeks such control cannot be a Christian party. It would only be operating under a Christian guise; its very incipiency must needs be hypocrisy, and therefore it would be the most corrupt of all political parties.

As to its motto, "What Would Jesus Do?" we ask, What did Jesus do? At a certain time the people wanted to make him king—wanted to "take him by force and make him king"—the highest political position in their gift. What opportunities for reform in government and in society that position would have afforded him! Were not such reforms needed then? They certainly were. Did he accept? No; he spurned the idea, and hid himself from the temptation. Was it because he thought he could not succeed in getting the place? No; he had the power of God behind him, and could have attained to any position that it was consistent for him to hold. His mission was to "preach good tidings to the meek," to "bind up the broken-hearted," to "proclaim liberty to the captives," and the "opening of the prison to them that are bound," to "proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God," to "comfort all that mourn," etc. Isa. 61:1-3.

Here is not one word about engaging in politics; not a word about reforming civil government or society through political methods. The only reformatory or beneficiary measures He ever suggested are comprehended in the proclamation of the gospel, by precept and example. And his word to his disciples is, "Follow me." The men who are endeavoring to form political parties for the purpose of controlling the Government are not following Christ or his apostles.

Have these professed Christians ever thought seriously of what the establishment of a Christian government means to this Government and to their work. There can be no Christian government without Christ at the head of it. He is coming to this earth to set up just such a government. But when he comes, it will be the death knell of every earthly government then in existence, no matter what its pretense may be. His kingdom is represented by the stone "cut out without hands" (Daniel 2) which will break in pieces every other government, and "fill the whole earth." Not one of the governments of men will be patched up by political means and made to do service as the kingdom of Christ. The prophet saw them all become "like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them."

But not only will all human governments be destroyed, but all human beings who have not the Spirit of Christ will be destroyed "by the brightness of his coming." Christ himself declared, "My kingdom is not of this world;" and men who are endeavoring to build him a worldly kingdom and to force worldly people into allegiance to it, are simply building in Christ's name a structure which, together with the builders, he will utterly repudiate and destroy at his coming.
