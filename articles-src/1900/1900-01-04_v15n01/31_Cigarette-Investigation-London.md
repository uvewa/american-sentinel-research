RECENTLY an examination of cigarettes was made by a sanitary commission in London, to determine whether they contained opium, phosphorus, mercury, arsenic, or other unsuspected poison which might account for the deadly results known to follow the smoking of cigarettes in many instances. The result of the investigation, as announced by The Lancet, was that the cigarettes were exonerated as giving no fair ground for "an allegation of the presence of a substance producing injury to health." And yet there is scarcely a more deadly poison known than oil of nicotine, which is produced wholly from tobacco, of which all cigarettes are composed. Strange that the sanitary experts did not think of hunting for this poison.
