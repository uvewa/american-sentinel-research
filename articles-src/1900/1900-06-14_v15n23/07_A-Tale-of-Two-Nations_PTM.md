### MAGNIFICENT IMPERIALISM; TREMENDOUS EXPANSION.

Israel had desired a "strong central government," in order that they might maintain their standing among the nations. They thought that "the tribes must be united in a strong central government" or else they would not be respected by the nations round about them. God granted their desire, and with Saul as the first king monarchy was launched in Israel. At first the people had a voice in saying who their king should be, but even this degree of liberty was soon lost sight of and the monarchy became an absolute one, hereditary in the reigning dynasty.

The reign of Saul was not wholly an inglorious one. He was followed by David, whose reign, next to that of Solomon, who succeeded him, was the most glorious of all the kings of Israel. David was a man of war and he made war on a great many of the nations round about. These he conquered and brought them into subjection under his yoke. Thus at the same time that imperialism began in Israel, expansion also took place. There was a great era of expansion and all Israel thought that Samuel and the Lord must surely have been mistaken when they warned them against a monarchy. Surely, thought they, Israel has never been so great or so powerful as she is to-day, and her scepter sways over a far greater portion of the earth than ever before in her history. Thus the record was writ—"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river [Euphrates] unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life. * * * He had dominion over all the regions on this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side of the river; and he had peace on all sides round about him. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even unto Beersheba, all the days of Solomon."

Truly, halcyon skies seemed to be bending over Israel; the Elysian days must indeed have come. Everywhere their arms were victorious; everywhere kings bowed the knee and paid tribute at the feet of him who sat upon the throne of the Empire of Israel. Israel was now "a great world power." The desired goal had been reached; all nations respected her and counted her a factor in the management of international affairs. During his day there was no greater king than Solomon and all the kings of the East country and the Queen of Sheba came to see his greatness and the grandeur of his court.

"And when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cup bearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord; there was no more spirit in her."

Enormous public works were commenced. Thousands upon thousands of men were set at work; a magnificent temple was erected to the Lord; treasure cities were built.

The old simple, pastoral Israel began to be no more; and in its place grew up, as in a night, a magnificent empire, studded with handsome cities, jeweled with magnificent palaces, and adorned with all the precious things that tribute nations could bring.

The wealth of Solomon, as head of the Empire of Israel, was very great. The gold that was left to him by David amounted to 108,000 talents. In a single year, the gold that came to him was over 666 talents. In one voyage alone, his ships brought 420 talents from Ophir, and on another voyage they brought him 450 talents. The Queen of Sheba gave him 120 talents; Hiram of Tyre gave him 120 talents. All this was "besides that he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia and of the governors of the country;" that is, all of this was besides the regular customs, duties and taxes from his own kingdom. And all this was of gold alone, not accounting the silver, for silver "was nothing to be accounted of in the days of Solomon," he "made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones."

Solomon was a great builder. He says, "I built me houses." And no building on earth has ever surpassed for beauty and glory the temple which he built for the Lord. No mention need be made of this, for the descriptions of it everywhere published are legion. Of his houses, the chief one was 150 ft. long, 75 ft. wide and 45 ft. high; and was in three stories. It had a grand porch 75 ft. long, 45 ft. broad. All the pillars, beams and floors of the house were of the finest cedar of Lebanon; and the pillars were so numerous and so costly and those in the porch so tall that the building was called "The House of the Cedar of Lebanon." Besides this, he built the "Porch of Judgment." There he placed his royal throne. It was built of ivory, inlaid with purest gold; having six steps with a footstool of gold; two graven lions on each step and one at each arm. The back formed a half circle and the seat was a golden bull. "There was not the like made in any kingdom." Near by was the "Tower of David" built for an armory. On the walls of this building there were hung "a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men." Besides, there was the house of Pharaoh's daughter, his wife. These all were built with walls and foundations of costly stones, many of them twelve or fifteen feet in length. All were supported with pillars and beams of cedar and fir, decked with gold and silver, and the ceilings and walls were ornamented with beautiful stones, set with gold and silver, after the style of the temple. He also built a summer palace in Lebanon.

"He says, 'I made me great works.' He built 'Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.' 'And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities which he built in Hamath. Also, he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities with walls, gates and bars; and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion."

"'Millo' was a strong fortification, or tower, that protected the city of Jerusalem on the north.

"'The wall of Jerusalem' began at Millo, and extended entirely around the city; and upon it were sixty towers.

"'Hazor' was the principal city, and the stronghold of the whole of North Palestine. It lay in the territory of the tribe of Naphtali, 'apparently on the high ground overlooking the lake of Merom.'

"'Gezer' was also a fortified city, that commanded the Mediterranean coast road of communication between Egypt and Jerusalem. The king of Egypt had taken it from the original inhabitants of the land—the Canaanites—and had given it as a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife. At the taking of it, Pharaoh had burnt it and left it in ruins.

"The two Beth-horons—'the upper' and 'the nether'—lay on the boundary line between the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin, and guarded a pass on the road from Gibeon to the Philistine plain. Through this pass was the main way into the country of Israel from Philistia on the west, and from Moab and Ammon on the east.

"'Tadmor,' called also Palmyra, was built in an oasis in the desert of Hamath on the east. It was 'two days' journey (about 120 miles) from upper Syria, and one day's journey from the Euphrates and six long days' journey from Babylon the great."—Josephus. This city was built that Solomon might control the caravan trade from the East. Even the ruins of Tadmor are a wonder, and what magnificence must have been displayed when it stood in its splendor!

"I planted me vineyards; I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits." Literally, 'I made me paradises'—beautiful parks for pleasure grounds. The principal one was at Etham, about six miles from Jerusalem. To this place he would go in the morning, in stately progress, dressed in snow-white raiment; riding in his chariot of state, which was made of the finest cedar, decked with gold and silver and purple, and carpeted with the costliest tapestry worked by the daughters of Jerusalem; and attended by a body-guard of sixty valiant men, of the tallest and handsomest of the young men of all Israel arrayed in Tyrian purple, with their long black hair, freshly sprinkled with gold-dust every day, glittering in the sun.

"I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees." These were necessary to keep his parks fresh and beautiful. There were three notable pools built in the side of the valley of Edom. The upper pool was 380 feet long, 236 feet wide at the eastern end and 229 at the western, and 25 feet deep. One hundred and sixty feet from this was the middle pool, 423 feet long, 250 feet broad at the eastern end, and 160 at the western, and 30 feet deep. Two hundred and forty-eight feet from the middle pool lay the lower pool, 582 feet long, 207 feet wide at the eastern end, and 148 at the western, and 50 feet deep. They were partly hewn out of the solid rock, and partly built of masonry. All were lined with cement; all had flights of steps from top to bottom; and all three were connected together by conduits, and with Jerusalem by an aqueduct, so that not only his paradise at Etham, but also the city of Jerusalem, was supplied with water from them."

Solomon spent twenty years in building his own royal house and the temple of the Lord. Never had Israel seen such a glorious era. Never had times seemed so prosperous or prospects for the future so bright. Empire brought a desire for conquest; conquest brought wealth; wealth brought magnificence; wealth and magnificence brought luxury; luxury bred vice; and vice gave birth to ruin. And in a few brief years the magnificent fabric of governmental power which Solomon had built up lay bleaching on the sands of time, a stranded, dismantled hulk.
