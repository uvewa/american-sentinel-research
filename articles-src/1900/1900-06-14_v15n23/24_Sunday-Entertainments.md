An advocate of Sunday observance by law says of a recent Sunday theatrical show in Boston, Mass., "Of all the Sunday entertainments I have witnessed, this was the most disgraceful." We recommend that next time he stay away from the show, and thus set a good example before others. The disgraceful show would not exist if there was no public demand for it; and as long as there is such a demand the show will find some means of existence. Continuing, this observer says that "there was no pretence, even, of anything sacred, and every number was a vaudeville act or a comic opera scene, and identically the same as presented at week-day performances, excepting costumes." If this is so, then identically the same reason exists for its suppression on "week days" as on Sunday. If such shows interfere with the rights of the people they should be prohibited; but as nobody is obliged to go to them, it is difficult to see how they constitute an infringement of rights. They are of course very degrading and demoralizing spectacles, but the law cannot go outside the sphere of rights. Only in that sphere can it be effective. In the sphere of morals the law is without a guide—a juggernaut running wild and doing incalculable damage. The natural rights of mankind are self-evident, and with them the law of mankind can safely undertake to deal. In the sphere of morals one must have the guidance of Omniscience, which can be secured only by the individual act of faith.
