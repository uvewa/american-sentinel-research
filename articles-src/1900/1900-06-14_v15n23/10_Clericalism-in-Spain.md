A correspondent of the Springfield (Mass.) Republican, writing from Madrid, says:

"There will be no good education in Spain so long as clericalism retains its power. I speak not of the Catholic church, but of that peculiar religio-political amalgam which is the enemy of progress everywhere. The Carlist party was supposed to be the depository of this in Spain. But Carlism is declining fast; there is but one Carlist deputy in the Chamber. No chance whatever of any serious Carlist rising. How then is it that clericalism still holds its head high? The liberal reply is that the queen regent is more clerical than the Carlists, that she is responsible for this backward current, that she openly patronizes it and works for it in all those secret, quiet ways which 'constitutional' sovereigns know how to apply. I do not assert this of my own knowledge. I merely repeat common talk among the liberal deputies and journalists of Madrid. Until this reactionary factor is broken, there seems little chance for the liberation of the popular intelligence of Spain. I repeat this has nothing to do with genuine religion, for the Spanish churches in their general emptiness bear testimony to the fact that real devotion is no more widespread than in Italy. At high mass at Segovia on Sunday I counted less than fifty persons; I only noted one service well attended anywhere in Spain and that was by peasants. There is immensely more outer regard for Catholic rites in France than in Spain, while, of course, there is no comparison between the zealous and educated priesthood of France and the dull, and in many cases worse parish clergy of Spain."

Such facts, and they are known by everybody, ought to convince even the most obtuse that there is not only nothing to be gained but much to be lost by uniting church and state, or as some prefer to speak of it, "religion and the state." But no matter what it is called, it is always and everywhere the same baleful thing, ruinous alike to both parties to the unnatural and adulterous union.
