At the recent Methodist conference in this city, Thomas Allen, D. D., fraternal delegate representing the English Wesleyan Methodist Church, said:

"During the last twenty-five years a new sentiment has grown up in our midst. I refer to imperialism. It is by no means a party sentiment, because it has captivated men of various types of political thought.

* * *

"It was this sentiment which found such dramatic expression in our diamond jubilee a few years ago. The central figure of that great demonstration was our venerable and beloved queen, and she acted her part with a reverence, a thoughtfulness, and a sympathy which left nothing to be desired. This new

**SENTIMENT HAS REVOLUTIONIZED OUR COLONIAL POLICY.**

Time was when our colonies were regarded as a burden, and Parliament would not have shed tears if some of them had set up housekeeping for themselves. But that day has gone by forever. The colonial troops now fighting for us in South Africa have awakened extraordinary enthusiasm. One compensation for this terrible war will be that the bounds of friendship between the colonies and the mother country will be strengthened. Having been united in sacrifice, they will not easily be separated in the time to come.

"What the ultimate outcome of this new sentiment will be it is hard to say. Sometimes I have been afraid that it may lead to a series of wars like that which marked the time of the colonization of the New World.

"Anyhow, I feel that the Christian church has a duty to perform in relation to this new sentiment. Her duty is to chasten it, to purify it from all inferior elements, to sanctify it; and then it will help us to consolidate the empire and to build the

**KINGDOM OF JESUS CHRIST.**

"I believe in the election of nations to work out definite purposes of the divine mind. The Hebrews served the purposes of revelation and religion. The Greeks furnished the world with an example of intellectual and artistic culture. The Romans developed the principles of law, government, and order. And England's mission seems to be to serve the purposes of colonization and Christianity.

"England has not forgotten the spiritual needs of her colonies. The evangelical revival produced our modern missionary societies, and at the beginning of this century these societies sent forth brave men, not only to preach the Gospel to the heathen, but also to supply the early settlers with ordinances of Christianity. * * * These men laid the foundations of our colonial churches, and they are worthy to be held in everlasting remembrance.

"Such is the providential mission of England, and because she has fulfilled it with success she has excited the jealousy of the old powers of Europe. They talk about perfidious Albion, and they call us land-grabbers and all manner of hard names.

## A RULING AND COLONIZING RACE.

"I do not say that we have always had right on our side. We are a ruling race. * * * The French people say that we are always professing that we do not want territory, and yet we are always taking it. They say that we regard heaven as a British possession. But there is more sincerity in our professions than there seems to be * * * Our greatest interest is peace. We are colonizers. * * * There would have been no war in South Africa if Englishmen in the Transvaal had been treated as Dutchmen are treated in Cape Colony. The political rights which Mr. Chamberlain claimed for the Uitlanders were essentially reasonable. Europe said so, and if they had been conceded, the South African Republic would have renewed the lease of its life and prosperity. But instead of making any concession President Kruger sent us that precious ultimatum—an ultimatum that was worthy of Napoleon himself. There was only one addition that could have been made to it, and that was, All Englishmen must clear out of South Africa in six months. We are not fighting for the enfranchisement of Johannesburg. It is a question of supremacy between the two races. You cannot have two masters in one house. Seeing that our territory has been invaded, that our colonists have been plundered, and that our men have been slain, you may depend upon it that we shall not sheathe the sword until the union jack waves over Pretoria.

## A POSSIBLE ALLIANCE.

"The help of Canada and the sympathy of America have given us the warmest satisfaction and pleasure. When America went to war with Spain on behalf of Cuba we gave her our blessing, and she has repaid us with interest. You have departed in one way from the Monroe doctrine. You have adopted a foreign policy, and if you intend to continue on this line, you will find it necessary to consider the question of alliances with other powers. And what is so natural as that a new friendship should be established between Great Britain and America? We are allied in blood. Our principles of self-government are the same. Our interests are identical in various parts of the world; and these are strong reasons why we should be friends, and why we should co-operate for the advancement of civilization and for the triumph of Christianity throughout the earth."

It is thus that ministers of the Prince of Peace identify themselves with human governments and help to keep alive and to fan into intensity the war spirit, than which nothing can be more contrary to the spirit of Christ.

Again, notice how the sentiment in favor of an alliance between this country and Great Britain is cultivated. Notice the mingling of the secular and the ecclesiastical, of the material and the spiritual—in short, of the sacred and the profane. Our material interests are the same, therefore "we should co-operate for the triumph of Christianity throughout the earth."

And what sort of Christianity is it that thus triumphs throughout the earth? So far as the government is concerned it is a Christianity that forces opium upon China at the cannon's mouth and that sends to every heathen land ten gallons of rum for every Bible.

Christianity is all right; and Anglo-Saxon civilization is far in advance of the civilization of Asia or Africa; and the political systems of Europe and America are far ahead of those of other parts of the world, but it is a misnomer to call them "Christian." It is impossible for any people ever to highly esteem any religion that has been forced upon them by the sword. It is possible "to build the kingdom of Jesus Christ" only by preaching the gospel of the Prince of Peace.
