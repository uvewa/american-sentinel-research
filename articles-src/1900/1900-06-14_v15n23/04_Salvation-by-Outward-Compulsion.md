"Salvation," remarks the Sunday School Times, "is not putting a man into heaven, but putting heaven into a man. It is not putting a sinful man into a law-abiding community, but writing the law of God in his heart and mind. The real question is not, What will we do under outward compulsion? but, What will we do by inward choice? Salvation is not the change of circumstances, but that central change in us, that change of the heart, of its attitude, its intentions, of its choices, which will make it the conqueror, under all circumstances, in life's battles."

Those who are trying to usher in the kingdom of God by constitutional amendment, by civil enactments, and some even by force of arms, should make a note of this.
