The members of the classis of the Dutch Reformed Church of Parmus Valley, N. J., were bickering recently before Vice-Chancellor Pitney for possession of the church property. The Chancellor listened for a time, then turning to the quarreling members, he said:

"My advice to you, reverend gentlemen, is to go home and stop fighting. You are deeply injuring the cause of religion by your actions. The classis seems determined to impoverish this church. Go home and show more Christlike forbearance in your dealings with each other."

This was good advice, but it ought not to have been necessary for a civil officer to give such counsel to ministers of the gospel.
