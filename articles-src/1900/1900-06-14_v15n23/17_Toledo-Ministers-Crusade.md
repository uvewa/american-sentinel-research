A minister of the Christian denomination in Toledo, Ohio, has inaugurated a crusade "against the aristocracy of the churches and the insolent attitude they assume toward the poor." He says:

"By the practice of the church more people are doomed to eternal perdition than were ever doomed by the saloons or any other influence. Place no faith in your churches; the clergy preach against raffling in saloons for chickens or turkeys for the poor, and a few days later they advertise a lottery for a fancy quilt or an embroidered sofa pillow for the rich. Mark my words, that there will be a reformation that will shake the religious world to its foundations. Isms and schisms will be parts of a broken parachute. Churches in New York and other cities receive direct rentals from the liquor traffic."

It is announced that this minister proposes to arrange for a church with regular church services, and will have on the side billiards, pool, bowling, and other games in the way of amusements, but no liquor or tobacco.

A Freethought paper suggests that "if this venture at mixing religion and diversion proves successful some of the Toledo saloons may back-cap the Rev. Mr. Patton by hiring a minister and advertising billiards and pool with preaching on the side."

It must be admitted that there is far too much truth in Mr. Patton's arraignment of the churches, but the remedy will not be found in "billiards, pool, bowling, and other games" as an adjunct to the church. The people want not more amusements, but more of Christ.
