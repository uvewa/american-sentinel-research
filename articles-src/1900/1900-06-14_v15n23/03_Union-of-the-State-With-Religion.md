Very few people in this country will openly admit that they favor a union of church and state. The National Reform party, which has taken the lead in work that directly leads to such a union, is as much against the union of church and state—according to their definition of such union—as any other people are. They do not want the government to unite with the Methodist church or the Baptist church, or the Presbyterian, the Congregational, the Disciple, the Lutheran, or the Roman Catholic, or with any other denomination. They only want the government to become Christian, like an individual who accepts and practices Christian truths. The government should not unite with any church, they say, but it should by all means unite with religion.

Almost any intelligent person can define the evils of a union of church and state. But a union of religion and the state in this country would really be far worse as regards intolerance than a union of the state with any church. This is evident in the light of the fact that such a union would inevitably meet with the combined opposition of all the other churches, and would therefore be shorn of all power to enforce the will of the state church upon dissenters. Thus it is in England to-day; the state church is opposed by numerous non-conformist churches, as powerful as itself in their combined strength, and there is little if anything savoring of religious persecution in that country. The union is a mild thing because under the circumstances it cannot be otherwise. And the union of church and state in this country against which the National Reform party and its allies are so valiantly opposed, would necessarily be equally impotent.

But not so of a union of the state with religion. For religion, in such a case, would represent a combination of the leading churches, and not merely one of them alone. The religious tenets to which the state would hold in becoming "Christian" would be those upon which the leading churches are united in their religious belief. All the churches would work to this end, and undoubtedly all would be taken into the scheme to insure its success. Then all the leading and powerful churches would be equally interested in maintaining the state religion, and the opposition would be practically nothing. Dissenters would have no powerful opposing body to stand between them and the will of the church combination executed by the state, and the combination would feel no fear to enforce its religious will by vigorous decrees. Dissenters being comparatively few, would be despised instead of feared and would be ground beneath the juggernaut of the state religion as is always done to dissenters under such circumstances. Thus a union of religion and the state, where there are a number of powerful churches, would be the most intolerant union that could be formed. It would be church and state union in its worst form.

And, therefore, of all possible religio-political unions that are possible in this country, we want no union of the state with religion.
