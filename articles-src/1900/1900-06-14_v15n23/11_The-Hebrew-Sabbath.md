"The Jewish or Hebrew Sabbath," says the Defender, organ of the "Sabbath Protective League" of New England, "was a memorial of the release of the children of Israel from Egyptian bondage,—a sign and promise of weekly rest of body, mind and soul."

Very good; and does not every Christian belong to Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:29)? and if an individual is a son of God (2Cor. 6:18) has he not been called out of Egypt (Matt. 2:15)? Are not the ten commandments addressed to those who have been brought out of Egyptian bondage (Ex. 20:1-17)? and is not deliverance from bondage the first experience of every Christian? Then why should not that ancient Sabbath memorial be observed by Christians today?
