The readers of the Sentinel remember that not long ago a Seventh-day Adventist minister was banished from Kharput to Equin in Asia Minor. The Armenians had stirred the government against him at Kharput, that he might be sent away, that nobody might come to the knowledge of the truth. But God took their plan and used it to the salvation of others. The minister after gaining his freedom in Equin began to teach in the Protestant church.

This was a unique opportunity offered to us by Protestants in Turkey. He labored several months without any success, the people seeming very indifferent to what was preached. But in these later days all at once several souls have been awakened to study the Bible, and two men and four women have begun to keep the Sabbath. One of the women is the teacher of the orphanage school opened by American missionaries after the massacre. She is teaching the truth to the orphans also, and a good interest has been awakened among the children. She is sure that as soon as the missionaries hear about her obedience, she cannot longer stay there. Another sister is the wife of the master of a factory running with the capital given by missionaries. Her husband also is very friendly to the truth. These things will surely arouse antagonism from the missionaries and jealous souls. Let us see what will happen next.
