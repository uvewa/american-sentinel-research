For more than three hundred years after Christ the church had to make its way by a struggle with the Roman Empire, which had adopted the policy of no toleration for new religions. The persecution waged against the Christian church was inspired by a false system of religion which enjoyed the favor of the state and in fact held the reins of government in the empire. This persecution was often severe in the extreme, and finally reached the climax during the reign of Diocletian, when an attempt was made to utterly exterminate Christians and blot out the church and Christianity, by destroying all the sacred books of the Christians from the face of the earth. The church did not lose heart in this contest; she knew that the Almighty was her source of strength and power. This fierce struggle ended in triumph for the church; for the real author of this last persecution so far relented and became softened by the power of Christianity as to join the Emperor Constantine in an act of toleration of Christians in the year 311. This edict acknowledged the failure of persecution to accomplish any good for the empire, which at the beginning of its opposition to Christianity was at its zenith, but now was tottering to its fall.

During this period of pagan persecution the voice of Christians was often heard in protest against the abuse of the power of the state, and in advocacy of the divine principle of religious liberty. Among the instances recorded in history are those of Justin Martyr, Turtullian and Lactantius. It will be sufficient for the purposes of this article to refer to one of these. Turtullian, addressing the Proconsul of Carthage, says of Christians:

"We are worshipers of one God, of whose existence and character nature teaches all men; at whose lightnings and thunders you tremble; whose benefits minister to your happiness. You think that others, too, are gods, whom we know to be but demons. However, it is a fundamental, human right, and a privilege of nature, that every man should worship according to his own convictions. One man's religion neither harms nor helps another man. It is assuredly no part of religion to compel religion, to which free will, and not force, should lead us; you will render no real service to your gods by compelling us to sacrifice. For they can have no desire of offering from the unwilling."

Lactantius and others plead with the heathen in similar language. All of which may be received as evidence that the early Christians taught religious liberty as a doctrine of Christianity.

It is sad, however, to note that the edict of Constantine was only the beginning of a transition to a new order of things; for, in the process of time, Christianity exchanged places with paganism. It became the religion of the state, and became possessed of all the power and privileges that had been enjoyed by paganism. Not alone did the church enjoy imperial protection, but the power to dictate the course of empire, and to her ministers was granted the right to assume the authority of sovereign bishop, not alone of the internal affairs of the church, but it soon extended to the affairs of the state.

No sooner had this new order of things become established than another spirit took possession of the church. Christian intolerance took the place of pagan intolerance, and greatly exceeded it in intensity and extent. Christianity aroused in men a greater depth of passion, and when the love inspired by true Christianity was turned to hate it knew no bounds, and woe to the individual that dared to attempt to withstand its will.

Heresy now became punishable by civil disability, confiscation, exile, and death; and new modes of punishment were added, as the hate of men led to new inventions for torture.

The union of church and state which began with Constantine benefited the church in no way, but exposed her to all the abuses of wealth and power, and conformed the kingdom of Christ, which is a kingdom of love and peace, to the kingdoms of this world.

The state was in no way benefited, for instead of its power being used in a legitimate way for the protection of society against the criminal element that is always present in the world, it was turned aside and made use of by the church for the punishment of offenders against a false standard of religion; and the purposes for which governments exist were entirely overlooked and the result was disintegration.

Notwithstanding the world and the church have these facts of apostacy and the terrible results before them, yet there are some even in our day that believe with Gregory XVI. that "religious liberty is the liberty of error," and "the most fruitful cause of evil with which the church is at present afflicted." And some seem to adopt the view further expressed by the same dignitary, when he said: "From this noxious fountain of indifferentism flows the absurd, erroneous opinion, or rather form of madness, which declares that liberty of conscience should be asserted and maintained for every one. For this most pestilential error that full and immoderate liberty of opinion paves the way which, to the injury of sacred and civil government, is now spread far and wide, and which some with utmost impudence have extolled as beneficial to religion."

These utterances are entirely at variance with the declarations of early Christians already referred to, and contrary to the teaching of Jesus Christ, the author of Christianity. After his resurrection Jesus said: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth," and this power is for the church, not for the purpose of coercing men, but to convince them.

Nor is this power promised to the church through the medium of the state, for this would rob the author of Christianity of all the glory. The state exists for a different purpose; and besides it has become contaminated by contact with paganism. While the power of the church depends on her purity. Jesus could not accept the kingdoms of this world when offered him, because by doing so he would have lost his power to save men, although he might have had the power of universal empire. If it was not safe for the author of Christianity to accept of worldly power, it is much less so for the church to covet and accept such power. This is substantiated by all the history of the past.

But shall not the power of the state be sought for the enforcement of certain institutions of the church? It was precisely in this way that the church became involved in the fourth century. The principle once violated in the smallest degree severs the church from the source of divine power, and leaves it wholly dependent on the powers of this world. The power of the state is for mutual protection in things material; the power of the church is for individual upbuilding in things spiritual. The state is maintained by force; the church by love. The power of the state is the lesser power; that of the church the greater. When the church lets go the power of love and accepts the power of force, it must necessarily suffer loss, for it discards the greater for the less. When the state undertakes to do the work of the church, it must of necessity suffer loss, for in undertaking the work of the church its energies are diverted and criminals thrive and good men suffer as criminals.

When the church has lost its divine power it loses divine wisdom also, and virtues are made crimes and crimes are made virtues. Pius IX. said in his condemnation of the eighty errors of the age:

"It is a crime for private individuals to make no account of the duties of religion, or to treat different kinds of religion in the same way. The church judges it not lawful that the various kinds of divine worship should have the same right as the true religion."

If it is a crime it should be punished, but the church does not use force, therefore the power of the state must be sought to execute the judgment of the church. Thus we see the result of the church seeking to ally itself with the state. It condemns as a crime that which was extolled by Jesus and his early followers as one of the greatest virtues. Let the church of to-day take warning.

ALLEN MOON.
