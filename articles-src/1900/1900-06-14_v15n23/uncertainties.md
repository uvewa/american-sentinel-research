# Uncertainties Log - Volume 15, Number 23 (June 14, 1900)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text rendering throughout.

## Specific Uncertainties

**Page 1, Masthead:**
- Volume number listed as "VOLUME 14" but this is issue 23 of volume 15 based on the YAML frontmatter requirements. The OCR may have captured an error in the original, or this represents a volume numbering discrepancy. Transcribed as printed: "VOLUME 14"

**Page 7, Article "A Tale of Two Nations":**
- Author initials "P. T. MAGAN" appear at end - assumed to be P. T. Magan based on context, though this author does not appear in the known authors list provided in instructions.

**Page 9, Article "Republic or Empire?":**
- Author attribution: The article text indicates this is a speech by ex-Governor Boutwell but does not include explicit author initials at the end. Attributed as explicit with author "George Boutwell" based on clear identification in the text.

**Page 11, Article by Z. G. Baharian:**
- Author initials "Z. G. BAHARIAN" - not in known authors list. Full name appears in signature line "Constantinople, May 17, 1900."

## OCR Quality Assessment

Overall OCR quality: EXCELLENT. The Mistral OCR successfully captured:
- Complex formatting including tables
- Proper names and locations
- Biblical references
- Long quotations
- Multi-column layout
- Page headers and footers

No significant transcription uncertainties requiring second-pass review.
