May 24 ex-Governor Boutwell of Massachusetts, a life-long Republican, eighty-two years of age and of course with no political ambition, made a speech in Cooper Institute, New York, in which he uttered some truths well worth repeating—truths which should be carefully considered by everybody without partisan prejudice.

Governor Boutwell did not content himself with a statement of abstract principles. He doubtless felt it necessary to make the application to men and parties as they exist and as they have ranged themselves, or are now ranging themselves on the question at issue.

So far as we are concerned we care nothing about men or parties. The Sentinel has no political ax to grind. We do, however, believe that the nation is in great danger of taking a step that will be fatal to republicanism—"government of the people, by the people, and for the people"—and which will bind us as a nation for all time to military imperialism.

"There are indications," said the venerable ex-Governor, "that attempts are making to so construe the Constitution as to justify the policy of seizing, through war, foreign lands and alien peoples, and governing them as they might be governed if the Constitution of the United States did not exist. It is the manifest purpose * * * to seize and to hold countries and to govern races and communities outside of the jurisdiction of the Constitution. Thus is the administration creating a power in the president and Congress independent of the Constitution, and over which the people can have no control. It is with that usurpation that I am now to deal. The question before the country is this: Republic or empire?"

Coming at once to the real question at issue, Governor Boutwell said of

THE JURISDICTION OF THE CONSTITUTION:

"Of many propositions that may be laid down concerning the Constitution of the United States, no one can be more worthy of universal acceptance than this, namely: The Constitution cannot, of its own force, apply to territory that is not of the United States.

"A second proposition, which seems to justify itself without argument, is this: The Constitution by its own force applies equally and everywhere and always to every part of the United States.

"In elucidation and support of the first proposition, if that proposition is open to debate, it may be said that it was not in the power of the men who made the Constitution, nor of the people and states that ratified it, to have it applicable to Great Britain, to the Philippines, or to the island of Porto Rico, that was then under the dominion of Spain.

"If, then, the first proposition must be accepted as an indisputable truth, it follows, inevitably, that the Constitution does not give power, and, in fine, that the Constitution could not have given power to Congress to legislate for territories and peoples that then were or that thereafter might be outside of the jurisdiction of the Constitution itself. The power of legislation, which subsists in the Congress of the United States, is a derived power, and it is subject to one inherent limitation—its powers cannot exceed the powers possessed by the body of authority—in this case the Constitution—from which its own powers are derived. If, upon argument, this proposition might be open to debate, it remains to be said that the Constitution has fixed the limit of legislative power. As a declaration of a limitation of legislative power in Congress, the provision is superfluous, but its value is now to be appreciated in the enforcement of a manifest truth which otherwise, in these times, might be resisted stubbornly.

CONGRESS CAN NOT GO BEYOND CONSTITUTION.

"Following the preamble to the Constitution, and standing at the head of all things and of all declarations else, are these words: 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' Hence it follows that Congress must find authority in the Constitution for each and every of its legislative acts.

"In vain will be the search for authority to legislate beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. No attempt has been made in the Constitution to give such authority, and such authority could not have been given. The limits of legislative powers in Congress have been fixed by the Constitution, and they are fixed, irrevocably fixed in the nature of things.

"As a nation we are to obey the Constitution and to apply these truths. If Porto Rico is of the United States, then its ports are ports of the United States, and its inhabitants are citizens of the United States, and they are endowed already with all the rights and privileges of citizenship. If Porto Rico is not of the United States, then the attempt to exercise jurisdiction over the island through the lawmaking power is a gross usurpation abroad and a violation of duty at home, which cannot be defended and which ought not to be tolerated."

HEREIN IS USURPATION.

Referring to the advocates of imperialism, the speaker said that "through two steps in an argument" they "have deduced an erroneous conclusion from an admitted truth: (1) Our government, in common with other sovereignties, has a right to acquire territory. (2) That right carries with it the right to govern territory so acquired.

"From these propositions they deduce the false conclusion that Congress may indulge in a full and free discretion in the government of territories so acquired. Herein is the error, and herein is the usurpation. By their acquisition the territories have become a part of the United States. As a part of the United States the Constitution extends to them, and the privileges and guarantees of the Constitution are their possession, as they are the possession of the pre-existing states and territories. In these features of our system of government is the security that this nation cannot at the same time play the part of empire and of republic.

"We have the right to acquire territory, and we have the right to govern all territory acquired; but we must govern it under the Constitution, and in the exercise of those powers, and those only, which have been conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. Any attempt further is a criminal usurpation."

A CLAIM TO UNLIMITED POWER.

"The claim that Congress may extend the Constitution to the new territories is only a restatement of the claim that the Constitution does not apply of its own force to our newly acquired possessions, and that the power of Congress over such possessions is an unlimited power.

"Congress is to obey the Constitution. It has no power to increase or to diminish the scope of that instrument.

"Whenever a territory is acquired, either by purchase or conquest, the Constitution becomes immediately and by its own force the fundamental law of such acquired territory, or it must remain forever outside the Constitution, and consequently outside of the jurisdiction of Congress, inasmuch as Congress cannot legislate beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution, the source, and the sole source, of its legislative authority. The inquiry thus made leads to these conclusions, namely:

"1. Whenever territory is acquired, whether by conquest or purchase, such territory becomes subject to the Constitution, and that without the aid or agency of any branch or department of the government of the United States.

"2. The power of legislation by Congress over such territory is fixed and limited by the Constitution.

"3. That power is so limited that the 'duties, imposts and excises' must be the same in the newly acquired possessions as they may then be in pre-existing states and territories at the same periods of time.

"4. The claim that Congress may govern territories and provinces that are not within the jurisdiction of the Constitution, or that Congress may extend the Constitution over Porto Rico, or the Philippines, or Japan, is an assumption of arbitrary power that must prove fatal to our republican system. These conclusions are in harmony with the decisions of the supreme court of the United States, with the opinion of Chancellor Kent, with the decision after argument of an international tribunal, in which the United States was a party, and in harmony with the opinion given recently by Judge Lochren."

JUSTIFICATION OF IMPERIALISM CONSIDERED.

"I am now to consider some of the pretexts that are tendered in justification of the policy of imperialism," says Governor Boutwell.

"If we pass by Shakespeare, Milton and Pope, our own poet, Oliver Wendell Holmes, may be classed among the leading philosophical writers of the modern era, in whatever relates to the passions and weaknesses of mankind. Holmes has named sin among the diseases that are catching. America has caught from England the disease of land-grabbing, of thirst for the subjugation of inferior races, all tributary to empire building, the crowning sin of dead nations and the peril of struggling nations that yet exist."

## WHEN TRADE FOLLOWS THE FLAG.

Referring to the advocacy of "a warlike undertaking ostensibly for the extension of our trade with China," the venerable speaker said:

"China and Russia are combined, and nothing of trade facilities with China can be secured by force or by threats of force. The authorities of China have given notice that further territorial concessions will not be made. The recent speeches of the Chinese minister should be accepted as a declaration that trade with China is to depend upon friendships, agreements, reciprocal relations, and that nothing will be conceded to force. England and the United States, acting separately or combined, have not the power to dictate a commercial policy to China. Russia has gained more in the last five years by peaceful means and agencies than England has gained by war in the closing quarter of this century. Russia has connected its vast Siberian empire with the great Pacific sea on the east, and with the Persian gulf and the Indian ocean on the south.

"The British empire in India is now embraced in the arms of Russia. That country has allied itself with China on one side and with Persia on the other, and with openings to the sea through each country. Thus Russia is to control a third of the population of the globe, and, if we are to enjoy the benefits of trade with the millions of the East, we are to secure that trade by the profession and the practice of the principles and the arts of peace. Thus, again, it may appear that the maxim, or saying, that trade follows the flag is true only when the flag is the emblem and herald of peace. Legitimate and systematic trade shuns the flag in times of war.

## THE MOST DISGRACEFUL CHAPTER OF ALL MODERN HISTORY.

"Of all modern history, the most disgraceful chapter is that which the American nation is now writing. At the opening of the last third of this century we abolished slavery in America, and at the end of this century we are making war for the establishment of a system of slavery in Asia. The crimes of England, in the Sepoy war, on the upper Nile, in South Africa, are trivial offenses against justice and humanity when compared with the crime of subjugating and enslaving 10,000,000 people.

* * * * *

"In four years the doctrine of the right of self-government has been repudiated in Washington. * * * The downfall of Rome, as described by De Vertot, was not more rapid than the change that has taken place in the capital city of America."

The remedy suggested by politicians is of course the overthrow of those now in power, of those who are directing affairs. But this is a superficial view. The fault is not in officials alone, but in the people. As a nation we have ceased to prize liberty as we ought. We have become careless, and what wonder if rulers are also becoming corrupt—what wonder if the political "boss" usurps the place once given to fundamental principle. The true remedy is in calling the people back to the true principles of liberty.
