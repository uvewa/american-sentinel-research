Human jurisdiction extends only to outward acts, and to these only so far as they affect the rights of others.

A religious opinion is not any more entitled to the protection of law than is an opinion touching secular affairs.

Every person's conscience is for himself alone, and if every person would be sufficiently conscientious for himself he would not try to become conscience for other people.

"The general welfare" cannot be promoted by ignoring individual welfare. "The masses" cannot be reached by any good which goes over the head of the individual.

Religious liberty is not license to trample upon the rights of our fellowmen. It is, however, freedom from interference in all matters of religious faith; and in all practice touching religion, not inconsistent with the equal rights of others.

Opinions do not outweigh rights. Every person has a right to rest, and likewise a right to labor, on Sunday, or any day, and one person's opinion that everybody ought to rest on a certain day cannot be of any binding force upon another individual.

Civil government can have no rightful jurisdiction over the conscience, because of human limitations; and because to give it such authority would be to put it in the place of God.

The rights of a thousand men are no greater than the rights of a single individual. Each one of the thousand has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; but the individual has exactly the same right, and the thousand has it only because each individual in the thousand has it.
