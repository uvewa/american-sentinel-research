"It is refreshing," remarks the Chicago Record, "to find a case of consistency where money is at stake. The Haines Gauge company of Philadelphia declines to furnish apparatus for the ships of the United States navy on the ground that the proprietors are members of the Society of Friends and are opposed to war. This is the first case of the kind on record."
