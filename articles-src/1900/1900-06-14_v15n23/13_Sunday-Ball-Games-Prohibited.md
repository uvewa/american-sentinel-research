The Haverhill (Mass.) Gazette of May 14 reports the breaking up of two Sunday ball games on the previous day by the marshal of that city. There are many who still insist that Sunday statutes are merely civil. If so, on what grounds can base ball and other similar games be prohibited on that day? The fact that not only work but play is forbidden on Sunday proves that the object of the law is to compel its observance as a religious institution.
