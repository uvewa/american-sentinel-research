Apropos of the demand of a New York clergyman that negro slavery be restored in this country is this from the Truth Seeker:

"Mr. Frank in his solicitude for the negro forgets the white man, and hence overlooks the fact that slavery is always degrading to the master, however elevating it may be to the slave."

It must be admitted that in this instance the Free-thought editor shows a clearer moral insight than the minister.
