Under the heading, "Drunkenness in Manila," the New York Christian Advocate of the 9th inst. says:

"Through private sources the Advocate has been given a special glance at the liquor evil in Manila, and is constrained to allow other eyes to share the vision.

"To begin with, our far-away informant seems to be under great constraint lest the military authorities in Manila may find out who it is that's giving out information. The press censorship is very strict, and even the private correspondence of individuals is closely watched."

Then follows a statement of the evil effects of liquor drinking, especially on the soldiers, many of whom have died of drunkenness and "scores if not hundreds have gone insane" from the use of a native liquor called "vino."

But what must be thought of a censorship which is so strict that private individuals do not dare even to have it known that they write to their friends a true statement of the conditions in Manila?

There can be but one reason for such a censorship, namely, to keep the people of this country, and possibly even the administration, in ignorance of the real conditions in the Philippines. How much better is this than Spanish methods? But censorship, not only of the press but of private correspondence, is inseparable from military imperialism. If the people will have the "glory" they must pay the price.
