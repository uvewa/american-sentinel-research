The situation in China looks at this distance very much like anarchy. The conditions are certainly serious and are doubtless causing uneasiness in many capitals. It is true that so far as China herself is concerned there is no more cause for alarm now than in the past. The Taiping rebellion of forty years ago was more formidable than is the "Boxer" outbreak of today; but the hungry European powers were not then in a position to take advantage of the situation as they are to-day. Russia, for example, now has several thousand within striking distance of Pekin. Other European powers and even the United States are represented by war vessels, with other forces within easy call. At present England is too fully occupied in Africa to be able to take any active part in the partition of China, but from present indications the South African war is practically over and Lord Salisbury may think it an opportune time to strike while such a large army is several thousand miles nearer the scene of prospective operations than under ordinary conditions. Or should the South African war continue the Czar may conclude that he has nothing to gain but much to lose by delay. Viewed from any reasonable standpoint the outlook is ominous for China.
