"It has become a crime to sell bread on Sunday in the city of New York," says a weekly paper published in that city. "On May 21 four men were arraigned in Essex Market police court on the charge of having committed that offense. The arresting officer looked ashamed of his position, and the magistrate inquired, 'Can't the police find any more serious crime down this way?' Then the officer told how he came to make the arrests. 'It isn't my fault, judge,' he said; 'I acted under orders. A minister has been complaining about me allowing the law to be violated. He comes to the station house frequently and insists that we arrest these desecrators of the Sabbath. I only obeyed orders. He is the Rev. Malcolm A. Birnie, and he is connected with a mission at 280 Rivington street.'

The accused men were discharged, but when the Rev. Birnie was seen he expressed a determination to keep on calling the attention of the police to the violations of the law.

Birnie is chairman of the 'Committee on Good Citizenship of the First District of New York City Christian Endeavor Union,' and causing the arrest of men who sell bread or ice cream and of boys who sell flowers is in the line of his work, which he says is done in the interests of Sunday school children. He stated to a reporter: 'We want the streets of New York so quiet on Sundays that children attending our Sunday schools may go to and from their homes undisturbed by unholy thoughts. There are plenty of bakeshops open on Saturdays where people can buy their bread for Sundays.' To this statement the Rev. Birnie has the irony to add: 'We do not want to deprive anybody of his rights!'

"In discharging the bread sellers Magistrate Crane said to the officer:

"'When the minister makes a complaint against you send him to me, and I guarantee that I will read him a lecture that may interest him and do him good. I do not blame you, but I feel that I am doing a Christian act when I discharge these poor people, who themselves are trying hard to earn bread for their families. Now I want you to see this minister and tell him before he makes any more complaints to see me. I would like to talk with him a while.'

"It is well to talk to Birnie, although he is probably impervious to reason—either too fanatical or too rascally to allow words to affect his conduct; but the persons responsible for the Sunday law are the real culprits who have placed in Birnie's hands the power to gratify his bigoted and persecuting propensity. A law enforcing the observance of Sunday is as wildly out of place on our statute books as it would be if it enforced the rite of baptism. Nobody can point to any good coming from the law that could not be realized without it, and it ought to be forever repealed. When that is done we shall be through with such miscreants as the Rev. Birnie and the gang of conspirators against liberty who employ him as their agent."

The paper from which the foregoing is taken is the Truth Seeker, whose editor is an agnostic. Now isn't it too bad that he has opportunity to record such unchristian acts on the part of a minister of the Christian religion? It certainly is.

But it should be remembered that this man Birnie is no worse than the system which he represents. It is the law that is at fault, and consequently the sentiment back of the law; and yet that same sentiment is by some called "Christian sentiment." But "by their fruits ye shall know them."
