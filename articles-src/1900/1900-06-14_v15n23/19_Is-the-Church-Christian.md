The National Christian Citizenship League recently sent to a number of persons the following questions: "Is the church Christian? Does she stand for the things for which Jesus stood and teach the truths he taught?"

Among the replies received was one from the Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, rector of All Souls church, who said:

"If by the question is meant, Is the church as an organization Christly, possessed of the spirit and organized upon the principles of Christ? I am afraid the answer must be no. The teachings of the church for the most part are far from following the teachings of Jesus—nay, they are far from recognizing what those teachings are. The organization of the church is planned and patterned upon a policy which is the very antithesis of a true society of Jesus? Commercialism dominates the organization and conventionality tyrannizes the pulpit. The law of the market rather than the law of the Mount is accepted by the church at large."

And who will dare deny that Dr. Newton told the truth. Clearly the church has departed very far from the simplicity and doctrine of the apostles.
