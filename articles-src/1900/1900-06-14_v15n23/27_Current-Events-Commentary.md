We still have on hand a limited supply of the first three numbers of the Sentinel issued from this office, dates May 10, 17 and 24. These are excellent for distribution and to use as samples. While they last we will fill orders for them in lots of twenty-five or more to one address at one cent per copy.

We devote considerable space this week to matter bearing more or less directly upon the question of imperialism. We do not do this from any political motive, or for the benefit of any candidate or party, but because a vital principle is involved directly affecting the formation of individual character.

It is said of man, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Therefore it is not a matter of indifference what one thinks upon any question of vital principle. Just views of individual rights are conducive to a just appreciation of individual responsibility; and to know and feel individual responsibility toward God is the very foundation of all right character. Wrong thinking is sure to react disastrously upon the character; therefore we should cherish right principles, whether our own liberties are involved directly or not. The vital question with each individual is not so much, What principle will the government cherish? but, What principle shall I cherish?

A religious institution does not become civil simply because recognized and enforced by civil statute. Prayers and sermons paid for by the State are not civil. Who ever read that a session of the Senate was opened by a "civil prayer," or the "civil services" are conducted on board a certain battle-ship every Sunday by the chaplain?

The claim made in behalf of Sunday is that it is the Sabbath of the Lord, enjoined by the fourth commandment of the decalogue. It has even been styled "the test of all religion." Dr. W. F. Crafts says concerning it: "Taking religion out of the day takes the rest out." While Joseph Cook, in one of his Boston Monday lectures, in 1887, said: "You will in vain endeavor to preserve Sunday as a day of rest, unless you preserve it as a day of worship." This claim alone should at once remove the day from the sphere of human legislation. It is not the province of the state to enforce religious institutions.

Religious legislation now generally takes the form of statutes requiring the observance of Sunday. The people are told that this is not religious legislation, and that such statutes are designed "to protect the workingman." The fact, however, is that Sunday laws are always and everywhere designed to protect not the man but the day. That this is true is shown by the form of the charge against those who disregard the law; they are uniformly charged with "Sabbath breaking," "violating the Lord's day," "profaning the Sabbath," etc.

Exhaust all the arguments ever urged in behalf of "civil Sabbath" statutes and the fact remains that but for the supposedly sacred character of the day there would be no Sunday law. Nobody is required to observe a purely civil day. Who ever heard of a law forbidding anybody to do as he sees fit on the 22d of February, the 30th of May, the 4th of July, 10th of September, or even upon Thanksgiving or Christmas?

All religious legislation—legislation touching religious questions—is dangerous for the reason, if for no other, that it furnishes precedent for other similar measures.

We do not see the reason for so much fear as is expressed touching the secularization of the "American Sabbath." If the Sabbath is American, it will not be any less American when it is made wholly secular, for secular things are as truly American as anything can be. It will still be the "American Sabbath," and why should not every American institution be what the American people wish it to be? With the "Sabbath of the Lord," of course, the case is different; but that is no more American than it is German or French.

Among the supporters of Sunday laws are always to be found those who are themselves persistent violators of the law—they want such statutes for others, not for themselves.
