## THE PAPACY AND PROGRESS.—II.

The paragraph of the Pope's encyclical "to the Americans" which has the most direct bearing on the questions suggested by the language of Mr. Malone, is as follows:

"The church among you, unopposed by the Constitution and Government of your nation, fettered by no hostile legislation, protected against violence by the common laws and the impartiality of the tribunals, is free to live and act without hindrance. Yet, though all this is true, it would be very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the type of the most desirable status of the church; or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for state and church to be, as in America, dissevered and divorced. The fact that Catholicity with you is in good condition, nay, is even enjoying a prosperous growth, is by all means to be attributed to the fecundity with which God has endowed his church; in virtue of which, unless men or circumstances interfere, she spontaneously expands and propagates herself. But she would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority."

It would seem that this language needs no comment. Blind indeed must be the person who can not see at the first reading of this paragraph that the Catholic Church has not "learned the lesson of tolerance;" that she has not learned to "separate politics and religion;" that she has not learned "new ways of looking at things;" that she is perfectly ready to do now just what she did in the Middle Ages. Notice, Leo does not want the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority because the church is restricted in her operations, and Catholics are not allowed "to enjoy their constitutional rights in their integrity." He knows nothing of the things that it is claimed give rise to Catholic federation. He sees that the church "is free to live and act without hindrance," and that she has, in the enjoyment of such liberty, "from scant and slender beginnings, grown with rapidity to be great and exceedingly flourishing." But, "though all this is true, it would be very erroneous to draw the conclusion that in America is to be sought the type of the most desirable status of the church; or that it would be universally lawful or expedient for state and church to be, as in America, dissevered and divorced." "She would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority." Let it be noted that the position of Leo, which is the position of the Papacy, is that perfect freedom and protection to live and act without hindrance is not enough for the church to-day; she must have from the state, and from the United States at that, "in addition to liberty," favor and patronage. Favor is "an act or course of kindness or generosity, as distinguished from one that is inspired by a regard for justice, duty, or right." It is "kindness bestowed upon one to the exclusion of others; partiality; preference." Patronage is "favor, aid, protection, or care extended to a person or work by a patron; special countenance and encouragement; guardianship."

The attitude of the Catholic Church to-day, and especially her attitude with respect to the United States, is stated in the paragraph given, just as it is, and so plainly that there is no possibility of its being misunderstood. The Roman pontiffs in their palmiest days, with all their arrogance and presumption, were never more bold in their statement of the attitude of the church toward the civil power. But the encyclical from which this is taken is astounding beyond any papal document of the Middle Ages for these reasons: (1) In view of the "grand march of progress" of the last few centuries, of which Mr. Malone speaks. (2) In view of the claims of Catholics that the church has kept step with this progress. (3) Above all else in view of the fact that it was addressed to the people of a nation which has stood before the world for more than a century on principles which forever forbid to any church or any religion "the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority."

This encyclical allows no escape from the following conclusions: (1) The church has not changed or advanced in the slightest degree from her position in the Middle Ages on the relation of church and state. (2) She is withheld only by lack of opportunity and power from completely dominating governments and nations as in the Middle Ages; and she stands ready to do as she did then whenever she can do so without endangering her interests. (3) She considers that the times are auspicious in this country—the classic land of liberty—to claim the favor and support of government that she was accustomed to have on demand in the Middle Ages.

If there is a tendency to look at the church from "the view-point of the Middle Ages," the cause is not far to seek. She takes her stand on the *principles* of the Middle Ages. An investigation of her position to-day shows that the Papacy is one of the very few institutions that it is perfectly proper to judge from "the view-point of the Middle Ages." There is a sense in which she should crave such a view-point. The principles of the Middle Ages will appear more acceptable from the view-point of the Middle Ages than from the view-point of the present age.

When Leo calls attention to the "abundant fruits" that the church would bring forth were she in her "most desirable status," he points directly to all the fiendish atrocities of the Middle Ages that are attributable to state support of the Catholic system, for these were the fruits—the "abundant fruits"—of such a status. It might be possible to forget—at least in the sense of connecting them with the church of to-day—those deeds which blacken the Dark Ages, did not the church by her present conduct and claims force them upon our attention. The most desirable status of the church, according to Leo XIII., is the status that she enjoyed under Innocent III. and Gregory VII. It is a status that in no sense accords with the standards of the age and country in which we live. The declarations of Leo can not be reconciled with the principles of religious and civil freedom which this age is supposed to endorse.

What matters it, even if it were true, that Catholics established religious freedom first in the New World, and that "when America was as yet but a new-born babe, uttering in its cradle its first feeble cries, the church took it to her bosom and motherly embrace"? In the year 1895 Leo XIII. asserts all the powers the church has ever claimed, and says that she should hold such power in the United States.

In 1897 the Duc de Broglie, writing for the church, declares that the Pope "is far from approving the principles of the American Constitution, with its absolute separation of church and state, in matters of religion," and that "the church can never give her approval to the principle of an absolute equality between all forms of religious thought." At the present moment the Pope is mourning over the "painful" situation in which he finds himself because he can not *oppose* the free propaganda of Protestantism in Italy, especially in Rome. As in 1878, he sorrows that "there is no restriction on the press," and that "here [in Rome] Protestant churches are built even in the most populous streets as if to insult us." The Duc de Broglie says that the church is immovable on the point of freedom of conscience for the faithful, and he might have said with more truth that she is equally as immovable on the point of no freedom of conscience for those who are not of the "faithful."

The church may dilate upon her progress, she may loudly claim to have been the first to establish religious freedom in the New World, and to have nurtured the American Republic from its birth, but in spite of all her fair pretenses there appears across her front in bold and unmistakable characters the legend, STATE SUPPORT, SUPREMACY IN CIVIL ADMINISTRATIONS, THE FAVOR OF THE LAWS AND THE PATRONAGE OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY. And even while her words are most plausible and fair there comes from her throat another voice, deeper and more authoritative, saying: "The church can never give her approval to the principle of an absolute equality between all forms of religious thought." "It would be very erroneous to conclude that in America is to be sought the most desirable status of the church." "She would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority." "What the church has done in the past for other nations she will now do for the United States."

The same arrogance and presumption which marked the church in a day of great intellectual darkness are the very same characteristics that she manifests in this day of great intellectual light.

The Papacy has indeed made progress within recent years, but not progress that indicates that she has learned the lesson of tolerance, or that she has learned to separate politics and religion. It is the progress mentioned by Mgr. Satolli in his letter to the New York *World* in March, 1895, following closely upon the publication of the encyclical "to the Americans." At the close of a review of the career of Leo XIII. he said:

"During the seventeen years of his rule nothing has been more remarkable than the incessant growth of his benignant moral influence. To-day his words are listened to with deference by every court, every government, every people. On every question touching universal human interests his counsel is sought eagerly and welcomed gratefully. Despite, then, all the adverse trend of mundane circumstances, despite the loss of the external symbols of its high authority, the Papacy has gained in power and splendor since the accession of the present glorious pontiff. As Macaulay says in one of his most noble essays: 'The Papacy remains, not in decay, not a mere antique, but full of life and youthful vigor.'"

The fact that the encyclical of Leo was received with scarcely a protest in this country demonstrates that the language of Satolli is too well-founded in actual conditions. When the American people listen with deference—as they have listened—to such a document as that sent them by Leo in 1895, an evil day has come for human liberty and "the grand march of progress." The American people should be the first to protest against such assumptions and encroachments upon the principles for which their nation has stood sponsor. But it appears now that they will realize only when it is too late to escape the snare, the meaning and purpose of the policy of Rome which is given with such Jesuitical adroitness in Leo's encyclical "to the Americans."

And now, in conclusion, the writer will say, as when he began, that he has had no desire to attack Catholic individuals from the Pope to the humblest peasant who contributes his "Peter's pence." The Pope is but an old man, not more dangerous or more cruel by nature than other men, and is soon to pass from the pontifical chair to the grave. The people of the Catholic communion are, as Mr. Malone says, much like other people; and they, too, come and go. But "the Papacy remains not in decay, not a mere antique, but full of life and youthful vigor," and always the same in her principles and policies; and it is with the Papacy that the writer has tried to deal.
