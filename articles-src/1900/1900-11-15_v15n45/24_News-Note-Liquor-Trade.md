A WRITER in "Arnold's Practical Sunday School Lessons" says that there are in the United States "about 225,000 liquor dealers and 1,200,000 bartenders." "More liquor is sold in one year than there is pork, wheat, and corn combined." "The drink bill of this Republic is $1,025,000,000." "The physical and moral results of this condition of affairs are shown by the fact that in the State of Ohio alone, out of 9,430 insane people, 5,186 cases were traced to liquor; of 16,335 criminals, 12,596 were drunk when they broke the law." Nevertheless it is a matter of record in the Supreme Court of the United States that "this is a Christian nation."
