## UPHOLDING THE "RIGHTS" OF THE CHURCH.

CARDINAD RAMPOLLA, papal secretary of state, says that "the church needs in Cuba and the Philippines the cooperation of the American Government for the protection of its rights and liberties, as, indeed, the American Government needs the cooperation of the church for the pacification of those countries."

And Archbishop Ireland says: "As a plain matter of fact, the only safety which the Catholic Church at the present time has in the Philippines for the possession of her properties and for the lives of her priests is the protection afforded by the American flag; and all this is fully understood and fully recognized in Rome."

This means that the American Government is to maintain the "rights of the church," as defined by the church, in Cuba and the Philippines. But the true purpose of civil government is not to protect churches, but individuals, and this Government can secure the Catholic Church in the enjoyment of what she claims as her rights only by recognizing the well-known claim of that church to be superior over all other churches, and that she is divinely ordained to rule over men in both spiritual and temporal affairs. These are "rights" always unhesitatingly claimed by the church of Rome.

And as to the question whether the American Government will uphold these "rights" of the church in those countries, it is to be noted that the Pope said to Archbishop Ireland in a recent interview:

"We are well pleased with the relations of the American Government to the church in Cuba and the Philippine Islands. The American Government gives proof of good will, and exhibits in its acts a spirit of justice and of respect for the liberty and rights of the church. The reports we receive from bishops and others indicate this. * * * Under the American Government there will be due respect for rights of property and of conscience.

"You will thank in my name the President of the Republic for what is being done." s.
