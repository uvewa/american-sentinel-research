## A "SPECIAL" SENTINEL.

THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY of December 6 will be a special illustrated number, containing seven or eight half-tone illustrations. It will be printed on an extra fine quality of paper, and will present a very attractive appearance.

The general subject of this "special" issue will be the movement now on foot to secure the Sunday closing of the Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo, beginning next May.

The agitation of this question and the interest in it will be second only to that concerning the closing of the Columbian Exposition in 1893. The advocates of enforced Sunday observance are already at work, and as this matter will be settled long before the exposition opens, there is no time to lose.

Literature treating upon the principles involved in compulsory Sunday observance should be scattered broadcast now while the minds of the people are directed to this subject.

Though it will cost much more than usual to produce this copy of THE SENTINEL, we will supply it at the usual rate of one cent per copy, or $8.00 per thousand.

We will send a limited number at the rate of one and a quarter cents per copy in single wraps to lists of names furnished to us. Please write names and addresses very plainly.

Orders for this number should be sent in as soon as possible so that we shall know how many to print.
