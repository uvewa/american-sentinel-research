"OH, for a good Christian politician!" exclaims the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, as quoted in a recent sermon delivered in New York City. "The average politician," Dr. Sheldon says, "reminds me of the Pharisees, whom Christ likened to whited sepulchers."

If Dr. Sheldon will note what history has to say on the subject of "Christian politicians," we think candor will force him to admit that such persons were never of any great benefit to their own or to later generations, but quite the contrary. The men who have tried to administer Christianity through civil government have succeeded only in discounting both civil government and Christianity, and this not because they were lacking in skill, but because the two are fundamentally different in character. Of course the official of civil government should be an honest man; but it takes more than mere honesty to make an individual a Christian.
