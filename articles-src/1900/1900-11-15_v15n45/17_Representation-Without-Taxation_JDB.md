## "REPRESENTATION WITHOUT TAXATION."

The present is a time of the heaping together of vast treasures, and a time when the just dues of those who reap—the common people whose labor makes wealth of the raw materials of nature—are kept back by fraud. Many are the ways in which this is done and new ways are continually being devised. One of these methods of fraud was quite thoroughly exposed at a mass-meeting held in Central Music Hall, this city, October 29. The meeting was called by the Chicago Teachers' Federation, and the following facts were brought to its attention.

The State Board of Tax Equalization of this State has for years, contrary to law and to the decision of the State and United States Supreme Court, allowed the franchises and capital stock of a great number of large corporations located in Chicago to go untaxed. According to the arrangement of the board the county of Cook must pay a certain proportion of the State tax, so that the escape from taxation of so much property held by these large corporations has greatly increased the burden of taxation on the property of the ordinary people. This increase has been from twenty to fifty per cent. For twenty-three years no railroad in this State has been assessed on its franchises. In 1875 the franchises of the railroads were assessed at twenty-two millions of dollars. In 1899, as for many years previous, no value was given to their franchises. In 1874 two small street-car lines in Chicago were paying taxes on franchises valued at over a million dollars. In 1899 seven hundred miles of electric and cable car lines paid no tax whatever on their franchises. In 1874, three years after the Chicago fire, the board of equalization assessed the franchises of two gas companies in Chicago at a half million dollars. In 1899, when the gas trust had almost exclusive occupancy of hundreds of miles of streets in Chicago, there was no franchise tax, though the company had informed its stockholders that its franchise was worth fifty million dollars.

The Teachers' Federation finds that twenty-three corporations alone in the city of Chicago are escaping taxation on franchises and stocks to the amount of $235,829,000. Only one street-car line in Chicago pays taxes on its franchise, and it is only two or three blocks in length. The other companies owning hundreds of miles of street railways pay no tax whatever on their franchises.

These corporations are required to fill out blanks and submit them to the board of equalization. In the places where the value of stocks and franchises are required by law to be given they write "Unknown," and this is accepted by the board. In a number of instances it has been found that companies making such report have within a few weeks of the time of making the report given to their stockholders the exact statement of the value of such properties.

Speeches were made on this matter by prominent men. One speaker said that "no taxation without representation was the principle of the Revolutionary fathers, but now the tendency seems to be representation without taxation." It was pointed out that those who own the most valuable and paying properties, on which there is scarcely any taxation, are the very ones who have most influence with boards of equalizers and legislatures.

The closing speech was made by John L. Spalding, Roman Catholic bishop of Peoria, whose words are always marked by deep thought, and seem in this case to be inspired by the highest considerations of justice and morality. His speech dealt not so much with the particular matter under consideration, but with the state of affairs from which it springs and of which it is a symptom. He declared that notwithstanding the fact that the people of to-day are accustomed to congratulate themselves that the world is getting better than it used to be, and that they can bring statistics to prove it, the power of moral indignation seems to be gradually creeping away from men. They stand silent in the presence of great wrongs. This he declared to be the sure forerunner of moral death. Greed seems to be in complete control. It is the dominating motive in almost everything. It seems to be more important to have great commercial interests than to sustain manhood and womanhood. Gold is thought to supply every human need. The things that men make are considered of more value than the men themselves. The truth that happiness and virtue have their springs within and not without, seems to be passing from the minds of men in the mad accumulation of material things. Greed and commercialism are dominating all the organized institutions of society.

Speaking directly of trusts, he said: "Corporations which use franchises given them by the people to defraud the people are worse than highway robbers. By their oppressions they make the conditions of human existence almost unendurable to great numbers of people, and drive poor men and poor women into crime. The trusts urge that they act in self-defense. Competition is fierce and their existence depends upon their supremacy. Well, men may fight in self-defense, they may go so far as to kill men in self-defense, but they must not corrupt and debase men in self-defense; and the self-defense of the trust must stop when it comes to corrupting and debasing society. It is said that a corporation has no soul. Well, a trust has a soul; it has the soul of a devil, and it goes about seeking whom it may devour. The organized powers of society seem to be gradually developing into government of the trust, by the trust, and for the trust more than one of the people, by the people, and for the people. If things continue as they are at present, within fifty or one hundred years there will be a few great corporations, and most of the people will be servants and slaves."

The bishop declared that one of the most erroneous and dangerous ideas that seemed to have at the present time the strong endorsement of public opinion was that legality is justice. "All the great crimes of history," he declared, "have been legal. The Christian martyrs were executed and the horrors of the Inquisition were carried on according to law."
