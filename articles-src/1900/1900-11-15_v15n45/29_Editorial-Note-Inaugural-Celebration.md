"WASHINGTON leaders," we are now informed, "are preparing a most imposing celebration" for the next presidential inaugural. "We should strive," says one member of the inaugural committee, "to excel in the glory of that day the splendor of the jubilee of England's queen."

These words are suggestive, but not of republican government.
