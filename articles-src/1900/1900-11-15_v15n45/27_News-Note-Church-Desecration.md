GENERAL THOMAS M. ANDERSON, who commanded the first expedition of soldiers sent to the Philippines, denies the charge made recently by Bishop McFaul in the North American Review that Catholic churches were desecrated by American soldiers. The general says: "While our American soldiers are not altogether saintly, it is not true that they have looted and desecrated churches."
