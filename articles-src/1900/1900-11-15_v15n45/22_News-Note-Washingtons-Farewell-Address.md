THE president of the League for Social Service, Dr. Josiah Strong, has written a book dealing with the subject of "expansion," in which he says that new conditions have rendered necessary a revision of Washington's Farewell Address. "Reduced to its simplest terms," Doctor Strong says, "Washington's advice amounts to this, 'Let us mind our own business.' Admirable advice for that age and equally good for this. Then our business was confined to this continent; now it is in the ends of the earth. By all means let us mind it."

In this Doctor Strong voices the sentiment of most of the modern "reform" leagues and societies.
