## A SUNDAY BILL IN ARGENTINA.

A Sunday-rest bill has been introduced in the legislature of the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, South America, which contains the following provisions:

"ARTICLE I. The legal working day in the province shall not exceed a maximum of twelve hours, Sunday being excluded. ["This sentence," says our correspondent, "is quite blind in the Spanish. I suppose it means that on Sunday no amount of work shall be done."]

"ART. 2. The townships or, in their stead, the executive power, are authorized to arrange the details of this precept and to enforce it, making the Sunday rest effective, as also the resting hours in the summer months." [The resting hours are from 11 A. M. to 2 or 3 P. M. Some townships enforced them last summer during the excessive heat.]

For a copy of this bill we are indebted to Mr. John Vuilleumier, a Protestant missionary now in Argentina, who sends us also some extracts from a speech made in favor of the bill by its author, Senor Ramon Lucero. It is interesting to note the ground taken in support of Sunday legislation in this Catholic country of South America, the province in question being, we are informed, a stronghold of the Jesuits. The senor said:

"Rest is a physical and moral necessity; where it is not granted, it must be enforced; where it is not used as a privilege, it must be enforced as a coercive measure; human solidarity commands us to defend the weak not only against the strong but also against themselves. * * *

"Thus is explained the fact that from the most remote times, we find rest established in the legislation of all civilized nations, either as a religious duty or, more generally, as a favor granted to slaves who in this way had a day of rest each week. [He here quoted Plato.]

"This precept is also practised in modern civilization, and it is noted that the most active, prosperous and free nations are those precisely who keep Sunday most strictly and who devote a larger part of this day to rest and sport. [Italics ours.]

"Nothing is so impressive as the spectacle presented on this day by the English people and the people of the United States. Nobody works; industry and commerce close their doors; theatres and concerts are empty; museums, and even international expositions, remain closed, while railroads stop their march."

The senor quoted from a speech by Macaulay in a debate in the House of Commons where an immense majority rejected a motion to open the museums on Sundays. Also, from Gladstone, to whom he attributed the statement that "it is necessary to secure for the people by all available means the benefits of a day of rest." He said further:

"In the North American Union, the mother of our own institutions, this matter has always been so considered. During the Revolutionary War, Washington gave his army the following order: 'In the future, the general leaves the troops free from duty on each and every Sunday, so that they may attend to their religious duties and take some rest.'

"Lincoln, while President, gave the army the following order on the 15th of November, 1862: 'The President, commander-in-chief of the armies of sea and land, would recommend to the officers, soldiers and marines under the flag, the observance of Sunday. Should we desecrate this day and the name of the Almighty, we might endanger the discipline and the reputation of our armies and jeopardize the cause which they defend.'

"And finally, a law of the North American Congress says: 'The sanctification of Sunday is an institution of public interest, a special means of honoring, in the house and church of God, the Creator and Providence of the Universe.' As a consequence, it is prohibited under fine to open groceries on that day or to attend any concert, ball, or theatre."

The author of the bill then talked of "rest as a physical and moral necessity," and claimed that the legislature has power to legislate in matters of "hygiene, public health, and public order."

In his quotations and statements relating to the United States the senor draws heavily on his imagination, as in general speakers in behalf of Sunday legislation are prone to do. It is to be noted also that in Argentina it is assumed that the legislature has the same right to decree and enforce hours of rest on any day that it has to enforce rest on Sunday, and truly the one proceeding is no less arbitrary than the other. The people of Argentina accept such arbitrary measures because they have not known the liberty enjoyed by the people of North America. The idea of devoting a considerable part of Sunday to sport, as advocated by the author of this bill, is quite in keeping with Roman Catholic teaching touching the manner in which the day should be observed.
