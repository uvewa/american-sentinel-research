Civil government has no authority to define sin, and neither the authority nor the wisdom to deal with an act as a sin. No sin can be rightly dealt with save by the universal and all-wise Sovereign. And as the transgression of the moral law is always sin, that law does not come within the scope of civil government. A sin is a blow struck at God's government, but civil government is not ordained to look after the things of God. Its purpose is to secure life, liberty, and property to individuals in society.
