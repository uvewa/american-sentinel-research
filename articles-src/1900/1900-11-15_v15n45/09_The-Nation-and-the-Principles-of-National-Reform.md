## THE NATION AND THE RINCIPLES OF NATIONAL REFORM.

Ever since 1863 the National Reform Association has been at work in this country trying to undo the work of the founders of this Government. Very naturally the special objects of their attack have been the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. Touching the first of these documents, at least it would seem that their work is done, their warfare accomplished.

All these years these Reformers have denied that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. In a convention held in Sedalia, Mo., May 23 and 24, 1889, Rev. W. P. Gray, the secretary of the convention, said:

"I for one do not believe that as a political maxim governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And so the object of this movement is to change that feature in our fundamental law. * * * And I see in this reform a providence teaching us the necessity of recognizing something else besides the will of the people as the basis of government."

This doctrine was most industriously taught for years by pulpit and press, in schools and colleges; taught not only as sound political doctrine, but as Christian doctrine, until it became familiar to the ears of the men now prominent in public affairs, and proper conditions only were wanting to bring to its full fruitage this evil seed-sowing.

The proper conditions came as a consequence of the Spanish-American war. Without any special design, merely as one of the incidents of war, this Government found itself in possession of the harbor of Manila, the capital of a large and rich group of Pacific islands. The natives were in revolt against their former masters, the minions of Spain. Like the American colonists of a century and a quarter ago, these people were trying to throw off a foreign yoke and establish a government of their own. The generous impulses of a free people inclined Americans to second this effort, and from the archives of state was heard a voice saying:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

Never before had the Declaration of Independence spoken in vain, but now its voice falls upon ears deaf to the plea of justice. Ambition said: The young colossus of the West must be like all the nations—a great world-power. Greed pointed to the rich lands, to the undeveloped mines, to the virgin forests, to the teaming millions ready to exchange gold, and pearls, and various rare but rich materials for the products of the forge and factory of the busy West.

Other voices, too, were heard in excited and angry denial of the principle of government by the consent of the governed. The National Reform doctrine that governments do not derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, suddenly found many advocates. It was voiced by press and pulpit, by clergymen and statesmen. The clergyman pleaded the spiritual needs of the natives and the great advantage that would accrue to the church from American rule in the Philippines, and urged that it was a sacred duty to follow the "evident leading of divine Providence." The plea of the statesman was the difficulty of withdrawing from the islands, the need of coaling stations and fortified harbors in the far East, the obligation a great nation is under to civilization, and the duty of the Government to open to commerce every avenue that promises fair returns on invested capital; and last, but not least, that the possession of this Eastern empire, to be had for the taking, was "manifest destiny."

But, whatever the argument, all the advocates of the new imperial policy united in denying the doctrine of the fathers of the Republic that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And then, after the question was fully discussed, the people spoke upon it in a general election, and by their votes sanctioned the doctrine that governments do not derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

And now what is the next step in this apostasy from the principles of republicanism? Clearly this, to deny at home and as applying to American citizens the doctrine of equal rights as it has been denied as applied to "inferior" races in distant islands. It was Lincoln who said: "This government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free." The same principle exactly is stated by Froude when he says: "If there is one lesson which history clearly teaches, it is this, that free nations can not govern subject provinces. If they are unable or unwilling to admit their dependencies to share their own constitution, the constitution itself will fall to pieces from mere incompetence for its duties."

The spirit of arbitrary power has possessed the people. It manifests itself not alone in the dealings of the general Government with the Philippine Islands, not alone in the usurpations of the trusts, nor in both of these, but in the readiness of the people themselves to disregard the very foundation principles of free government if, perchance, such principles stand in the way of carrying out the popular will.

The National Reform attack upon the doctrine of equal, natural rights has been successful. The people have been educated away from the Declaration of Independence and into the doctrine that men are entitled only to such rights, or more properly, only to such privileges, as the state sees fit to grant them. This is where we as a people stand today. Are we individually ready for the issue? "Ye can discern the face of the sky: but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" B.
