## APPLYING THE GOLDEN RULE.

A WRITER on the solution of a certain question recently said, "We have committed the Golden Rule to heart: now let us commit it to life." Some may think this does not mean very much, but if once considered in all of its force and power it will be found to be the very best solution of every difficulty.

Let us get this rule before us that we may study it: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." MATT. 7: 12. This command has been usually called the Saviour's Golden Rule, a name given to it on account of its great value.

All that you expect or desire of others under similar circumstances, do to them. Act not from selfishness or injustice, but put yourself in the place of the other, and ask what you would expect of him then. This brings the living principle of the rule into the life and causes one to respect the rights, the privileges, and the honor of every other one.

The Golden Rule committed to life makes one impartial and just in all things. It destroys envy, false conduct, unkindness, slander, theft, adultery, and murder. It has been well said that this law is what the balance wheel is to machinery. It would prevent all irregularity of movement in the moral world, as that does in a steam-engine.

Its application is easy, and its justice is seen by all men, and when inwrought in the heart and reduced to deeds, all will acknowledge its force and value.

While reasoning together upon the quoted words above, an ancient rabbi said to a man: "Whatever is hateful to you, do not do to another." All existing difficulties could be settled by this rule, and obedience to it would prevent further difficulties.

The application of this rule, committed to life, would enlarge the sphere of justice for all men; but the principles must be applied in Christ's way. The Golden Rule must be applied in the individual life before it can be applied in the collective life. Its power must be the Spirit of God received by faith. Politics, human science, and man-made theories are all powerless, but the Golden Rule is all powerful in all men who commit it to life. Does any man wish to be deprived of his right to worship God according to his own conscience? Does he wish to be compelled to serve God as some one else may dictate? Then will he in any way lend his influence to deprive others of this right or compel them to adopt certain forms of worship? Certainly not! Committing this rule to life, then, guarantees perfect liberty, perfect freedom, and perfect equality. In this rule we find persuasion, not compulsion; freedom, not servitude; love, not hatred.

Jesus of Nazareth is the Saviour of the human race. In his principles of justice, in his principles of brotherhood we find the solution of every difficulty, the settling of every question, for a question is never settled until it is settled right, according to truth. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts."

"If any one knock at the door of my heart," said Luther, "and ask, 'Does Martian Luther live here?' I would answer, 'No; he has moved out to make room for Christ to move in.'" Committing the Golden Rule to life is Christ moving in, and the Golden Rule committed to life is God working in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

It is one thing to study a lesson to recite it, but it is quite an other thing to study a lesson to know it. Committing the Golden Rule to mind is of little value to any one, but committing it to life is of great value to the individual and to all who have to do with him. It makes home happy, communities peaceful, churches Christ-like, and, finally, gains an entrance through the gates into the city of God.

W. H. Thurston.
