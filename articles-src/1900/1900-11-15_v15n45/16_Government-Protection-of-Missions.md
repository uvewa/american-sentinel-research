## GOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF MISSIONS.

By Rev. J. T. Gracey, D.D., President of the International Missionary Union, in the Missionary Review of the World.

The utterances of Lord Salisbury about the triumphs of missionaries in early church history, without government protection, may be a diplomatic hint of a change of policy in government patronage of the modern missionary. But Lord Salisbury needed not to go back so far to find illustrations of the success of non-combative evangelism, and there is little ground for his intimation that Protestant missionaries rely unduly on the arm of flesh.

Rev. J. Hudson Taylor, of the China Inland Mission, has under his leadership missionary subjects of several of the western powers. Does anybody suppose he would like to see a syndicate of these powers combined for their protection? Members of that mission tell of riotous persecution, involving imminent peril to their own lives, without a hint to government about redress, which advertised the mission and provoked investigation of Chinese hitherto indifferent to it, and this resulted in conversions, and from among these specific converts came some of the most efficient evangelists and leaders of the native church. Bishop Ridley, of Caledonia, tells of his being spat upon, knocked down, and kicked about by savage ruffians, without any thought of appealing to his own British government to keep the peace in British Columbia. The brute who abused him afterward clasped his feet and begged his pardon, and at last died a triumphant Christian. The inherent might of this non-combative love has won victory for hundreds of modern Christian converts from heathendom. It is the native Christians that have to bear the brunt of persecution without redress from civil or political source.

Bishop Ridley tells of a heathen band who entered the church of Indian Christians and forbade their reading the Bible to the people. Because they would not promise to comply with this demand the savages tore down the edifice with axes and bars, and because it was too great a task to pull down the tower, set fire to it and burned it up. One young Christian said, "Shall we not fight for the house of God?" An older Christian replied, "No; Jesus never fought, he died. We will rather die than fight." There was no appeal to government for redress; no requisition for punishment of the criminals. They bore it all meekly and lovingly, declining to "put up a good fight in the name of the Prince of Peace," and the result was the conversion of the tribe to which the men of the mob belonged—the strongest tribe on the Pacific coast. "From that night onward," said one of the rioters, "I dreaded the Spirit of God. * * * When I hunted among the mountains the Spirit of God hunted me, and I was afraid." Another man was one day holding the tape measure while the bishop was measuring out the best site in the town to begin a new church, when he said, "Bishop, do you know that that hand set fire to the church? It did; and until I heard the native preacher say that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin, I never had peace in my heart, but when I heard that my fear went away."

## Triumphs of Grace.

All mission lands have furnished such illustrations of the triumphs of grace. Chinese Christians are eminent in these ranks. The case of Ling Ching Ting is well known. Persecuted, falsely accused, and sentenced to two thousand bamboo stripes, which left him almost lifeless and his back a jelly, his first words on being able to speak were, "Teacher, this poor body is in great pain just now. * * * Jesus is with me. I think perhaps he is going to take me to heaven, and I will be glad to go. But if I get up from this you will let me go back to Hok-chiang, won't you?" Back to the men who had falsely incriminated him and beaten him almost to death, without any civil protection or other assurance of his safety, his Christian zeal carried him, and he won these enemies to Christ.

No; Lord Salisbury needed not to go back so far to point the moral of the triumph of the principles of Christianity without government patronage. Nor will he be likely to have to wait long for similar illustrations. The most perplexing problem likely to confront missionary boards in China is not how to procure indemnity, nor how to secure civil and political guardianship for missionaries, but how to deter missionaries from re-entering fields where the danger is most imminent. If the missionary societies were to make the call for volunteers to enter the most perilous place in China a score of men and women would proffer their services to one that they could send, men who would spurn the suggestion that they must have government guaranty for their safety. Lone missionary women have not been regardful of the restrictions of consuls from re-entering isolated stations near the locality of the massacres of the Foochow provinces. Missionaries in Uganda have not asked the powers to avenge their personal injury, and elsewhere they have braved the dangers which the governments have superadded to those of the heathen conditions. The missionaries were not responsible for the Indian mutiny. It was the "hut tax" innovation in Sierra Leone that resulted in the massacre of missionaries. It is the abominations of the "concessions" that create peril for missionaries in other African colonies. The South African war is not a "missionary" war. Missionaries did not suggest "treaties" with North American Indians nor with Chinese. Hon. William B. Reed, as minister plenipotentiary, put the missionary clause into the treaties with China. Missionaries did not solicit it. Even French Roman Catholic missionaries did not take the initiative in this compact. They come under "the most favored nation" clause.

It was not missionaries, but United States Plenipotentiary Hon. Anson Burlingame, who put into a treaty with China the axiom that one of the fundamental rights of mankind was the privilege to change one's residence. If that was a fallacy the United States was the first to override it by Congressional act; the Chinese government did not dispute the proposition then, nor has it since done so. It is not missionaries, but John Barrett, ex-minister of our Government to Siam, and who, it is rumored, is a possible successor to Mr. Conger, who says: "We can not recall our missionaries unless we are ready to recall our merchants."

## Indemnities for Missionaries.

Of what use has the treaty with Turkey been to restore values destroyed in the Armenian massacres? Has the American Board ceased its operations while waiting for a paltry hundred thousand dollars, for the collection of which a "naval demonstration," costing far more than that sum, is reported as imminent?

Missionary indemnity for damage done American missions in this present uprising in China would not figure at all, except in name or principle—it would scarcely, at the utmost, reach one three-hundredth part of the money indemnity which has been mentioned as a probable sum to be requisitioned by the United States from China. If money indemnity is to be demanded from China it must be too long a coming to be of avail for missionary rehabilitation.

China cares nothing for demand of blood; life is too cheap. Somebody dies when this is insisted on, but generally not the person who committed the crime. The punishment of officials by degrading them is a temporary farce; the deposed officers being reappointed to some other office, and presently advanced higher than ever. Chinese are amenable to but two kinds of punishment—loss of territory and cash indemnity. But any considerable cash indemnity, such as the two hundred million dollars to Japan in the late war, means outrages of "squeezing," and corruption, and oppression, against which, when pressed too far, the ordinary Chinese rebels, and the native Christian seeks protection of the missionary patronage.

To appeal for "indemnity" is, therefore, a course which complicates the missionary situation, and it is probable the boards in America may forego their technical claims in the case of China. The United States is not likely to take a territorial indemnity, and she may have to administer some form of Chinese imperial revenue, if ever she gets a cash equivalent. The whole situation is so complicated that missionary societies and missionaries may pause before reaching any conclusions as to the course they should pursue.

But what governments are to do is quite another question. It was, perhaps is, "in the air," that Lord Salisbury's speech was a manifesto, indicating that the allied powers might withdraw all government protection from missionaries hereafter. But France is not likely to consent to that. She has always extended her protection over Roman Catholic missions as a matter of state policy. With a million of adherents in China, and her "chief priests" advanced to mandarins she is not likely now to retreat from her precedents, and especially when precedents are pretexts for her meddling with politics through missions for five hundred years in the far East. The Russian Empire is inseparable from the Greek Church, and it is not likely she will attempt the impossible, and tell her bishops and other ecclesiastical functionaries in her missions in Peking that she will not protect them. Great Britain's policy of colonization includes the missionary as advance courier of commerce, and she is not likely to begin a differentiation against the missionary as a "subject," when she spent two millions in Egypt to defend a "subject" who was a Jew. The United States would brook no discrimination between classes of her "citizens."

But government patronage and protection is not a missionary question; it is distinctly a government matter. Missionaries would differ among themselves as widely as any other citizens would, as to how the government's action would affect missionary or political interests. The writer asked an experienced missionary of Constantinople what would be the effect on missions if the government withdrew from them their protection in their civil capacity, and he replied, "I would not like to see it tried in Turkey." Another missionary from the interior of China replied to the same question, "The only effect on the Chinese mind would be that they would attribute it to weakness."

That the protection of missionaries as subjects or citizens has its own perplexities is conceded, but it is not a missionary problem, it is a state question. They would find that Lord Salisbury's appeal to return to primitive practice would not afford them any relief. There are men who would face the antagonism of their own governments as quickly as they would that of a heathen one to preach Christ in the regions beyond. The Moravian missionaries to the Iroquois were imprisoned in the city of New York because they would not desist. When Dr. Schauffler was told by the Russian minister at Constantinople, "My master, the Czar, will not let you put foot on that territory," Schauffler's immortalized reply was, "My Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, will not ask the Czar of all the Russias where he shall put his foot."
