## A TALE OF TWO NATIONS.

### The Fathers: The Consent of the Governed, and the "Party Spirit."

(Concluded.)

GEORGE WASHINGTON was followed by John Adams, who, in one terse paragraph, set forth his mind on the menace of political parties:

"In the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties, if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. *If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good.* If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance."—Inaugural of John Adams, Philadelphia, Pa., March 4, 1797.

The manly honesty of the foregoing citations is touching in its simplicity. They breathe lofty ideals for the new-born Republic. Instinctively our better natures turn to them as we whisper a prayer over our present lot, and sorrow that the wishes of the Fathers have not been realized in their sons.

We think of the picture of things as Washington and Adams hoped they would be, and contrast it with events as they now are. We hear on every side the jangle of cheap political talk. We see the "spirit of revenge" natural "to party dissension." Once again it perpetrates "the most horrid enormities," and is itself a "frightful despotism." And we know only too well that all of this will lead at length "to a more formal and permanent despotism." The result can only be as it has been so many times before, that men will "seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual." Then the last sad act in the failure of self-government will be enacted: "The chief of some prevailing faction, more able or fortunate than his competitors, will turn this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation ON THE RUINS OF PUBLIC LIBERTY." And the fire of "party spirit," instead of "warming," will indeed "consume."

The men who framed the Constitution thought that they had devised a scheme for the election of the chief magistrate of the Republic, which would make him Olympian in his administration, and raise him above all party faction. They adopted the device of a double election.

The Constitution directs each State to choose a number of presidential electors equal to the number of its representatives in both houses of Congress. These electors are directed to meet some weeks later in their respective States, on a day fixed by law, and give their votes in writing for President and vice-President.

It was thought that this plan would secure the choice by the best citizens of every State, in a quiet and deliberate manner, of the man whom they in their unfettered discretion should deem most fitted to be chief executive of the Union. The votes were not to be counted by States, so that the vote of each and every elector would have its full weight.

No part of the Constitution has so utterly belied the expectations of the framers as this. The President of the United States is not elected by a comparatively small body of men, the best citizens of all the States. He is not elected by such men sitting in quietude in their different States, undisturbed by party orators and popular influences. The presidential electors have become a mere cog-wheel in the machine; a mere contrivance for giving effect to the decision of the people. "Their personal qualifications are a matter of indifference. They have no discretion, but are chosen under a pledge." They are bound to vote for a particular candidate. In choosing them the people virtually chose the President.

That all of these things are not as the Fathers intended them is very evident. That the founders of the nation designed this double election in order to eliminate the influence of party is also patent. But their hopes have not been fulfilled, and in nothing does party and party machinery control to a greater extent than in the closing of the President of the United States.

Party spirit now dominates, and party spirit, according to the thought of the Fathers, is destructive of a really free and popular form of government. But be it so. The ideals of Washington, and Adams, and Jefferson, and Madison have not been realized. The ideals of Christians, as far as the things of this world are concerned, are not realized. Nevertheless we must labor on, pray on, and ask the great Dispenser of events to bless our rulers and those in authority.
PERCY T. MAGAN.
