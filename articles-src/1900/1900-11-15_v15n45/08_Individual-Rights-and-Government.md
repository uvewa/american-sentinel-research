"ALL men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." These rights belong only to individuals; they do not belong to the civil government nor to the church.

The reason these rights belong only to individuals is that they come from the Creator, who bestowed them upon man—the individual. God created the individual, but the existing organizations of individuals are the work of man himself.

It might seem that since individuals have these rights they must belong to the government which the individuals compose. But to make these rights inherent in the government would be to take them away from the ones on whom the Creator bestowed them. If, for example, the government had an unalienable right to existence it might, if necessary, sacrifice the lives of all the people under it merely to perpetuate itself, thus depriving the people of their own unalienable right to life, which it is the very purpose of the government to preserve. It is often assumed, indeed, that the civil government does have the right to sacrifice any number of human lives for the sake of preserving its own life; but such an assumption reverses the truth which expresses the purpose of human governments. The government exists to serve the people, not the people to serve the government.

Nor has a church an unalienable right to existence which the civil power is bound to preserve. Individuals may and should live at peace with one another, but religions are necessarily at war with one another, and two churches, representing different religions, are necessarily opposed to each other. Christianity is opposed to paganism, Protestantism is opposed to the Papacy, and each religion would if it could exterminate all the others. Protestants would gladly convert every Catholic in the world to Protestantism, and Catholics would as gladly turn back every Protestant to the fold of Rome. Protestants would thus, if they could, destroy every Catholic church in the world, and Catholics would likewise destroy every Protestant church. And with it all the civil government could not in any way properly interfere.

If the civil government did interfere to perpetuate any church it would of necessity exercise its power against the church or churches which might be standing in opposition to the church thus favored. If, for example, the American Government should exercise its power to preserve the "rights" of "the church" (Catholic) in the Philippines it would necessarily uphold that church against the Protestant church, which is there, as everywhere, contending against it. The Government would necessarily set itself against the spiritual agencies by which Protestanism is seeking the overthrow of the Papacy in the Philippines, as it is in all places where the two religions come in contact. Such a thing would be utterly at variance with the ordained purpose of civil government.

Therefore the civil power can not undertake to maintain the "rights" of church. If it does it will inevitably fail to maintain the rights of individuals opposed to that church. The one thing that civil government can and should do is to maintain the rights of the individual. And when it does this it can not fail to pursue a just course with respect to the church. When the government protects the rights of every man no man will have any just cause for complaint, and when no man complains no complaint will be heard from the church.
