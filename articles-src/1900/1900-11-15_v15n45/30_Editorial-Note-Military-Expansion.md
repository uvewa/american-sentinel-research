The chief of the navigation bureau, admiral Crowninshield, now tells us that the United States navy must be made four times as strong as it is, in order to be in condition "to fight a first-class European power;" and Senator Proctor, of the senate committee on military affairs, says that the regular army we have heretofore maintained is "absurdly small," and that no doubt Congress will at its next session increase it 55,000 or 60,000 men, and authorize the President to increase it to 100,000 if he thinks best.
