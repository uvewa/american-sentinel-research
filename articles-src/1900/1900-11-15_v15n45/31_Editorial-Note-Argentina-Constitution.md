A CORRESPONDENT in Argentina, from whom we quote elsewhere in this issue, writes that "most of the provincial constitutions, as also the federal constitution, here in Argentina make definite provisions in favor of liberty of conscience, but at the same time they state that the Roman Catholic religion is the religion of the state, to be by it devoutly sustained and protected."

You may smile at the inconsistency of this; but is it any more so than for a North American State to assure liberty of conscience to its citizens and at the same time to require all of them to do honor to a day it designates as the "Christian Sabbath"?
