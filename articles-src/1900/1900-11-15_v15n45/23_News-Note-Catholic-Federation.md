SPEAKING of the proposed Catholic federation the Catholic Mirror says it is essential to "remove politics from the contemplated sphere of action," and then shows how this expression is to be taken by referring to Windthorst, the noted leader of the Catholic party in the German Reichstag, as "a statesman and political leader," who "is to be admired," and "to be commended as an example to every Catholic youth." Herr Windthorst and his party held the balance of power in the Reichstag, and the government could pass its cherished measures through that body only by making great concessions to the Catholic Church.

With this federation standing behind it and holding the balance of political power in this country the Catholic Church says: "We want and demand the removal of all disability arising from sectarian bigotry and hate, whether in the minds of the leaders of one party or the bosses of another."
