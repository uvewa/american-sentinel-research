WE are informed that Messrs. R. S. Owen and Josiah Nash, of Amory, Miss., the former a Seventh-day Adventist elder, are threatened with the penalties of the Sunday law of that State. Mr. Nash, at the last report, had been arrested, and Elder Owen had been notified to appear before the circuit court. These men are not put under arrest because they have been molesting their neighbors or interfering with any person's rights; for no one brings such a charge against them. But they have been doing violence to the religious sentiment of the majority where they live, by refusing to honor Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. Even this might not have brought the law upon them; but they have brought in a rival religion, which exalts the seventh day of the week in place of the first; and so the religious majority have seized upon the favorite weapon against such—the Sunday law—and intend to put them down. It is not these men, but their religion, which they are trying to arrest.
