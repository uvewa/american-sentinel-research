# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 15, 1900 (v15n11)

## 1. "COMPILESION" in Editorial Notes

- **Location:** Page 1, Editorial Notes section (file: `01_Editorial-Notes.md`)
- **Issue:** The word "COMPILESION" appears in the OCR source: "*COMPILESION, when exercised in religion, only stirs up unholy and bitter passions in the soul.*"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "COMPILESION" (preserved as OCR output)
- **Confidence:** LOW — Almost certainly an OCR error for "COMPULSION." The sentence reads perfectly with "Compulsion" and is a common theme in this publication. However, without access to the original scan, this cannot be confirmed with certainty.
- **Reason:** Transcribed as OCR provided; flagged for verification against original scan. If original reads "COMPULSION," correct in transcription.

## 2. "Banz Draft" in Publisher's Notice

- **Location:** Page 13, publisher's subscription notice (not transcribed as article — classified as subscription/advertisement)
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "Remit by P. O. Money Order, or Express Order, or by Banz Draft on New York."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Expected reading:** "Bank Draft"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "Banz" is almost certainly an OCR error for "Bank." Not transcribed as article content; noted here for completeness.

## 3. Attribution of "Light Breaking in Ecuador" (file: `03_Light-Breaking-in-Ecuador.md`)

- **Location:** Page 2, following the "Sabbath Was Made for Man" article
- **Issue:** This item has no explicit divider (`---`) before it and no heading. It flows directly after the Sabbath article and ends with "—N. Y. Independent." This pattern identifies it as a reprint from the N.Y. Independent.
- **Decision:** Treated as a separate reprint article. The title "Light Breaking in Ecuador" was supplied editorially based on content, as no title appears in the original.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — The separation from the Sabbath article is inferred from the clear subject change and the reprint attribution at the end.

## 4. Author of "Fighting for Home and Freedom" (file: `10_Fighting-for-Home-and-Freedom.md`)

- **Location:** Page 6, bottom
- **Issue:** This brief quotation has no attribution. It may be a quote from a speech or editorial reprinted without source identification, or an original editorial note.
- **Decision:** Treated as `editorial` attribution.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## 5. D. T. Bourdeau identified as "A Frenchman"

- **Location:** Page 7, "Serious Thoughts About the United States" (file: `11_Serious-Thoughts-About-the-United-States_DTB.md`)
- **Note:** The article identifies the author as "BY D. T. BOURDEAU. (A Frenchman.)" — D. T. Bourdeau is Daniel T. Bourdeau, a French-Canadian Adventist minister. The "Frenchman" descriptor is part of the original text and has been preserved in the article body.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
