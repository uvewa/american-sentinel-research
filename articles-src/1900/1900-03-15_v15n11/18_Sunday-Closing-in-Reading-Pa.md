Since Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts visited the city of Reading about three weeks ago, many things are being agitated; foremost, Sunday closing and Curfew ordinance.

The Ministerial Association, W. C. T. U., Y. M. C. A., and the Barbers' Union, have "joined hands" and closed all barber shops except a few, and if they will not come to terms they must take the consequences.

The Barbers' Union have reduced the rates in favor of such as are not yet in the Union, and so if they will join and co-operate in the Sunday closing, many unpleasant things may be avoided.

The druggists are talking Sunday closing too; some wax quite hot in advocating the scheme as being a panacea for many ills.
