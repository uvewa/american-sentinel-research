IT is almost universally conceded that the old "Blue Laws," in which class the Sunday laws are placed, have been outgrown; they are not supported in this day by the sentiment of the people. This should be a plain sign that the time has come to remove such laws from the statute books. But instead of this, the effort is generally made to enforce them as if they were the outgrowth of modern necessities and sentiment. Why not sever these dead branches from the tree of progress instead of trying to nourish them again into life? The tree cannot be benefited, but only injured, by such endeavors.
