THE pessimist, says the Union Signal, is "the man who professes to believe that evil sits enthroned in the human heart and in the world," and such a person "is, to say the least, a very superficial thinker and observer." We wonder if the author of this statement has ever observed and thought about this declaration of Scripture: "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked"? or others which speak of the devil as the "prince of this world"? Not to have observed these plain texts is superficial observing; and not to believe them shows both superficial observing and thinking.
