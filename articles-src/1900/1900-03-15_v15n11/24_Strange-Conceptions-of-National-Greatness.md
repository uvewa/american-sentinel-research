FOR over half a century this nation has been saying to all the great powers of Europe, "Hands off this hemisphere; no planting of offshoots of European monarchies in this quarter of the globe;" and not one of Europe's crowned heads has dared to disregard it. And yet some "eminent statesmen" in this country have just discovered that the United States is a "world power;" and that because it vanquished the decrepit kingdom of Spain! See p. 163. Some people have strange conceptions of national greatness.
