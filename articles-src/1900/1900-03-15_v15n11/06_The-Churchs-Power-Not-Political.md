[In a religious exchange (Melbourne, Aus.) we note the following good advice given to those churches which believe they cannot obtain the power needed to do their appointed work in the earth without seeking to politics:—]

In writing to the Ephesians Paul tells them of the "exceeding greatness" of divine power. Eph. 1:19. God is not, therefore, curtailed in his operations for want of power. He is able to give power to the faint, "and to them that have no might he increaseth strength."

The fact that God possesses power, and that he alone can bestow it, is but too often overlooked by the church of God. After telling the disciples that all power in heaven and in earth was given him, Christ commissioned his followers to tarry at Jerusalem until they were endued with power from "on high." Luke 24:49. Power to work for God must come from on high. Power from any other source can but mar and hinder his design.

Had the church of God but been faithful to her mission, the Pentecostal baptism would have followed and sanctified her work through all the ages. She would not then have needed to link herself with any earthly combination of forces, or lean on the arm of any earthly government for assistance.

In the Baptist Union Assembly, held at Leeds, England, Sept. 27, 1899, the president, John Clifford, D. D., made use of the following statement in his address:—

"We dare not let politics alone. They are part of our religion. We should be disloyal to the King of kings if we failed in our duty to the state. The state is dear to us as the God-ordered instrument for the promotion of his rule of justice and peace and brotherhood; and it is one of our duties, first, to make the Parliament through which it acts really adequate for its work, and next, to use it so that the work may be well and faithfully done."

But God has not sent his church on a mission to Parliament. He gave his people command to go and preach the gospel to every creature. The church has nothing to do with fitting the Parliament for its work, or in seeing that its work is well done. God has ordained governmental power, for "the powers that be are ordained of God," so that the church can safely leave the work of putting the government right to the God who "rules in the kingdom of men."

If the church would follow the commission—"Feed my sheep"—and look after the individual, God would surely look after the government. But the spirit in man that is constantly seeking for power, has led the church to cease her work of teaching to become a dictator. In this way she endeavors to dictate to earthly governments in order that they may do her bidding. But this plan is not of God.

When Israel went down to Egypt for help she disconnected herself from God, because the help she sought was not in God's plan. It is so with the church to-day. She has gone down to Egypt for help, but instead of receiving help from earthly powers, she has received a wound. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help." Hosea 13:9.

Every bid that the church makes for temporal or civil power will only prove a stumbling-block in the way of God's work. It would be much more effective for the church to get on her knees than put on her titles. She would accomplish much more by prayer to God than prayer to Parliament. God has the Holy Spirit's power waiting for the church when she gets ready to receive it.
