BOTH sides in the South African war appear to be confident that God is in their favor, and will bring them to the end of the conflict victorious. The British leaders point to their present success as God's answer to the prayers of the nation in the darker days preceding, and President Kruger on the other hand exhorts the Boers to fight on and God will surely deliver them; but his "faith" has not prevented him from making overtures to Great Britain for peace. Meanwhile occasion is furnished for the scoffer to repeat the old saying attributed to Napoleon, that "God favors the heavy battalions," which has apparently been justified by the outcome of most wars. But the purposes of God do not depend for accomplishment upon the work of armed hosts. They are being wrought out in other ways than by battle, and by other agencies than soldiers and cannon. President Kruger and his pious followers are doomed to disappointment.
