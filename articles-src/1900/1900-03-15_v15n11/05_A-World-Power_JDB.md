In repudiating the principles of its Constitution as a republican government, the Government of the United States is distinctly changing its position in the eyes of and with reference to the other nations of the earth. This change is apparent to all. But the meaning of this change is recognized by few. There are many who insist that their country has at last entered the realm of greatness; that now, by virtue of this change, it has "risen to be a world power, henceforth to be reckoned with among the very few great nations of the earth."

However, there are some who know what greatness is, and who are not blind to the meaning of the change that has taken place. The difference between the position held by America before this change and the position which is now held and is to be held by virtue of it, and the character of the "reckoning" once had as compared with that now accorded and had by and "among the very few great nations of the earth," is plainly indicated by Senator Bacon, of Georgia, in his speech of January 30, in the Senate. He said:

"Again, sir, among the imperialists, those who soar on a loftier wing, are fond of appealing to the patriotic emotions and pride of the American people by the oft-repeated statement that the results of the Spanish war has made the United States a world power, and that they have now become one of the family of nations! Why, sir, one would suppose from these oft-repeated expressions that this nation had for a century been kicked and cuffed around like a mangy cur, and that it had skulked around afraid to pick up the refuse which its master threw it.

"What a wonderful discovery, Mr. President, that the United States have become a world power! Why, sir, when in the result of the Revolutionary War they made good the great Declaration of July 4, 1776, they instantly became the greatest of world powers; the greatest of world powers, sir, because in spite of the fewness of their numbers and the smallness of their resources, they had not only announced but maintained and secured a great principle thereafter to stand as a menace of every tyrant, the hope and inspiration of every people, however humble, who longed for liberty. This principle, thus maintained and exemplified in the growth of a great and free people, has, in the advancement of the free institutions of the world, been the most potential influence of a hundred years upon the destinies of the world. Just become, sir, a world power—a nation whose flag has never gone down in defeat! Just become a world power, when for seventy-five years it has stood as the guardian of a whole hemisphere and said to the whole world, 'Not one step farther on this hemisphere!' and for seventy-five years the world has obeyed the command!

"And this discovery that we have just become a world power is due to a mere skirmish in which we overcame the weak and decayed power of Spain, when in truth we had so recently with our own blood, written the history of the greatest and the fiercest and the bloodiest battles of modern times. Why, sir, within your memory there occurred within eighty miles of this Capitol a battle in which more men were killed and wounded in half an hour than were killed and wounded in both American and Spanish armies and navies during the entire Spanish war. And the highest demonstration that we were a world power was when the division ended, and when there stood again united for all time, the people, who, when divided, had between themselves fought battles under the shock of which the earth quaked and the very mountains rocked.

"No, Mr. President, we do not need to keep the Philippines to prove to the world that we are indeed a world power. There is a meaning to the expression 'world power.' It has been perverted and has become misunderstood. It originated across the water. They did say it about us. What did they mean? Did they mean they had suddenly discovered that a nation with 10,000,000 fighting men had suddenly become a world power, a nation with such a history as we have? No. What they meant by world power and coming into the family of nations was that before that time we had been a peaceful nation, attending to our business, frowning down upon the conquest of any people, however humble and however feeble they might be, holding up for free institutions; differing from all the rest of the world in the fact that they were always ready for conquest, always ready to oppress the weak, always ready to despoil anyone who might be in their power; and when they saw that we had gone across the ocean to pick up a little feeble people, they raised a hurrah that we had also become a world power among the land grabbers, and had become one of the family of nations to oppress and subject the weak and feeble."
