DOES ITS WEALTH BETOKEN GOOD TIMES?

The immense wealth of the United States does not, of itself, betoken good times to that nation. The history of past nations shows that, generally speaking, with them, great wealth meant effeminacy and extortion on the part of the rich; dissatisfaction, complaints of injustice, setting forth claims for rights and just dues, and uprisings, on the part of those in cramped circumstances struggling for a livelihood; more vice, more corruption, and more crimes; jealousies of other powers and foreign intervention; impending national ruin.

This was the state of things with the antediluvians just before ruin came upon them. They were buried up with the things of time and sense, and reaching out after wealth until the very day that Noah entered into the ark; and of them the Lord said at that time, "The earth is filled with violence." Gen. 6:13. See also Matt. 24:37–39; Luke 17:26, etc. The same was true of the Sodomites before their destruction. Of Sodom it is written: "Fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy." Eze. 16:49. The same was true of the Jews when God's avenging hand was about to be wielded against them through foreign powers. Even their priests and rulers were greedy after earthly riches, were "companions of thieves," oppressed the needy and turned a deaf ear to their cries. Christ showed his disapproval of such a course by the brisk use of chords as means of lashing guilty speculators. John 2:13–16. Read also Isa. 1:23; 56:10–12; Jer. 7:9; Heb. 2:5–13, etc.

It was when the Medes and Persians rolled in wealth and luxury that 640,000 of them were defeated in battle at Arbela by only 48,000 Greeks, and that the Medo-Persian Empire was replaced by the Greek Empire, the Greeks at that time being less wealthy, more industrious, stronger physically, more hardy and more virtuous than the Medo-Persians. The great wealth of the Roman Empire, acquired through injustice, oppression and cruelty, and perverted in its use, greatly helped to abase it in the scale of morality; and the union of church and state in that empire caused its overthrow.

IS IT A GOOD BASIS FOR CIVILIZING AND CHRISTIANIZING OTHERS?

Nor should civilizing and Christianizing others be made an excuse for departing from right principles. A civilization and Christianization that are the outgrowth of going against principles of justice and equity must be shallow indeed, not to say disgraceful to true civilization and genuine Christianity. The plea of advancing others in civilization by usurping their territory and depriving them of their natural rights is becoming quite popular with so-called Christian nations; but this plea was never made by Christ and his apostles. Christianity, pure, unadulterated, is the greatest civilizer in the world. Indeed, there can be no true civilization independently of the principles of Christianity, which have been embraced in the one plan of salvation ever since its establishment. But true Christianity wins by love and never deprives men of their natural rights nor forces conscience by the use of cruel and compulsory measures. A Christianity that does this is a misnomer. It is based on selfishness, hatred, envy, and revenge, and is the greatest enemy to true civilization. God can carry out his wise designs in spite of it, but he can never approve it. To day it keeps millions of our race who grope their way in the mists of heathenism, from embracing genuine Christianity and advancing in true civilization.

IS IT ANTIPATRIOTIC? IS IT TREASON?

Is it antipatriotic and breathing the spirit of treason, even from the standpoint of true Americans, to stand by the noble principles on which the American Republic was formed? What is patriotism from this point of view? The word patriotism comes from the Latin word pater, which means father. In this case, one truly patriotic would be one who would agree with the fathers of the first American Republic, who vindicated the principles of civil and religious freedom and of complete separation of church and state. Therefore for an American to oppose these principles of liberty, would be branding himself as antipatriotic. And is it not strictly true that Americans who by word and deed oppose the fundamental principles of the Republic of the United States are the very ones who breathe the spirit of treason, while Americans who stand by those principles are justly entitled to full and complete exoneration from the unjust charge of breathing the spirit and of being guilty of treason, and should be commended for their unwavering fidelity to the government to which they belong?

Being true to the righteous laws and principles of the government to which one belongs, is the best evidence of true patriotism and of antagonism with the spirit of treason.

Civil liberty goes hand in hand with religious liberty, and civil bondage goes hand in hand with religious bondage; and when a government that has, more than all others, professed and carried out before the world the principles of civil and religious liberty, and has for this reason prospered beyond every other nation under the sun and been admired and praised by lovers of liberty in every land—when we say, a government that has done this and that has thus prospered, so seriously departs from the very principles to which it owes its existence and unparalleled prosperity, goes back on its profession and principles so far as to deny that all men are created equal, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, what is to be expected of it? When men make the highest conceivable profession regarding religious liberty and the separation of church and state, and yet go squarely against this profession by passing a bill against perfect religious liberty, as in the matter of closing the gates of the Chicago Exposition on Sunday, what else can we expect than that such a government, continuing in its downward course of apostasy, will finally pass a national Sunday law, the enforcement of which will mean a deprivation of civil rights and a revival of the persecution of the Dark Ages, to those who, from conscientious scruples, will not submit to the oppressive national mandate? See Rev. 13:11-18.

Against this oppressive, antirepublican, antichristian work comes from a merciful God this prophetic warning of world-wide application: "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast, and his image, and whosoever receives the mark of his name." Rev. 14:9-11.

This warning being world-wide in its application, the danger of worshiping the "beast" and his "image" by receiving the "mark of the beast" and of papal authority, when enforced by strong legal enactments, will exist in every land; for to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" is the three fold message containing this warning to go. Rev. 14:6-14. The language of the warning is not, "If any man worship the beast or his image," etc.; but, "If any man worship the beast and his image," etc., which shows that both the "beast" and his "image" will be worshiped at the same time and by the same act of receiving the "mark" of the "beast."

How can this be done on the territory covered by the "beast," when the image is formed, not by the powers covering the territory of the beast, but by the United States located in America? Simply on this principle: The United States, notwithstanding its mild profession of religious freedom, takes the lead in this final work of extolling and enforcing Sunday by strong legal enactments; other nations catch the spirit and follow the example of the United States. In doing this they not only worship the papacy that brought about the change of the Sabbath as set forth in these prophetic words: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws" (or the law, Heb. Dan. 7:25); they also worship the image of the papacy formed by the United States, saying, Let us do as the United States are doing in the matter of enforcing Sunday by strict Sunday laws well guarded by strong penalties, even the death penalty. Rev. 13:15, etc.

The wrath of man and nations can, by grace divine, be endured, as it has been in past ages; but who can submit to endure the unmingled wrath of God, when the probation of men and nations shall have ended, and mercy's sweet voice shall no more be heard forever? Prov. 1:24-33; Rev. 22:11, 12 14:9-13; 15:1:16. Oh let us give unmistakable proof that we heed the heavenly warning for this time, by taking to heart and conforming to these words found in the last gospel message to a fallen world: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus!" Rev. 14:12.
