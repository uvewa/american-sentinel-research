Probably the most densely illiberal country in South America is Ecuador. There the priesthood has had absolute sway, and there has been almost no possibility of securing any independent action of any kind; and yet the light is breaking there. The Congress of the republic has prepared a series of laws on religion and the clergy, in which it lays restrictions upon the church which must be rather novel. The delegates of the pope are to have no right of jurisdiction without previous authority from the executive power, given in accordance with the council of State, and no bull or pontifical order is to be promulgated or executed or considered to have any value whatever without the corresponding exequatur from the executive power. Funeral and parish taxes the church is not allowed to collect. There are restrictions on church property, on ordination, on entrance to the novitiate, etc., which are very, very significant. The light is dawning, after all. —*N. Y. Independent.*
