The following is taken from the Evening Sentinel, published in Knoxville, Tenn., March 5:—

"HE SOLD CANDY.

"G. W. CARDEN VIOLATED SUNDAY ORDINANCE.

"G. W. Carden, a merchant doing business at 122 Georgia Street, was arrested Sunday by Patrolman Finley, for selling confectioneries, thereby violating the Sunday ordinance.

"This was the only arrest made during the day. Taking into consideration the short time the present department has been in office, and the opposition shown by some dealers against the ordinance, the police department is to be complimented on its efficiency in enforcing the law.

"Cardon will be tried this afternoon.

"At first there were some protests against it, but citizens are already accustoming themselves to it. Comparatively few protests were heard this second Sunday of enforcement.

"Those who were determined to get a smoke found it. Throughout the day Sunday, John Smith, who runs a fruit and cigar stand at the south end of the Tennessee River bridge, in connection with his restaurant, just smiled and sold another cigar. John is a genial fellow who attends strictly to his own business. Early Sunday morning he noticed the demand for his perfecto; was unusually large, but he thought nothing about it until in the afternoon when a purchaser told him it was impossible to buy a cigar in the city. John did a good business and a resident of the city who desired a smoke, had but to walk across the bridge."

The stores are closed tight on Sunday. Only drugs can be sold. A Sunday newspaper, The Tribune & Journal, is published and sold. Freight trains are switched in the yards and are run through the city. Passenger trains are run, and electric railway service is the same on Sunday as other week days. Why should a discrimination be made against candy and fruits, and in favor of steam and surface railways?
