AN APPEAL BY L. J. CALDWELL, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST AGAINST A DECISION BY THE COUNTY SUPT. OF SCHOOLS OF ARAPAHOE COUNTY.

To the Honorable State Board of Education of State of Colorado:

1. Your petitioner, a resident of this State, hereby appeals to your honorable body for redress concerning the action of Warren E. Knapp, Supt. of Schools for Arapahoe County, Colo., at the Teachers' Examination of December 15, 1899, more specifically detailed below: On said date, being the third Friday in December, your petitioner duly presented himself to answer the questions in the branches required, and did answer those in writing, arithmetic, natural science, grammar, orthography and school law. Your petitioner then requested the remaining questions for the purpose of then and there answering them, but was told by Supt. Knapp that they could not be had till the next day, Saturday, December 16, 1899.

2. Your petitioner, being now, and for many years past a conscientious observer of the Sabbath, or seventh day, did not know or offer to answer the remaining questions until sunset of Saturday, when the Sabbath was past. He then answered the questions in U. S. History, Reading, and Theory and Practice, and again requested the remaining questions for answering. This request and Supt. Knapp's reply were as follows:

Denver, Colo., December 16, 1899, 5:50 P. M.

Mr. W. E. Knapp, County Superintendent of Schools of Arapahoe County, Colo.

Hon. Sir: I hereby demand the remaining examination questions, viz: Civil Government, Geography and Physiology, unanswered by me at this examination of December 15th and 16th, 1899, for the purpose of answering them.

Yours respectfully,

LOYD J. CALDWELL.

OFFICE OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS.

Denver, Colo., December 16, 1899, 5:50 P. M.

MR. LOYD J. CALDWELL.—Dear Sir: The questions for which you have made the above demand will be tendered to you together with all the other questions used at said examination in the same manner and for the same reason as to the other applicants, after you have retired from said examination—the purpose for which they are to be used by you being unknown to me.

Very respectfully,

WARREN E. KNAPP.

County Superintendent of Schools for Arapaho Co., Colo.

3. Now your petitioner claims to have fulfilled both the law requiring Friday and the rule requiring Saturday examination, doing all he could in good conscience to conform to usual custom.

But God's law says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work." Ex. 20:10. "And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it he had rested from all his work." Gen. 2:3: "From even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbaths." Lev. 23:32.

When one is refused a teachers' certificate because he will not disobey God and violate his religion by taking examination on the seventh day then both the constitution and statute of Colorado are violated, as extracts appended will show:—

CONSTITUTION OF COLORADO, ACT II, SEC. 4.

"That the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination shall forever hereafter be guaranteed: and no person shall be denied any civil or political right, privilege or capacity on account of his opinions concerning religion—nor shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship."

Art. IX, Sec. 8, of the constitution provides:—

"No religious test or qualification shall ever be required of any person as a condition of admission into any public educational institution of the State, either as teacher or pupil."

SCHOOL LAW OF COLORADO, SEC. 15, (Law of Mar. 20, 1877.)

"On the third Friday in August, December and March in each year, he [the County Superintendent of Schools] shall examine all such applicants in orthography, reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar, geography, history, and Constitution of U. S., civil government, physiology, natural science, theory and practise of teaching, and school law of the State. If satisfied of the competency to teach and of the good moral character of the applicant . . . he shall give such applicant a certificate."

4. That there is discrimination and preference shown toward the keeper of the first day or Sunday in that that day is not employed or required for examination. That this is a point of religion would be quickly shown if a rule were made that all applicants must be examined on Sunday or must teach on Sunday. Is it right to stretch Friday over to 5:50 P. M. Saturday to accommodate some and to refuse a few additional minutes to another whose religion forbade certain earlier minutes of same day? Is it legal to require Saturday examinations at all?

5. Christ drew the line between civil and religious duties when he said, "Render therefore unto Caesar [the state] the things which are Caesar's [civil duties]; and unto God the things that are God's [religious duties]." Matt. 22:21. The apostles said "We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5:29.

The Sabbath, like baptism and the Lord's supper, is wholly God's; and no civil law or officer has aught of right to do with them more than to keep out of their way. God can and will collect his own, and condemn all who stand in the way.

Obedience is the highest form of worship. To condition a civil right (as to teach public school) on a religious disobedience (as of violating the seventh-day Sabbath) is high treason both to God and the constitution.

In closing, your petitioner begs to say that he believes the rule requiring Saturday examination was made to accommodate and not to debar any; and that Supt. Knapp decided as he did because of technical adherence to said rule, and not from personal motives.

Respectfully yours,

LOYD J. CALDWELL.

Denver, Colo., Dec. 20, 1899.
