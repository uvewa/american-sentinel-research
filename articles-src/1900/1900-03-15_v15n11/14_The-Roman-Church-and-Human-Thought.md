*"Springfield Republican."*

The pope, says the dispatch about his birthday reception, spoke of the honors paid in Italy to Giordano Bruno,—the dedication of his statue in Rome being one of those honors,—as instigated by the devil. This is so beautiful a specimen of medievalism that it is almost a pity to add a word of comment. Yet the word is really necessary to call the attention of the public to the fact that the Roman Church is dogmatically and in discipline precisely where it was in Bruno's day, 300 years ago. So much has been said about "American" Catholicism, so much about the wise concessions of Pope Leo XIII, that there is a general impression that the world is in some way changing the old church, bringing it to toleration of, if not to a conformity with modern advance of knowledge and practise. Now this remark of the pope to the Italian deputations that gave him their congratulations on his 90th anniversary, shows that the only modification in the papacy is in Joachim Pecci's personal wisdom and temperamental tact; and at the same time the case of St. George Mivart shows that there is absolutely no change in the attitude of the church toward thinkers since Bruno's day. The church to-day will not burn St. George Mivart at the stake, but the church of A. D. 1600 would have burned him, without question. So Giordano Bruno, though it would suspend from the sacraments, and no doubt eventually excommunicate him, would live his life out if he were living in this age to express his superior knowledge. It is not the Roman Church, but its circumstances, that have been so changed.

It is the outside world that has made the difference. While popes, councils, congregations, the hierarchy, are dwelling in the same dogmatic bounds which Bruno broke, to the inspiration and nurture of philosophy and science, the absolute acquirements of the world have gone onward and left them far behind. It is impossible for the progress of knowledge to stop of itself, and it is impossible for the church to stop it. But such slurs as even so enlightened a pope as Leo casts upon Bruno, and such disciplinary treatment as Cardinal Vaughan visits upon Mivart, unmistakably indicate that the Roman Church is what it was three centuries ago, and only the temper of the age, which it does not govern, has compelled it to change its methods.
