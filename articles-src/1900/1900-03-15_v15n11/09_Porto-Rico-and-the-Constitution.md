THE BILL [to erect a tariff barrier between Porto Rico and the United States] violates the Constitution. It imposes upon the Porto Ricans the tyranny of taxation without representation against which our forefathers rebelled. It violates the promise of General Miles to the inhabitants, never disavowed by our Government, that "Porto Rico under the American flag will enjoy the same privileges and the same immunities as the citizens of the different States and Territories of the Union." It makes of Porto Rico a "crown colony" instead of an American Territory.—*N. Y. World.*
