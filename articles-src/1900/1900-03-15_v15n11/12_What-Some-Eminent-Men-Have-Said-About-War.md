"Whence come wars and fightings among you?" James 4:1.

SENECA, the tutor of the Emperor Nero, and put to death by that tyrant, about A. D. 65, says in his 95th epistles:—

"We punish murders and massacres committed amongst private persons; what do we respecting wars and the glorious crime of murdering whole nations? Here avarice an cruelty know no bounds. Barbarities are authorized by decrees of the Senate and the votes of the people; and enormities forbidden in private persons are ordered and sanctioned by public legislatures.

"Things, which if men had done in their private capacity, they would have paid for with their lives—the very same things we extol to the skies, when they do them in their war accoutrements."

Such was the testimony of a virtuous heathen.

John Wickliffe, the great reformer, was particularly disgusted with the ambition which induced rival popes to assert their claims to St. Peter's chair, at the expense of torrents of human blood; for he not only considered the whole trade of war to be utterly unlawful for Christians, but thought it wrong, on the principles of the gospel, to take away the life of man upon any occasion. Respecting conquest, he said, "the title of conquest is utterly worthless and untenable, unless the conquest itself be expressly commanded by the Almighty."

Thos. Scott, D. D.—"War, in every case, must be deemed the triumph of the harvest of the first great murderer—the devil."

Bishop Porteus.—"One murder makes a villain—millions a hero."

Bishop Watson.—"When the spirit of Christianity shall exert its proper influence over the minds of individuals, and especially over the minds of public men in their public capacities, war will cease throughout the Christian world."

Frederick the Great.—"When sovereigns are determined to come to a rupture, they will not hesitate concerning materials for a manifesto."

Secker (Archbishop of Canterbury).—"War in all cases is accompanied with dreadful evils; of which we are apt to consider the heavy expense as if it were the only one, and forget the sufferings and miserable deaths of such multitudes of human creatures, though every one of them is a murder committed by the authors of this calamity."
