The readers of the SENTINEL remember that a minister of the Seventh-day Adventists was recently banished from Malatia to Kharpout. As soon as he reached there it was proposed by the government that he should have a commandment brought from Constantinople High Porte to preach in freedom. However, he was left free to work in the city. Under his labors an Armenian accepted the truth, and at once began to open his shop on Sunday. The Armenians were offended because of two things; first, that he began to keep the Sabbath, so that Sabbath-keeping took hold in that city; second, that their Sunday was openly desecrated.

This man was a shoemaker, and had a companion who was learning the art from him. He found that this man's Sabbath-keeping and Sunday working were contrary to his religion, but unwilling and unable to be without him, he devised a way to stop this new thing. Several Armenians called on the authorities to complain against the minister, and became successful in banishing him from Kharpout to Eguin. They expected that the shoemaker would go back into his former religion when he was left alone, but it was not so.

As soon as the minister arrived at Eguin, the police proposed that he should give a guarantee not to go out of the city and also not to preach the Sabbath. For several reasons he consented, but a few weeks later, after he had consulted with us, wrote two petitions, one to the governor of Eguin, and the other to the Vali of Kharpout. In both of them he presented the principles of religious liberty and the relation of the state to the church, ending with the cutting testimony that he should continue the preaching of the gospel under all circumstances. The Vali of Kharpout at once sent word to the governor of Eguin that he must stop the minister's preaching. The police called the minister and presented Vali's answer, and demanded from him a guarantee not to preach even when he is invited to preach in a Protestant church. The minister refused to comply with the proposition, and was put into jail.

We are sure that his bold act surprised the government and made them think about it more soberly. Five days only he was left in the jail. The fifth day the police took him out and committed him to the Armenian bishop, expecting that the bishop's council would withhold him from preaching. The bishop, ignorant of the Bible, told him to refrain from this work. After several minutes' talk, the bishop sent him away in freedom. Now the minister is free to preach, and a good door is open to him, because Protestants love him very much and have given him their church to preach whenever and whatever he wants.

Constantinople, Feb. 14, 1900.
