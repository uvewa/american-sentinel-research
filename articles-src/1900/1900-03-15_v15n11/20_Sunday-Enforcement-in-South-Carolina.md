In Spartansburg, S.C., an agitation has been started for the enforcement of the Sunday law, and definite steps to this end are expected to be taken at the March term of court, which is now in progress. The situation is set forth in the following from a Spartansburg Journal, the Free Lance:—

"Again we have been urged to continue to call public attention to the fact that work is being done on Sunday in the machine shops of our cotton mills. Only last week a mechanic told us that he worked six days in the machine shop and on Saturday he was told to report for work on the following Sunday morning; that he did not want to work on Sunday, but should he refuse, he would lose his job. He further stated that at one mill in the country the boss machinist had said that at that mill there was Sunday work for the next six months.

"These statements are startling and call for serious consideration by our people. Work on Sunday is not only forbidden by the Bible, but it is prohibited by the statute law of South Carolina, and we are derelict of our duty if we wink at these violations of both divine and human laws, simply because the one who forces this work on Sunday is a big corporation.

"The Free Lance is a secular and not a religious paper, but as most of the preachers of the county, we are glad to say, are readers of its pages, we hereby tender to these noble men the use of our columns so that they may enter their solemn protest against this flagrant disregard of the fourth commandment and against the desecration of the day set apart by all civilized and Christian people as a day of rest. Work on Sunday is either right or wrong—there can be no middle ground; and this commandment is universal in its application. The observance of the Sabbath is binding alike upon the rich and the poor, the farmer and the merchant, the factory president and the mechanic in the repair shop, and the saving of a little time or of a few dollars should have no place in determining whether an act is right or wrong. . . .

"This matter is now up to the Grand Jury and to Solicitor Sease, and the parties in interest want to know what will be done about the matter at the March term of court."

The Sunday law of South Carolina, as applying to secular labor, was a very mild affair so far as its penalties went, up to the year 1899. It read thus:—

"No tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever, shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business, or work of their ordinary callings upon the Lord's day, (commonly called Sunday), or any part thereof, (work of necessity or charity only excepted); and every person, being of the age of fifteen years or upwards, offending in the premises, shall, for every such offense, forfeit the sum of one dollar."

The law was, however, severe upon corporations running railway trains in the State on Sunday, this form of labor being prohibited under a penalty of $500.

Last year the legislature amended the law by adding to it the following:—

"That on and after the approval of this Act, in addition to the penalties prescribed against tradesmen, artificers, workmen, and laborers who shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business or work of their ordinary calling upon the Lord's day (commonly called the Sabbath) or Sunday, or any part thereof, any corporation, company, firm or person who shall order, require or direct any work to be done in any machine shop or shops on Sunday, except in cases of emergency, shall, upon conviction, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined in a sum not less than one hundred dollars and not more than five hundred dollars for each offense."

Of course, if this law is enforced, the cotton mills (which are closed on Sundays) will be seriously hampered by the frequent necessity of shutting down for repairs. Heretofore repairs for the week have been made in the repair shops on Sunday, while the mills were closed. Whether the religious element who want this law enforced will prevail or not against the interests represented by the mills, is the question now to be settled.
