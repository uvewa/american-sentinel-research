Recently a bill was introduced in the Iowa legislature to strike out from the phraseology of the Iowa Sunday law the words "except that of necessity or charity," which define the exception to the work prohibited by the law; thus making all labor on that day subject to prohibition. From the wording of the law, which we quote below, it will be observed that atheists, who do not "conscientiously observe the seventh day," or any other day as the Sabbath, have no exemption from its penalties, save such as can be secured under the plea of "work of necessity or charity." In now seeking to remove this slight ground of defense against the law, the clerical element which are behind this bill leave us to infer that in their view there can be no such thing as a "work of necessity or charity" where people of a class obnoxious to themselves are concerned, but that all work by atheists and others they do not like is necessarily bad and ought to be prohibited.

The effect of the bill, of course, was to arouse a deeper antagonism to religion in the minds of those most in need of its priceless blessings. Here is what one of this class says of it in a letter to the Free Thought Magazine:—

"The following is a copy of the present puritanical 'Sunday law' of Iowa. There is now a movement on foot to make this law enough worse to be worthy of fourteenth century legislation. Here is the present law:—

"Sec. 5040. If any person be found on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, engaged in carrying firearms, dancing, hunting, shooting, horse-racing, or in any manner disturbing a worshiping assembly or private family, or in buying or selling property of any kind, or in any labor except that of necessity or charity, he shall be fined not more than five nor less than one dollar, and be imprisoned in the county jail until the fine, with costs of prosecution, shall be paid; but nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to those who conscientiously observe the seventh day as the Sabbath, or to prevent persons traveling or families emigrating from pursuing their journey, or keepers of toll bridges, toll gates, and ferrymen from attending the same."

"You will readily see that, as the law now stands, it can be used to harass, fine, and imprison people who have done no one a wrong and who have disturbed no one. You will see that it recognizes the conscientious scruples of Jews and Adventists, but not of the larger and more intelligent class known as Liberals, Agnostics and Freethinkers. We can therefore say that the law is unjust, puritanical, and partial. But self-appointed meddlers in other people's private affairs are not even satisfied with this outrageous law. On Jan. 25, 1900, Senator Hazelton introduced a bill in the Senate (Sen. File 124), to strike out the phrase, 'except that of necessity or charity,' in the present law. If the reactionists can pass that bill they will have no trouble in finding a pretext to worry and fine every Freethinker, Agnostic, and Liberal in the State, for it would be almost impossible even to live and care for our families and domestic animals without in some way violating this law. It is pretty safe to say that preaching would be about the only occupation not prohibited by this law. The law in its present form has been used by those who 'love their enemies,' to harass and worry those who love their friends and are just to their enemies, to make them see the great beauty of godliness and piety."
