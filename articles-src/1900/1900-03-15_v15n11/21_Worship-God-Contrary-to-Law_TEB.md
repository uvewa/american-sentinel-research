PAUL had come to Corinth. He labored hard for his own countrymen, but when they blasphemed, he turned to the Gentiles. He went into a certain man's house, named Justus, "one that worshiped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."

This inspired account shows that close by where the Jews worshiped, was a heathen (as they regarded him) who was a worshiper of God. But the Jews "had a law," and unless men worshiped God according to that law, they felt very sure that God did not accept such service at all. And so because this good man believed on Jesus Christ, with many others, a thing they supposed altogether unnecessary according to their prescribed "law," they raised an insurrection, and had Paul arrested and dragged before the judgment seat of the Roman official, Gallio. The only thing they could accuse him of on the warrant was that "This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law."

Had this been truly contrary to God's law, then there might have been some force in the claim; but it was simply contrary to their human traditional law, which they had placed above God's sayings.

It is sad to contemplate that this same spirit is at work to-day. Men must worship their God "according to the laws of the land," and all who do not are looked upon as no worshipers at all. Perhaps God would be a better judge in such matters. He tells us that he is seeking worshipers who will worship in spirit and in truth. Finite minds cannot understand the operations of the Spirit fully. And again, spiritual things are understood only by spiritual minds.

What a good example was set rulers by Gallio. He says, "If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters."

Who can say this representative in civil affairs did not take the right stand? He drew a clear-cut distinction between religious and civil matters. He said he was no judge of the former, but in case it were a matter of uncivil conduct, he would give the case a hearing. He thus saved himself much trouble, and served God's gospel tellingly, for because of his decision Paul stayed there a long time after this happened and accomplished a good work.

God is not served by men getting the false burden that they must make everybody worship God according "to the law." T. E. BOWEN.
