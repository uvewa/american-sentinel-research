IN South Carolina the man who works on Sunday is liable only to a fine of one dollar; while in Georgia the man who does the same thing is liable to a $1,000 fine and one year in the chain gang. How much better Georgia must be than South Carolina in the matter of Sunday observance! What a contrast the one State must present with the other in this respect! Does it? Is Sunday kept any better in Georgia than in South Carolina? If not, as we think many Southern readers of this journal know, then what virtue is there in human laws to promote Sabbath observance?
