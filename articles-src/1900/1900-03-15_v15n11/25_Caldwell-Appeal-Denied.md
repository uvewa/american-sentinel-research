WE print on another page an appeal made by Mr. L. J. Caldwell, of Colorado, against a decision of the county superintendent of schools of Arapahoe County, Col., which deprived Mr. Caldwell of the privilege of taking an examination for a teacher's certificate without violating his conscience, the examination having been held on the seventh day of the week, which he observes as the Sabbath. As the constitutional law of the State plainly specifies that no privileges offered to any class of its citizens shall be denied to any by law on account of differences in religious belief, and as Mr. Caldwell has been denied the privilege of qualifying for a public instructor by a decision which operated against him solely through his religious belief, it seems clear that the county superintendent's decision in the case is unconstitutional. The State Board of Education, however, have refused to sustain Mr. Caldwell's appeal; and the latter says that he does not intend to carry the matter further on his own behalf.
