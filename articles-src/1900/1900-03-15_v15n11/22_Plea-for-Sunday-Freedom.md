CONVENTION HALL, in Kansas City, where a national political convention is to be held this summer, is under the control of a board of directors, who have decided that no secular entertainments shall be allowed in the Hall on Sundays. This decision has provoked much discussion upon the question of its propriety, and some important truths pertaining to the subject of enforced Sunday observance have been stated before the public. We note in the Kansas City Journal of February 26, the following pertinent remarks by the Rev. Dr. J. E. Roberts of that city:—

"The right to go to church is no more sacred than the right to go to a theater. If the Convention Hall directors had adopted their recent resolution two years ago it is doubtful if that great hall would have been built. If the sanhedrim and the high priests have the welfare of the people at heart they could do no finer, nobler thing than to inaugurate a series of Sunday entertainments in the Convention Hall."

"When some men get religion they get ugly. Well meaning men consider themselves the special policemen of the Infinite. There are others who think that God is entirely competent to execute his own laws. Helping God manage his affairs has been one of the most pernicious of religious followings. It reduces the Omnipotent to the level of a police magistrate.

"The principle is every day becoming more generally recognized, that the function of the law and penalty is the protection of people from injury. It isn't to make men moral, it isn't to punish them for wrong-doing, it is to protect society; it is to keep men free. The only laws of that kind that still remain are those relating to the keeping of the Sabbath day. These linger longest and die hardest. Sabbath discretion, so-called, affords opportunity for pulpit oratoricals and spectacular effects; it also gives some secular organizations a fine opportunity to pose as sponsors of the spiritual welfare of the community. . . . Those suffering from this malady have the peculiar hallucination that they must compel someone else to be good.

"It was while under the influence of such a hallucination that the directors of the People's hall resolved that Convention Hall shall not be rented on Sundays for performances of any kind; at that time the paroxysm was at its height. A little later when its rigors had begun to subside, this line was added: 'This is not to apply to meetings of a religious character, or to high order of musical entertainments or lectures.' Then came the mental depression which accompanies the paroxysm, and then this last part was added: 'There is to be no deviation from this rule, except by authority of the board of directors.' If that resolution had been promulgated eighteen months or two years ago, it may be fairly doubted if that great hall ever could have been built. It was not built for week day use, nor Sunday use; it was built for use by the people. It was built without reference to religion, politics, creed or sect, and the people who built it have the right to demand that it be kept sacred to their uses and free from restrictions imposed by any class. If its use is to be restricted on Sundays to please Christians, why should it not be equally restricted on Saturdays to please Jews, that is their day of worship; and why should its use not be restricted throughout all of Lent to conform to the ideas of Catholics? That resolution was a sorry tribute to the church people.

"For one, I cannot believe that they wanted it, or expected it, or do now approve it. I cannot think them possessed of such illiberality and such flagrant disregard for other people's opinions and rights as to wish to impose their own individual and peculiar ties upon the management of a public property. The hall directors erred when they presupposed the narrowness of the church people, and they erred still more grievously, if they imagined that their action would pass without protest. The Commercial Club indorsed that action; but the Commercial Club did not build Convention Hall; it helped to build it. Surely men of their breadth and sense of justice will not seek to override the rights and opinions of the humbler men who also helped to build it.

"When was the Commercial Club constituted a Sanhedrim to exercise its conscience for the spiritual guidance of the community; it does not contribute to the making of Kansas City a good place to live in to have a commercial Sanhedrim tell us how we shall and shall not spend our Sundays. There are some things in reference to that unprecedented performance that the public would be greatly interested in knowing.

"How many members of the commercial Sanhedrim are there?

"How many were present and voted when they indorsed the action of the Convention Hall high priests?

"Was notice of such impending action duly served upon each member of the Sanhedrim, and in ample time to allow of his being present?

"Previous to taking this action were any efforts made to ascertain what were the opinions of thousands of other joint owners of the hall?

"The Commercial Sanhedrim is made up of men of means. Many of them have spacious homes and grounds; most of them have horses, carriages and servants; they have books and pictures and music at home; they can press a button and a liveried servant drives a carriage to the door; they can drive with their family to the country, Sunday, which brings to them rest, variety, recreation and enjoyment.

"What of the tens of thousands who must toil early and late, who live in crowded houses, for whom Sunday is merely a change from the monotony of the shop or factory or store to the monotony of dreary homes, who have but little of variety, recreation and pleasure? The rich members of the Sanhedrim do not need the Convention Hall on Sunday; they do not even need the high class musical and literary entertainments which the high priests of the hall, made gracious, deigned to allow; but the poor people need that hall; and if the Sanhedrim and the high priests have the welfare of the city really at heart, they could do no nobler, finer, better thing than to inaugurate a series of Sunday entertainments in the hall, cheap enough to be within the reach of all, and good enough to give pleasure and profit to all. The rich members of the Commercial Sanhedrim drive to church on rubber tires and worship God in velvet pews; they drink from silver goblets lined with gold, and wonder why so many poor devils go to the saloons to drink beer. I will tell them why. It is because they have no other place to go.

The man who goes to the saloon instead of to the church, goes there because he prefers it. A nickel buys him a glass of beer, and in addition fellowship, fraternity and equality. He could not buy as much in a church for less than $10,000 a year, and now the good people are trying to close the saloons on Sunday, and the superlatively good Sanhedrim has already sealed up the Convention Hall, and both are trying to serve God and incidentally make this city a good place to live in. Let me tell them, one and all, no city can be a good place to live in unless the people are happy and contented. No people can be happy and contented when made moral by mandates and religious compulsion; the people must be free. One man's freedom ends only where another one's begins. The right to go to a church is no more sacred than the right to go to a theater. It is in the liberty to go, not in the place."
