The following Sunday bill has been introduced in the Maryland legislature by Representative Sanford, and active efforts are being made to secure its passage:—

"SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That Article IV. of the Code of Public Local Laws, title, City of Baltimore, subtitle, Sabbath, be and the same is hereby amended by adding thereto the following sections, to follow immediately after Section 807:

"807 A. No person whatsoever shall do any work or bodily labor on the Lord's Day, commonly called Sunday, and no person having children or servants shall command or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on said day, works of necessity or charity always excepted, nor suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting or unlawful pastime or recreation; every person transgressing this section to be punishable upon conviction before a Justice of the Peace by a fine of $5, to be applied to the use of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, provided, that it shall be lawful to do work or labor connected with or incidental to the editing, publication or delivery of newspapers, the carriage of passengers in any car, vehicle, or elevator, the carriage of baggage of travelers, the transmission of messages, the polishing of boots and shoes, the baking of bread and preparation of meals.

"807 B. No person shall sell, dispose of, barter, or, if a dealer in any one or more of the articles of merchandise named in this section, give away on the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, any spirituous or fermented liquors, cordials, lager beer, wine, cider, or any other goods, wares or merchandise whatsoever; and any person violating any provision of this section is punishable by fine of not less than $20 nor more than $50 for the first offense; if convicted a second time of a violation of this section, by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500, and by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 30 days, and his, her, or their license, if any were issued, shall be declared null and void by the court.

"It shall not be lawful for such person or persons to obtain another license for the period of 12 months from the time of such conviction, nor shall a license be obtained by any other person or persons to carry on said business, on the premises or elsewhere, if the person so as aforesaid convicted has any interest whatever therein, or shall derive any profit therefrom; and if convicted more than twice of a violation of this section, such person or persons on each occasion shall be imprisoned for not less than 30 nor more than 60 days and fined a sum not less than double that imposed on the last preceding conviction, and his, her or their license, if any were issued, shall be declared null and void by the court, and no new license shall be issued to such person or persons for a period of two years from the time of such conviction; nor to anyone else to carry on said business wherein he or she is in anywise interested, as before provided, for second violation of the provisions of this section. One-half of all fines to be imposed under this section shall be paid to the State and the other half to the informer. This section is not to apply to sales of meals, to be eaten on the premises, or served elsewhere by caterers, nor to the sale of newspapers, cigars or tobacco prepared for use, milk, ice, fruit, flowers, soda or mineral waters, confectionery, drugs, medicines and surgical appliances, in places other than those where spirituous, fermented or malt liquors are offered for sale.

"807 C. It shall not be lawful to keep open or use any dancing saloon, opera house, tenpin alley, barber saloon or ball alley on the Sabbath day, commonly called Sunday, and any person or persons, body politic or corporate, violating any provision of this section, or causing or knowingly permitting the same to be violated by any person or persons in his, her or its employ, shall be fined not less than $50 nor more than $100 for the first offense, and if convicted a second time of a violation of this section, shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500, and, if a natural person imprisoned for not less than 10 nor more than 30 days; and, upon conviction subsequent to the second, fined on each occasion in a sum at least double that imposed on the last preceding conviction, and, if a natural person imprisoned for not less than 30 nor more than 60 days. All fines imposed under this section are payable to the State.

"Sec. 2. That this act shall take effect from the date of its passage."

This measure, it should be noted, is designed not in the interest of stricter Sunday observance in Baltimore, but as a relief measure from the rigorous exactions of the existing law. The Baltimore Sun says of it that "Mr. Sanford deserves the thanks of all liberal-minded and progressive people for his earnest efforts to secure the modification of the obsolete and impracticable Sunday laws of the State." Yet this proposed change in the Sunday law, which will repeal "obsolete and impracticable" exactions, and will leave the law fully as severe in its requirements as are most Sunday laws elsewhere, is vigorously opposed by the clergy of Baltimore and of the State. They do not want the "obsolete and impracticable" restrictions of the old law repealed; they want them revived and enforced! What else but this can be inferred from their opposition to this bill?

And if this strictly religious and puritanical observance of the day, is what the clergy of Maryland want, as shown by their opposition to any effort to modify the old law, what must we conclude of the clergy in general who are calling for Sunday legislation? Is it not perfectly fair to conclude that one and all have in view the same puritanical restrictions upon liberty and self-government for which some of them are now so earnestly contending?

The Baltimore Herald, which favors Mr. Sanford's bill, says that "the present Sunday law, so far as it secures the population in the enjoyment of opportunities to worship and directs the suspension of toil, so that services may not be interfered with and that the individual may have time to strengthen his moral nature, commends itself to universal support." But how far does the Sunday law of Baltimore, either as it now is or as Mr. Sanford would have it, secure the population in the enjoyment of these things? How far are the people indebted to the Sunday laws for the opportunity to worship, for services that are not "interfered with," and for "time to strengthen their moral natures"? Are the people deprived of these privileges in California, where they have no Sunday law? We have never heard that Sunday is not as generally observed in California as it is in Maryland. Or how is it with those Christians —60,000 or more in this country— who observe the seventh day instead of the first, and have no law at all in their favor? Are they deprived of these privileges?

Since these people enjoy all these privileges—as they unquestionably do—and since the people of one State where there is no Sunday law enjoy them equally with those of another State where such a law exists, it is clear that the extent to which these privileges are secured to the people by the Sunday law may be correctly indicated by a cipher; and to this extent such a law "commends itself to universal support," and no further.
