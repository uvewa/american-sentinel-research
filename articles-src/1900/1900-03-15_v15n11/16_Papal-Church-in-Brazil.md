NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT

The papal church in Brazil has made an open demand for the overthrow of the existing institutions and laws in that country favoring civil and religious liberty, and a return to the system of complete church-and-state union. A dispatch from Rio Janeiro, dated March 5, says:—

"The Brazilian bishops have issued a collective pastoral to the clergy and laity, demanding the union of church and state and the suppression of liberty of conscience, civil marriages and secular cemeteries.

"The pastoral also proposes a programme to combat the existing state of affairs."

This is the program of the papacy for Brazil; and the only reason this is not its program for the United States, is that it knows such an attempt would be hopeless here. The papacy's wishes and purposes are everywhere the same; but its methods vary according to circumstances.
