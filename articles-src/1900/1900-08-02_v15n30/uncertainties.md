# Uncertainties Log

## Source
- **OCR source**: Mistral OCR dump `/Users/apl/Documents/PUBLICAR/APL/English/American Sentinel (Religious Freedom)/0. American Sentinel/2. Transcribed/1900/ocr/v15n30_1900-08-02.md`
- **Issue**: Volume 15, Number 30, August 2, 1900

## General Notes
- OCR quality was generally good
- Article separation was clear with horizontal rule dividers (`---`)
- Author attributions were clear where present

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 6, "Reformation or Deformation" article
- **Issue**: OCR rendering of "nq" in phrase "even if the guardians had done nq wrong"
- **Transcribed as**: "nq" (preserving OCR as-is)
- **Confidence**: LOW
- **Note**: Context suggests this should be "no" but OCR clearly shows "nq" - likely OCR error

### Page 10, "Theocracy in China" article
- **Issue**: Word "grèves" appears with accent in "dense grèves of locust, pine and fir trees"
- **Transcribed as**: "grèves" (preserving as rendered in OCR)
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Note**: Unusual word; context suggests it means "groves" but OCR shows accent mark

### Article Categorization Notes
- Several short editorial notes could potentially be bundled differently, but per instructions each received its own file with full frontmatter
- "News, Notes and Comment" is a collection piece but kept together as it appeared as a single section in the original
- Back matter includes miscellaneous notes and was kept as one article per standard practice

## Author Attribution
- P. T. Magan (PTM) - not in the known authors list, identified from explicit signature
- C. P. Bollman signed as "B." in article 4
- G. E. Fifield (GEF) - in known authors list
- All editorial pieces attributed to "editorial" per instructions
