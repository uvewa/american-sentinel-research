Dr. W. F. Crafts, not unknown to the readers of The Sentinel, has this to say about the Army canteen:

"Numerous papers are arguing that the administration has done a beneficent work in nullifying the anti-canteen law on the ground that the beer-selling canteen keeps soldiers from whiskey selling 'dives' outside. No proof is given that at any specific place the outside saloon has been displaced—in fact they have increased—but the sufficient and crushing answer is that where most of our soldiers have been through all this anti-canteen controversy, in Manila, Cuba, and Porto Rico, the President and War Department have had full control of saloons on the outside as well as inside."

Dr. Crafts, if we mistake not, wrote the anti-canteen bill, which, after it became law, was "repealed" by the United States Attorney-General. The friends of the law, blame the President, not for the decision against the law but for accepting without question a decision so clearly without any substantial foundation. It would seem that a law could not be made more explicit than the anti-canteen act.
