The Torch of Reason says: "If there is a good God he should let honest Freethinkers know that he exists; the fact that he does not, proves that he is not."

This question was answered long since, and the answer the editor of the Torch of Reason may read in Paul's letter to the Romans, Chap. 2, verse 20: "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by [perceived through, R. V.] the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so they are without excuse." "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork."
