The incongruity of opening political conventions and similar assemblies with prayer is being discussed in the daily press. It has been found, namely, that these prayers are frequently applauded when they chance to suit the tastes of the members of the convention. One of our religious exchanges, while expressing itself as being shocked at such occurrences, thinks that such conventions "need divine guidance." "The Witness" agrees that such conventions "need"—emphasis on need—divine guidance, but denies that this divine guidance should be prayed for in the way indicated. Prayer is an outflow of faith; unbelievers cannot pray. Prayer is an act of worship, and believers must not make pretense of worshipping before the throne of God in company with those of whom they know that these dare not come before Him. Prayer is an act of confession, and those who are not agreed in doctrine should not make a vain show of unity by ignoring, in public, the differences which keep them apart. Christians should pray in private, and in concert with their brethren, for divine guidance in behalf of the State officers, etc., and should insist that the public "praying" in secular and mixed assemblies be done away with.
