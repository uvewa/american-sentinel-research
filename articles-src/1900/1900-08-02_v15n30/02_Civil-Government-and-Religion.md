The evils of a union of church and state are so well known—or, rather, the more patent evils are so well known—that in this country but few are found who are ready to defend such union in plain terms. But a good many declare that they are in favor of religion and the state. But this is a distinction without any material difference.

What is meant by religion and the state is a religious state; that is, a state which recognizes and fosters religion, but has no religious establishment, or no state church, such as they have in England, and in most Roman Catholic countries.

Of course the state ought not to be anti-religious. To be anti-religious would be to be against religion, and clearly the state has no right to assume an attitude of hostility to religion. But this is very far from saying that the state ought to be religious. It is not at all necessary that the state should have any religious character whatever. It should be non-religious. A state need have no more religious character than a bank or a mercantile concern. Nobody ever speaks of a "Christian bank," or a "Christian mercantile establishment." Every member of a firm may be a Christian and yet the firm itself have no religious character, and make no religious profession. It is simply a business concern organized for purely business purposes. And that is just what every state ought to be—simply a concern created for the transaction of public business.

## NO CHRISTIAN BANKS.

A bank may have among its stock-holders, and even upon its board of directors, some men who are Christians and some who are not Christians. But the Christians do not feel that they have any duty to impose their religion upon the non-Christians by any official act. They may as individuals go just as far as they see fit in promulgating the tenets of their faith; but nobody ever heard of a Christian director of a bank saying to his fellow directors, "Now, in as much as a majority of us are Christians, and inasmuch as this bank was established by Christian men, with capital inherited from Christian fathers, we must so amend our articles of incorporation as to show that this is a Christian bank." And nobody ever heard of any sort of a business institution undertaking to impose the religion of a part of the individuals who composed it upon all the individuals composing it. This idea of collective responsibility for the religious views and practices of the individual does not obtain anywhere except in church and state affairs. It obtains in the church because the church exists for the very purpose of promulgating religion. It exists in the state because of the false, theocratical idea of civil government which has come down to us from the days of Constantine. The idea is destructive of individual responsibility and engenders despotism.

## THE STATE AND RELIGION IN ROME.

This idea of a religious state is not Christian but pagan. It comes not from Christ but from Rome. Rome was pagan, but intensely religious. The gods were to be recognized in every walk of life and at every turn. One could not attend a social function, nor even partake of a meal, without either honoring or denying the gods. And to deny the gods was to be guilty not only of sacrilege but of treason against the state, for the state was the chief god—the embodiment of all the gods. Moreover reverence for the gods was thought to be essential to good citizenship. Religion was maintained by the state, not primarily for the good of the individual, but because it was the bulwark of the state.

Exactly the same argument is urged to-day for the support of Christianity by the state that was urged for the support of paganism in Rome. The idea is just as pagan to-day as it was two thousand years ago; and it is just as much opposed to true piety now as it was then.
