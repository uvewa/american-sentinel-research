It is pleasant to note that among some few at least of those who are laboring for the promotion of Sunday observance it is coming to be recognized that this end cannot be secured by legislation. Thus in the report made by a committee of the Congregational churches of Massachusetts, at the session of the General Association, held recently, we find the following:

"3. It is not worth while for the friends of the Sabbath to look to the legislature of Massachusetts for help. The tendency of recent legislation is to weaken the force of existing Sunday laws. It may not be many years before most of them will be swept from the statute books. Our chief confidence must be in the living God and in enlightened and quickened Christian sentiment. Old, threadbare truths and principles must somehow be freshened in the public mind. Frequent reiteration in the pulpit, in the Sunday-school, in the prayer-meeting, in the Christian Endeavor Societies, of the claims of the Lord's day upon the individual, upon the church, upon the state, and upon the community, is absolutely indispensable. It must be 'line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.' The educational process is the most potent and hopeful factor in the problem."

By all means let the battle for the preservation of Sabbath observance and for the claims of one day as against another, be fought out by appeals to the intellect and the heart, and not by appeal to force. Force never settled any question; force has no rightful place save where the question has been already settled. The question of Sabbath observance, as to its necessity and the day to be set apart thereby, is an unsettled one, save as each individual has settled it for himself. When force steps into the arena of intellectual controversy it only adds distracting elements which make the situation worse than it was before. Truth asks no aid from force. It will win in the end, and the use of force in the contest would only delay the hour of victory.

Let the friends of the Sabbath cease looking to legislatures, and look to the Lord; let them cease petitioning legislatures, and petition the divine throne.

Then will they be enabled to make real progress toward the final establishment of Sabbath observance in the earth, though the settlement of the controversy may not come in the way which they had planned.
