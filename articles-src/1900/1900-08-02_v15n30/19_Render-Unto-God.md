There are certain duties which men are bound to render to "Caesar"—the state—and certain other duties also which men are bound to render to God. Matt. 22:15-20. If men fail to render to God that which is his, they commit a grievous wrong, but this does not confer upon the state authority to step in and command those things which have been withheld from the Lord. If our children fail to show to us that love and respect and obedience which is our due from them, our neighbor across the street may be shocked, but he is not thereby authorized to step in with a club and compel our ungrateful children to perform their duty. We would resent such an intrusion, and no more is our divine Parent pleased that the state should step in and command from his earthly children, under threat of legal penalties, the performance of any act showing love and reverence for him. Such an offering to the Lord would be only an insult. "He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." The most that the state can do therefore in enjoining upon men the duty of Sabbath observance, can result only in their offering to God that which is abomination in his sight.
