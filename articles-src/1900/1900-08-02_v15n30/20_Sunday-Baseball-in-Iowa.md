An Iowa paper says that "the question of Sunday baseball playing is receiving considerable attention in Des Moines at present, and two or three arrests have been made."

The fact that baseball and other games are prohibited on Sunday equally with labor and business, proves conclusively the religious motive back of them. The much-talked-of "civil Sabbath" is simply a religious institution enforced by civil law.
