The Hong-Kong correspondent of the New York World, writing to that paper under date of June 12, says that "the American troops are practicing in spots in the Philippines a policy beside which a bandit law is a tame affair." The authorities, he explains, have decided that "the rebellion must be 'kept down' and in spite of peace proclamations the soldiers resort to horrible measures with the natives."

Continuing his seemingly almost incredible story, the World's correspondent says:

"Since the war was officially declared to be ended we have killed more Filipinos than the Spaniards did in both rebellions. Captains and lieutenants are sometimes accusers, judges and executioners. If half a dozen natives, more or less, are shot on suspicion of being our enemies, no news of it reaches the military governor, who wants none."
