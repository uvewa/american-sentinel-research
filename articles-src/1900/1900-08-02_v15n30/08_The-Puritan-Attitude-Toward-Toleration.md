*(From a "Review of the Puritans," by Thomas Coit, D. D., member of the New York Historical Society.)*

That toleration was excluded from the very idea of religion by Puritanism, is evident from the fact that, in the Larger Catechism, one of the heinous offences against Heaven under the Second Commandment—a virtual commission of idolatry—is the "tolerating a false religion." Many will perhaps look into some edition of that Catechism, published now [1845], and say I am incorrect. Let them know, that the loss of the quoted words is only a modern improvement. The unexpurgated original reads as I state, as anyone can satisfy himself by examining an edition as early as my own, viz., of 1768. When the sin of toleration ceased to be a sin, I know not. The edition quoted proves, that toleration continued its sinful existence to the verge of the American Revolution. * * * The Cambridge and Saybrook Platforms virtually entertain the idea avowed by the Catechism, when they say the civil magistrate is "to put forth his coercive power as the matter shall require." But these, too, have fallen into desuetude * * and when they began to give "an uncertain sound" it is equally impossible to tell.

It is of little consequence. Suffice it to know what genuine Puritanism has been; and also, that its disavowal of toleration has been no inoperative theory. That this disavowal was no mere idea, is evident from the fact that Pym once boldly broached it in a Puritanic British Parliament. He "asserted that it was the duty of the legislature to establish true religion and to punish false"; and how cordially they believed him and acted out his doctrine, history has recorded with many a sigh and tear.

This, however, is quite enough to show how, in England, Puritanism, though it had once groaned for toleration, made others afterward groan for its own lack of it. Come we now to the land where it was (poetically) an exile from the pearl of great price—the enjoyment of an unmolested conscience. Did it there display no anxiety to molest the consciences of others? Let us see.

And first of all, Master Cotton, whom thy contemporaries esteem so "famous," I call thee upon the stand. Hear his "awful words," as Shepard truly characterizes them. * * "It was toleration that made the world anti-Christian, and the church never took hurt by the punishment of heretics." Again: "The Lord keep us from being bewitched with the whore's cup, lest while we seem to detest and reject her with open face of profession, we do not bring her in by a back door of toleration, and so come at last to drink deeply in the cup of the Lord's wrath, and be filled with the cup of her plagues."

Shepard was a worthy pupil of Master Cotton; for he goes if possible a step beyond him, and ascribes toleration to the Father of Lies. * * "'Tis Satan's policy," says he, "to plead for an indefinite and boundless toleration; as Chemnitius excellently shows from those words, Mark 1:24, 'Let us alone.' He calls it diabolica machinatio in conciliationibus religionum; i. e., Christ may have his kingdom if he will let Satan alone with his, and so both of them live lovingly and quietly together." So Shepard not only asserts his doctrine, but with the help of the profound Chemnitius establishes it, with due exegetical propriety. * * *

The very year succeeding [1673], heard as loud thunder against this luckless subject of toleration. "I look upon toleration," says President Oakes of Harvard University, "as the first-born of all abominations." This, too, was said in an Election sermon; and as that, according to Belknap, "may generally be accounted the echo of the public voice," it is the unanimous dictum of a Puritan community.

Of all Puritan classics, however, on the subject of toleration, the author of the "Simple Cobbler of Aggawam" bears away the palm. He makes it so ineffably revolutionary, that it empties on earth the contents of the bottomless pit, and overturns the throne itself of the Absolute Supreme. Speaking in one place of a shoal of sects, which toleration would disenthril, he describes it as "In a word, room for hell above ground." In another he says, in a figure I never saw paralleled, "To authorize an untruth by a toleration of state, is to build a sconce against the walls of heaven, to batter God out of his chair."

I will give but one quotation more, and that shall be from Hubbard, the historian, to show how the Puritans abated their intolerance by the most studious gradations—conforming it carefully to those times when, as Justice Story has told us, persecution became less frequent because it was less safe. "And indeed," says he, "let the experience of all reformed churches be consulted withal, and it will appear that disorder and confusion of the church will not be avoided by all the determination, advice, and counsel, of synods or other messengers of churches, unless they be a little acuated* by the civil authority. All men are naturally so wedded to their own apprehension, that unless there be a coercive power to restrain, the order and rule of the gospel will not be attended."

And these were the men who thought Archbishop Laud "the chief of sinners" because, esteeming themselves too fondly "wedded to their own apprehensions," he employed some of their own beloved "coercive power," and "acuated" church discipline "a little" by the civil authority, that they might attend to what he, as their spiritual guide, deemed the gospel's order and rule! * * *

Such were the men who denounced the intolerance of the Church of England. But a few years previous, and you would have thought them (in words, that is) the most disinterested champions for liberty of conscience the world ever saw. Toleration! Oh, it was their favorite and ever unworn theme, when they wanted to inflict their "levellisme" in church and state upon an audience in a cathedral, whose revenues they might spoil as lawfully as Israelites could Egyptians.

* Acuated—the word means, "made sharp as a needle."
