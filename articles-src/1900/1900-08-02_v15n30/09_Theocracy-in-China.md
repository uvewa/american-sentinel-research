Hon. Charles Denby, former United States Minister to China, in The Independent.

The Chinese government has been said to be patriarchal. In its actual administration it is undoubtedly patriarchal. The emperor is sire, and his officers, down to the head man in every village, occupy the position of father, just as a man does of his household. But behind the patriarchal system, and controlling it, is the principle of theocracy. No nation in the world in its administration of the law acknowledges so directly its responsibilities to the rule of heaven. Judged by governmental acts, nowhere does the deity so completely rule and control the destinies of men as in China. In the greatest, as in the smallest, affairs, heaven sways the conduct of the emperor and all his officials, and the people. When Ching Tang, founder of the Shang dynasty, B. C. 1766, and Wu Wang of the Chau, B. C. 1122, took up arms against the emperors, it was claimed that they had not fulfilled the decrees of heaven, and for that reason they had forfeited their right to the throne. I saw an altar in the Temple of Heaven, which was struck by lightning, burn up. The next day, by an imperial decree, punishment was awarded the guardians of this great edifice because of its destruction. I inquired of a learned Chinese how it was possible for any government to punish an official for the plain and direct act of nature, or of God, in which he had no concern whatever. I was told that heaven would not have destroyed the altar unless a sin had been committed—that some wrong had been done, and it had to be punished by the state.

It was said that even if the guardians had done nq wrong, their predecessors must have committed a crime, because the deity would not have destroyed the temple unless somebody had been guilty of wrong-doing. By the same line of reasoning the law of China reconciles with the idea of justice the punishment of the insane. It is freely admitted that an insane person does not know what he is doing—that no moral guilt attaches to his act. Nevertheless, when he murders his father, as sometimes happens, he is condemned to suffer the punishment of the Ling-Chir; that is to say, he is slowly and deliberately cut to pieces by severing one by one his members from his body. This severity is accounted for by the statement that the deity would not have made the man insane unless he, or some one connected with him, had committed a crime, and that crime must be punished.

Among the rulers of the world the Pope alone approaches the Emperor of China in the claim to be the vice-regent of Heaven. They alone interpret the decrees of the deity. No senator of the United States, who ascribes everything that has been done in governmental affairs to the divine command, is more eloquent on that subject than the emperor in his official papers. His ascending the throne is described as his "receiving from heaven and revolving nature the government of the world." In the announcement of his ascent to the dragon seat he proclaims that his predecessor, "the dragon charioteer, became a guest on high." He speaks of the divine utensil devolving on his "contemptible person," and goes on to say that with veneration, "I receive charge of heaven's great concerns."

He is the high priest, too, of his nation. Three miles south of the palace in the Chinese city, the Tien Tan, or altar of heaven, is situated. Here the emperor, accompanied by the princes of his family and his nobles, goes at the winter solstice. On this day the houses on the route are all closed up. The side streets are barred with matting, and the foreigners are requested not to go on the streets which the imperial cortege must traverse. If any one peeps he is shot by the guard. In a compound, surrounded by three miles of wall, amid dense grèves of locust, pine and fir trees, there is a second wall which surrounds the sacred buildings. As in all temples in the East, there is a copse of enormous old cypress trees, and in the midst of them stands the great south altar. Williams says of it:

"This most important of Chinese religious structures is a beautiful triple circular terrace of white marble, whose base is 210, middle stage 150 and top 90 feet in width, each terrace encompassed by a richly carved balustrade. A curious symbol of the number three and its multiples may be noticed in the measurements of this pile. The uppermost terrace, whose height above the ground is about 18 feet, is paved with marble slabs, forming nine concentric circles—the inner of nine stones inclosing a central piece, and around this each receding layer consists of a successive multiple of nine until the square of nine (a favorite number of Chinese philosophy) is reached in the uttermost row. It is upon the single round stone in the center of the upper platform that the emperor kneels when worshiping heaven and his ancestors at the winter solstice."

Nearby is the great furnace, nine feet high, faced with green porcelain, and ascended on three of its sides by porcelain staircases. In this receptacle is consumed at the yearly ceremony a burnt offering of a bullock entire and without blemish. Formerly the emperor went to the Temple of Heaven in a car drawn by an elephant. The elephant was still in Peking when I was there, but of later years the emperor is carried in a chair borne by sixteen men. He goes first to the Chai-Kung, or "palace of fasting," where he prepares himself by lonely meditation for his duty. His followers likewise prepare themselves for the occasion by fasting, ablution and change of garments.

In the Temple of Heaven there are no signs, placards, images or memorials. With magnificent simplicity, imitating the ancient Jewish rites, as the representative and high-priest of one-fourth of the human family, the emperor worships the unknown god, Shangti. Who was Shangti? Here the layman had better pause. It is not his business to discuss theological questions. The missionaries have worried for many years over this subject. If Shangti was a deity, then his worship bears no resemblance to idolatry, but the religious thinker generally asserts that he was not an entity, not the Jupiter, nor the Jehovah, but that he represents heaven; that is to say, pantheism. Williams, the great missionary, diplomatist and author, disposes of the question as follows:

"The idea that the Chinese have of heaven seems to be pantheistic, and in worshiping heaven, earth, and terrestrial gods they mean to include and propitiate all superior powers. If, as seems probable, the original idea of Shangti, as it can be imperfectly gleaned from early records, was that of the Supreme intelligence, it has since been lost."

I cannot see how this idea has been lost. As was done six thousand years ago, so to-day the emperor performs the ancient rites, and worships Shangti, and invites him to banquet with his imperial ancestors. Nothing ever changes in China. This is the religion of the state. For the people there are three sects, usually called Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, or rationalism. Among the gentry and literati naturally Confucianism is the most popular, because it is no religion at all; it is simply philosophy. Confucius had little to say about religion. He confined himself to man's duty to his neighbor, and let the gods alone. He did not teach the duty of man to a higher power. In our day he would have been called an agnostic. Williams says:

"He admitted that he did not understand much about the gods, and that the obligations of man lay rather in doing his duties to his relatives and society than in worshiping spirits unknown. 'Not knowing even life,' said he, 'how can we know death?'"

I shall imitate the modesty of Confucius and not undertake to discuss a subject that I know nothing about—the purpose of this article being simply to show how theocratic principles enter into the actual administration of governmental affairs in the Chinese empire.
