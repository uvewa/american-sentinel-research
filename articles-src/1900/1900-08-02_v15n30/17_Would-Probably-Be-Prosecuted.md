A reader in a State having an iron-clad Sunday law without "the usual exemption" in favor of those "who keep another day," sends us several newspaper clippings—reading notices of Sunday excursions, which he says are well patronized by many of the best church people of that place. "And the ministers never say anything against them. I do not think they dare to. I do not know what some of their members would do if a seventh-day keeper should do some work on Sunday."

Well, judging by what has been done in other places, the Sabbatarian would be prosecuted. It is true that persons who are not Sabbatarians are sometimes prosecuted for Sunday work, but they are not half as likely to be thus prosecuted as are those who keep the seventh day. The reason is not far to seek. Sunday work coupled with Sabbath-keeping is a practical protest against the dogma of Sunday sacredness. It is not the Sunday work that "hurts" so much as it is the keeping of another day.
