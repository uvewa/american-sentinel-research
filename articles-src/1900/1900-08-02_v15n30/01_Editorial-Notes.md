Moral obligation can never be the basis of civil law.

The Lord says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath."

The "Christian world" says: "The first day is the Sabbath."

The Lord enforces the observance of his day by the spiritual law of love.

The "Christian world" enforces the observance of its day by the physical law of force.

A truly "civil Sabbath" could not possibly be anything but a holiday. It could never be a holy day. Holy things are not civil, and civil things are not holy.

No country in the world ever established a weekly rest-day, forbidding both labor and amusement upon it, except from religious motives.

Civil law is not designed to conserve moral right but civil rights.

Freedom of conscience means not only liberty to think, but liberty to do.

Just government must guarantee not only freedom of the mind but liberty of the body as well in everything which does not infringe the equal rights of others.
