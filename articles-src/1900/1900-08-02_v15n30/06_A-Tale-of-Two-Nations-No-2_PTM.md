Thus came the King breaking dawn for a new kingdom and a monarchy of a kind hitherto unknown in the world. When his disciples strove as to who should be the greatest, Jesus called them unto him and said, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister. And whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant. Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many." This is an utter and entire reversal of all earthly principles of monarchy. The principle of earthly governments is that all men shall defend and save the king; but in the kingdom and monarchy of Christ it was the king who gave his life in the defense and for the salvation of every member of the human family. In another place he told the striving disciples, "Be ye not called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren . . . neither be ye called master: for one is your master, even Christ; but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant."

In the kingdom of Christ, royal position is measured by willingness to serve, instead of a willingness to accept service, by a willingness to give up those so-called natural rights, rather than by a willingness to maintain and defend them at all hazards.

Peter on one occasion came to Christ saying, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times seven?" Jesus said unto him, "I say not unto thee until seven times; but until seventy times seven." Such was the law of the kingdom of God. It should be the law to-day with all who truly live in the kingdom of God. And again he said, "Take heed to yourselves; if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him; and if he repent forgive him; and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, 'I repent,' thou shalt forgive him." This was the law of the kingdom of Christ.

"Ye have heard that it hath been said," he tells his people, "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but I say unto you that ye resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. Ye have heard that it hath been said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute, that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love that which loveth you what reward have you? Do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye even more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."

All of this comes well from the Master's lips, from the One who when he was reviled reviled not again, who when he suffered threatened not but calmly commending his spirit to his God gave birth to these glorious words, the light of which has illuminated the ages, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

Such was the monarchy of the Master. It needs not to be said that in the human sense of the word it was no monarchy at all, but in the deepest, truest sense, as our better natures will admit, it is a monarchy of the most noble and lofty nature, a monarchy of service and sacrifice, a monarchy of self-surrender and self-abnegation, but a monarchy which in the endless ages of eternity will prove itself more powerful to set up and establish an enduring kingdom where rebellion and insurrection will never come than all the systems which earth has ever devised.

"Conquering kings their titles make
From the captives that they take;
Jesus from a mightier deed,
By the captives which he freed."
