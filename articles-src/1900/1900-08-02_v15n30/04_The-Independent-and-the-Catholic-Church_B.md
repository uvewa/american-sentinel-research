The New York Independent is supposed to be a Protestant journal. Nevertheless it contains some things that have a strange sound coming from a Protestant source. For instance, in its issue of July 26 the Independent says:

"The appointment of Bishop Blenk, an American priest who speaks Spanish, as head of the Catholic Church in Porto Rico, seems to be accomplishing most desirable results in the way of restoring the loyalty of the people to the Church."

In capitalizing "church" in this case we have simply followed the Independent. When a Catholic says "the Church" he not only means the Roman Catholic Church, but he implies thereby that there is no other church. Probably the Independent uses the same term only by way of courtesy; but it is impossible to say, since it regards "restoring the loyalty of the people" to the Catholic Church as a "most desirable" result.

However this may be, the Independent waxes quite enthusiastic over the work of the new Bishop of Porto Rico and says:

"His appointment as bishop gave the island a man who had become acquainted with its condition, and who was an enthusiastic American, and who thus quite escaped the traditions and suspicions which had hampered the Church so long as it was under Spanish dominion. Last February he issued a pastoral letter exhorting the people to cling to their faith and to be true to the flag of their new country. He promised them that after a period of testing their power of self-government they might expect to be received as one of the States of the Union. This letter was read in all the churches."

The Independent seems to see no impropriety in the bishop's telling the people what they may expect from the government. But it may be said that this is only the bishop's opinion. Very well; be it so. Other governments have found that in dealing with colonies largely Catholic, it is sometimes quite necessary to have bishops who have opinions in accord with the government, or rather to have the government in accord with the bishops; or at least to so far yield to the wishes of the bishop as to keep his influence on the side of the government. Henry IV. and Prince Bismarck are not the only civil rulers who have gone to Conossa, nor is there any assurance that there may not be yet many others to travel the same road.

In order to maintain harmony between the civil and ecclesiastical authorities, governments have sometimes insisted upon a voice in the appointment of bishops. But this can be only when "the Church" is supported in whole or in part by the government. Therefore as this government has no financial interest in "the Church," it seems altogether more likely that the government will be compelled to yield to "the Church" than that "the Church" will yield to the government.

Of course where each attends strictly to its own affairs there can be no clash between church and state; but as "Rome never changes" it is not a supposable case that "the Church" will not demand things in Porto Rico that are not in harmony with American principles. If she don't get what she wants "the Church" well knows how to make things very uncomfortable for the civil authorities in such communities as "our new insular possessions."
