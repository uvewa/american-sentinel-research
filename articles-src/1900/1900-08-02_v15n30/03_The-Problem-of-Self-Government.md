In a discussion of the question "What is self-government?" The Outlook labors to give the impression that self-government, as applied to nations and peoples, is a very complex thing, and that only when the various problems it presents in a given case have been solved so that there is clear sailing for the new ship of state, ought the privilege of self-government to be intrusted to any people.

Thus The Outlook proceeds to reason after this fashion in regard to Cuba:

"What shall we do in Cuba? Withdraw our forces? recall General Wood? leave the Cubans to govern themselves? This is the formula. But no sooner is there some indication that this formula is to be acted upon by the United States, than representative men of property, who have everything to lose and nothing to gain by revolution, appeal to us not to withdraw and leave them to the mercy of the revolutionists. America has promised to Cuba her independence; and so far as we can see no one desires to cancel that promise, though some think it was made too hastily and not wisely. But when is Cuba 'pacified'? Is it pacified because it is at peace while our troops remain there to keep order? And who are the people of Cuba to whom the duties and responsibilities of government should be handed over by us? Are they all the men and all the women? or only all the men? or only all the white men? or only all the native-born Cubans? or only the men who have some measure of intelligence or some property interests, or both? These and kindred questions come in to perplex the real man of affairs, who has to consider the property interests involved, the industries just coming into existence, the schools just established, the sanitary laws reluctantly recognized and obeyed for the first time in Cuba's history. Such questions cannot be cavalierly dismissed with the formula, 'self-government.'"

In like manner The Outlook takes up the case of Porto Rico:

"What shall we do in Porto Rico? The figures are somewhat in doubt, but apparently not over five per cent of the inhabitants can read and write. Does self-government mean that the ninety-five per cent shall be put under the government of the five per cent? Does it mean, on the contrary, that the men of intelligence and property shall be put under the government of the ignorant and the propertyless?"

## SELF-GOVERNMENT A RIGHT.

Many other like questions may be asked; indeed, it would be hard to set a limit to the questions that might be anticipated in considering the fitness of any praticular people for self-government. But is it necessary to consider such questions at all. Is the right of self-government at all affected by the questions that may be raised as to the results that may follow from its exercise?

If King George III. had been allowed to settle to his own satisfaction the various problems relating to the question of the fitness of the American colonies for self-government, before granting them self-government, would those colonies ever have become self-governing? As any one who will read the history of that time may know, there was as much doubt in the minds of the king and parliament respecting the colonists' capacity for self-government, as there is now in the mind of The Outlook editor respecting the like capacity among the late subjects of Spain. Nor was there wanting that which seemed fully to justify their opinion. Among the rebellious people which overturned the king's authority in the States, the elements of a stable government were not conspicuous; and for years after the new nation set out upon the pathway of self-government, it presented but a sorry spectacle among the powers of earth. It was without finances or credit, it was torn by internal dissention which ripened into open strife, the colonies were jealous and suspicious of one another to such a degree that harmony between them seemed impossible, and the situation grew worse instead of better, until it seemed that the new fabric of self-government would inevitably fall to pieces. Those who predicted its downfall stood pointing at it the finger of scorn, and justifying their own wisdom. But the republic survived, and out of the conflict of discordant views and parties, under the inspiration only of the love of liberty, were developed the elements of stability and strength which established the new nation upon a solid basis of prosperity and crowned the experiment of self-government with triumphant success.

But the colonies would never have become self-governing if they had waited for the British parliament to raise and solve all the problems involved in the experiment of self-government for that time; and if the like questions respecting Cuba must be considered and settled in Congress before Cuba has independence, it may safely be affirmed that Cuba will wait long for self-government.

The right of self-government for any people is an independent right, and not a privilege dependent upon decisions made by the finite wisdom of men. The problems that may arise from the inauguration of republican government in Cuba, or in any land, are beyond the power of any man to foresee. Those problems which appear greatest in anticipation, may prove to be but minor ones in reality, while really formidable difficulties may arise which were wholly unforeseen. The American Republic came near being split asunder by a civil war, which no one foresaw at the beginning; and as the problem of self-government is not one which the foresight and wisdom of one people can settle for another, so the right of self-government is not one to be regulated by the authority of one people over another. It is a right independent and unalienable.

So long as a colony of ants can maintain self-government, so long as the bushmen of Central Africa can live and flourish independently of the advice and authority of their superior fellow-men, and so long as the gospel message proclaims self-government to all men as a duty, and pledges the power of God for its accomplishment in any and all in every land who will receive that message, let not that right be denied to any under the plea that they are not fit to receive the boon. The only people not fit for self-government are those who do not want it, who prefer despotism in its place.
