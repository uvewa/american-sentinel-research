The great objection to the Sunday paper on the part of the believers in Sunday sacredness, is not the fact that some Sunday work is done in producing the paper. The amount of work actually done on a Sunday paper on Sunday, is much smaller than the work done on the Monday paper. The great objection to the Sunday paper is that so many people read it instead of going to church. It is in this respect a rival of the preacher; and the average Sunday preacher feels that he has a divine right to a monopoly of the day. While he does not ask the government directly to compel the people to go to church, he does demand that civil laws shall be so framed and administered as to reduce to the minimum the possibility of going anywhere else on Sunday. Of course very many people, if shut up to the choice of spending the entire day at home or going to church would go to church.
