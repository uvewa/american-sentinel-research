Among the resolutions adopted at the recent meeting of the W. C. T. U. of Manitoba, held at Portage la Prairie, was this one touching Sunday observance:

Resolved—That we guard our Lord's day, and that we co-operate with the Provincial Lord's Day Alliance in endeavoring to secure better enforcement of the same. That we do our best to assist trainmen in obtaining Sabbath rest by discouraging Sunday traveling, Sunday newspapers, etc., and that we aid, by all the influence we possess, every endeavor to attain this object, not only for trainmen but for merchants, mail clerks, milkmen, and all whom we know are laboring on this day.

The "Provincial Lord's Day Alliance" is an organization formed for the purpose of securing the legal enforcement of Sunday. It is of the same character exactly as the various "Lord's Day" and "Sabbath" unions, associations, and alliances in the United States. The one dominant thought in all of them is to compel by civil law the observance of a religious institution.
