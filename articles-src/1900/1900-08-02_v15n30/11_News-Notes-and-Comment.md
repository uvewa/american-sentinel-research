## NEWS, NOTES AND COMMENT

It is reported that Russian soldiers are perpetrating atrocities on women and children in China.

* * *

Recent events in South Africa indicate that the Boer war is not yet over. Within three weeks the Boers have outgeneraled their opponents in a remarkably skillful manner. Lord Roberts is calling for reinforcements from England, and all the seasoned men available are being sent out to him.

It is announced that President McKinley's "policy will be to cooperate with the Powers for the relief of the foreigners in Peking if alive, and of punishment of their murders, if dead. The United States will furnish its full quota of men and warships and bear a share in all needed expense, but the United States will not be a party to any alliance hereafter for the dismemberment of China or the acquisition of territory."

* * *

It is now announced that within a few months Cuba is to have "independence," but with limitations:

1. The foreign relations of Cuba to be managed through the American government at Washington.
2. Cuba to have no power to declare war without the consent of the United States.
3. The United States Government to have a veto power over legislation increasing the Cuban debt beyond certain limits to be set forth in the new constitution.
4. The United States to have a certain well-defined supervision over the Cuban treasury.
5. The United States to retain for a period of years, if not indefinitely, control of the fortifications which command the port of Havana and other important cities of the republic."

The Houghton County (Mich.) Ministerial Association has started the boycott on the Houghton Daily Mining Gazette. A dispatch to the Chicago Chronicle says that at numerous churches in the copper district, Sunday, July 22, the services were "devoted to a plea for boycotting this newspaper, which started a Sunday edition four weeks ago and has contumaciously refused to suspend the same at the behest of the allied preachers. At the churches whose pastors preached against Sunday newspapers printed postal cards were distributed for signatures of subscribers ordering the newspapers stopped immediately. The pastors are now bending their energies toward destroying the circulation of the paper and are personally circulating papers ordering subscriptions discontinued for signatures of all subscribers amenable to pastoral admonition. The newspaper is owned by a stock company, comprised of the leading bankers, mining and professional men of the district."

German newspapers bitterly arraign President McKinley for his reply to the Chinese request for intervention.

When it was announced that under certain conditions the President would accede to the Chinese appeals, the most moderate of the organs declared Mr. McKinley was presuming too much.

For instance, the Hanover Courier declared that to treat with China in such a manner was treason to the other allies and should result in the enforced withdrawal of American troops from the international force. Had Mr. McKinley not held back the exact conditions on which the American government would interfere, such criticism might not have been offered, but as it is, the German papers continue to denounce the administration.

The New York Evening Post, speaking of Lord Salisbury's address to the missionaries meeting in London, in which he practically implied that the imprudence of missionaries in China was a contributing cause to the existing troubles, says:

"But one at least of the missionary boards has taken up this challenge of the British premier. The secretary of the China Inland Mission wrote to the press to explain how the rules of his society explicitly directed missionaries to refrain from appealing to British consuls to 'demand the vindication of real or supposed rights.' The regulations add: 'Under no circumstances may any missionary on his own responsibility make any written appeal to the British or other foreign authorities.' The China Inland Mission has been in existence thirty-five years, and in that time has planted one hundred and twenty-five stations in ten of the interior provinces. Its missionaries have gone far beyond the reach of gunboats; yet in all this time only one missionary has lost his life through the violence of the people. On the other hand, British consuls have testified in the most unmistakable terms to the value of the work of the Inland Mission in conciliating the natives, so that they observe a more friendly attitude toward all foreigners. If Lord Salisbury were to apply his cynical analysis to diplomacy in China, and to the seizure of Chinese territory, by nominally Christian nations, he would come nearer the exciting cause of the outbreak."

Fourth Assistant Postmaster General Bristow's report detailing conditions as he found them in the Cuban postal service has been made public, and reveals the existence of a state of affairs almost without a parallel. Mr. Bristow does not spare any of the minor thieves like Neely and his confederates. He also makes complete exposure of Rathbone, the director general, who was suspended last month.

Mr. Bristow finds that Neely's embezzlements aggregated at least $131,713, and says this will be increased by the discovery of additional sales of surcharged stamps, but will not exceed $150,000 in the aggregate.

Mr. Bristow says he was justified in recommending the removal of Director General Rathbone. There is no doubt that in the matter of unauthorized per diem allowances, personal expenses and warrants cashed and unaccounted for he unlawfully appropriated to his own use money of the Cuban revenues.

The Chinese doctrine of "public sin," described as follows by a writer in the Forum, is based upon the same wisdom which moves some people in the United States to charge upon others or upon the Government the responsibility for public calamities:

"In China there is a failure in duty known as 'public sin,' which means the sin of an official in allowing calamities such as floods or drouths or famines to visit the people. An officer temporarily deprived of his rank until he should repair the breach in the bank of a river, caused by excessive rains, said to the writer, 'It is difficult to escape public sin.' Li Hung Chang, viceroy of the province, was deprived of his yellow jacket for the same 'sin.' An official had just been appointed to take charge of repairs on the Yellow River, when a more serious breach occurred. In reporting the matter he humbly acknowledged his sin and begged the emperor to fix his punishment. The emperor forgave him for the reason that he had just entered upon his office, and so was not fully responsible for what had taken place."
