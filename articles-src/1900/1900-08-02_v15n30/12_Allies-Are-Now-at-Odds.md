Under this heading, a London dispatch of recent date says:

The latest news from China is very disquieting; it is said that there is considerable dissension among the allies on account of Russia's attempts to control the railway between Taku and Peking. It is reported that the czar's officers have intimated that they intend to control the lines of communication until the war is over. After that they say they will restore the railway to the Chinese.

At the same time the French are said to be endeavoring to obtain a monopoly of the tug-boat service on the Peiho river, with the intention of sharing Russia's complete domination of the right of way to the Chinese capital.

Admiral Seymour and the British residents in Tientsin are said to be in open revolt of the plan proposed by Russia, as they consider it a direct menace to British interests and calculated to interfere seriously with the advance of the Peking expedition.

The mutual jealousy of the great world Powers is the ominous feature of the present situation in the far East, from every standpoint except that of China. It certainly threatens to plunge the world into war. It may result simply in preserving the integrity of Chinese territory.
