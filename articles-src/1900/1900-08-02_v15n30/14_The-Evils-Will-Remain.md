It is thought by some that the contest now going on in the Established Church of England, between Ritualists and anti-Ritualists is hastening disestablishment. "The Ritualists," says the Outlook, "are represented by an extremely aggressive militant organization called the English Church Union. The union has just issued a protest against the decision of the Archbishops [against Ritualism] and although there is in the protest only a veiled hint of what may be done in case the protest is of no avail, the uncompromising members of the union declare that, if their particular interpretation of the Prayer-Book is to be denounced by the courts, it would be better to have disestablishment at once. Though by no means a Ritualistic organ, The Outlook agrees to this opinion. The Ritualists are really doing what the Nonconformists have done in other days and are doing to-day—they are upholding the Protestant tradition, that is, the right of private judgment; and that right logically involves, sooner or later, separation of church and state. The protest of the English Church Union is not likely to delay but to accelerate disestablishment."

But whatever may be true of the legal status of any particular ecclesiastical organization in England, that country will never be free from practical church and state union. It may be that some of the grosser features of such union, such as direct financial support of the clergy, will be done away, but the more subtle evils will remain forever.
