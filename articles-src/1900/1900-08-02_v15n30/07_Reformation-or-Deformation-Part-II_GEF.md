In the preceding paper it was, I trust, made plain that attempts by government to reform or to foster either religion or literature, not only invariably fail, but produce the opposite from the desired effect. Even were it possible for government to invariably lend its influence and support to the right side, it could not then produce one impulse of genius or one heart throb of true piety. But governments are fallible and erring; they are also necessarily conservative, and so opposed to the progressive truth. Buckle says, "After a careful study I think myself authorized to say, that for one instance in which a sovereign has recompensed a man who is before his age, there are at least twenty instances of his recompensing one who is behind his age." (History of Civilization. Vol. I. Page 495.) It was this which Jesus foresaw when he forbade his church all appeal to force, "Lest while they gather up the tares they root up also the wheat." "Almighty God created the mind free, and all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments, or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness."—Jefferson.

One of the chief values of history is, that through it, by means of the past, we may read and understand the present and the future.

There is to-day a religio-political Christian citizenship movement, identical in motives and methods with that of the fourth century. This movement to-day, like that of the fourth century, proposes to make this a Christian nation by law, and to so control matters that in the end only Christians can hold office. By these means they propose to usher in the reign of Christ.

### PUTS A PREMIUM ON HYPOCRISY.

However good the intentions, there can be but one result. The movement puts a premium on hypocrisy; and as soon as it is seen that the church is the only road to political preferment, all office seekers will become externally very pious, and will seek and gain admission to the church. Under those circumstances only an honest man will have the courage to stay outside the church. The only possible result to the church is foretold in Revelation where the prophet says it will become, "The hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." The rule and reign of such a church will be the rule and reign of evil, not of good. It matters not how good and pure the intentions of the religio-political leaders now may be, this can not change the final result. Jonathan Edwards, I think it was, once remarked that, "Hell is paved with good intentions."

The leaders of this movement propose to suppress by law all forms of vice and immorality. Especially do they propose to stop all Sunday labor and amusements, and to give the monopoly of that day wholly to the church. Exactly this was attempted, and by the same methods, in the fourth century, but with a result diametrically opposed to the welfare of the Kingdom of Christ.

### WOULD NOT QUESTION MOTIVES.

We would not to-day seek to question or to analyze the motives of the men and women who are working so persistently for religious laws; but in the light of history, we prophesy that the outcome of the movement will be the ushering in of a carnival of vice, crime, and intemperance such as the world has seldom or never seen. Let us coolly, and without prejudice, study the facts, and see if this will not be the only possible outcome.

One of the very first efforts of this movement to-day, is to see that all saloons are closed on Sunday. This is done professedly as a temperance measure, though it remains to be proven that drunkenness on Sunday is either more harmful or more wicked than on other days. It may be that Sunday closing of the saloons in some instances does prevent a man from starting in on a spree; yet the Voice, one of the leading prohibition papers, says of such closing, "As a temperance measure it has little merit. It is just as practical to get the Sunday supply of whisky or beer as of steak or roast. When the Omaha mayor began shutting up the Sunday saloon in that city, men had a dry and dreadful time for the first Sunday under that policy. They had not dreamed it to be a serious purpose of the mayor. They were not caught a second Sunday, however; they got an abundant supply the Saturday before."

## ANOTHER EVIL.

But there is another, and an evil side even to Sunday closing. Who can not see that a law forbidding murder or theft on Sunday only would necessarily sanction and legalize those crimes six days in the week? So if the business of selling liquor as a beverage, to produce paupers and lunatics, and people temporarily insane, and so liable to commit crime,—if this is a crime at all, all Sunday closing laws legalize it, and throw around it the respectability of government on six days in the week.

But this movement, as far as possible, proposes to stop all Sunday labor, and so make what is honest work on other days, a crime on Sunday, punishable by fine and imprisonment. This is to create a crime by law. Such artificial crimes are much more liable to be committed by well meaning young men than are real violations of human rights. But even such an arbitrary law once broken, the young man is treated as a common criminal. He is fined and imprisoned along with drunkards and thieves. He is disgraced before the community, and loses his own self respect, and so is started in the downward way. All laws that create artificial crimes, tend also to create real criminals.

Again, these laws enforce idleness on Sunday, for all men know that such laws can not reach the heart and enforce those divine sanctions which, to the true Christian, make the Sabbath very different from a day of idleness. All enforced Sabbath keeping, therefore, is simply enforced idleness, and it is a familiar proverb that the Devil always has work for idle hands to do.

## WOULD PROHIBIT SUNDAY CARS.

But this is not the worst. This movement proposes to stop all Sunday excursions, and as fast as possible, all Sunday trains, and so take away all means of getting into the country from the overheated and overcrowded city, on the only day when most people can have a chance to go. Doctor Evart gives their reason for this: "The Sunday train is another great evil. They can not afford to run a train unless they get a great many passengers, and so break up a great many congregations."

## WOULD STOP SUNDAY PAPERS.

They propose to stop the publication of all Sunday papers. This can not be to give those who work on the papers their Sunday, for the work on the Sunday paper is done largely on Saturday, and the work on the Monday paper is mostly done on Sunday. Dr. Evarts here also gives the real reason why it is the Sunday and not the Monday paper that is to be stopped. He says, "The laboring classes are apt to rise late on Sunday morning, read the Sunday paper, and allow the hour of worship to go by unheeded." They propose even to stop the Sunday street cars. In Toronto, Canada, a city of two hundred thousand inhabitants, the church people have thus far prevented the running of Sunday street cars; and this they have done in spite of the petitioning and the persistent effort of the common people to secure this cheap means of transit on their one leisure day in the week. Because of this fact, Toronto has been held up all over the United States, by the religio-political workers, as the pious and model city, a sample of what they hope to accomplish in this country.

Thus they propose to take from the poor man in our large cities every means he has of getting his family even to the parks of the city on the only day of the week he has for recreation and rest. There can be no denying the motive of this. It is an indirect effort to force church attendance. The writer, with many other ministers, was present at a hearing in the Massachusetts Legislature on these very points. From the speeches made by nearly every minister, it was so plain why they wanted everything but the church closed up on Sunday, that an agnostic arose, and in a ringing speech boldly accused the preachers of wanting a monopoly of the day. One of the Boston clergymen indignantly expressed his surprise that any man in the nineteenth century should dare to publicly make such an accusation. But before he sat down even, he gave his case entirely away by saying, "I maintain that the church can not compete with the theaters and the museums, and the places of public resort." The reverend gentleman was reminded that the church once did compete with the circus and the theater, and with all the sports of the pagan world, and that she triumphed over them, and went forth as on a white horse conquering and to conquer.

If the church lacks that power to-day, instead of seeking a monopoly from the state, she should seek more power from God.

The great cry to-day is that the masses do not want to attend church. If the masses do not want to attend church now, will they want to do so more when the church has cut off every avenue of escape, and they plainly see that she is trying to force them to attend? Every one who knows human nature at all, or who even understands his own heart, must answer, NO. Now, these men who do not want to attend church can go to the seashore, and to the country, and, if they will not of their own free wills attend the church, there is no better place for them on earth than the seashore and the country. God, through Nature, often speaks to men who will not listen to the preaching of his word by the human voice.

Out upon the mountains, where the yawning canyons are beneath, and, above, the mighty rocks thrust up their thunder splintered pinnacles into the sky, how small man seems! But how near, and how great, and grand is God! Down by the seashore where the mighty waves come rolling in, and dash against the rocks, how the beating of the waves sometimes seems but the ceaseless pulsation of His mighty heart, and one can not but feel that it throbs in sympathy with human woe and human heart-ache and human need! Ah yes, many a man has first come to know God by seeing him revealed in nature, and the man who is shut up most of the time in a large city is peculiarly susceptible to the beauties of the woods and hills. But, take away the opportunity of the masses for going to the country or the seashore on Sunday, and what will the masses do on that day of leisure? They will not attend church, for they will not attend church now, and they will be more determined than ever not to attend church, when they see that the church is trying to coerce them.

**SUNDAY LAWS INCREASE DRUNKENNESS.**

What will they do? The question is not difficult to one who knows human nature as it is. On Saturday night, John will say to Henry, and Charles, and William, "Come to my house to-morrow, I will have a case of beer in the back kitchen, and we will have a quiet game of cards, and so I think we will be able to spend the day." Next week, William or Henry will return the compliment, and so on. No liquor will be sold, nothing can be done to prevent a man from taking a social glass with his friends in his own house. And so innumerable little drinking clubs will spring up, and thousands of young men who are too self-respecting to go to a saloon for their first glass, will thus acquire the appetite for drink. Instead of the voice of God in nature, they will have only the influence of the back kitchen, and the cards, and the drink.

Do you say this is only a speculative theory? The writer admits that years ago he first saw it as such. Reasoning from cause to effect, he was driven unavoidably to this conclusion; but since then, he has seen his conclusions verified. In that professedly pious city of Toronto, on Saturday afternoon, any one who will, may see the streets dotted with wine and beer wagons delivering drinkables to be used on the morrow. There are no street cars on Sunday. The multitudes can not get away from their hot tenements. They do not care to go to the church that has persistently refused them the cheap transportation they have so often asked for. So they must devise some way to spend the day.

If any one still doubts the truthfulness of this picture, here is a quotation to the point from Dr. Charles Roads, published in the New York Christian Advocate. This doubtless will be an authority to many, and it fully proves the point in question. "The Brooks High License law of Pennsylvania was rigorously applied in Philadelphia in its first year, 1889, by four judges sitting as the license court. They reduced the number of the saloons from fifty-five hundred to sixteen hundred, and inspired such terror concerning violations of the law in the sixteen hundred that in one particular—that of suppressing Sunday selling—there is practically complete success. These apparent gains, however, are offset by a steady and alarmingly accelerating increase in the consumption of beer and distilled liquors, which the internal revenue laws show to be far beyond the growth of the population; by the great extension of the bottling business, which by energetic peddling has introduced beer into tens of thousands of homes hitherto free from it, and where now, as we know by many inquiries, it is freely given to children; by young men's clubs, notoriously organized for drinking purposes, becoming very numerous and liberally furnished with all sorts of drinks on Saturday afternoon, which by the evasion of monthly dues are really Sunday saloons, thronged with men and boys all day."

Now, both by reason, and by actual appeal to facts, the dark prophecy, which at first may have startled the reader, has been abundantly proven. The writer hopes that all who read may take warning, and have nothing to do with any method of attempted reformation which will inevitably mean deformation, and destruction in the end.
