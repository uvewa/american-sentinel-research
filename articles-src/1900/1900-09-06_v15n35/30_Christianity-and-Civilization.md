Ho Yow, Chinese consul-general at San Francisco, said in a recent address delivered there that he feared the spread of Christianity in China, because his countrymen, being quick to learn, "will be able to manufacture guns and all the engines of warfare," and precipitate a terrible conflict. Ho Yow, like many people in this country, fails to distinguish between Christianity and civilization.
