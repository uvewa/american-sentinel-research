To preserve natural rights men must be restrained from all actions that would invade such rights; hence there must be laws against murder, theft, assault, etc. But this does not contradict the statement that the Creator designs men to be free to choose either good or evil. To restrain men from invading one another's rights does not and can not hinder them from opening their hearts to evil thoughts and desires; it can not hinder them from leading lives which the Creator condemns.
