## MR. WU'S PERTINENT QUESTION.

From the New York Tribune.

SENATOR EUGENE HALE, of Maine, told recently with amused chagrin of a passage at arms he had with Mr. Wu, the Chinese minister. The treatment of the missionaries in the far East was under discussion, and the senator had trotted out a number of instances of maltreatment, and even worse, that the missionaries had met with at the hands of their Eastern brethern. The senator then pointed out to the minister that this was hardly the way in which the missionary should be received, and that a liberty of faith should be accorded their subjects by Eastern rulers. All through this homily the Chinese minister had grinned sympathetically, but a trifle derisively.

"Liberty of religious thought, eh?" Wu inquired tentatively, when his chance came. "You not always give liberty of religious thought in this country; you sometimes persecute the missionary in these great United States, I think?" To this, needless to say, the junior senator from the Pine Tree State interposed a vigorous denial.

"No, you never do such things here, never! You never persecute the poor missionary! You are too high-minded. You have too much freedom of thought for that!" And here Wu's derisive smile grew diabolical. "How about that Levantine affair?"

"Levantine affair?" was the puzzled inquiry.

"Yes; Levantine affair; affair at Levant. What did you do there?"

And then the senator suddenly remembered the fate of a Mormon missionary at Levant, Me. The keen Celestial eye of the Chinese minister saw the look of understanding in Senator Hale's eye, and he drove the nail home.

"What did you do with that Mormon missionary at Levant, eh? You gave him what is called the tar and feathers; is it not so?" But the senator had no response at hand.
