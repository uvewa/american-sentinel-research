## CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS AND "REVERENCE FOR LAW."

There is in Providence, R. I., an organization known as "the Providence Union of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor."

"Some time since," says the Providence Journal, this "union took up the agitation for increased respect for the law," and "the enforcement of law as law." The literature used was "leaflets of the League for Social Service, of which Dr. Josiah Strong is president."

"A special service," says the Journal, "was arranged for July 1 by the citizenship committee of the Providence Union, which is composed of one representative from each church society, with Rev. E. Tallmadge Root, of Elmwood Temple, as chairman. There are 43 of these societies, and the total average attendance at their meetings is about 2,000."

"In many of the churches the meeting was addressed by an attorney. The theme in each was the divine authority of law; the prevailing neglect of law; that this neglect is the main cause of our moral problems; that a strong public sentiment demanding the enforcement of the letter of every statute would prove the solution of all these promllems; and that, therefore, the key to the whole battle for civic righteousness is insistence upon the rigid enforcement of law."

Letters were read in the various meetings from ex-Presidents Harrison and Cleveland.

Mr. Cleveland wrote as follows:

"PRINCETON, June 2d, 1900.

"Rev. E. Tallmadge Root.

"DEAR SIR: It is not a pleasing thing to be obliged to concede that at this period of our nation's history there should be truth and relevancy in the proposition: 'The Great Need of Our Country—Reverence for Law.'

"The difference between barbarity and civilization consists in the absence or existence of laws and their enforcement. American civilization requires that laws for the safety and protection of persons and property should be made and executed by those chosen for that purpose, by the people to be affected by such laws. This circumstance creates the demand of popular participation and consent, which increases enormously the obligation of support and obedience. These are included in 'Reverence for Law.' That this reverence is the great need of our country results from an inordinate national and individual strife to reach ends regardless of all restraint, and from the growth of the notion among our people that ends must be gained whether the means employed are justified or not.

"That this tendency is extremely dangerous to the well-being, if not the perpetuity of our nation, there can be no doubt; and when those in control of our Government can satisfy themselves in a certain course of action by saying if there is no constitutional or legal warrant for it, there ought to be, it is a short step to a feeling among the people that if the laws made for their control and guidance do not permit them to do everything they desire, such laws may be despised and disregarded.

"In view of impending dangers confessed by the statements of our country's need, no more lofty or important work can employ the efforts of Christian workers, than the earnest revival of 'Reverence for Law.'

"Yours very truly,

"GROVER CLEVELAND."

Writing under date of June 9, Mr. Harrison referred to a speech made by him at Knoxville, Tenn., April 14, 1891, in which he said:

"We live in a government of law. The compact of our organization is that a majority of our people, taking those methods which are prescribed by the Constitution and law, shall determine our public policies and choose our rulers. It is our solemn compact; it can not safely be broken. We may safely differ about policies; we may divide upon the question as to what shall be the law; but when the law is once enacted no community can safely divide on the question of implicit obedience to the law. It is the one rule of conduct for us all. I may not choose as President what laws I will enforce, and the citizen may not choose what laws he will obey. Upon this broad principle our institutions rest. If we save it, all the agitations and tumults of our campaigns, exciting though they may be, will be harmless to move our Government from its safe and abiding foundation. If we abandon it, all is gone. Therefore my appeal everywhere is to hold the law in veneration and reverence. We have no other king; public officers are your servants; but in the august and majestic presence of the law we all uncover and bow the knee."

This "special service" in forty-three Providence churches, simply illustrates the way in which the young people, not of a single city but of the whole country, are being trained. Instead of being instructed in the principles of justice which underlie all just statutes, they are taught the enforcement of "law as law;" greater "reverence for law;" and to "uncover and bow the knee" "in the majestic presence of the law," simply because it is law, or rather because it is statute.

Very much is statute that is not law. Law exists in the very nature of things. Just statutes simply declare the law of nature. "This law of nature," says Blackstone, "being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original."

If more were said to the young about the majesty of human rights, if they were taught that rights are God-given, that they exist in the very nature of things, that rights are everywhere equal, and to be respected as much in the humblest man as in the most exalted, there would be less need to insist upon the enforcement of "law as law."

And this is the instruction that all the people must have if popular government is to be maintained. It is just as impossible for a community to make itself law-abiding by statutes as it is for an individual to make himself moral by good resolutions. The individual will be moral only as he is genuinely attached to the principles of morality. In like manner and for exactly the same reason, a community will be law-abiding only as the individuals in that community are genuinely attached to the principles of justice. The passionate man may resolve ever so sincerely never to swear again, but unless his motive is real reverence for the name of God, his "good resolution" will be broken under the first provocation. Just so with a community; statutes will be respected only as the people are genuinely attached to the principles underlying them.

In the early history of our country, principles were emphasized. Much was said of the value of liberty and of the sacredness of human rights. As a consequence laws were founded upon justice, and human rights were respected. Now statutes are enacted with little reference to underlying principles, human rights are made light of, and as a consequence law is disregarded and rights are trampled into the dust.
