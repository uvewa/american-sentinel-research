## AN OLD DECEPTION.

It is not altogether strange that religious people in this age of the world should be seeking to fulfill the purposes of God by the use of worldly agencies, seeing it is true that so great and righteous a man as Abraham, the "father of the faithful," once committed this same mistake himself.

Abraham was a man who feared God, and was full of zeal for his cause; and God had chosen him from among men and told him that his seed was to be as the stars of heaven for number, and through him was to come the promised One in whom all families of the earth should be blessed. But Sarah, Abraham's wife, had no child, and as the years passed on and no heir appeared to point to the fulfillment of the cherished promise, the vision of the divine agency working out the high designs of God grew dim in their troubled minds, and it seemed that the realization of the promise devolved upon themselves. So Abraham and Sarah set to work to fulfill the prophecy by the best plan they could devise, and the result of their scheme was Ishmael, the son of the Egyptian bondwoman, Hagar. Then God appeared to Abraham and told him that the promise was to be fulfilled not through any human plan or power, but only in the power and wisdom of God, through faith; and then, through Abraham's faith in God, came in due time the child that was the true heir, Isaac.

The purposes of God, the prophecies of his Word, are to be realized through faith; never in any other way. The agencies in their fulfillment are spiritual agencies working with the children of faith; the power is the power of God. The earth is to be purified from wickedness, the saints of the Most High are to inherit it and exercise dominion over it, and it is to be filled with righteousness and peace. Such is the promise of the Almighty. But how are men, the professed followers of God, working for its fulfillment? The outlook shows us that they have gone to work to fulfill the prophecy themselves by earthly agencies, such as human wisdom always selects—legislation, the ballot, politics and even conquest. They are going to make the world good and usher in the golden age by vote, by grasping political power, and by the forcible extension on the earth of the blessings of American "Christian civilization." In this abortive scheme we see millions of zealous Christian people engaged to-day.

Friends, leaders in this great effort, it is all a mistake. It is the same old deception—the substitution of earthly agencies and human wisdom for the divine in the fulfillment of God's high purposes. It is not of faith; it is not based on the word of God or the example of Christ. It can only fail and bring disappointment, darkness and disaster.

Let the purposes of the Most High be consummated by the superior agencies at His command, in that way which will manifest to the universe the omniscience and omnipotence of its Sovereign, and let those who long for the realization of these purposes study and believe His Word, work in faith, and exercise "the patience of the saints." s.

If the world could be saved by legislation or conquest, the sacrifice of the cross would not have been necessary.
