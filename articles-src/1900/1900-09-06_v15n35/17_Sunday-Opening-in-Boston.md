The question of allowing Sunday opening of stores has become an issue between Jews and Christians in Boston, says the Boston Globe. The Jews, on the strength of permission they claim to have received from the city government, have their stores wide open on Sunday, and the "Christians" are complaining that this gives their Hebrew rivals an undue share of the profits of trade, notwithstanding the Hebrew stores are closed on Saturday. The police department has announced that it will enforce Sunday closing on Jews and Christians alike.

It appears from this that the "Christian" storekeepers concerned in this agitation are desirous of observing the day they believe to be the Sabbath, provided it does not involve a sacrifice on their part. But that is not Christianity at all; for there is no worship and service of God acceptable to him without sacrifice. He that regardeth the kingdom of God as dear at any price, will never get into it.
