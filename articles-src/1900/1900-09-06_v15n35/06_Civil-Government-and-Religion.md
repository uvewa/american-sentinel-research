To attempt by the agencies of civil government to make men live righteously before God is to take away from men that freedom of choice which he has given them and designs them to have as a condition necessary to the development of character. But to use the power of civil government to make men respect each other's rights is to preserve their freedom of choice. When civil government gets into the sphere of religion, therefore, it does just the opposite of that which it does in the secular sphere, and defeats the very purpose of its existence.
