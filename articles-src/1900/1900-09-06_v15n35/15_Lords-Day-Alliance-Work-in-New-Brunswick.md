# LORD'S DAY ALLIANCE WORK IN NEW BRUNSWICK.

The following, setting forth the activity of the Lord's Day Alliance in New Brunswick, appeared recently in the St. John Sun. The secular authorities of the province, it will be observed, are inclined to regard the Sunday laws as dead letters, experience having no doubt shown them, as it has the authorities in this country, that such laws are not related to the problem of preserving the rights of the people, and have no proper place in the modern systems of secular government. But the clergy, with more zeal than knowledge in such matters, and having more in view the interests of religion than the ends of just government, are pushing the secular officials forward to the enforcement of these obsolete statutes, and their efforts are producing a marked effect. The Sun says:

"A meeting of the executive committee of the St. John Lord's Day Alliance was held in the parlor of the Y. M. C. A. on Monday afternoon.

"The secretary reported that since the last meeting efforts had been made to ascertain why the Sunday law was still apparently a dead letter, seeing that it had been sustained by the supreme court of the province.

"It was found that the responsibility rested wholly with the city authorities, and upon laying the matter before the chairman of the safety board, the recorder and the chief of police, promise had been obtained that the act would be put in force next Sunday.

"The Rev. J. G. Shearer, field secretary of the Dominion L. D. Alliance, who is now in Nova Scotia, is expected to occupy pulpits in St. John on Sunday, September 9th, and to speak at a public convention which is to be held on the Monday evening following for the purpose of organizing a provincial alliance. The arrangements will be made public as soon as the use of the required buildings has been secured.

"Interviewed by the Sun last evening with reference to the action of the Lord's Day Alliance toward the more rigid enforcement of the Sunday law, Alderman Seaton, chairman of the safety board, stated that officially he had no jurisdiction in the matter, and that he had referred the committee from the alliance which had waited upon him to the recorder and the chief of police, in whose hands the matter now rests.

"A Sun reporter saw Recorder Skinner last night with reference to the matter. Mr. Skinner said the supreme court of New Brunswick sustained the law. Last spring Chief of Police Clark consulted him as to what course he should pursue, and he advised the chief that the law should be enforced. But then word came to the effect that an appeal had been carried to Ottawa. It was intimated about the same time that it would be well to await the decision of the supreme court of Canada. He told Chief Clark that if these appeals were bona fide it would be just as well to wait till the court gave their decision. He was then waited upon by representatives of the Lord's Day Alliance, who maintained that the chief was not doing his duty. He assured these gentlemen that the chief was not to blame, as he was always ready and willing to do all he could for the enforcement of all laws. The recorder advised this delegation to see the attorney-general. On Tuesday Revs. Dr. Wilson and T. F. Fotheringham waited upon him with a letter from Attorney-General Emmerson, which set forth that the local government was not doing anything to prevent the enforcement of the law. The letter stated that the matter of enforcing the law lay with the civic authorities in St. John. The recorder then advised the chief of police to see that the law is enforced. The Sun man was unable to get any further information from the recorder, except that the chief things complained of were the desecration of the Sabbath by the sale of soda water and cigars.

"Chief of Police Clark was not willing to talk to the Sun. He said he was always ready to do what he considered his duty. In this matter he acted upon the advice of the recorder, and as they were at present in consultation he had no statements to make for publication."

The same paper also mentions the formation of a local Lord's Day Alliance at Charlottetown, N. B., of which the clergy of the city were made vice-presidents. The field secretary of the general organization, Rev. J. G. Shearer, has been actively at work organizing branches of the alliance throughout Canada, and this activity will certainly not be without results.
