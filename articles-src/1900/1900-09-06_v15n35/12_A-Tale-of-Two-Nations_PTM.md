## A TALE OF TWO NATIONS.

### The Reign of Right.

The nation of Israel was set in the earth by the Almighty to represent RIGHT in things national and governmental. The United States was ordained of God to do a similar work. Nothing can be more clear than this, and in the Declaration of Independence it is writ.

The doctrine of Europe was summed up in the words, "The divine right of kings." One author has tritely said that this was "a divine right to govern wrong." In other words, the doctrine of the nations of medieval times was that "might makes right." If a nation possessed enough arbitrary power and physical force to accomplish a certain end, no matter how criminally aggressive, no matter how tyrannical or despotic that end might be, the power to do was always supposed to prove the rightfulness of the thing done. And back of this time, in the dawn of European history, in the days of the Roman Republic, that nation had held to the doctrine of "Vox Populi vox Dei"—"The voice of the people is the voice of God." In other words, the Roman doctrine was that if the majority of the people approved of a thing it must be right.

But the Declaration of Independence, with one simple yet sweeping statement, disowns, disclaims, and discards both the Roman and the medieval theories, and substitutes in their place a principle beyond comparison with them for its lofty and holy teachings.

In the last paragraph of that immortal document it is written that these United Colonies, as free and independent States, "have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of RIGHT do."

Wrapped in these words was a new doctrine. Here was the enunciation of a principle hitherto unheard of. Heretofore sovereignty had been considered as being unlimited and illimitable. But the Declaration of Independence brought to the birth a new principle, that RIGHT IS SUPERIOR TO ALL EARTHLY POWER, whether vested in prince or potentate, or in a republican form of government. With the founders of this Government it was not a question of what the nation was able to do, but contrarywise, what was right for the nation to do. I quote from the great Sumner:

"But the great Declaration, not content with announcing certain rights as unalienable, and therefore beyond the control of any government, still further restrains the sovereignty which it asserts by simply declaring that the United States have 'full power to do all acts and things which independent States may of right do.' Here is a well-defined limitation upon the popular sovereignty. The dogma of Tory lawyers and pamphleteers—put forward to sustain the claim of parliamentary omnipotence and vehemently espoused by Dr. Johnson in his 'Taxation no Tyranny'—was taught, that sovereignty is in its nature illimitable, precisely as it is now loosely professed by Mr. Douglass for his handful of squatters. But this doctrine is distinctly discarded in the Declaration, and it is frankly proclaimed that all sovereignty is subordinate to the rule of right. Mark, now, the difference: All existing governments at that time, even the local government of the colonies, stood on power without limitation. Here was a new Government, which, taking its place among the nations, announced that it stood only on right, and claimed no sovereignty inconsistent with right."

In 1837 John Quincy Adams, in a Fourth-of-July oration at Newburyport, said:

"The sovereign authority conferred upon the people of the colonies by the Declaration of Independence could not dispense them, nor any individual citizen of them from the fulfillment of their moral obligations. The people who assumed their equal and separate station among the powers of the earth by the laws of nature's God, by that very act acknowledged themselves bound to the observance of those laws, and could neither exercise nor confer any power inconsistent with them."

Still further alluding to the self-imposed restraints upon the sovereignty which had been established, he says:

"The Declaration acknowledged the rule of right paramount to the power of independent states itself, and virtually disclaimed all power to do, wrong. This was a novelty in the moral philosophy of nations, and it is the essential point of difference between the system of government announced in the Declaration of Independence and those systems which had until then prevailed among men. * * * It was an experiment upon the heart of man. All the legislators of the human race until that day had laid the foundations of all government among men in power; and hence it was that in the maxims of theory, as well as in the practice of nations, sovereignty was held to be unlimited and illimitable. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed another law, * * * a law of right, binding upon nations as well as individuals, upon sovereigns as well as upon subjects. * * * In assuming the attributes of sovereign power, the colonists appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of their intentions, and neither claimed nor conferred authority to do anything but for RIGHT."

In a speech delivered in the United States Senate January 6, 1899, Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, refers to Thackeray's comment upon the great picture in the rotunda of the Capitol. So beautifully and forcibly has he woven into his argument this incident, and another with it, that I take the liberty of giving it again in his own words, for they are far better than my own could be:

"Thackeray, no mean judge of noble art, no mean judge of noble actions, was one day crossing the rotunda of this Capitol in company with Charles Sumner. He stopped before the picture where the genuis of the great artist of Connecticut has delineated on the imperishable canvass the scene when the Declaration of Independence was presented by Jefferson to the solemn sitting over which Hancock presided, and the new nation, born on the 19th of April, 1775, was baptized in the faith of our new gospel of liberty. He stood for a moment silent, and then said to Mr. Sumner: 'That's your painter.'

"Surely he was right. The foremost action of human history is fitly represented by the great work which we fondly hope is to be as enduring as time, enduring as the Republic, enduring as liberty. It is there, in the foremost place of honor which can be found on this earth. No Parthenon, no Saint Peter's, no Palace of the Escurial, no Sans Souci, not Westminster Abbey itself, can equal, at least to our eyes, this spot, where forever a great and free people declares its constitutional will.

"Beneath the great dome, to which the pilgrim from afar first repairs when he visits the capital of his country, hangs the great picture which delineates the scene when the nation was first baptized into immortal life. It was not only the independence of America which was then declared, it was the dignity of human nature itself.

"When Samuel Rogers visited the Dominican convent at Padua an aged friar showed him the famous picture of 'The Last Supper' in the refectory of the convent. He said:

"I have sat at my meals before it for seven and forty years, and such are the changes that have taken place among us--so many have come and gone in that time--that when I look upon the company there, upon those who are sitting at that table, silent as they are, I am sometimes inclined to think that we, not they, are the shadows.'

"As administrations, terms of presidential office begin and end, as senators and representatives come and go before the silent figures in that immortal picture, it seems to me that we are but the shadows, while Hancock and Jefferson and Adams and Franklin and Ellsworth and Livingston are still deliberating, still acting, still alive."

In the Book of books it is written that, "the grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the Word of our God shall stand forever;" and in another place that that immortal Word "liveth and abideth forever." And it is even so with the great principles of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution of the United States. These principles are coeval with time, and they will be commensurate with eternity. The government of God in the beautiful world to come will be a government of love, a government founded upon the principle of the consent of the governed, for every soul in that blest home and kingdom and in all the infinite universe will desire naught else but that God and Jesus Christ shall rule. This will be the supreme and ever-living desire of every one. Heaven's government is indeed one deriving its powers, which are only just, from the consent of the governed. Every voice in the righteous nation blends in that glad chorus: "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing." Says John the revelator: "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever."
