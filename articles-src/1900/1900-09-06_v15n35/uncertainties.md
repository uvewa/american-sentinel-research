## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 3, "Christian Endeavorers and 'Reverence for Law'" article
- **Text transcribed as:** "promllems"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - this appears to be an OCR error
- **Reason:** Context clearly indicates this should be "problems" - the double 'll' is likely a misread of 'b'
- **Note:** Preserved as-is per OCR output, but this is almost certainly "problems" in the original

### Page 14-16 (Advertisements)
- **Decision:** Advertisements and subscription information were not transcribed as individual article files
- **Reason:** Following project guidelines that advertisements should be skipped

## Articles with No Uncertainties
All other articles were transcribed with clear, unambiguous text from the OCR output.
