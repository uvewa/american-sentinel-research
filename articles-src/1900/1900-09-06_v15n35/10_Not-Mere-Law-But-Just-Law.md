## NOT MERE LAW, BUT JUST LAW.

It is not law that the world needs to-day. There has always been law enough in the world. Despots never were without plenty of law for their subjects. The Pharisees of old fairly revelled in law; they had manufactured it almost without end. George III. supplied the colonies with plenty of law, such as it was. Our forefathers, indeed, decided they had more law than they wanted, and were willing to take up arms to get rid of some of it. The legislative harvest never fails to yield a surplus. Vastly more statutes are turned out each year than the country needs.

No great reform ever began in the world with the enactment of more law, or even with the enforcing of more rigid obedience to existing laws; while, on the contrary, reforms that have marked epochs in the world's history have led to the resisting of law, as witness the great Reformation, which sent hosts of martyrs to the stake and dungeon for disobeying the "law of the land." There would never have been an American Revolution or the United States of America if the colonies had felt bound to obey the will of King George simply because it was "the law."

No. What is needed to-day, and sadly needed, is more respect for right, for justice and for truth. It is only respect for the right that makes law effective anywhere outside of a military despotism. Lacking this, mere statutes are of no use. Reverence for justice is the foundation of stability in a republic. The deification of mere "law" leads only to despotism.
