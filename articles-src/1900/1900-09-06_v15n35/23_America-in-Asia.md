"It is only since 1894 that foreign ambassadors were allowed in the most sacred part of Peking," says the Daily News of this city. "That the allies have now seized this 'purple' city, and that American soldiers had the honor of planting the first foreign flag over the imperial palace, greeted by English, German, Russian and Japanese cheers, is a significant fact." This occurrence is indeed fraught with significance—a significance that should cause Washington and Monroe to turn in their graves. The fact that America is in Asia, cheered on by the great powers of the world, has in it a significance that can scarcely be realized now, but which will be realized more and more keenly as time goes on.
