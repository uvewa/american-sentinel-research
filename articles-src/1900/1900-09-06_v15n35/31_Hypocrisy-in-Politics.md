A FORCIBLE illustration is at present before the country of the affinity that seems to exist between politics and insincerity. One of the two leading parties is posing before the country as the champions of government by consent of the governed, declaring this to be the most important issue before the people. They have much to say about the injustice done to the Filipinos and others by foreign conquest. Yet in the South, where this party is in the ascendency, some of these same men and others who are adherents of this party are boldly denying the privilege of self-government to people already recognized as American citizens by the Constitution. It is not to such sources of hypocrisy that the country may look for deliverance from impending perils.
