Another Sunday-closing campaign in Chicago has been organized by the Butchers and Grocery Clerks' Association of this city: "A report was received from the Employer's Association," says the Daily News, "recommending that the clerks and employers work together in the effort to close all retail stores in Chicago Sundays. Statistics were introduced showing that the merchants who have kept open Sundays have, as a rule, lost by it." It is further stated that "work will be started among the laboring classes to secure an endorsement of Sunday closing."

The statement that "merchants who have kept open Sundays have, as a rule, lost by it" is worthy of note. If it is not profitable to keep one's store open on Sunday, surely there is no force in the oft-heard plea that Sunday trading is unfair to the conscientious shop-keeper who wants to observe Sunday as the Sabbath.
