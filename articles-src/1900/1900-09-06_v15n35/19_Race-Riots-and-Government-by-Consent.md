Is denial of the doctrine of government by consent of the governed, exemplified in the conquest of foreign territory, already reacting at home in these United States, in cheapening the estimation in which black men are held by Anglo-Saxons? Do the race riots in such cities as New York, and Akron, Ohio, signify anything of this kind? The supposition is not a far-fetched one. And a contempt for the colored race is not a profitable acquisition for America at this time. There is material on hand, if that feeling holds sway, for unlimited rioting North as well as South.
