THE American Bar Association held its twenty-third annual meeting at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., last week. In his opening address President Charles F. Manderson "spoke of the failure of the peace congress at the Hague. The promise of that conference, he said, had proved utterly futile. Within the present year France had increased her army 5,000 men, Germany 33,000, Austria-Hungary 10,000 and Great Britain 240,000." "War is in the air," said Mr. Manderson. "Africa and Asia are witnesses of bloody conflicts, and Europe, trembling with anxiety, fears that her domestic peace may be disturbed and Moloch reign."
