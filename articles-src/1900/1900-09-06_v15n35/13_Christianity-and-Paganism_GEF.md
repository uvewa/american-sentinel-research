## CHRISTIANITY AND PAGANISM.

"The conflict of Christianity with Judaism was a civil war; that with paganism, the invasion and conquest of a foreign territory. In the former case it was the declared design of the innovation to perfect the established constitution on its primary principles; to expand the yet undeveloped system, according to the original views of the divine Legislator: in the latter, it contemplated the total subversion of the existing order of things, a reconstruction of the whole moral and religious being of mankind." * * *

"With the foreign Jew the service of the synagogue was his religion; and the synagogue, without any violent change, was transformed into a Christian church. The same Almighty God to whom it was primarily dedicated, maintained his place; and the sole difference was that He was worshipped through the mediation of the crucified Jesus of Nazareth. With the pagan the whole of his religious observances fell under the unsparing proscription. Every one of the countless temples and shrines, and sacred groves, and hallowed fountains, were to be desecrated by the abhorrent feelings of those who looked back with shame and contempt upon their old idolatries. Every image, from the living works of Phidias or Praxiteles to the rude and shapeless Hermes or Terminus, was to become a meaningless mass of wood or stone.

### A Contest in Every Place.

"In every city, town, or even village, there was a contest to be maintained, not merely against the general system of polytheism, but against the local and tutelary deity of the place. Every public spectacle, every procession, every civil or military duty, was a religious ceremonial. * * *

The whole life of the heathen, whether of the philosopher who despised or the vulgar who were indifferent, to the essential part of the religion, was pervaded by the spirit of polytheism. It met him in every form, in every quarter, in every act and function of every day's business; not merely in the graver offices of state, in the civil and military acts of public men; in the senate, which commenced its deliberations with sacrifice; in the camp, the center of which was a consecrated temple. The pagan's domestic hearth was guarded by the Penates, or by the ancestral gods of his family or tribe; by land he traveled under the protection of one tutelar divinity, by sea of another; the birth, the bridal, the funeral, had each its presiding deity; the very commonest household utensils and implements were cast in mythological forms; he could scarcely drink without being reminded of making a libation to the gods; and the language itself was impregnated with constant allusions to the popular religion." (Milman's Hist. Christ., vol. 1, pp. 436-439.)

## National Worship an Homage to Demons.

Notwithstanding all the frauds of the pagan temples it is now well known that many of the pagan priests were Spiritualist mediums, possessing great thaumaturgical power. So Gibbon says: "The Christians, who, by the interposition of the evil spirits could so readily explain every preternatural appearance, were disposed and even desirous to admit the most extravagant fictions of the pagan mythology. But the belief of the Christian was accompanied with horror. The most trifling act of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the demon and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of God. * * * It was the first but arduous duty of every Christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled from the practice of idolatry."

## Idolatry All-Pervading.

"The religion of the nations was not merely a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in the temples. The innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven with every circumstance of business or pleasure, of public or private life, and it seemed impossible to escape the observance of them without, at the same time, renouncing the commerce of mankind, and all the offices and amusements of society. The important transactions of peace and war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which the magistrate, the senator and the soldier were obliged to preside or participate.

"The Christian, who with pious horror avoided the abomination of the circus and the theater, found himself encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial entertainment, as often as his friends invoking the hospitable deities poured out libations to each other's happiness.

"When the bride, struggling with well-affected reluctance, was forced in hymeneal pomp over the threshold of her new habitation, or when the sad procession of the dead slowly moved toward the funeral pile, the Christian, on these interesting occasions, was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him rather than contract the guilt inherent in those impious ceremonies. Every art and every trade that was in the least concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the stain of idolatry." "Even the arts of music and painting, of eloquence and poetry, flowed from the same impure origin." "Even the common language of Rome abounded with familiar but impious expressions, which the imprudent Christian might too carelessly utter or too patiently hear. * * *

## The Days of Solemn Festival.

"The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in ambush to surprise the unguarded believer assailed him with redoubled violence on the days of solemn festival. * * * Some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christian for such impious ceremonies by the scrupulous delicacy which they displayed on a much less alarming occasion. On days of general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown their heads with garlands of flowers. This innocent and elegant practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil institution. But it most unluckily happened that the doors were under the protection of the household gods; that the laurels were sacred to the lovers of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers, though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning, had been dedicated in their first origin to the services of superstition. The trembling Christian, who was persuaded in this instance to comply with the fashion of his country, and with the commands of the magistrate, labored under the most gloomy apprehension from the reproaches of his own conscience and the censures of the church. * * * Such was the anxious diligence which was required to guard the chastity of the gospel from the infectious breath of idolatry." (Gibbon's "Decline and Fall," chapter 15, par. 15, 16 and 17.)

Forcible as are these quotations they only partially show the conflict that Christianity had to fight with paganism in the early days.

**Philosophy and Superstition Alike Intolerant.**

Those who were educated among the pagans were thorough skeptics. They had come to disbelieve, not only in the wonders and myths in their own religion, but also in the supernatural in all religion. The cardinal doctrines of Christianity were to them utterly past believing for reasoning men. Agnosticism has to-day few, if any, arguments that were not familiar at that time; and all these, Christianity had to meet. To those ancient unbelievers religion was merely a state necessity to enable them to control, through their superstitions, the ignorant masses. To its outward observances, as such a necessity, they themselves solemnly and punctilliously submitted, and they determined that the Christian should do the same. Not being troubled by any conscience of their own on such points, they were utterly unable to comprehend the conscience of the Christian. His refusal to offer incense to the gods was to them sheer obstinacy, deserving of rigorous punishment by the laws lest it lead to rebellion in others. Thus the philosophical, who tolerated all other religions, persecuted the Christians. The effort of all Christ's followers to show that the gods of heathenism were no gods, if it was not impiety to them, "it was treason against the majesty of Rome."

On the other hand, the religion of Rome, appealing as all paganism did to the sensuous nature and baser passions of man, had a strong hold of the multitude. From infancy the masses had believed unquestioningly in its myths, and as a result they were very superstitious. To them the Christians were atheists, because they everywhere denied the gods of Rome, and also because they had no visible shrines or temples. Every famine or pestilence or defeat in battle was almost sure to give rise to the terrible mob-cry of paganism, "The Christians to the lions." It was natural that this should be, for the superstitious multitude could but think that in all these evils the gods were avenging themselves upon Rome for permitting the Christians to live. In those troublous times the emperors, even, were often driven from the throne by the soldiers and populace, and, since the rulers therefore held their position by the pleasure of the multitude, they dare not deny to the multitude the gratification of their superstitious rage. Thus the conscientious Christian brought down upon himself the persecuting wrath both of the superstitious and the philosophical.

**The Enmity of Tradesmen, Magicians, and Emperors.**

But this was not all. There were multitudes of tradesmen who earned their livelihood by building and decorating the almost innumerable temples and shrines and idols. Gibbon says these included by far the greater portion of the community who were employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanical professions. These were organized into trades-unions, and were swayed by self-interest as well as by superstition; like the makers of silver shrines for Diana, they were all actuated by uncompromising hatred for the Christians. Then, too, the jugglers and magicians felt their sham wonders outdone by the miracles of the apostles and of the early Christians, and so hated them accordingly. The very spirit of freedom and of liberty in early Christianity was uncompromisingly, though silently, opposed to imperialism. The Christian church, while taking no part in the politics of Rome, was a republic within the empire—a republic having its own laws, its own courts, and its own traditions of human rights. This republic needed only to expand far enough, and the empire of Rome was no more. These facts the philosophical emperors Marcus Aurelius and Decius Trajan clearly saw; and so, almost against their wills, they became persecutors of the Christians.

Even the unselfish love which bound the early Christians so closely together could not be understood by the pagans; so it was everywhere reported that the Christians were held in such close unity by the fear of punishment for the horrible crimes they had committed in secret.

**The Mighty Conflict of Christianity.**

Thus all classes were against the Christians—all classes, from the emperor on the throne to the lowest mountebank whose loud voice was heard in the street. The laws, too, and traditions of Rome were against them, and on the side of the multitude, making it easy for superstition and self-interest to drag the Christian before the tribunal and have him banished, burned or "butchered to make a Roman holiday." Who can not see that Christianity had a mighty conflict to fight in those days? And all know that she fought it grandly and victoriously in the power of the divine Christ, her Lord and Master, and without the aid of any earthly state. While the Roman state was "invaded by open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a pure and humble religion gently insinuated itself into the hearts of men, grew up in silence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and finally erected the triumphant banner of the cross on the ruins of the capitol." (Gibbon's "Decline and Fall," chap. 15, par. 1.)

## The Secret of the Wonderful Triumph.

The secret of this wonderful triumph is in part beautifully given by Draper. With its innumerable temples and shrines on which the wealth of succeeding ages had been lavished, with all its pride and philosophy and superstition, "paganism presented inherent weakness, infidelity and cheerless prospects." As in all religion save that of the blessed Master, it was cold and formal, leaving the heart hungry, "giving itself no concern for the lowly and unfortunate." "On the other side was Christianity, with its enthusiasm and burning faith; its rewards in this life and everlasting happiness in the next; its proselyting spirit; its vivid dogmas of the resurrection from the dead, the approaching end of the world, and the judgment day." "To the needy Christian the charities of the faithful were freely given; to the desolate, sympathy. In every congregation there were prayers to God that he would listen to the sighing of the prisoner and captive, and have mercy on those who were ready to die. For the slave and his master there was one law and one hope, one baptism, one Saviour, one Judge. In times of domestic bereavement the Christian slave doubtless often consoled his pagan mistress with the suggestion that our present separations are only for a little while, and revealed to her willing ear that there is another world, a land in which we rejoin our dead. How is it possible to arrest the spread of a faith which can make the broken heart leap with joy?" (Draper's "Intellectual Development," vol. 1, pp. 268, 269.)

Genuine Christianity has to-day the same truths, the same enthusiasm, the same burning faith, and deathless hope, and limitless love. Better than all else, it has the same Almighty God back of it, and the same divine Christ who has promised to be with his children always, "even unto the end of the world." The forces which are arrayed against true Christianity to-day are only the same they have ever been, manifesting themselves perhaps under different forms; they are the forces of the world, the flesh, and the devil. Christianity is therefore able to fight its own battles without the help of any state. It should seek the power of God, and that alone, and, doing this, it is sure to triumph.
