## THE DRAGON SPIRIT OF "CHRISTIAN" CIVILIZATION.

In more ways than one does the Chinese situation serve to reveal the fact that the world was never before so far from universal peace and so close to universal war. The outlook for peace and civilization is certainly dark enough when a ruler of one of the great "Christian" nations of the world speaks as did the emperor of Germany at the embarkation of his soldiers for China. But the outlook is infinitely worse when those who profess to be followers of the Prince of Peace, and to hold commissions from him who said, "Blessed are the peacemakers," are possessed by such feelings as are revealed by the following language which we take from a first page editorial in the Michigan Christian Advocate of August 25:

"View him as you may, the yellow man of the East appears to be inviting his own fate. * * * The world cannot afford longer to tolerate the existence of a people who make themselves a terror and a nuisance. China must open up or be opened up, and she is now taking the steps which are leading to the opening up process. * * * It is said that the Chinese nation is rich. She will need to be rich when she comes to settle the present war bills with the other powers. And she will have to be yielding, too. If the United States has a leading hand, as now seems likely, in laying down the conditions of peace, she will have to make guarantees of the future rights and safety of foreigners that no amount of prejudice or treachery can imperil. She is rapidly having this truth rubbed through her thick skull, too. Recent diplomacy, though largely hidden from the public eye, is bringing her to her senses. The knock of the allied armies at the gate of her capitol, having passed her strongholds of defense, is alarming her. If these movements meant only the payment of heavy indemnities and the execution of a few political culprits, she would not mind those so much, but subjection to foreign dictation and the overthrow of sacred traditions will cut her to the quick. And these are the things now coming. The nations are aroused. Their armies and fleets are up to the yellow men, although they be 500 million strong. Before these representative military and naval forces retire, the vast empire of the East will have been brought to terms in a manner to stay. The struggle has already been practically decided. * * * The Chinese must submit."

"The representative forces of Christian civilization are still able to demonstrate their superiority over the sluggish, stunted and fanatical hordes of paganism."

In the same issue of the Advocate is this editorial note: "Great news from Peking! 'Our God is marching on.'" From all of which the conclusion is inevitable that the Advocate thoroughly agrees with Napoleon that God is on the side of the heaviest battalions, according to the belief of all the men and nations throughout history who have forgotten God in their desire for revenge and their glorification of the might and power of earthly conquest.

"If the salt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted?" If those who are supposed to stand for peace and good will to men, and who claim to be looking for the millennium, are foremost in advocating vengeance, how can the world have anything else but war? J. D. B.
