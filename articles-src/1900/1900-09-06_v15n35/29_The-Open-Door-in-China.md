SENATOR DAVIS, in a speech made a few days ago in Chicago, said this country would insist that the "open door" in China shall remain open "under any and all conditions of sovereignty, cession or foreign ascendency." This nation will have to plant its foot firmly in the Chinese doorway if that is done.
