"The notion that the union of religion and politics can be only evil is as morally insane as the notion that only evil can come from the union of God and man. It is not the union of religion and politics that brings tyranny, but the false unity of unspiritual religion and immoral politics."

So says Prof. George D. Herron in a recent article on "Religion and Politics." A little reflection on the professor's second proposition is sufficient to demonstrate the entire lack of anything upon which to base the first. The alliance of a purely spiritual religion with politics is not possible. A spiritual church or religion, the weapons of whose warfare are not carnal, needs and seeks no support from the state; a just civil government need not and will not invade the realm of spiritual things in securing and perpetuating human rights. On the other hand political corruption in the state and spiritual decline in the church is a condition that has always been favorable to "the union of religion and politics;" and these things have never yet in a single instance failed to attend and follow such union. "In some instances" such union has "been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of civil authority; in many instances" it has "been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance" has it "been seen the guardian of the liberties of the people" or a preserver or promoter of the spirituality of religion. Surely the professor knows this to be the unbroken testimony of the past. Why does he expect entirely different fruits in the future? When the professor is able to point to a single instance where a "union of religion and politics" has not corrupted the civil administration and robbed the church of its spiritual power, there will be a force in his first proposition that is manifestly lacking at present.
