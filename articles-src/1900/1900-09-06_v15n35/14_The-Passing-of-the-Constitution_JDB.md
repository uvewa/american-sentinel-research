## THE PASSING OF THE CONSTITUTION.

(Concluded.)

Government limited only by "the law of freedom instinct in its own being" has had already more than its day in the world, for it was carried on almost without interruption from Nimrod to the rise of the American Republic. Then was declared and instituted "a new order of things"—Novus Ordo Seclorum. But the old order of things is now rapidly becoming the new order of things. It is marvelous that in the last year of the nineteenth century, and in the American Republic at that, there should be any one so blind to all the lessons of history as to be advocating the administration of government subject only to "the law of freedom instinct in its own being." True, this limitation was sufficient for the governments of Charles V., Louis XIV., and Napoleon, and it may answer the purposes of the Czar and other autocrats whose "free hand" will admit of no restraint upon their authority and no constitutional protection for their subjects. But for a free people who expect to secure to themselves and their posterity the inestimable blessings of civil and religious liberty, this proposed guarantee is more than inadequate; it is insulting. They will either refuse to subscribe to this doctrine for a single day, or their liberties will perish. Let the doctrine which the Tribune advocates once become prevalent and paramount—and it now seems to be the paramount idea with most of the men who control the government and the great newspapers of the country—and the way is open for the repetition in this country of all the tyrannies and oppressions with which arbitrary and unlimited power has cursed the earth.

## The Constitution the Safeguard.

So "Congress has full legislative power, 'subject only to the fundamental safeguards of liberty, justice and personal rights?'" And yet Congress is not subject to the Constitution, for that would be "to emasculate American sovereignty by constitutional limitations." This is language which the American. people can not understand. The only fundamental safeguards of liberty, justice and personal rights that they know anything about in connection with their Government and which they have appointed for the guidance of their representatives are the provisions of the CONSTITUTION. They ordained that in order to "establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare," and to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity. The Constitution is not the fountain of liberty, nor is it the foundation of justice and personal rights, but it is the instrument by which the American Government secures those things to the people, and when that is overridden and set aside, so far as the Government is concerned, there are no "fundamental safeguards of liberty, justice and personal rights." The only sovereignty and the only fundamental safeguard of liberty, justice and personal rights pertaining to the Government and about which it can know anything is that of the Constitution. And so far as governmental affairs and purposes are concerned, the people have no sovereignty but that expressly declared in the Constitution, for the sovereignty of the people is not effective in the governmental sense until it is expressed through their supreme law.

## A Dangerous Sort of Humanity.

Certainly a humane procedure should not be opposed. It would seem that government "by the people for the good of mankind" and "the federation of the world" should without question be given the right of way. But the world will be better off without that humanity and that government "by the people for the good of mankind" which requires the sacrifice of the Constitution and which is afraid to repeat word for word the language of freedom either as found in the Declaration or in the language which has been held by its supporters throughout the history of this country. "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," in accordance with the Declaration and the Constitution is still a good thing, and if the "federation of the world" cannot be brought about on that principle, let the federation be postponed.

One of the most striking characteristics of this movement which the Tribune is forwarding, and one which is quite prominent in the quotations given last week, is the use of terms which sound as nearly as possible like the genuine utterances of freedom in the Declaration and elsewhere, but which say and mean something entirely different. And this is a characteristic that is deep with meaning.

## More than a Political Issue.

As was said at the beginning of this article, this grave question which should now hold the attention of every friend of liberty, will not be settled by the coming elections—at least not more than it is already settled. To see this paramount issue as it is, is to see that it is a great deal more than a ground of dispute between political parties. It is more than a political issue. Political parties have been forced to take up its discussion almost in spite of themselves; and this has come that all may have the best possible opportunity to see just what it is and to learn just what it means. It is an issue between principles as different and distinct as midnight and noonday. It is a battle between liberty and despotism; a battle which can best be fought not at the polls, but in the minds and hearts of individuals, where alone is certain victory.

There is a way by which this issue may not be seen as it is, and by which all that it means may be missed. That is to make of it merely a matter of politics. There are two ways by which this can be done. One is to do as a politician can not fail to do—make of it simply political capital and an opportunity for political and partisan advantage. The other way is to declare it to be nothing but a matter of politics, and therefore nothing in which you are concerned and with which you will have nothing to do. The man who follows either of these courses is blind to an event which marks one of the greatest backward steps in the world's history.

He who sees this as it is and realizes even in a slight degree the terrible consequences with which it is fraught, will not make of it to himself a mere matter of politics, either by using it for political capital and treating it as a matter to be cured by the ballot, or by declaring it to be something with which he will have nothing to do because of its political nature. "He who in the light of Christianity has learned reverence for human liberty and rights, who has learned because of the essential equality of all men before the common Father, to respect his race and to reprobate its oppressors," will use every means that his conscience can approve in upholding the Protestant and Republican principles of the Constitution, and in staying the progress of the principles of ecclesiastical and political despotism which are to-day more than threatening the institutions which freedom has reared.
