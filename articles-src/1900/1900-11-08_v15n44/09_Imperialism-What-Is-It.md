Now that the campaign is over (as it will be before this comes under the eye of the reader), it may be well to stop and candidly consider the meaning of the term "imperialism," so very familiar, and yet, it is to be feared, but little understood.

Imperialism is the opposite of republicanism, and republicanism, as defined by Abraham Lincoln, is "government of the people, by the people, for the people." And this is exactly what the American Government was designed to be and what it still professes to be. That it has always been exactly this, or that it now is exactly this, probably nobody will assert. Indeed, this is the ideal conception of government, and the ideal is difficult, if not impossible, of attainment in things human.

But the fact that things human are of necessity imperfect is no reason why men should not strive after the ideal in government. Touching the purpose of the fathers of the Republic in giving to their countrymen and to the world the Declaration of Independence, Mr. Lincoln said:

"They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to all and be revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere."

This and this alone is genuine republicanism. Adopt any other idea, lose sight of this ideal and settle down content with something else, admit, for example, that there are some people who have not the inherent right of self-government and who must be governed despotically by others, and the high "maxim" has been abandoned, the principle violated and genuine republicanism relegated to the realm of the impracticable.

But in truth there are but two ways in which people can be governed: they must be governed either by themselves or by others. The first is self-government—republicanism; the second, government by others—imperialism.

To depart from the principles of republicanism and adopt the principles of imperialism it is not necessary that a people shall conquer and make subject to themselves other peoples. The principle of self-government may be repudiated just as fully in domestic affairs as in the arbitrary government of distant provinces.

Prior to the great civil war of 1861 to 1865, Abraham Lincoln showed very clearly that the principles of the Déclaration of Independence were violated by this nation in the maintenance of human slavery. With that incisive logic of which he was master, and with a grand eloquence due not so much to rhetoric as to truth, Mr. Lincoln, standing upon the Declaration of Independence, plead with telling effect the cause of the oppressed and down-trodden. The world knows the result.

And now again this same question of the right and nature of self-government is before the American people. Ere this paper falls from the press the people may have voted to sustain the policy of imperialism as applied to the islands recently acquired from Spain; or it may be that they will have repudiated the imperialistic policy as applied to those islands. But in neither case will the duty of those who would be true to their fellowmen and to themselves be done.

In the contest to be decided before this paper is off the press, one party has in effect declared in favor of imperialism, and the other against it. But who does not know that so far as the real principle is concerned, honors are practically even as between these parties? The very machinery of the parties themselves, with "boss rule," which so completely dominates not simply the party caucuses and conventions, but through these the whole governmental machinery from the smallest municipality to the Federal Government, is thoroughly imperialistic. Who believes that Tammany really represents Greater New York or that the corrupt Republican machine in Philadelphia is representative of the people of the Quaker city?—Nobody!

Again, the very party which in this campaign poses as the champion of self-government denies in several States the identical principles advocated in its national platform. The open, wholesale disfranchisement of the negroes of several of the Southern States is as certainly a violation of the principles of the Declaration of Independence as is anything that the Government has done or can do in the Philippines. Thus, as touching the real principle, there is little to hope for from either of the great parties, nor indeed from any party.

If the rights of the people are to be preserved, it must be by the people themselves. And it is a sad fact that as a people we are rapidly losing the faculty of self-government. Self-government is only another name for self-control, and when the people fail to exercise self-control, when a whole community, or even a large proportion of a community, so far loses this faculty that they must be governed by force, there remains for that people only imperialism. Hence this is not a political question but a question of vital principle which touches, even if it does not shape, the character of every man.

THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY is not only non-partizan, but it is non-political. We deal not with party questions or platforms, but with great underlying principles of justice. We seek not to mold national but individual life. It makes but little difference what party platforms are; they are made for campaign purposes and are not generally taken very seriously after they have served their purpose, but it makes a great deal of difference what the people are. We want the people—each individual for himself—to be loyal in his own heart and in his own life to the principle of right and justice, which is the principle of self-government, of self-control, not license for self and arbitrary control for the other man. This is where we believe God wants every man to stand, and it is where no party does consistently stand.
