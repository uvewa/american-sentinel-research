THE liquor dealers' organization in Lexington, Ky., is lending its influence in favor of Sunday closing of the saloons, so as to render these disreputable institutions "law-abiding." The saloon, however, being a natural breeder of crime, is a natural outlaw, and its character is not changed in the least by its observance of Sunday.

This attitude of the liquor organization is pleasing to some of Lexington's clergy, one of whom, in commending Sunday closing, said that "the continual strain on nerve and brain is too severe without such refreshing, invigorating, and elevating influences as come from one day out of every seven devoted to moral, intellectual, and physical repairs." This is a poor argument for Sunday closing as applied to the saloon. If the strain of keeping open and doing business seven days in the week would become so severe as to wreck the institution entirely, by all means let the saloon be kept open the week through. We are not anxious for the liquor business to experience a periodical recuperation by the observance of Sabbath rest.
