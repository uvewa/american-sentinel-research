From the Lutheran Witness.

The bold statement has lately been made that the Romish Church fostered the circulation and study of the Bible in the vernacular even before the Reformation, and that she has not opposed the spreading of the Scriptures. In searching for historical truth in this matter it is necessary to bear in mind that the Romish Church has not always been and is not always in harmony with herself. Her history is notoriously of such composition as to admit of being adduced either in the affirmative or in the negative of many questions. All that is needed is to know what is to be proved or disproved, and the "painstaking" Romish historian will find the history to fit the case. Besides, Rome is very shrewd in accommodating herself to surroundings, and is never worse, from an evangelical viewpoint, than the times and other circumstances will permit. To judge of her position on any point it is necessary to know her express doctrine in connection with her practice when she felt free to carry out her will.

## The Testimony of History.

The testimony of trustworthy history proves that Rome regards the Bible as a dangerous book for Christians, especially when read by laymen in their own language. The rule is that laymen are not permitted to read the Scriptures. In exceptional cases laymen may have the Word in a Romish translation if the respective bishops will give written permission; but the bishop must give this permission only when the father confessor certifies that the respective applicant is sufficiently grounded in papistical doctrine. Whoever, without such permission, is found in possession of a Bible in the vernacular lays himself open to the suspicion of heresy, commits a great sin, and can not recieve absolution until he has surrendered the book. The book dealer who sells a Bible to a Romish layman who has not the permission to read the same, is taken under discipline. This, we find, is the attitude in which history, past and present, finds Rome against the general reading of the Bible.

## The Bible Placed on the "Index."

In proof, a few references. The great Pope, Gregory VII., wrote in 1080 that God was pleased to have the Word remain unknown in some localities in order to save the people from error. The Council of Toulouse, in 1229, prohibited laymen from possessing the two Testaments, and even from reading the Psalter in the vernacular. Similar action was taken by the Council of Tarracona, 1234. In 1564 Pope Pius IV. approved the following decree of the Council of Trent: "Whereas experience has taught us that the reading of the Bible in the vernacular has done more harm than good, be it resolved that the permission of the bishop or of the inquisition must be procured by the priest for such person as desires to read the Scriptures in the vernacular and is known to be sound in faith and in piety. This permission shall be given in writing. On the other hand, if any one desires to possess and to read the Bible without such permission; he shall not receive absolution from sins until he has placed the Bible in the hands of the officer sent by the bishop." Sixtus V. (1585–1590) amended this rule by ordering that even a bishop is not allowed to grant such permission to a layman, while Urban VIII. decreed in 1631 that not even a bishop himself is allowed to read a vernacular Bible without permission from the Pope. It is said that in the "Jesuits' Confession," called the "Hungarian Formulary of Damnations," is contained the blasphemous expression, "We confess that the reading of the Holy Scriptures is the origin of all heresies and sects and a source of blasphemy." In the beginning of the nineteenth century Dr. Leander Van Ness, a Romish professor of theology in the University of Marburg, finished a translation of the Bible which was at first received with approbation by the Romish authorities; but when it began to be distributed too generally among the people it was placed on the "Index" or list of books with which faithful Romanists must have nothing to do.

## The Gospels Suppressed in France.

In 1886, Henri Lasserre, a faithful Romanist, published a translation of the Gospels into French. He was known before that time as the author of a successful book on Lourdes and the miracles wrought there, of which he claimed to have proof in his own person. Turning to the study of Holy Writ, he derived so much benefit from the reading of the Book of books, that he determined to share this blessing with his fellow-believers, of whom hundreds, he said, who partook of the sacraments, had never opened a Bible. His translation, fairly correct and dedicated to "Our dear Lady of Lourdes," was received with the greatest approval by the highest Romish authorities, when, all of a sudden, on December 19, 1887, a decree of the "Congregation of the Index" appeared by which the book was unreservedly condemned, its publication forbidden, and those in possession of copies ordered to surrender them to the ecclesiastical authorities. To-day the book belongs to the rarities.

## Must Read in a Corrupted Text.

In order to stereotype and perpetuate error the Council of Trent placed the Apocryphal books—uninspired human products—on equal rank with the books of God's Spirit-inspired revelation. Besides, that council decreed that "our Holy Mother, the church, possesses the sole right to define the true meaning and sense of the Holy Scriptures," and that the "holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church is the mother and mistress (regent and teacher) of all churches." To this, Cardinal Bellarmin, who lived in the seventeenth century and is the great exponent of popery as constituted under the Jesuitic system, adds: "Inerrancy is not found with a council of bishops; it is found only with the Pope." The Jesuits' Confession teaches: "All and everything taught, ordained, and instituted by the Pope, whether it is contained in the Scriptures or not, and whatever he commands must be accepted as saving and divine truth, and must, therefore, be held in higher esteem by the laity then even the commandments of the living God." And, lastly, when for good reasons it becomes necessary to allow the laity to have a Bible in the vernacular, the translation must be one "approved by the church," and must be read "with submission to the interpretation and authority of the church." This means that the Word must be read in the text—corrupted as every one may know—that the Romish Church furnishes, and must be understood in the sense in which that church understands the Word. Thus the machinery for perpetuating error and superstition is perfect and efficient in either case, with or without the laity's having access to a Bible; and how cruelly in earnest the Romanists have been about quenching the light that would stream from an open Bible is evidenced by the dying groans of tens of thousands of martyrs, whose damning crime was loving and believing their Bible too well.

## "Rome Never Changes."

But has not, perhaps, Rome changed? Rome! Changed! The Reverend Burry, writing in the *Lutheran Standard*, quotes from a Romish catechism written by a Romish bishop and used in the diocese of Columbus, O. It teaches that the laity may read the Scripture in the original Hebrew and Greek, or in the Latin Vulgate translation, or in an approved modern version; but always with due submission to the interpretation and authority of the church. This hatred for the Word manifests itself to-day in the priest-ruled republics of our hemisphere in persecution of those who would introduce the open Bible. Pope Leo XIII., the present "liberal" pontiff, is not one whit behind his predecessors in fulminating against Protestant Bible societies and against the spreading of the Bible as "a pestilence, the ruin of faith, the great danger for souls." True, the Romanist will lay much stress on the fact that it is "Protestant" translations and "Protestant" societies for the spreading of the Bible which the popes condemn. But history proves that even a version from a Romish source, issued by episcopal authority, may find a place on the index of prohibited books. Besides, if it is fear for the supposed errors in Protestant versions that has called forth the denunciation of Bible societies, why has the Romish Church never used a vanishing moiety of its all but limitless resources to spread its versions broadcast among its people? Where are the Romish Bible societies and where does the Romish clergy, except where forced to it by conditions over which they have no control, where does this clergy encourage the people to search the Scriptures in order that they may prove all things?

## Dr. De Costa Answered.

Dr. De Costa, in his tirade against Protestants for maintaining that the Romish Church opposed the spreading and popular reading of the Bible, makes much of the fact that there were in Germany, for example, versions of the Bible before Luther's translation. It has never occurred to any one to deny this historical fact. Between the years 1466 and 1522 there were printed in Germany as many as seventeen translations of the Bible into the vernacular. But the circulation was very limited for various reasons, prominent among which were the facts that the work of translation was so bunglingly done as to make the text well nigh unintelligible; and that the versions, made from the Vulgate, were replete with errors. Not until he was twenty years old, in 1507, did Luther, born of faithful church members, a diligent student and investigator, see a complete copy of the Bible. When, in 1522, he published his translation of the New Testament, the first edition of 3,000 was sold, at a comparatively high price, in the first three months. Afterwards edition after edition of the whole Bible was issued, and one hundred thousand copies, or more, were sold in forty years. Do these facts seem to bear out De Costa's statements about an "unchained" Bible, and that in "1507 small and cheap pocket editions were in circulation"? That Luther's translation was largely plagiarized from prior versions is one of those flings in the face of history and fact of which no one but a Romanist—preferably a newly converted one—could make himself guilty, and is altogether in line with the statement that in the "King James Version the Word of God was deliberately mutilated."

The translations of the Bible into the vernacular in the Middle Ages prior to the Reformation, were due largely, if not exclusively, to the dawning knowledge of the corruption and errors of the Papacy. Time and again men arose who saw more or less clearly the anti-Christian character of the Pope and his doctrine, and they sought for weapons in the Scriptures, as far as these were accessible. True, these translations fell far short of what they should have been, but they were far better than nothing and their effects were such as to rouse the murderous fury of the Romanists, who sought to root out these versions with fire and sword, and to offset them with translations from papistic sources. Since the Reformation the Romish Church has been largely on the defensive, and has been obliged to do, especially here in our country, what she would never think of doing in her day of uncontested supremacy. Whatever measure of encouragement and freedom for the study of the Bible is given to Romanists here or elsewhere, is due largely to the spirit of the Reformation and the power with which God crowned this His work. Even for the followers of the Pope the Bible has been loosed from chains by the hand of God working through Martin Luther.
