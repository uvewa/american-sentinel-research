This article which we reprint verbatim, including the heading, from the Catholic Standard and Times of Philadelphia, shows most conclusively that the question of Catholic Indian Schools is not settled. Depend upon it, we shall very soon hear more upon this subject. The Standard's article is as follows:

"Non-Sectarianism Spells Protestantism.

"Recently we showed by the terms of official reports from the Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C., that in Alaska grants of money and live stock are being systematically paid to Protestant missions in Alaska through the Rev. Sheldon Jackson. Alaska stands in relation to the United States in much the same position as the Indian Territories. Recently it was stated, publicly and emphatically, that the Government had once for all made up its mind that no more money would be paid to contract schools of any denomination, and it has rigidly carried out its stern decree in regard to the unhappy Catholic Indians.

"As for those who are not Catholics, so far as their material interests are concerned, they are in no way affected by the decision. Practically the change of policy means the coercion of the Indians to accept the Protestant religion or starve. The methods by which this insidious scheme is being worked are graphically described in a number of letters now given to the world in the November issue of the Messenger of the Sacred Heart. One of them tells how in a certain agency nineteen public schools have been erected under cover of being non-sectarian. All these are simply Protestant schools, and open and undisguised Protestant teaching is given in some. This is exemplified in the fact that Bibles are being given in them by Protestant clergymen and the children are being compulsorily baptized in the Protestant faith, even against their protests.

"These flagrant violations both of the Constitution and the Government's stern declarations against the sectarian principle are being perpetrated under circumstances which make the proselytism a thousand-fold more intolerable and galling. In the fact that it is the Indians' own money that is being utilized to paganize or Protestantize them is found the very cynicism of arbitrary wrong. The Indians in some of those places have petitioned that their children be sent to Catholic schools and the expense be deducted from the allowance made to them, under covenant, in lieu of the lands they handed over to the Government. But these petitions the rigidly impartial State Department has stoically refused. The Indians must not do as they please with their own money, but must have it bestowed as martinets in Washington and in Congress wish.

"Meanwhile the pall of starvation hangs over the Catholic schools. Nothing more pitiable than the present condition of the schools thus left derelict ever appealed to the hearts of the just and merciful. The teaching staffs in many cases are in a state of absolute famine, and the few poor Indian charges whom they have left suffer the pangs of hunger as well. The children pine under 'half rations,' while the religious who teach them half starve themselves in order to spare their slender store for their more tender charges. Think of it!"

Forty days and nights in the wilderness with naught but spiritual sustenance to uphold the brave hearts who thus devote their lives to the service of those miserable 'wards of the nation'—the most pitiless guardian that was ever set over brother as his keeper.

"We can add nothing to the pathos of this story. It must go straight home to every noble heart, Catholic or Protestant, and waken the generous impulses of the better part of the people. But for Catholics it can have but one message. It must rouse them to instant effort for the relief of the stricken Catholic Indians and their teachers."
