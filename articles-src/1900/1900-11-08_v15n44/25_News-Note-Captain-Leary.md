CAPTAIN LEARY, until quite recently governor-general of Guam, one of the islands acquired from Spain during the late war, is reported as saying in an interview that "if he had his way he would hang every American citizen who presumed to publicly express dissent from the present foreign policy of the Government, as it is being worked out in our dependencies." It may well be doubted whether the captain made the statement quite as strong as is reported, but the sentiment attributed to him is in perfect keeping with the spirit of imperialism.
