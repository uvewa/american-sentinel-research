The Defender, the organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League," notes in its November number that "the Synod of New York, which embraces all New England, took a decided position at its annual meeting with reference to Sunday closing at the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. The clergymen and laymen making up that influential body," says the Defender, "were unanimous in their expression of opinion and their vote against Sunday opening." The Defender adds that "a committee of prominent business men of Buffalo was appointed by the Synod to further the movement for Sunday closing." "It will be a national disgrace," asserts the Defender, "if this great exposition, which will receive help from the United States Government, shall disregard the fundamental principles and practices of our national life." We would be pleased to be informed how long since Sunday observance became one of the "fundamental principles of our national life."
