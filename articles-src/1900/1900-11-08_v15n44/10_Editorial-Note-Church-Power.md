WHEN the church forsakes the power of the gospel for the power of the state, she forsakes the blessed ministrations of the olive, the fig tree, and the vine for the thorns of the unfruitful bramble. She has no longer for men the fat fruit of the olive, the sweet and good fruit of the fig tree, and the cheering wine of the vine. She has only the lacerations, and bruises, and tyranny of the bramble, and instead of preserving men's lives, devours them. She deprives men of the substance of good things and leaves them no support but her own shadow.
