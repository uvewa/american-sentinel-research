THE Bible will not be read in the public schools of Chicago. This decision was reached recently by the school board by a vote of thirteen to six. The vote was upon a book of selections made by a committee of which Professor Swing and Cardinal Gibbons were members. The book is in use in the schools of a number of American cities.
