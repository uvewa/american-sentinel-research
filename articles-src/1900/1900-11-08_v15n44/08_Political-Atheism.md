It has been often charged against the framers of the national Constitution that they were political atheists, because they made the consent of the governed rather than the law of God the foundation of civil government. Those who make this charge belong to the class of individuals who put darkness for light and light for darkness. It states just the reverse of the truth.

Our forefathers who founded this nation said that civil governments are instituted among men to preserve the unalienable rights which all men have as their birthright; and in this they make a distinct acknowledgment of the Creator. *Not to have acknowledged that men have these rights would have been to deny the Creator.*

It was not by accident that the Declaration of Independence was made to say that "all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." Leave the Creator out and there is no basis left for the doctrine of rights.

If there is no Creator to whom every human being owes allegiance and to whom he must answer for himself independently of all other persons in the world, the problem of human government has only such obligations to consider as arise from the relation of each man to his fellow-men. In that case the only rights that could exist would be such as would arise out of society and not those descending from a Creator. It would remain merely for society to ordain the manner in which it should exist, without being under obligation to any higher source of authority than itself. Men might claim that they possessed individual rights, but the answer would be that society is above the individual, as the mass is greater and more important than the unit. And if there were no higher authority in the world than human authority this answer would be wholly true, and the individual would be bound to submit in all things to the rule of society.

Recognizing man's relation to his Creator, civil government is obliged to consider men as individuals, each man having a sphere in which he stands by himself, apart from all other individuals that compose society. But ignoring the existence of man's Creator, civil government considers men not by themselves as individuals possessing rights which even the government must not disturb, but only as component parts of the political whole; and then the question to be considered in their government is not what rights do men have as individuals which civil government must preserve, but what is for the general good of the whole? In other words, "the greatest good to the greatest number."

And this shows the real meaning of this phrase as a rule of civil government: *it means political atheism*. It stands for a system which, instead of honoring God, really denies him altogether.

The noble men who ordained the Constitution of the United States, by making that instrument the embodiment of the doctrine of inalienable human rights, recognized the Creator from whom alone such rights could come. And the men who to-day call the Constitution a Godless document and demand that it contain a "recognition of God" which would ignore the rights of those for whom the Constitution is the fundamental law, thereby deny the doctrine of inalienable individual rights, deny the Creator, and become themselves the authors of the political atheism which they charge upon Washington, Jefferson, and their co-patriots.

The doctrine that man is the possessor of certain inalienable individual rights is fixed unalterably and eternally upon the doctrine that man is the workmanship of a sovereign Creator. To deny this doctrine of rights is to proclaim atheism.
