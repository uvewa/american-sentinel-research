## The Fathers: The Consent of the Governed, and the "Party Spirit."

No one can read the history of the infancy and early childhood of these United States and not become deeply impressed with the sacred reverence in which the Fathers held the pillars of priceless principle upon which the sheltering roof to so many millions—the Constitution of the United States, was upreared.

In the speeches, the letters, and the state papers of the time this everywhere appears. There is a rich fervor of righteousness and truth in them all. There is manifest a wealth of honesty and robustness of true life which is indeed refreshing. There is an entire absence of cant and catchy phrase making, and in its place a steady stream of loyalty to those principles of government to which they had pledged "their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor."

"It would be unbecoming," said President John Adams when Congress first met at Washington, "the representatives of this nation to assemble for the first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme Ruler of the universe and imploring his blessing.

"May this territory be the residence of virtue and happiness! In this city may that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnaminity, that constancy and self-government which adorned the great character whose name it bears be forever held in veneration! Here and throughout our contrary may simple manners, pure morals, and true religion flourish forever!"—Fourth Annual Address, November 22, 1800.

Mirrored in these words are the innate desires of the founders of the nation. Their love for their country was not in word only, "but in deed and in truth." And we can truthfully say of them, as was fittingly said of George Washington just after he had passed away:

"Ancient and modern names are diminished before him. Greatness and guilt have too often been allied, but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant. The destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue. It reproved the intemperance of their ambition and darkened the splendor of victory. The scene is closed, and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory. He has traveled on to the end of his journey and carried with him an increasing weight of honor. He has deposited it safely where misfortune can not tarnish it, where malice can not blast it."—Address of Samuel Livermore, President of the Senate pro tempore, to John Adams, President of the United States, in behalf of the Senate, on the occasion of the death of George Washington.

The jealous care with which these great men guarded the inviolability of the "consent-of-the governed" principle is illustrated to a remarkable degree by the manner in which they feared the "party spirit."

Primarily it must be borne in mind that the founders of the American Republic did not anticipate in the beginning that America would ever be ruled by political parties. They regarded political parties as a menace to free government, and as a factor in events possessing a tendency to make null and void the consent-of-the-governed system in the North American Union.

These thoughts are admirably set forth in the famous Farewell Address of George Washington, as well as in the state papers of some of his immediate successors in the presidential chair:

"In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations—Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western—whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts.

You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. * * *

"All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of a nation the will of a party, often a small, but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.

"However combinations of associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

"Toward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. * * *

"I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.

"This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed, but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.

"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which, in different ages and countries, has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.

"Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it."

"It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosities of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.

"There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest, instead of warning, it should consume."—From the Farewell Address of George Washington, September 17, 1796.
