A ROMAN Catholic writer of some note takes a rather gloomy view of the future of "the church" in France, and predicts that "a day will of necessity come when they [the Protestants] will drive the cure from his church, the bishop from his cathedral, and every Catholic from public office."

If this is the trend in France the conditions are very unlike those in this country. Here Romanism is making very rapid progress, and is every day increasing its political influence. According to the best authorities, the same is true in other countries, notably England and Germany.
