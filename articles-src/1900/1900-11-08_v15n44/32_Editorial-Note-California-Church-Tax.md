THE election in California this week decides that State's future policy touching the question of the taxation of church property. Up to this time church property in California has been taxed, but now, as the result of persistent agitation by church leaders, a constitutional amendment is before the people "to exempt from taxation all buildings used solely and exclusively for religious worship, and so much of the real property as is required for their convenient use and occupation."
