It was openly charged at the time of the great railroad strike in this city in 1894 that the burning of freight cars was not the work of the mob, but that is was done by men in the employ of the railroads. The object, it was asserted, was to bring about Federal interference, which was finally secured. This charge seems to be sustained in large measure by evidence brought out in civil suits for damages brought by the railroads against the city and county. Ever since the great strike, attorneys for the labor unions have declared that the companies dare not allow these facts to be brought out in court, but recently one of these suits was tried and resulted in a verdict in favor of the city on the ground that the railroad companies, through their own employes, destroyed their own property, expecting, of course, to compel payment for it after the strike.
