A RECENT London despatch says: "The Sultan of Turkey continues to oppress the Armenians in the most heartless manner, according to a report of Bishop Mush to the Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople. He says everything in the way of crops, sheep, cattle, and furniture has been carried off by the Kurds and that many Armenians have died of starvation. The report concludes that the despair of all Armenians in these districts is such that they have come to wish that a general massacre might terminate their sufferings."
