Rev. Thomas H. Malone, in his article of dissent from Catholic federation in the October *North American Review*, to which attention was called in these columns recently, while declaring such action to be "pernicious in itself," puts forth as his chief objection that it will "prove injurious to Catholics," and is "likely to react upon Catholics everywhere." He considers the loyalty of Catholics to American institutions as beyond question, but in view of the fact that "ruthless and malign has been the misrepresentation in certain quarters of the spirit of Catholic citizens," such movements as that being forwarded by Bishop McFaul are very unwise because they give excuse for certain "fanatics" to continue their "groundless attacks." In discussing this point Mr. Malone says:

"Catholics owe it to themselves to avoid giving, by their attitude or their acts, even the semblance of probability to the statements of those who, when talking about them, argue from the viewpoint of the Middle Ages, and picture Catholics doing now what Catholics did then. Enlightened non-Catholics realize full well that non-Catholics in the Middle Ages did many things which their coreligionists would not do now, and appreciate clearly that Catholics have not been left out in the grand march of progress, which has brought with it new ideas, new interests, and new ways of looking at things.

"In the Middle Ages and the period of the Reformation politics and religion were almost one. To-day men, whether Catholics or Protestants, separate their politics and religion. * * *

"At the present time * * * the best of our citizens, those who have helped to make this country what it is and will continue to assist in her progress on broad humanitarian lines, have no fear of the Catholic element of our citizenship, which has been with us since the beginning and has thrown itself nobly into the common struggle.

"These people know that we are all 'brothers under the skin,' and whatever has happened in past ages, both sides were to blame, and both have learned the lesson of tolerance, liberality, and nationality, and it is not for us to throw into each other's faces the blood they then spilled, and which has long since cried to heaven for vengeance."

## Some Questions.

Now the writer has no desire to quarrel with Mr. Malone, nor to make any attacks upon Catholics, "groundless" or otherwise. He does not desire to question the loyalty of Catholics nor to say that they have "been left out in the grand march of progress." The statements of Mr. Malone may be, and doubtless are, true with reference to great numbers of Catholics as individuals, but certainly he is mistaken if he means that his language shall be taken as applying to the Catholic Church itself. Has the Papacy "learned the lesson of tolerance"? Has she learned to "separate politics and religion"? Has she kept up with "the grand march of progress"? Has she learned "new ways of looking at things"? Will she not do now what she did in the Middle Ages? These are vital questions that are suggested by the language of Mr. Malone.

In securing satisfactory answers to these questions it is unnecessary to go back to Torquemada and the Inquisition, to St. Bartholemew and the rejoicings of Gregory XIII., to the Duke of Alva and the wholesale murder of Protestants in the Netherlands, to the Dragonade and Louis XIV., or to the thunders of the papal pontiffs against the Albigen-ses and Waldenses. These are, indeed, things that can not be blotted from human memory, but we turn elsewhere for the attitude of the Papacy to-day.

## "Pope Leo Speaks to America."

It would be easy to pile up quotations from Catholic authorities showing that the church today stands where she has always stood, and that she is not only not ashamed of her record during the Middle Ages, but stoutly insists that she was right then and would be right in doing the same things now. But it is sufficient for the present purpose to go directly to the present head of that church and ascertain from him—the greatest living authority—the present attitude of the church. This he has made very plain on many occasions, but on none more plain than in his encyclical published in this country early in 1895. This document is recent and authoritative, and the writer will confine himself in this article quite closely to it in its bearing upon the questions enumerated above.

This encyclical has not received the attention that it deserves. Some stir was made over it before its appearance, but there has been little reference to it since. It came shortly after the appointment of an "apostolic delegate" to this country and the announcement from Catholic sources that the Pope had elevated "the United States to the first rank as a Catholic nation." The attention of the whole country had been called to this forth-coming document months before its appearance in the press on the morning of January 29, 1895. We shall quote from it as it appeared in the New York Herald, where it was published under the heading, "Pope Leo Speaks to America." A brief glance at the opening paragraphs is sufficient to show that no more appropriate heading could have been given it, for the Pope, while ostensibly addressing "our Venerable Brethren, the Archbishop and Bishops of the United States," was really speaking to the American people themselves in their national capacity.

## The Pope's Regard for "Christian" America.

In the opening paragraph the Pope expresses his high esteem and exceeding love for "the young and vigorous American nation." In the second paragraph he tells how he "commemorated together with you" the celebration by "your whole nation" of "the completion of the fourth century since the discovery of America." So greatly did he share in these rejoicings that he could not be "content with offering prayers at a distance for your welfare and greatness," but wished to be "in some manner present with you in your festivities." "Hence," he says, "we cheerfully sent one who would represent our person." Satolli was the person sent, and he came not alone to represent the Pope at the World's Fair, and in that way alone to show the Pope's interest in the affairs of the American people, but with his coming to this country there was established "by the Apostolic See" "an American Legation." "By this action," the Pope says at another place in the encyclical, "as we have elsewhere intimated, we have wished, first of all, to certify that in our judgment and affection America occupies the same place and rights as other states, be they ever so mighty and imperial." This action, he says farther, "accorded with the usage and policy of the Apostolic See. For it has been, from earliest antiquity, the custom of the Roman Pontiffs, in the exercise of the divinely bestowed gift of the primacy in the administration of the Church of Christ, to send forth legates to Christian nations and peoples." Thus the pope responded to the declaration of the Supreme Court but a short time before that "this is a Christian nation." And let it be noted that that response, in the language of the Pope himself, was but the carrying out of "the custom of the Roman Pontiffs" "from the earliest antiquity."

In the next paragraph the Pope declares that it was with "good reason" that he took part in this celebration of the whole people of this country, and gives as one reason that "when America was as yet but a new born babe, uttering in its cradle its first feeble cries, the Church took it to her bosom and motherly embrace." Continuing with these "reasons," he says:

"The very names newly given to so many of your towns and rivers and mountains and lakes, teach and clearly witness how deeply your beginnings were marked with the footprints of the Catholic Church. Nor perchance, did the fact that we now relate take place without some design of Divine Providence. Precisely at the epoch when the American colonies, having, with Catholic aid, achieved liberty and independence, coalesced into a constitutional republic, the ecclesiastical heirarchy was happily established among you, and at the very time when the popular suffrage placed the great Washington at the helm of the Republic, the first bishop was set by apostolic authority over the American church. The well-known friendship and familiar intercourse which subsisted between these two men seems to be an evidence that the United States ought to be conjoined in concord and amity with the Cath-olic Church. And not without cause, for without morality the state can not endure."

It is interesting to note how much the Pope finds in common between the young republic of the New World, the great distinction of which has been the fact that it has in principle and largely in practice utterly divorced church and state and repudiated and denied the use of force in matters of opinion and religion, and the old sorceress of tyranny of the Old World whose chief distinction is that of occupying the highest place "among the contrivances which have been devised for deceiving and oppressing mankind." And it is interesting, too, to note with what care he manufactures the basis for the conclusion that this republic "ought to be conjoined in concord and amity with the Catholic Church." This conclusion is the key of his encyclical; and the quotations thus far made are a fitting introduction to the paragraph to which especial attention should be given.

## The Papacy and the Fathers of the Republic.

But first, we can not forbear a few remarks relating to the quotation just given. There may have existed the utmost friendship between John Carroll, the first bishop of Baltimore, and Washington and other great Americans of that day, but it does not follow by any means that the Catholic system was especially in favor among them, or that they felt at all the need of the "motherly embrace" of the church or that "the United States ought to be conjoined in concord and amity with the Catholic Church" in the sense in which the Pope uses these words. When, in 1783, the Pope, through his nuncio at Paris, made overtures to Franklin on the subject of appointing an apostolic vicar for the United States (extending, as it were, the arms of the church for the "motherly embrace"), he was informed that the subject, being purely spiritual, was not a matter with which the American Government could properly have anything to do. James Madison and others in Virginia considered it of the utmost importance to oppose a measure because they saw in it that which would "lead us back to the church of Rome." The first Continental Congress, in its memorial addressed to the people of Great Britain, written by John Jay, used these words in speaking of the establishment of the Catholic religion by the English government in a portion of the Dominion of Canada: "Nor can we suppress our astonishment that a British parliament should ever consent to establish in that country a religion that has deluged your island in blood, and dispersed impiety, bigotry, persecution, murder, and rebellion through every part of the world." Honor should be given to whom honor is due, and it may be and doubtless is true that John Carroll is entitled to the credit and honor of having done what he could to aid the colonies in securing their independence, but it will never be possible for Leo XIII. or any one else to show that the Catholic Church is entitled to any credit or any honor for the Declaration of Independence and the setting up of a government on its principles.

The consideration of these things showing the real drift of the encyclical makes it necessary to leave until next week the important paragraph.
