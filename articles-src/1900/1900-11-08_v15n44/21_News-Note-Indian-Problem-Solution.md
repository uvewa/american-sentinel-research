SPEAKING of the results of the eighteenth annual session of the Indian Conference, just held at Lake Mohonk, the *Independent* says: "For the Indian problem there is but one solution and conclusion,—the treating of the Indian just like the white man, giving him the same protection by law, the same privileges of citizenship and education and self-support, the same right and the same risk in paddling his own canoe in whatever waters he may choose."

Then the Indian will no longer constitute an exception to the rule of government by consent of the governed.
