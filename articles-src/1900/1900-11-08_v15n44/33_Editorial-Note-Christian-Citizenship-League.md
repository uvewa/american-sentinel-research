THE State Christian Citizenship League of Illinois has sent to every candidate for election to the Illinois legislature a list of questions, with a request for an answer to the same. The attitude of the candidate toward these questions, it is understood, will in each case determine the attitude of the Christian Citizenship League toward the candidate at the polls. The questions in this case relate principally to the saloon, but if they related to Sunday enforcement and other religious measures it would not be beyond the scope of the Christian Citizenship movement, as outlined in its literature. We are unquestionably rapidly approaching the time when candidates for political office will have to pass a religious test in order to be sure of the church vote.
