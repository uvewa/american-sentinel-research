"MRS. CONGER, in a letter to her niece," says the *Christian Endeavor World*, "tells how a Chinese bullet made a hole in the Declaration of Independence in the American legation at Peking. The hole will be mended when an American is as safe in China as at home." It will take more than safety in China to repair the injury done to the Declaration of Independence, not by Chinese bullets, but by American politicians.
