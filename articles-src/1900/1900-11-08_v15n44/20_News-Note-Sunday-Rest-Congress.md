"THERE are those who deplore the fact that no World's Parliament of Religions was conducted in connection with the Paris Exposition," says the *Lutheran Witness*. "To make up in part for this seeming defect there has recently been held what is called the International Sunday Rest Congress, similar to the one at Brussels in 1896. Now we are not all clear as to what is what in this matter. It is announced that the assemblage was to consider 'only the physical and industrial gains arising from the week-day rest,' and yet, in the same breath, this congress is called 'an evidence of religion in its institutional form.' The very fact that religious journals attach any importance to such a project indicates that it is after all only an ill disguised attempt to further the cause of the 'Christian Sabbath.' If such is the case the Sunday Rest Congress is just as much out of place, and will do just as little real good as the World's Parliament of Religions did."
