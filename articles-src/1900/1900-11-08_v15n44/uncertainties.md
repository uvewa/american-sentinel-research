# Uncertainties Log - Volume 15, Number 44 (November 8, 1900)

## General Notes

The OCR quality for this issue was generally very good. The following items were noted:

## Page 1

- Line 223: "contrary" appears to be an OCR error for "country" in John Adams quote: "Here and throughout our contrary may simple manners..."

## Page 6

- Line 183: "heirarchy" appears in original OCR (modern spelling: "hierarchy")

## Page 7

- Line 197-198: Text references "a British parliament should ever consent to establish" - quote appears complete and accurate

## Page 12

- Line 402: "sectatures" appears to be an OCR error, possibly for "scriptures" in the Labor and Money Power advertisement

## Page 15

- Line 518: "near at House" appears to be OCR error for "nearest House"

## Resolution

All obvious OCR errors were corrected in the final transcription. The original spelling and punctuation of the 1900 publication has been preserved throughout.
