Repeated outbreaks of religious intolerance in Mansfield, Ohio, have recently occurred, following various attempts of certain elders of the Dowie "Zion" church to hold religious services with the few followers of the sect residing in that place. The conduct of the city government in permitting these repeated outrages is rightly characterized by leading American journals as pusillanimous in the extreme and entirely without excuse. "What," inquires the Independent, "can Ohio say about Southern lynchings when Mansfield thus flouts the laws and the constitution of the State and the country?" and the question is altogether pertinent.
