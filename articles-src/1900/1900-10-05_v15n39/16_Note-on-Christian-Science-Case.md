"Two adherents of "Christian Science" in Milwaukee, Wis., were recently found guilty of practicing medicine in violation of the State medical law, which forbids such practice to any person not a graduate of a medical college. This is a very proper legal provision, but the judge in giving his decision declared that a person's religion is subordinate to the laws of the land, citing as evidence a decision of the United States Supreme Court against Mormonism. This judge's decision is a precedent which will probably be heard from later."
