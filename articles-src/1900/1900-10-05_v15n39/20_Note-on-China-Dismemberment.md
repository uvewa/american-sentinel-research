The following "special cable" from Paris to the New York Tribune gives "the latest" on the Chinese situation:

"Paris, September 29.—A veneer of purely formal and conventional ceremonial is all that is left of the famous European concert in China. The politely-worded official disclaimers from St. Petersburg of any desire for territorial acquisition are accepted here as at Berlin and London with the same exquisite courtesy with which they are proffered. The mask has fallen, and in diplomatic circles not a doubt is entertained but what Germany's vigorous initiative, keenly backed by Japan, marks the first step towards the dismemberment of the Chinese empire."
