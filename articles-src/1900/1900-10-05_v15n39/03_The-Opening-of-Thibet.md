## THE OPENING OF THIBET.

The Roman Catholic Bishop Biet, vicar-apostolic of Thibet, is authority for the statement that the strict laws which have closed that country hitherto on pain of death against all white men, and especially against missionaries, have been repealed, and that henceforth religious liberty is vouchsafed in the land of the Grand Lama. The New York Tribune explains this astonishing news on the basis of the hostility which for centuries has existed between Thibet and China, holding that the Thibetans see in this move at this juncture a fine opportunity for injuring their hereditary foes, one of whose chief defenses has been the position of "the forbidden land," guarding against intrusion their western frontier. If Thibet has thrown in her lot with civilization, the control of China by the great world forces will be doubly easy.

Whatever may have been the cause, this event, if it has really happened, is one of the most important of the closing century, since it signifies that the last hermit nation on earth has thrown down its walls.—Christian Endeavor World
