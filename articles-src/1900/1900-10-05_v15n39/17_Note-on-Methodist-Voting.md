The Michigan Christian Advocate, in giving some advice to "the voting Methodist," cites this paragraph from the chapter on temperance in the Methodist discipline: "We record our deliberate judgment that no political party has a right to expect, nor ought it to receive, the support of Christian men so long as it stands committed to the license policy or refuses to put itself on record in an attitude of open hostility to the saloon. But the foregoing must not be considered as in the interest of any political party."

"The voting Methodist," adds the Advocate, "has as a guide the 'deliberate judgment' of the representative men of his church that no political party which is tolerant toward the saloon is entitled to a Methodist vote."

Without casting any reflection upon the sincerity of the assertion that this is not meant to favor any political party, the fact remains that no one will have any difficulty in knowing which one of the parties the voting Methodist must sustain if this advice is followed. But if the saloon evil ought to be cast out by vote, why should not other national evils be attacked in the same way, and why should not the representative men of the church record their "deliberate judgment" concerning these also?
