# Uncertainties Log - Volume 15, Number 39 (October 5, 1900)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good. The following items were noted during transcription:

## Page 1, Article "The Right to Think"
- **Text:** "s." appears alone at end of article
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** This appears to be an author initial or signature mark, consistent with editorial practice. Left as transcribed.

## Page 3, Article "Sunday Enforcement in Arkansas"
- **Text:** "SeJalia, Mo."
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This likely should be "Sedalia, Mo." but OCR shows "SeJalia" - possible OCR error or archaic spelling. Transcribed as shown in OCR.

## Page 16, Subscription Notice
- **Obstruction:** Low-quality image reproduction in OCR
- **Transcribed as:** Noted but omitted from article files (subscription/advertising content per instructions)
- **Confidence:** N/A
- **Reason:** Administrative content, not substantive articles
