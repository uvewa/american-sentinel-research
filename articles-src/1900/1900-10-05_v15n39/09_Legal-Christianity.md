## LEGAL CHRISTIANITY.

From the "Bible Echo," Melbourne, Aust.

God's message to humanity is, "If ye love me keep my commandments;" but man's message to his fellow is, "Love or no love, you must keep our Sunday laws."

Now, when a man desires to obey religious laws he may be made better for both earth and heaven, but when a man is compelled to obey religious laws he is only forced into being a hypocrite, and thus rendered more unfit for either earth or heaven.

It is very natural for the mind of man to say, "You must think and believe and act as I dictate." But this natural spirit is the one that blossomed into the Papacy, and brought forth a harvest of death in the slaughter of 50,000,000 of martyrs. Yet just so far as dissenters lay hold on methods of coercion in matters of religion they are actuated by the same spirit as that which made Rome the terror of the ages; and, if granted opportunity to develop, it must bear the same kind of fruit.

No man can be made better by any outward observance of a religion that he does not recognize and accept with his mind. The state has a right to say to its citizens, "You must not injure the life of your neighbor. You must not defile his home relations, steal his property or steal his character." These things stand between man and man, and are the only four rules—sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth commandments—of the decalogue that human legislation can touch; and even these can not be imposed by earthly powers as the law of God, but simply as civil requirements between man and man. Anything more than this in the line of religious legislation cometh of evil, and also brings evil.

All legal forms grip outside the man, and thus invite the man to wage war against their interference. Love works from within and transforms the man until he is in harmony with the law. But no earthly power can generate love in man—that is the work of God's Spirit—consequently can not transform the man. The man who does not do the wrong because nine hundred policemen step in to prevent him is just as bad as the man who does the wrong whenever he has the chance.

The true servant of God has nothing to do with all this business. "If you love me keep my commandments," is God's message still. The policeman's club may make a man take his hand off his neighbour's goods, but it can never make him a Christian. There is no such thing as legal Christianity with God. The only service that he asks or can accept is a willing service. The wrath of man can never work the righteousness of God.
