MERE good intentions are no hinderance to the outgrowth of despotism.

THERE is no man on earth or set of men good enough to be intrusted with arbitrary power.

HE is the least fitted for self-government who has the least regard for the dictates of conscience.

THE platform of the Christian's party, as defined in Scripture, is "the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."

IF a person has no natural right to civil liberty it can not logically be claimed that he has any right to religious liberty.

THE character of a scheme of government is to be judged not by the good things that may be probable, but by the evil things that may be possible, under it.

A REPUBLIC which undertakes to enforce the "will of God" upon its own or any other people, is essentially the same as a government in which kings or czars give their commands by "divine right."

As the gospel, with its teaching of the brotherhood of all men, is the strongest defender of human rights, so a false system of religion, which puts despotism in the place of love, is the strongest enemy of such rights.
