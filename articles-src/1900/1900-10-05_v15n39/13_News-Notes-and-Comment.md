**News, Notes . . . and Comment**

Eight young men of Corunna, Mich., were recently arrested for playing ball on Sunday, the arrest being instigated, of course, by a clergyman. At the trial, says the Detroit Free Press, the point was made by the attorney for the defense that the boys were not playing base-ball, but only a game of toss up, and therefore the "Sabbath" had not been legally violated. The jury, says the report, puzzled over this point till midnight, and finally stood half for conviction and half for acquittal. Would it not be more in the interests of consistency, common sense, and good government if human legislators would let the subject of the Sabbath alone?

As illustrating the trend in which things are rapidly going in this country, and the wild lengths to which some are carried by the spirit of these things, is the following utterance which a few days ago was received with tremendous applause by an immense audience in this city: "The great American Ocean, hitherto known as the Pacific Ocean." This carries with it a significance and a meaning that the "eloquent orator" evidently did not reckon on; for it is certain that if the attempt is made to give this idea any practical effect it will be no longer fitting to designate that ocean by the name that it has borne from the days of Balboa and Magellan. It will probably become the rendezvous of the far from peaceful fleets and squadrons of Powers that will consider themselves as having as good claim to that ocean as any body else, and if they are not each and all at least secured in the continuance of the "open door" and the possession of a satisfactory "sphere of influence," they will be more than likely to bring to pass upon its surface some scenes that will render the name Pacific very inappropriate indeed.

The blessings (?) of militarism for the soldier, to say nothing of those who bear the burdens it imposes, were illustrated recently by the suicide of three soldiers of one regiment in the French army in one week. France is a republic with a big army.

The United States having joined the "concert" of the Powers in China finds itself in an embarrassing position. At almost the first move it makes it is accused by some of the other Powers of having spoiled the program. If the United States is to stay in the "concert" it must, of course, not sound a note of discord in the music, but must pipe to the tune of the European monarchies.

How easily and unconsciously do men betray themselves and their schemes when advocating the impossible. A great orator a few days since, waxing eloquent on the rule of dependencies by the American Government, declared: "Who knows but what in the orderly and perfect administration we are sure to give these possessions and their cities, we shall find the remedy and the means of reforming the corrupt administrations of our own State and municipal governments here at home?"

Comment on this is almost superfluous. When rivers can flow up hill, when muddy streams can become at their mouths more clear and transparent than are the springs of the mountains from whence they flow, then may the promise of liberty by those who are themselves the servants of corruption be received as capable of fulfillment.

It is now bluntly declared by a leading spokesman for the imperialistic program of the Government, that the declaration for Cuban liberty and independence with which this nation through Congress announced to the world its intention to step between Spain and the down-trodden Cubans, was a great mistake—that the promise of independence given to the Cubans ought never to have been made, because they ought to be ruled by the United States. Thus spoke Senator Beveridge recently to a vast and applauding audience in this city. "Forcible annexation" of Cuba, which but two years ago was "not to be thought of" because it would be "criminal aggression," is now, according to this spokesman, entirely justifiable and proper. The point to be noted is the rapidity with which the old American ideals of government are giving place to others of an opposite character.

REFERRING to the reports, now well authenticated, that the looting of Tien-Tsin and Peking was authorized by military authority, the Christian Endeavor World inquires:

"What can the so-called Christian nations expect after this horrible exhibition of barbarism? They have sown the wind; they will surely reap the whirlwind. The excesses of the Boxers in their maddest moments were apparently no greater, if they were as great, as the rapine and destruction of these barbarians from civilized lands. Who can blame the Chinese for any reprisals which they may hereafter make upon these hordes of white bandits who have overrun their country?"

The possession of a white skin and a knowledge of the ways of civilization are no proof that an individual is not as pure a barbarian as ever lived. And of such individuals the "so-called Christian nations" are in large part composed.

WE commend the following thoughts expressed by the Oriental Watchman, published in Calcutta, India, in reference to the Chinese situation as it was a few weeks ago. After describing the perils by which the missionaries were surrounded, the Watchman says:

"There is a lesson to be learned by these calamities, and missionaries need to study it. How often have we seen the spectacle of missionary bodies calling for political intervention, and, if not calling for it, allowing themselves without protest to be treated 'just like other citizens,' when difficulties with the non-Christian peoples have arisen. All this has given people the impression that Lord Salisbury indicated in his warning to missionaries. He also, a politician, set forth a spiritual truth that most missionary bodies have been too blind to see. He pointed out the spiritual weakness that must result from associating religion with political power. And now, it is to be feared, the innocent will have to suffer with the guilty. Whenever a missionary makes himself a party to calling for the sword to punish anti-Christian violence he forgets Christ's warning, 'They that take the sword shall perish with the sword.'

"Of course governments, from their point of view, must protect their citizens, the missionary as well as others. And some say, 'Ought not a missionary to be protected the same as any citizen?' If the missionary wants to place himself on the same level as citizens of the kingdoms of this world he may do so. But the true missionary is a 'man sent from God,' not from England, or America, or Germany. His 'citizenship is in heaven,' and when he gets into trouble over the discharge of his duties as an ambassador of heaven he appeals to the court of heaven for protection. In the realm of the gospel the Lord said, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay,' and as for protection, 'Lo, I am with you always.'

For years missionaries have penetrated to the remotest corners of China. There have been local tumults and violence, but when persecuted in one city the missionary has usually been able to flee unto another, as Christ commanded. It is undeniable that the gravest dangers to missionaries have arisen through the hatred stirred up by the actions of political powers. Some missionaries have called for it, and some have protested against it. Now we can only commend all alike to the only protection that can save hundreds of mission stations in the Chinese interior."
