Count Tolstoy, the famous Russian, has been excommunicated by the Russian state church (Greek Catholic), which has undertaken further to see that the Count does not get into heaven, by forbidding him "absolution" in the hour of death. In view of the fact that Tolstoy does not believe in war, and is opposed to every principle of tyranny, and does not hesitate to say so, this attitude of the Greek Catholic Church is readily comprehensible.
