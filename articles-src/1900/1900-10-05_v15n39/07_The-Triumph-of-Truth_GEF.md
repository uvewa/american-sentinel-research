## THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH.

All truth is immortal, for God is the truth, "Who only hath immortality." Each truth is one of the thoughts of God, and all truth is harmonious, since God's thoughts are not conflicting.

Truth not only possesses the immortality of God, but also inherent in itself is the almighty power of its divine Author. There is one strong thing and one enduring thing in this universe, and that is truth. Still we must not from this conclude that truth is always in this world openly and apparently triumphant. On the contrary, it is often down in the utmost apparent defeat; but it is through these apparent defeats in time that truth triumphs for eternity. Jesus said, "I am the truth." His life and death reveal how the truth is regarded in this world. He was born in a manger because there was no room for him in the inn. Throughout life he was a homeless wanderer without where to lay his head; crucified as a malefactor, ignominiously crucified between thieves; he was raised again the third day and taken up to heaven glorified forever. This is the history of truth in this world. And yet, while the world has no room for truth in the inn, but only a cross arranged for it between thieves, God, when he bringeth this truth into the world says, "Let all the angels of God worship him." In heaven truth is always worshipful as it will be in this world when it is finally triumphant and "The hail has swept away the refuge of lies."

Yes, truth is always worshipful in the world to-day, though not always worshiped. It was not simply nineteen hundred years ago that Truth was crucified. Lowell well and grandly says:

"Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne,
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown
Standeth God within the shadows, keeping watch above His own."

Another poet has truly said:

"Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,
The eternal years of God are hers;
But error, wounded, writhes with pain,
And dies amid her worshipers."

Truth to-day, as of old, enters the world unknown and unrecognized by the self-styled great of earth. It comes in by the minority of one, and that one only a babe in the eyes of the world. It is still persecuted and often ignominiously crucified, and its pilgrimage is long and perilous before a majority believe in it. But still it is ever triumphing through apparent defeat and crucifixion. You may crucify it to-day ignominiously between thieves and ere three days it will rise again, and full soon it will ascend up to heaven glorified.

All the world will shout themselves hoarse with enthusiasm at the heels of the truth triumphant, and instantly enter their claims for a share of its honors and emoluments, but the Christian worships the crucified truth, and in self-forgetful love is willingly crucified with it for the truth's sake, and the Christian thus triumphs with the truth with a triumph eternal.

On the other hand, if there is one lesson better taught by the history even of this world than almost any other it is this, that a lie can not endure forever. Put behind it all the authority of all the legislators of earth to enact it into laws; back of these all the courts with their learned decisions, all the executive power, all the policemen with their billies, all the militia with its muskets, all the army with its guns, all the navy with its floating enginery of death; back of these never so many editors to write leading articles to make the lie popular, never so many of the plumed knights of music to blow the lie to the winds in harmonious notes, never so many executioners to put to death all dissenters from the lie, and still it is only a lie. It may stand its day or two, its century or two, doing evil while it can, but it ever approaches the time of its utter extinction. Its triumphs are transient and its defeats eternal. The truth unaided, save by its own divine inherent strength, is mightier than the lie with all the powers of earth behind it.

The world is full of illustrations of this fact. A few centuries ago men believed that this world was the most stationary thing in this universe. They thought it was flat, and that it rested on the shoulders of a gigantic man, and the man stood on the back of a turtle. Where the turtle stood they had not as yet discovered. The blue sky was a canopy cemented to the edges of the world, and the stars were holes punched in this canopy to let the glory shine through and so give man glimpses of heaven. The sun and moon were hauled across the sky by invisible angels who got them back always in time for a new trip. All this the world believed and the church believed. Moreover the church taught that the Bible taught this, and that any one was eternally damned who dared to deny it. For fear that God would not do the work to suit her she proposed to begin to damn him here herself. Back of this great church that then held the world in her hand were all the kingdoms and courts and congresses of earth, and all the armies ready to do her bidding. Under these circumstances, one man, Galileo by name, invented a telescope by putting some lenses into a piece of lead pipe. With this he dicovered the moons of Jupiter and the motion of Jupiter upon its axis. He said this was a miniature Copernican system hung up in the sky to show us the plan of the universe. He asked the other philosophers to look through his telescope and see for themselves and they refused to look, afraid that they would be possessed with the philosopher's magic and see things that never were. Galileo began to teach that the world was round, and that it turned on its axis instead of the sun going around it. For this the church shut him up in the dungeons of the inquisition and subjected him to the tortures of the rack. Under these tortures he weakened, and said he guessed the world did not move. They let him out because he lied thus, just as they had previously shut him up because he told the truth. But when he got out and the free air of heaven once more fanned his fevered cheek, he said, "Still she moves." And she did move; and to-day the whole world knows that she did move.

The truth held in the heart of one man, and but tremblingly even there, and that man in a dungeon and all the world against him, was stronger than the lie with all the combined powers of the church and the world behind it. Could there ever be a harder show for the triumph of truth? Yet even here it has triumphed gloriously, and so it continues to triumph through persecution and through crucifixion. It is conscious of its own inherent strength, and so asks no other power. Truth is almighty, for truth is divine, as God is the Truth.

It is always the lie that, conscious of its own inherent weakness, is ever beseeching the state for the power of legislatures and courts and armies to enable it to compete with truth. It is a lie to-day that in the form of Sunday asks for legislation to enable it to put down the truth of the Sabbath of the Lord. It is a corrupted, apostate, and therefore a false form of Christianity that to-day is asking for force to enable it to triumph over the truth of God for this time. But still the defeat of the lie is certain, for "The hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow their hiding place."

He who does not believe that the truth will conquer the lie on a fair field does not believe that God is as strong as Satan, for God is the Truth and Satan is the father of lies, and lying is still his principal weapon. Thus the church is now denying the power of God, and confessing her own weakness before the world by asking the aid of the civil power. But let Satan and evil men do their worst, the triumph of the truth is still certain, and those who are crucified with it will surely triumph with it.
