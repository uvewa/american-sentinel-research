## PEACE THAT MEANS WAR.

Truly hope springs eternal in the human breast. The century is going out in war, and still the cry is peace, even by those who, unconsciously or otherwise, are doing the most to bring about those conditions which can have no outcome but world-wide war. In striking proof and illustration of this is the following with which Senator Beveridge, of Indiana, closed a speech to an audience of six thousand people at the Auditorium, in this city, last week:

"Men—patriotic, brave, and wise—have sought to stay that tremendous purpose of destiny, but their opposition was as the finger of a babe against the resistless pour of the Gulf Stream's mighty current, for God's hand was in it all. His plans were working out their glorious results; and just as futile is resistance to the continuance to-day of the eternal movement of the American people toward the mastery of the world. This is a destiny neither vague nor undesirable. It is definite, splendid, and holy. When nations shall war no more without the consent of the American Republic, what American heart thrills not with pride at that prospect? And yet our interests are weaving themselves so rapidly around the world that that time is almost here. When governments stay the slaughter of human beings, because the American Republic demands it, what American heart thrills not with pride at that prospect? And yet to-night there sits in Constantinople a sovereign who knows that that time is nearly here. When the commerce of the world on which the world's peace hangs, travelling every ocean highway of earth shall pass beneath the guns of the great Republic, what American heart thrills not at that prospect? When any changing of the map of earth requires a conference of the Powers, and when, at any congress of the nations, the American Republic will preside as the most powerful of Powers and most righteous of judges, what American heart thrills not at that prospect? And yet that prospect is at hand even as I speak. It is the high and holy destiny of the American people, and from that destiny the American bugles will never sound retreat. 'Westward the star of empire takes its way.'"

A delusion more fatal to the peace of the world it would be hard to imagine than that contained in the above. The thrilling of the heart with that pride which attends the prospect of world-mastery is a stimulus that will make war sure and certain. Nations warring no more and slaughtering no more because the American Republic forbids them!!

There is no such thing as peaceful mastery of the world. England has sovereignty over a good portion of the earth, and instead of its making for peace it keeps her in war almost continually. The folly of this delusion is that it takes account of nothing but itself; and it sees itself only with the eyes of pride and vanity. It forgets that the people and nations of the earth will not agree to and are well able to dispute the supreme mastery of America or any other Power in world affairs. It forgets that all the inhabitants of the world are not enraptured with the sentiment that American mastery means the end of war and slaughter, and that all hearts do not thrill with pride at the prospect of that "high and holy destiny" for the American Republic. It forgets that there are other equally powerful nations who think with equally as good reasons that their mastery of the world is the best thing that could possibly come to pass. What nation is there indeed that will not be willing that slaughter shall cease and that war shall be no more when all the inhabitants of the earth bow unquestioningly to its sway? This is the peace that all the conquerors of the earth have longed for and fought for. Surely this delusion must spring from those spirits of deception that prophecy declared were to go forth to deceive the nations and to gather them to the battle of Armageddon.

John D. Bradley.
