# COMMON SENSE ON THE SUBJECT OF SABBATH ENFORCEMENT.

Plain Words Spoken by a Canadian Journal.

From "Saturday Night," Toronto, Ont.

THAT good Presbyterian newspaper, the Westminster, is exceedingly and, I am afraid, unduly concerned with regard to the continued existence of the Sabbath day in Canada. Last week, in an article enquiring "Is the Sabbath Worth Saving?" it says:

"It (the Sabbath) is beset behind and before, undermined and honeycombed by secularizing forces working for its complete destruction. If no stand is made, deliberate, unabashed, and unyielding, the day of rest will be transformed within this generation to a day of pleasure and toil. Let there be no mistake about this thing. We raise no alarmist cry. It is not a question of Sunday cars in Toronto or Hamilton. It is not a local affair at all. It is at bottom a question involving every industry and every community. Mills, factories, and shops in every county of Ontario, as well as electric cars in every town, and concerts and games at every resort, may, within a decade, demand the services of workmen and attendants if the friends of a rest day for toilers and a worship day for the devout are not vigilant, determined, and strong. . . . Toronto seems of late to be set upon destroying its worldwide reputation for Sabbath quiet. The traffic in soft drinks in the city, the lawlessness on the Island and the general demoralization of the parks and gardens are significant signs of the changed conditions."

I wonder where the editor of the Westminster has been spending his Sundays, for if he has witnessed these evidences of degeneracy he has been frequenting places which the ordinary citizen of Toronto either avoids or has not seen. If we hunt for "tough joints" we can find them in Toronto or in any other good-sized town, both on Sundays and week days, and it has always been so, and probably until the end of the chapter it will not be different. It may be true that the Sabbath is an institution that is badly "beset by secularizing forces," as the Westminster describes, but are not the churches in the same predicament? Are they not assailed "behind and before, undermined and honeycombed by secularizing forces," and are they not working as swiftly and certainly for their own destruction as for the destruction of the Sabbath day itself? Is it not because of the weakened influence and worth of the churches that the people are seeking in the parks and waterside resorts the rest and enjoyment which life is not unreasonably expected by the average human beings to have in store for them? We can not expect any but the most devout or the most superstitious to continually go to church and ask for bread and be given a stone. The intellectual are disappointed because they so often find in the pulpit neither zeal, eloquence, nor thoughtfulness, sometimes not even piety. The weary are becoming tired of putting on their best clothes and walking through the hot sun to hear students preach while the pastor is away to play. The poor shrink from the doors of the fashionable edifices and are almost surprised when they enter that they are not ejected from the soft cushions of the pews. They look at the raiment of those arrayed in purple and fine linen with eyes of envy, or turn, shamefaced, from the critical gaze of those who stare at their worn and faded garments. Those who want peace, naturally enough weary while listening to dogma, denunciation, and platitudes about divine love, which find no counterpart in the lives of those among whom they sit. We hear the Protestants berating the Catholics, and unfortunately sometimes we hear the Catholics endeavoring to prove that there is only one gate into heaven, and that Peter is there to keep out all but those whose souls have been shrived by priests on earth. They take away from these edifices, dedicated to God, no sound which lasts so long in their ears as the jingle of the coins in the collection-box, and there is no cry which they remember so well as the appeal to them to give, give, give. They hear more about the mortgage on the church, the debt, the interest account, foreign missions, home missions, and entertainments at so much per head than they do about the love of Christ, and more pains are taken to show them how they can spare a little more of their stipend than how they can save their souls.

It is not so much the secularizing influences of those who, for profit, desire to lead people to parks and pleasure resorts, as the secularizing influences within the church itself, which threaten to destroy the devotional character of the first day of the week. Going to church has become more or less of a business proposition, and the change from devoutness to habit, and the departure from habit in favor of a Sunday outing, has not more than kept pace with the degeneracy of preaching or the lofty ideal of carrying the Word of Life to the ears of all people and all nations, into a business—a business which is paid for as the services of a lawyer or a doctor are paid for. Lacking the example of the real godliness of church members and church leaders, the people have naturally, and it does not appear to me altogether unreasonably, decided that there is so much that is secular in the church, and so much that is beautiful in nature, and restful and changeful in an outing, that they have decided that one is perhaps quite as elevating as the other, and that the outing is perhaps the more healthful and restful of the two. That there are occasional exhibitions of rowdyism in the parks and on the Island is to be expected, for where a large number of people gather together the conspicuously ill-behaved person will always be found. In churches this conspicuously ill-mannered person is also found. He may not swear or try to fight, but he treats people badly; he sneers at his brethren and treats with contempt or ignores with cheap hauteur the poor and the anxious. Rowdyism, consequently, though of different varieties, is to be found in both places, and probably the sort which utters no unclean word or strikes no physical blow is the worse of the two. No doubt some churches make everyone welcome, and probably some preachers are always seeking to make an impression on the hearts of their listeners, but the fact should never be overlooked that you can not have the common people on the first day of the week if you ignore, starve or overwork them the other six.

The remedy that the Westminster proposes is to aid the Lord's Day Alliance by "co-operation and financial support." O blind leaders! Have you been taught nothing by the lessons of the past? Why would you try again by the enaction of laws which the people will defy, to fill your pews to overflowing by forcing those who seek a change of scene and circumstance to worship with you because they have nowhere else to go? The world years ago rolled away from that idea of godliness. Are you in such desperate straits that laws must be enacted practically compelling people either to stay at home, go for a perhaps wearisome walk, or else attend church? The majority of people are physically weary on Sunday. All week artisans have been shut up in workshops, clerks in warehouses, and women have been within doors drudging for their families. In the bright summer, on the only day they have you would make them march to a hot and stuffy church from which even the regular preacher has fled for a summering, or else they must lose all the pleasure of contact with a more or less desirable crowd of their fellow-beings. Going for a walk is just as bad as going to the Island or going to a park, and it is much more tiring and less interesting. I believe that people are much better off if they go to church at least once on a Sunday, for it keeps fresh the memory of the teachings of youth and all that is good in their nature, unless the man in the pulpit preaches the good all out of them in trying to get doctrine into them. But if they see fit to stay away it is their business, it is their souls that are to be saved or lost, and the Lord's Day Alliance can not by any legal means drive them into heaven through the portals of a church. The Lord's Day Alliance practically denies the doctrine of free will, and then must fall back upon Calvinism, which I presume is still held as a sacred dogma by the editor of the Westminster. If so, what matters it? If they are elected to be saved, they will be saved anyhow, and if the are predestined to be damned, they will be damned anyhow.

The editor of the Westminster need not fear that the workers of the civilized world will yield up the franchise which gives them a day of rest. The whole tendency of organized labor, and for that matter, to a certain extent, of organized capital is to reduce the number of hours of work per week. Ten hours a day is now considered too long for any man or woman to work, and almost universally in Anglo-Saxon workshops it has been cut down to nine. In Canada the clamor for an eight-hour day is growing greater every year. The Saturday half-holiday, particularly in the summer, is an established institution as well. These reforms have been brought about without impinging in the slightest upon Sunday as a day of complete rest. The economics of labor are proving that men can do as much work in nine hours as they formerly did in ten, and that it may be possible that they can do as much work in eight hours as they are now doing in nine, though I doubt it. The fact remains, however, that labor is now organized as it never was when the churches held their supreme sway, and that workingmen have obtained for themselves in the matter of rest what the church never sought to obtain for them. Go into an assembly of artisans and talk about the church having obtained for them additional rest or easier working hours, and the majority of the men will laugh at you. One reason that the working classes have so little sympathy with the churches is because the churches have had so little sympathy with them. What the workingmen have obtained they have fought for as workingmen, not as Christians. In fact, the capitalists who support the big churches have been slowest to yield to the demands of the toiler. It is because of this that the masses, who would be downtrodden were it not for their own exertions, have little or nothing to thank the churches for in the matter of a reduction of the hours of toil, and they know they can keep Sunday as a day of rest without the help of the Lord's Day Alliance. Thus thanking the church for nothing they are leaving the church to mind its own business, which is, unfortunately, largely that of running a sort of a religious club of a more or less exclusive character, and they are taking their enjoyments when and where they see fit. My esteemed brother of the Westminster, when he next makes an appeal on behalf of the Lord's Day Alliance, would be wise not to use any of the pharisaical expressions which no longer appeal to the real workers, but instead openly declare that he fears that his craft and that of his fellow-ministers is in danger.
