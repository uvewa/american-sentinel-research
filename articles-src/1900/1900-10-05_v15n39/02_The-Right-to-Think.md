## THE RIGHT TO THINK.

It may seem the tamest of platitudes to assert a truth so self-evident as that every person has the right to think; yet, looking at the logical deductions based upon this axiomatic truth, it is evident that in the practices of men its truth is far from being universally conceded.

The right to think is the logical starting point of liberty and the logical stopping point of despotism.

The gospel is the strongest advocate of man's right to think. It asserts the right not only as a right, but as a duty. It points man to faith—the individual exercise of belief without regard to any other man—as the only means of salvation. It shows him, further, that "faith without works is dead."

The religious system known as the Papacy denies that man can be saved through his own belief independently of the belief of others, but declares that men must accept the word of salvation as understood by pope and prelate and as received from tradition. This is to deny man's right to think for himself; and this right being denied, it follows of necessity that man has no right to act for himself, but can act only as the power to which he yields intellectual submission may direct. Hence the papal system has always claimed, and still claims, that the Pope is the civil as well as the religious ruler of the world.

Under the rule of the Papacy dissenters were punished by the civil authority, whose duty, as declared by the church, was to root out heresy. The civil power, it was held, existed to execute the will of the church. But the Reformation, proclaiming to all men that salvation was by faith, denied the necessity or the right of such exercise of the civil authority. As the Reformation doctrine was received by the people it was perceived that civil governments must exist for some different purpose than to execute the decrees of the church. It was perceived that not only was salvation by faith inconsistent with the absolutism of the Pope, but with that of king and emperor as well. It was seen that absolutism in civil government had never been ordained by the Creator, and that the right form of civil government was not a monarchy.

Following this came the declaration to the world that the true purpose of civil government is to preserve individual rights, and that the just powers of civil governments are derived from the consent of the governed; and with this came the rise of a new nation, in which the governmental power and authority represented the will only of the people themselves.

But nearly forty years ago there began a movement in this country which sought to substitute what its leaders held to be the will of God for the will of the people in the fundamental law of the land. This would force all the people to accept a human interpretation of the will of God, which is the essential feature of the Papacy. Civil government would be placed back again upon the principles of the papal system; and that movement has been steadily growing in the United States, wearing the mask of benevolence, by which the multitudes have been led to consider it worthy of their support. The primary party in this movement, which furnished the leaven for the vastly greater lump of its adherents to-day, is known as the National Reform party.

It is not strange, therefore, that it was a convention of this party which first declared in this country that civil governments do not derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and stigmatized that assertion of our forefathers as "that old Philadelphia lie." The doctrine that civil governments should execute the divine will rather than the will of the people; that the will of God should therefore be enforced upon the people by the civil power; that the individual conscience must yield to the "national conscience;" and therefore that the individual has no right to think for himself—is the starting point of the despotism which denies the right of the people to self-government. It is the starting point of the doctrine that the people must be governed, not by themselves, but by the Lord, through his divinely-appointed agent, in the person of Pope or king. And when it was proclaimed in Congress, as the sentiment of that body and the voice of the nation, that governments do not derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, it was a proclamation of what had been from the first the underlying principle of the National Reform scheme, and what the advocates of that scheme had, as far back as 1889, at SeJalia, Mo., and at the Chautauqua Assembly in New York, openly declared in words. It is entirely logical, moreover, that in repudiating the doctrine of government by consent of the governed there should be much said about the leadings of Providence and performing of the divine will. This "divine-right" system of civil government and the National Reform scheme will reach a point at which they will coalesce, and that point is the Papacy.

The right to self-government is inherent in the right to think; and the leading enemy of the whole system of human rights is a false system of religion.
