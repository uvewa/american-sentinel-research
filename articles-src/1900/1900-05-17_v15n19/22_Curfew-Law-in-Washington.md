Washington, D. C., reformers have started a movement for a curfew law to keep children off the streets in the evening, and the district commissioners have referred the matter to Maj. Sylvester, superintendent of police, for report. It is stated that Maj. Sylvester will oppose the plan. He says that in Washington the summers are so hot that the children cannot play out of doors in the daytime, and that for the sake of their health they should have the run of the streets and the parks in the evening.
