The spirit of Sunday legislation puts on various disguises before the people of civilized and self-governing lands, but in those countries where it is not obliged to contend with the influence of modern liberalism and enlightenment, it feels no need of any disguise and shows itself in its true character. Here in the United States, it hides behind the plea of civil necessity, and professes to be mild toward all dissenters; it would not in any way interfere with the worship of people who observe another day. But in the far-off islands of the sea, where there is no sense of accountability to vast masses of intelligent people, it shuts up the churches of dissenters, forbids their worship, and resorts to measures identified with religious persecution. The following extracts from a letter written by Dr. J. E. Caldwell, a medical missionary to the Cook Islands, will demonstrate the truth of these statements. They relate to the change recently made in the islands from Saturday to Sunday as the weekly day of rest, and the law enacted at the time commanding Sunday observance. The letter is dated at Avarua, Raratonga, Feb. 28, 1900:

"It is marvelous what the Lord is doing for some of them (the natives). Before they called us to teach them they had built a coro house for worship, with a good rau thatch roof. By order of the judge of the district, the house was closed. Some of the principal members were taken to court and fined, under various pretexts—the real reason being that they had ceased to attend services since the change to the first day of the week. Eight of the original forty-six members who at first sent us their names have gone over to the other side. No, that is hardly the true way to put it. Their sympathies are still against the movement, but they have yielded to the threats of the arikis, and have begun to go to meeting at their old place of worship. It is reported that another batch of them has been singled out to be fined to-day."

"It is a marvel to me that any of them had the hardihood to endure the persecutions they have been subjected to, without giving up. They are threatened with the loss of their homes if they do not yield. To a native, who lives upon his land and has no means of earning money, this is a very serious thing."

"Sunday morning. I was permitted to go out to Titikavaka yesterday and speak to the brethren there. The entire village who have not been working on Sabbath and attending the first day meetings were fined on last preparation day therefor. The specific charges brought were that they had trampled on and profaned their chief, and they had talked hard against the first day. The facts are they did not accede to the request of the ariki when he asked them to attend the first day meetings. If not paid to-morrow, their fines of 30 shillings each are to be put into the High Court for collection. The fines were against all adults, male and female alike."

"The dominant mission is exactly where the church was in the time of Constantine, and the establishment of the ecclesiastical hierarchy that was to continue 1260 years. Their plan is to persecute and to intimidate all who do not choose to adopt the new religion. They are succeeding in turning most of the people into their channel, but at a cost which is proving fatal to the interests of their cause. The very men who are most worthy among their people are alienated. They refuse to attend the church, or in the few cases where they have succeeded in getting them to attend church, they do so with so poor a grace, and with so much complaint, that the cause of the persecutors is done more harm than good. By the advantage which a long residence among them has given us, we are easily able to call their attention to the blessed truths of God by which they may be sanctified. They are forbidden to meet any more in their familiar places of neighborhood worship, but they always greet us very warmly when we approach them."

In a letter shortly preceding this, also, Dr. Caldwell wrote that "the people who refused to observe Sunday were turned out of their places of worship, the doors of the churches being closed against them for service on any other day than the first day of the week, and they were even forbidden the privilege of meeting in private meeting-houses, those in authority, some of whom are missionaries, even going so far as to suggest that these buildings be burned. One of our missionaries was arrested and fined for non-observance of the law. But with all this, many were inquiring for light, among whom were chiefs and former missionaries, and some had already taken their stand for the truth of God.

And all this is done by white people, English-speaking people—the same kind of people who are urging forward the movement for Sunday enforcement in England and the United States. If they were in this country they would disclaim any intention or desire to interfere with the worship of seventh-day people and talk about the necessity for Sunday observance on purely civil grounds. But in the far-off Cook Islands, where they feel that they can do as they please without being accountable to civilized and self-governing people, they boldly proceed to close up the churches of seventh-day observers, and manifest the genuine spirit of religious persecution. That is the real spirit of the Sunday laws, and it is just as truly so here in North America as it is in the Cook Islands. If it were not such here, it would not be what it is there.
