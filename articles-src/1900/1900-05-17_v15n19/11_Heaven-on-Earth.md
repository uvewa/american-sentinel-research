A prominent clergyman of New York City, Rev. Dr. McArthur, gave utterance recently to the following, which certainly suggests that the church, so far as he represents it, is not very closely in touch with present conditions among the humbler classes, either here or in other lands:

"No Christian ought to enter heaven during the next twenty-five years if he can help it; we are getting more heaven on earth now than ever we had. We have had more of it in the last twenty-five years than at any time since Adam fell into sin in the Garden of Eden."
