"God is a Spirit." "God is love." Love is the spiritual element and the spiritual power in this universe. God's law is a spiritual law, and it is a law of love—"love is the fulfilling of the law." As love is the fulfilling of the law, so all sin, which is the transgression of the law, is an infringement of love. He who is filled with the spirit of love until he spontaneously acts out the acts of love, has been emancipated from all legalism and compulsion; because God's will has become his will, and so, in freely doing his own will, he obeys God. "The fruit of the spirit of love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law."

John, in holy vision, beheld this spiritual law, this law of love, in heaven, under the throne of God, the basis of his government for the whole universe. The kingdom of God is therefore a spiritual kingdom, it is "righteousness, joy, and peace in the Holy Spirit." It is not the kingdom of force or arbitrary power, it is the kingdom of love. It does not, like other kingdoms, have to be maintained by armies, for its throne is established in the willing heart of each subject. "The kingdom of God is within you." Each subject has been won by love to willing service in the kingdom of love. God is king of this spiritual kingdom, this kingdom of love, because he is the supreme Spirit, the supreme Love, the source and fountain of all true love.

Christ reigns with the Father because, by his wonderful manifestation of love, he has won the hearts of all God's true subjects, so that he has been given a name with God high above every other name that is named in earth or heaven, so "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, * * * and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father." Ultimately this spiritual kingdom will include the whole universe, and every morally accountable being that shall remain in the universe, for, "Every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, 'Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power unto him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever.'"

## CHRIST'S CHOICE.

There is no forced service here. All is free and spontaneous. In the perfected kingdom, every heart forever more will be bound by the invisible cords of love to the everlasting throne of him who "is love."

Every Christian is in the world now, to represent by his words and his life this kingdom of love. He should therefore repudiate as does the Lord, all forced or compulsory service, and seek that service which cometh from the heart only.

The true church of Christ is the one divinely appointed organic representation on earth of this spiritual kingdom. It is to stand, therefore, solely, and only, for the reign of love. It is thus to be a manifestation of the only power that can control the heart, and so actuate the life from within in harmony with the law of love. The church that seeks to bring to its aid any other power than the power of love, repudiates itself as the church of Christ, and abdicates the spiritual throne of that glorious kingdom for the blood-stained thrones of earth.

In all ages, opposed to this spiritual kingdom of love, is the beast power, the kingdom of brute force and of political intrigue, the kingdom whose motto is, "Might makes right," the kingdom that is maintained only by force of arms, and whose subjects are held by deception and fear. This kingdom originated in heaven when Satan said, "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God." This kingdom, in heaven, drew to it one-third of the heavenly host. How long the conflict raged there we know not. We do know that love and truth were finally triumphant there, and force and falsehood and hatred were driven out.

Then Satan came to earth, and taking advantage of man's free will, he deceived him, and led him astray, and so established his kingdom here. Since then there are two kingdoms on this earth, the kingdom of love and truth, and the kingdom of hatred, deception and force, the kingdom of light, and the kingdom of darkness. As no two kingdoms can exist peacefully in the same territory at the same time, so here there is ever war and unceasing conflict between the two.

This conflict enters every human life. Because of the sins of our ancestors, tendency to which we have inherited, we have in us from infancy elements of the kingdom of darkness. There are also in us elements of the kingdom of light, for Christ "is the light that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world." The conflict is between these two. The question is whether the spirit shall rule, or the beast; whether love shall be triumphant in that life, casting out all hatred, intrigue, and force, or whether the beast shall rule, and love be cast out, and the final motto of that life be that might makes right. Bound and hampered as we are from birth by the law of an evil heredity and an evil environment, or by what Paul calls the law of sin and death in our members, unless we flee from the weakness of the flesh, and seek aid from the divine power, the beast will surely win in us, and the spirit be cast out. But thank God, "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, makes us free from the law of sin and death." When we resign ourselves to the Higher Power, we are "born from above," "born of God," "born of the spirit," born of love. Love thus is enthroned supreme within, and we are acknowledged members of the spiritual kingdom. Jesus said, "Except a man be born from above, born of the spirit, he can not see, he can not enter the kingdom of God." By this birth, love becomes supreme, the beast power, the flesh is cast out and crucified until Christ, or love, becomes all and in all.

## CALLED TO FACE THE QUESTION.

Every man must make his choice. Jesus made his choice. Satan offered him all the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them if he would fall down and worship him. This was no idle imagination. Once the people tried to take him by force and make him king, but he eluded them and went his way. The political circumstances of the times were such that if Jesus would have but been untrue to the principles of the divine kingdom, if he would have but yielded himself to this world's methods and plans, the methods and plans of force, in other words, if he would only worship Satan the beast power, instead of God the love power, he might have been king of this world. In this temptation, Satan simply made this fact plain to him. Jesus stood at the parting of the ways. On the one hand was the way of sacrifice and suffering and crucifixion in this world, with an eternal crown beyond in the spiritual kingdom of love. On the other hand was the way of earthly ambition, honor, and glory; the way of an earthly crown which however great, could be but temporal, since faith saw in the great future, all kingdom and dominion given to love. Jesus chose the way of the cross, and went about preaching the kingdom of sacrifice and love. It was the choice between the beast and the spirit. Every man, we repeat, has to make the same choice, and how many choose wrong.

Not only does every individual have to make this choice, but the organic church has to make this choice in every age, and often has she chosen wrong. Paganism originated in this way. The external church, the visible, humanly organized church, made its choice, and chose wrong. Paganism is the religion of deception and force, it is the religion that dethrones the divine and exalts the human, or, in other words, that worships the beast. Its appeal is to the sensuous, the lustful, the brutal nature. In every land, its chief characteristic was sun worship with its indescribable carnival of lust, and in all these lands its chief festival and its designating mark was the sun-festival, or the sunday. From all this iniquity of the visible church, God's true children had to individually separate themselves and come out. It was here than God's spirit, the spirit of love, led Abraham out, and made him the father of the faithful.

The church in the fourth century of this era had to make the same momentous decision, and, sad to relate, here too the visible, the humanly organized church, chose wrong. Before her, as before Jesus, were two ways. If she held high the standard of Christ, and remained true to the law of his kingdom which is the rule of love only, she saw before her in this world only sacrifice and service and persecution. She must, as the Lord said, take up her cross and deny herself daily and follow him. By doing this she would truly represent on earth the kingdom of love, and have as her reward a part in that eternal kingdom when it is fully set up. On the other hand, if she lowered the standard to suit the pagans around her, if she deserted the heavenly principle of the divine kingdom, the principle of love only, and stooped to intrigue, and to use force as a worldly power, she saw before her worldly honor, and power, and the throne of earthly empire. The temptation was too great. She lowered the standard. As Gavazzi says, "A pagan flood, flowing into the church, carried with it its customs, practices, and idols." By reason of this transgression, a host was given him against the true worship, which is ever a "daily sacrifice." The beast power triumphed, and the visible church was transformed from the kingdom of love ruling the heart by loving service, to a kingdom of force compelling mankind, and kinging and unkinging men at pleasure. This exaltation of the church, however, was its disgrace. "For whosoever exalteth himself, shall be abased, and who so humbleth himself shall be exalted." Again the true church had to individually come out, and to flee into the wilderness and into the fastnesses of the mountains, where "the earth helped the woman," and where the pure gospel was maintained in spite of the power of the papacy. When thus transformed, the Bible calls the ecclesiastical power of the papal church "the beast," and by the symbol used it shows its unity with the beast power through all the ages. How well she deserved this title, the historian Draper well shows when he calls her "the greatest incarnation of brute force the world has ever seen."

## GOD SEEKS ONLY HEART SERVICE.

The churches of the Reformation are to-day being called upon to face this same great question, Shall it be love? or force? the spirit? or the beast? Shall it be the way of the cross? or the way of an earthly crown? And with grief of heart, here too must we relate that the visible church is choosing wrong. She is forgetting that the true power of the church is the power of love only. She is forgetting that her Lord denied to her the sword of earthly dominion. She is forgetting that the way he taught was the way he trod, the way of cross bearing service, and that he distinctly said, "Except ye take up your cross, and deny yourself daily, and follow me, ye can not be my disciple."

The church to-day is dreaming the same old dream of earthly empire. She says she has found "that whatever she asks Congress for unitedly she can have," and "she hopes to see the day when the great churches of the country will come together and harmoniously issue their edicts, and the legislatures will respect them, and enact them into laws." This is again the triumph of the beast over the spirit. The same scripture that calls the papacy the "beast," calls this the "image to the beast." It is the same beast power. Truly saith the Scripture, "All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life." It is ever either the spirit or the beast, one or the other must be triumphant.

As the visible church takes this stand to-day, as ever before, the true children of God must individually come out, and be separate. The solemn message goes to every nation, kindred, and tongue, "Saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation." "Come out of here, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." The people who heard this warning, and came out, are thus described. "Here is the patience of the saints, here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." They are next presented before the throne of God, having the harps and palms of victory over the beast, and over his image, and singing the triumphant song of Moses and of the Lamb. Than this, no message can be more solemn, and this is the message for the people of to-day. This is the message we bring to you. Let love be triumphant in the life and in the church. Repudiate force, refuse to worship the beast, so only shall you reign in the kingdom of love.
