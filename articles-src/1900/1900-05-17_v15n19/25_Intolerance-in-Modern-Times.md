The article on another page, "An Anti-Protestant Crusade in France," is significant as showing that, notwithstanding the boasted enlightenment and consequent liberality of the times in which we live, human nature is swayed by the same passions as in the days of Torquamada, Duke of Alva, Duke of Guise, Catherine de Medici and others whose names are synonymous with persecution. Tolerance, like beauty, is only skin deep. Given the power and opportunity men would persecute as bitterly to-day as they did when the auto da fe lighted up the landscape in Castile and the Netherlands.

Nor is all intolerance bound up in the hearts of French Roman Catholics. We must not forget that no longer ago than last December, a respectable Boston clergyman speaking in a National Reform convention in New York City invoked the death penalty upon those who refuse to keep Sunday; and only a few days since a Seventh-day Adventist in the State of Pennsylvania was haled before a justice of the peace and fined $4 and costs for raking in his own door yard on Sunday, being accused by one who spied upon him for that purpose. Times change, but only the grace of God can change the human heart, taking out of it the spirit of Cain and putting into it the spirit of love.
