"With Prosperity, Why Strikes?" is the heading of an article in a prominent religious paper. "The year 1900, whose name is a synonym for general prosperity, is having labor strikes by the dozen," says the journal referred to. "The New England granite-cutters, the machinists, 60,000 employes of Chicago building contractors, the grain shovelers, coal miners, and street railway men, inaugurated strikes early in the year. The New York Central Railroad has a strike on hand, which threatens to spread to other roads. May Day brought news of strikes from all over the country—strikes of carpenters, plumbers, brewery engineers, telegraphers."

This is not overdrawn. The outlook is certainly ominous. Nor does it help matters to say that "times are prosperous" and that "the reasons for these strikes must be looked for above the stomach," as does the paper from which we quote.

It may be true as stated by a prominent professor in the Boston University, after making a careful study of the subject, that "enough food is wasted in Boston to feed the whole of Greece. Probably the workingmen of Europe might almost be fed on what American workingmen waste," and that "the poorer classes of foreign laborers that come here do at first live on what the American laborer would despise to eat." But the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of laboring people are dissatisfied. If indeed it be true that no adequate cause for this discontent exists, then it is all the more ominous, since all the more difficult, if not impossible, to apply a remedy. It is to be suspected, however, that the assumed "general prosperity" spoken of is felt more by certain classes than by the masses of the people.
