Some remark has been occasioned by the surprise expressed by Parisian journals at the resolution of the students of Princeton and the United States Athletic Association not to participate in the athletic contests at the Exposition if the sports should be held on Sundays. President McKinley's reported instructions to Commissioner Peck to close the American exhibit are also said to be "making America and the Americans appear ridiculous in French and continental eyes." To this a secular paper retorts: "Quite likely. Americans, however, will not lose any sleep over the fact. This country is able to make its will respected in matters that concern itself and has not yet adopted the easy Parisian and Continental ideas as to Sunday observance. In matters of conscience and religion the United States refuses to accept as its standard the ideas of a nation whose president, as in the case of the late M. Faure, thinks it consistent with his dignity and with the due observance of religion to go hunting on Sunday."

It is probable that Europeans will not be able to see much difference between actually going hunting on Sunday and starting on fishing tours and other pleasure excursions, as at least one of the presidents of the United States did several times not very many years ago. However, this he had a perfect right to do so far as any moral principle is concerned, since, "where there is no law there is no transgression;" and there is certainly no divine law against either fishing or hunting on Sunday any more than on any other day.

The trouble in the whole question is in not leaving the matter of Sunday observance to the individual conscience. The people of France know very well that the divine Sabbath law is not the standard of Sunday keeping in the United States. They also know that from the standpoint of that law neither the United States nor any American state is consistent in its Sunday keeping or in the Sunday keeping that it requires of individuals, since all such laws permit many things on Sunday that the divine law forbids on the Sabbath; and it requires more wisdom than the average Parisian seems to possess to understand why, if one is going to depart from the fourth commandment at all, he may not as well depart from it wholly as in part.

We think, however, that the facts are not correctly stated. It is not so much the refusal of the students to participate in the French games on Sunday that excites European derision as it is the effort of Americans to appear more pious than they really are.
