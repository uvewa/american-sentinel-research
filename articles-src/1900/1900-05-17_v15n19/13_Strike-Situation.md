At the time of closing the columns of this paper the strike situation not only in this city but generally remained practically unchanged from last week.

Street car lines are tied up in St. Louis. Several people have been hurt and one woman was struck upon the head by a brickbat and killed. It is true that this was not done intentionally, for the woman was in no way connected with the strike and was carrying an infant in her arms when struck, but the incident shows the intense feeling there is and to what desperate lengths the strikers are willing to go to carry their point.

In Kansas City a blanket injunction has been issued by United States District Judge William C. Hook enjoining not only the strikers but a large number of labor leaders from interfering in any way with the running of the cars. The injunction is predicated upon the fact that several of the persons complained against as threatening the interests of the company are residents of other states, and the further fact that the strikers threaten to prevent the company from carrying out its contract with the United States government to transport the city mail carriers to and from their routes. The injunction is made absolute for a week, the matter being set for a hearing on the 19th inst.
