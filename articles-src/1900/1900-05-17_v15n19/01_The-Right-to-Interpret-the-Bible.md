The Sentinel of Liberty contends for the right of every person to be independent of all other persons in deciding what are the duties required of him by religion, and in conforming his actions to his own convictions of right.

Why—it may be asked—does the Sentinel think it necessary to contend for this right? Who in this free land disputes this right? Who is denied the privilege of deciding for himself what constitutes duty toward God, and of practicing his convictions of duty in his daily life?

It may be surprising to the reader to be told that not merely one person, or a few individuals, but many thousands of people—indeed, the whole minority in the government, are denied this privilege by the scheme of government advocated by the National Reform Association and its allies; but such is the fact. That scheme has not yet been set in operation in this country, but it is one for which millions of earnest people are actively working, and whose ultimate success is not doubtful if its present rate of progress continues.

Just what it is that we are talking about will be made clear to the reader by reference to a hearing given the advocates of the National Reform scheme before a committee of Congress in March, 1896. The hearing related to a bill then before Congress providing for an amendment to the constitution which would make it "recognize God." The preamble was to be so amended as to read: "We, the people of the United States (acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and his revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs), in order to form a more perfect union," etc. The "revealed will of God" being given in the Bible, the discussion at the hearing turned upon the interpretation of the Bible, and this question was asked with reference to the religious duty of Sabbath observance:

Mr. Burton. "Is not this the theory: Each man regards the day he believes to be the Sabbath, and the Government protects him in his worship from disturbance or interference?"

The reply, given by Dr. David McAllister, the leading champion of the proposed amendment, was:

"Not only must this be the case in regard to every man, but the state and nation must decide for themselves whether they will keep one day or not."

Then followed this question and answer:

Mr. Connolly. "Suppose the Bible has already settled that question, how could any act of Congress interfere with it if that is to be in the constitution?"

Dr. McAllister. "Because we must interpret the Bible."

Putting Dr. McAllister's replies together, we have the essence of the National Reform theory of government which millions of misguided people in this land are working to set up. While "each man" is to "regard the day he believes to be the Sabbath," "the state and the nation" must also "decide for themselves whether they will keep one day or not," and to do this the state "must interpret the Bible." But when the state interprets the Bible to discover its supposed duty upon any point, what is to become of the interpretation held on the same point by the individual subject to the state law? Upon this point Dr. McAllister said:

"Here is the nation, which gives its decision according to its sense of right and wrong. That is the national conscience, and when the nation thus gives its decision, individuals whose conscientious views may conflict . . . in such cases the individual conscience must yield to the conscience of the whole people, which is over him and should be over him in order to enforce what is right, but which can be over him only by recognizing the Lord's supreme authority over the nation."

Thus, in case the individual holds a different interpretation of Scripture from that held by the state, the individual conscience must yield to the state conscience, and the individual must practice that which he believes to be wrong; or if he refuses this, he must suffer the pains and penalties of the civil law.

The "state conscience" upon any point will of course be the conscience of the majority in the state touching that point. The minority will constitute dissenters, and all these must yield their conscientious convictions upon any point of duty toward God, as they yield in the matter of imposing a tariff upon imports, or other purely secular questions of state policy.

And if the individual conscience must yield to the state conscience upon one point, it may just as properly be made to yield upon every point, and can be dispensed with altogether, the individual being guided by the state conscience which "is over him," and is of so much greater authority, in the National Reform view, than the individual conscience can be. The individual would then need to exercise his conscience only when he became identified with the majority who were laying down rules and enacting laws of religious conduct for the benefit of the minority.

Such is the scheme of government which, as stated, the National Reform party and its allies are urging upon Congress and upon the country, as they have been for many years. It is easily perceived to be identical with the union of church and state which has "cursed the fairest portions of the Old World," and against which the first American statesmen took special care to guard this nation.

Many will be naturally skeptical as to the probability of the success of this baneful scheme. Why—it may be asked—should millions of intelligent people be working for something so contrary to the foundation principles of this Government? The answer is, they are doing it unwittingly. They are blindly following their leaders in a course which appears to be righteous, and they do not realize the nature of the results that will follow. They do not realize this because they have not taken time to study the subject of the relation of their work to the principles of free government. They do not believe it possible that their leaders can be in the wrong, so they have never thought of considering the nature of their work from the standpoint of such a possibility.

But the people of this great country—the many millions who are not concerned in the promotion of religio-political reforms—will not they rise up and prevent this National Reform scheme being carried into effect? Ah, the people are indifferent on the subject of their religious rights. Believing such rights secure in this free land, they are careless and unconcerned, and are in ignorance of the danger that is threatening. As Jefferson prophesied, they are all too intent upon projects for making money to have any time to give to the securing of their rights. Upon both sides the people are under the bane of ignorance and must be enlightened and aroused to discern the situation in which the rights and liberties of the people are now placed, if those liberties are to be longer preserved. This is a mighty fact, and the reason why the Sentinel of Liberty is published to-day.
