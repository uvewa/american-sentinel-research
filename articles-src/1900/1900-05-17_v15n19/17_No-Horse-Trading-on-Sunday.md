Justice Dooley, of this city, took occasion on the 7th inst., to express his opinion of alleged violators of the "Sabbath" recognized by the laws of this State and municipality. Two weeks before a number of men were severely reprimanded by his honor for selling and trading horses on Sunday close to a church.

Abe Schaefer, 465 14th street, fell into the hands of Detectives Hagerman and King while trying to dispose of a horse May 6.

When Schaefer was arraigned Justice Dooley said: "It is a shame that worshipers cannot pass through the streets on their way to church without encountering these men who persist in carrying on their business in the public streets on Sunday."

The magistrate then spoke severely to the prisoner and remarked that he ought to be fined $25 as a lesson to both himself and others. He did impose a fine of $10, but allowed the prisoner to go on payment of costs.

The justice certainly acted discreetly, since the imposition of a fine would very likely have resulted in an appeal, or commitment and *habeas corpus* proceedings, and in the end his honor might have been compelled even to pay the costs. This was the result in the barber cases some years ago. In fact, that contest left only enough of the Sunday law to enable "detectives" who are anxious to find somebody not under "police protection" whom they can arrest, to make trouble either for those who do not know their rights or are not able to go into court to defend them.
