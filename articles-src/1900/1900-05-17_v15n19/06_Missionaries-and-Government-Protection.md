In the Chicago Tribune of April 6 the president of Michigan University, James B. Angell, argues that governments ought to protect by force their citizens who go as missionaries to foreign lands, but says it is agreed "that we should not make war upon any nation for the sake of carrying Christianity into it." But as missionaries go to a foreign land for the sole purpose of carrying Christianity into it, and the government under which they are citizens exercises its force to protect them in propagating that work, what else does the government do in effect but make war with a country for the sake of Christianity, when it becomes necessary to protect the missionaries by force of arms?

The only way out of the dilemma is for Christian missionaries to prosecute their work as citizens not of the civil powers of earth, but of the kingdom of heaven, looking for protection only to that government for whose extension they are laboring.
