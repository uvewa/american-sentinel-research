The editor of the Chicago Israelite, being importuned by a subscriber to say something in the way of encouraging Hebrews to remain loyal to the ancient Sabbath, responds thus:

"I most respectfully decline to again enter upon a discussion of the Sunday-Sabbath question—if it is a live question. As long as only one congregation in the country has transferred its day of rest and worship from the seventh to the first day of the week, and has not succeeded after a great many years of active propaganda in securing even one single, solitary other congregation to follow its example, I see no reason to regard the matter as in any way an imminent one. If, after the passing of almost two decades, the innovation has made no headway, I see no reason which should make consistent Jews regard the movement as dangerous or important. Not only has it made no progress, but it has even lost some of its original advocates, one of whom, Dr. Kohler, a former occupant of Temple Sinai's pulpit, is as strong an opponent today as he was in former years a propagator of the Sunday-Sabbath idea. The topic is one which has been most thoroughly debated, and as the practical outcome of the proposition has thus far been nil, it is scarcely worth while to discuss it—unless as a question for the young folk to debate in their literary clubs to give them a zest for the supper and dancing to follow. I promise my correspondent that as soon as there are any other congregations of consequence to follow in the footsteps of Sinai I will blow a loud and long blast upon my bugle horn and summon to the aid of the imperiled Sabbath a host of staunch defenders."

We have heard much from time to time of the Jews abandoning the Sabbath of the fathers for the Sunday of their Gentile neighbors, but it seems that this movement is not nearly so general as some have supposed. It is true that, yielding to the demands of "business," very many Jews disregard the Sabbath altogether, but that many of them have adopted Sunday as their day of rest does not seem to be sustained by facts.
