The "Literary Digest" of the 12th inst. has an article under the foregoing heading that contains much food for thought.

Reference is made in the "Digest" to an article by a Unitarian clergyman in "The North American Review" for April, in which the statement is made that "the essential features of the orthodox theory of religion have been discredited by the modern knowledge of the modern world."

This clergyman's conception of that which is to take the place of the discredited religion, namely of Christianity as generally understood (that is of faith in the atonement of Christ and in his power to save from sin), is "a perfect kingdom of God," which he says "becomes a perfectly reasonable dream."

But herein lies a great danger. The power of God is the only power that can subdue or even hold in check the evil passions of men. But this power can be received only by faith. "Without faith it is impossible to please Him." Hence to destroy faith is to cut men off from all hope of receiving the power of God to subdue their evil hearts.

But what is even the highest civilization, the highest culture, without God? It is described in the first chapter of Paul's letter to the Romans: "When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their own imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to fourfooted beasts, and to creeping things."

This was the wisdom of Greece and Rome, and without faith in God it must be the wisdom of the twentieth century. Then when faith in God has perished, and by human wisdom "a perfect kingdom of God" has been established, not indeed of the God of the Bible, but of the imaginary being that human wisdom will have substituted for the Creator as he has revealed himself in nature and in the Scriptures, refusal to accept this "perfect kingdom" will be treason to the state. And so as in Rome "enlightened liberalism" will persecute for opinion's sake the "narrow-minded" minority who, by adherence to "antequated ideas, hinder the progress of the whole people."

Even now the education of the schools tends to undermine genuine faith in the God of the Bible; but this education is in some instances forced upon everybody. This will be so more and more; it will be held to be essential to the salvation of the state; and those who oppose this false system will be regarded as enemies of the state. We do not half realize the dangers that are thickening around us. Much that is called liberality is only the worse tyranny. There is no real liberty outside the gospel of Jesus Christ, and this is the very thing that is assailed by those who attack the credibility of the Scriptures, who sneer at faith, and who by human wisdom and human legislation would establish "a perfect kingdom of God."
