If the state would let conscience alone, it must let religion alone also.

The conscience that is educated by the laws and customs of men, will fail to pass examination at the bar of God.

Let men beware how they lay hold upon conscience, for it is a "live wire," directly connected with the dynamo of the Omnipotent will.

The importance of the Sabbath as an institution of God for the welfare of mankind constitutes the chief reason why the state should not meddle with that institution in any way.

The Creator made the Sabbath a day of refreshment—of renewing of life; but state Sabbath legislation, with its restrictions upon labor and recreation, tends to make the day altogether lifeless.

The Sabbath institution bears the image and superscription of God, and when the state by assuming the right to legislate upon it, makes the institution its property and puts upon it the stamp of Caesar, the result is the defacement of God's image and an institution valueless to both God and man.
