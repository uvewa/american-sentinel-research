The Converted Catholic (New York) publishes in its May issue a picture showing Cardinal Gibbons posing at the Dewey celebration in Washington last fall. It was designed by a Roman Catholic, and shows the Cardinal standing between Admiral Dewey and President McKinley, the latter facing the Cardinal with bowed head. The Converted Catholic says of it: "An enterprising Roman Catholic had this picture engraved and at great cost had offered it for sale to the Catholics; but the poor man is now bankrupt, for not a Catholic family would dare to possess a copy of it after Mrs. Dewey had formally declared herself a Protestant."
