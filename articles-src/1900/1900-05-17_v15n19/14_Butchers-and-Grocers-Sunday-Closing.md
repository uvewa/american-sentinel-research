At a recent meeting of the Butchers and Grocers' association in this city, held to consider the question of Sunday closing, it was declared as the unanimous sentiment of those present that the present system of voluntary closing is highly satisfactory in its working, and causes no loss in business to those who practice it. If this is so, as we have no reason to doubt, it shows that there is no necessity for bringing everybody under the compulsion of a Sunday law in order to provide Sunday closing for storekeepers who do not want to keep open on that day.

Another meeting is to be held June 5 for the purpose of enlisting all the merchants on the South Side in the Sunday closing movement.
