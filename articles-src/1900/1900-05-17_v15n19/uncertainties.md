# Uncertainties Log for Volume 15, Number 19 (May 17, 1900)

## Note on Volume/Issue Number Discrepancy

**Location:** Page 1, masthead

**Issue:** The OCR source shows "VOLUME 15. CHICAGO, MAY 17, 1900. NUMBER 18." but the filename indicates this is v15n19.

**Decision:** Used issue number 19 in all YAML frontmatter to match the filename convention (v15n19), assuming the printed "NUMBER 18" was a typographical error in the original publication.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Reason:** Filename convention appears consistent with other issues in the series; publication error in original masthead is plausible.
