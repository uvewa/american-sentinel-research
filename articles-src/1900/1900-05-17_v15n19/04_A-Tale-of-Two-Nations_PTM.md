### "THE COMMONWEALTH OF ISRAEL."

If man had never fallen and become sinful, there never would have been such a thing as civil government in the earth. Even after the human family had lost their first estate, if every soul had earnestly sought God for the "renewing" of His Spirit, there never would have been any necessity for civil government.

But man did fall. Moreover, he was so perverse after he had fallen that he did not seek God for a new heart, and of course the result of this was that he grew worse and worse by nature. Then and only then out of heavenly goodness to man did God permit that institution among men which we call civil government.

In the very early days among the people of God the head of each house ruled that house. Thus it was written of Abraham: "I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment." This status of affairs continued until Israel went into Egyptian bondage. When the days of their captivity were at an end God raised up a man—Moses—to lead them forth.

In all of his dealings with the children of Israel, from the time of the exodus onward, God never for a moment violated the "consent of the governed" principle. At no time did He act in an arbitrary way, or manifest to the smallest degree, monarchical—one-man power—principles. All of this is made abundantly clear by the commission which God gave to Moses and the acceptance by Israel of Moses and the heavenly propositions of freedom of which he was the bearer.

"And God said moreover unto Moses, * * * Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them," etc. "And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, * * * and the people believed."

Here was a free, a voluntary acceptance of Moses and his mission by the people of Israel. The thing was in no wise forced upon them. A meeting was called, and the people not only concurred in the plan, but they "believed" it. Moreover God never at any time led Israel a single step save only as the people "believed."

God never led any man in Israel a single step save only as that man "believed"—had confidence in, and gave his consent to that step and the taking of it by him.

Once more, as the climax thought on this point, it may be said: God never asks and never has asked a soul to do a thing of any kind or name or nature, until that soul manifests faith in that thing and the doing of it by him. But faith is the highest, the most perfect and complete kind of consent.

After the death of Moses, Joshua became the leader of the people and nation of Israel. In his leadership under God all had faith; for of their own free will they said unto him: "All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. According as we harkened unto Moses in all things, so will we harken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses." This last provision was the only constitutional limitation, as it were, imposed on Joshua. He must see to it that his life was such that God could go with him.

After the death of Joshua the Lord raised up judges to judge the Hebrew nation. On whomsoever the Spirit of the Lord rested, on the man or woman upon whom the gift of leadership and judgment came—that one did the people of Israel obey as judge over them. To this class of rulers belong Deborah, the prophetess, and Barak and Gideon. The form of choosing these officers, and the operation of such a plan of government, was so simple, and worked so smoothly, that, whether we understand all its modes and workings, it is bound to command our admiration and respect.

Such was the form of civil government prevalent in the nation of Israel until the days of Samuel. In this government the "consent of the governed" was the great basic principle. It was a government among men of God's own ordering. As long as the people abided by God's principles of government for them, they had his promise that they should be a great nation. More than this, they had the promise of the Almighty that other nations should acknowledge their greatness as a nation. Thus it is written in Deut., 4:5-8: "Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"

This was a wonderful promise. It was a blessed heritage. It was the legitimate fruit of permitting God's own plan of government to work among them. It was a glorious goal for the once despised people, and the path leading to it was a happy and an easy one.

There was also another great principle which God laid down for Israel, and upon the observance of which their happiness and welfare as a nation largely depended. In the prophecy of Balaam it is said of Israel: "From the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations."

The people of Israel were to dwell alone. They were to avoid "entangling alliances" with other peoples. To hold themselves in this condition was essential to their glory and their greatness; while all the nations would call them great if they held to the principles which God had given them; yet they were not to be reckoned among the nations. In other words, Israel was to be a power among the nations; but not a nation among the powers.

This separation was necessary. God did not ask Israel to stand alone because he wished to exercise arbitrary authority or because he wanted to impose hard regulations upon her. In his great wisdom he knew that it would be impossible for her to preserve the simplicity and righteousness of her institutions and at the same time become one among the powers of earth.

Such was the "Commonwealth of Israel." Well would it have been for that nation had they never departed from it and entered upon the sad, though well-trodden, path of Imperialism.
