Lord Salisbury's view of the saloon Sunday law was expressed recently in a speech made before the Church of England bishops. On this point the British premier said:

"I have some sympathy with people who want beer on Sunday. I don't drink beer myself, but if I did I should want it as much on Sunday as on any other day."

Certainly any man who drinks intoxicants wants them as much on Sunday as on other days, and it is both useless and unreasonable to allow people to drink freely six days in the week and then try to shut them off from indulgence on the remaining day. There is always some inconsistency in a Sunday law.
