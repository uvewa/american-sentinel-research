All human rights are God-given, and hence sacred. Every faculty and opportunity that any man has was given to him by the Creator to be used to His glory; and he who infringes a single one of these rights—who hinders the free, legitimate exercise of a single God-given faculty—invades not only the civil liberty, but the religious liberty of his fellow men.

The rule of the Christian life is, "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." He who obeys this divine rule is serving God equally whether following his plow or going to church.

All his time and powers belong to the Lord. They are talents entrusted to him to use for God.

It is manifest that to the man who believes this and who lives it, every act is in a sense religious. Such a man will gladly do whatever is his duty toward his neighbor and toward society—do it not with eye-service, as a man-pleaser, but as "serving the Lord Christ." To require of him more than this, or to forbid him to do this, is to infringe his rights of conscience; for his every act springs from conscientious conviction of duty. If he prays, it is of God; if he labors with his hands, he does it as the Lord's servant.

Therefore, viewed from the standpoint of the Christian, all natural rights are religious rights, and all liberty is religious liberty. To forbid to any man that which God permits, is to restrict the liberty of God's servant; while to exact from him more than justice demands, either in time or money, is to take from him a portion of his Lord's entrusted goods. Thus any unjust law is violative of religious liberty, which is simply liberty to live the Christian life in all every-day affairs. This liberty has been provided by the Creator for every man, and belongs to every man, whether he ever claims it or not; and no power on earth has any right to restrict this liberty in any way. B.
