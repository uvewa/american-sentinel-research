"The Michigan Christian Advocate" seems to think that the United States ought to compel Turkey by force of arms to pay the "indemnity for missionary losses." The "Advocate" says:

"One thing is pretty certain, if no pressure is brought to bear upon Turkey, the indemnity will not be paid very soon. His policy is to procrastinate, and nothing but a show of force will bring him to terms. It is not the amount of the indemnity claimed, and which the porte has promised to pay, that is so important. If that were all, no one would advise war for a mere $90,000. But it is the principle involved. If Turkey is not brought to time now, there will be no security for American missionaries in Turkey hereafter."

The slang expression "brought to time" is quite in keeping with the spirit that would invoke force in the interests of the gospel of the Prince of Peace. Better a thousand times that every bit of mission property in Turkey should be destroyed, and every missionary be expelled from the country than that this or any other so-called Christian nation should declare war to secure the interests of Christian missions. The gospel commission is still in force, as is likewise the promise of the One who gave it; and if those who minister in his name would only rely more upon his power and less on earthly powers, Christianity would not be so misunderstood as it is in Mohammedan and pagan lands to-day. Much of the trouble that missionaries have in foreign lands is because they will not let political affairs alone.
