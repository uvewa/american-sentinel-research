The national constitution prohibits Congress from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." But as the doctrine prevails that the constitution does not apply outside the United States, there is manifestly nothing to prevent Congress from establishing a religion in foreign territory under American control; for instance, in the Philippine islands. And the religious question being the leading, burning issue in those islands, which is pressing upon the governing power for settlement, it is quite possible that Congress, not feeling hampered by constitutional restrictions in legislating for that country, may establish some form of religion there by force as the easiest way to bring the controversy to an end. Certainly Congress is at liberty, under the prevailing view, to establish a religion in any portion of the new territory; but do the American people want Congress to become familiar with the practice of setting up state religions? Will they feel entirely safe under such circumstances with regard to religious freedom here at home?
