Several months ago nearly all the grocery stores and butcher shops in this city arranged to close on Sunday, and for a time the agreement was very generally observed. Now, however, that warmer weather has come, some dealers are beginning to keep open as aforetime.

The Evening News, the newspaper champion of the Sunday-closing movement, in its issue of May 7, gives this account of the matter:

"Thinking that hot weather will afford an excuse for keeping their stores open on Sunday, one or two dealers in the northwest part of the city have removed the placards which for months have been displayed in their store windows. These announced that no more seven-day selling would be countenanced, and were hung up at a time when nearly every Chicago grocer and butcher was in a fervor of delight at the thought that at last they were to be permitted to rest every Sunday.

"A few signed the agreement under protest, but these included the retailers in whose places of business the clerks were in nearly all cases children or relatives of the proprietors. And now it is asserted by several of this class, that during the sultry summer days they intend to keep their stores open. As yet there has been but one violation of the agreement entered into with the clerks last winter. This is reported as having occurred with the opening of the butcher shop of Christopher Buehler, 246 Clark street. The announcement is made by officers of Washington Council, No. 17, of the Clerks' Association. A number of butchers, whose stores are in the vicinity of Buehler's, and who are opposed to an "open-door policy" on Sundays during the summer, as well as in cold weather, visited Buehler, when he first opened shop, and remonstrated with him. It is understood that no threats were made, but a peaceable effort to induce Buehler to stand firm met with failure. For fear that some of his competitors might do him injury, he visited the Chicago avenue police station yesterday afternoon and asked for police protection. Patrolman Clune was detailed on the matter, but there was no violence."

A subsequent issue of the News contains also the following:

"Grocers and marketmen in the vicinity of Ogden avenue and West 12th street assert that unless patrons are more consistent in their demands and in buying supplies Saturday night they will be compelled to start anew in Sunday selling. While they express a desire to keep their store doors locked at least one day during the week, they say that unless something is done they will have to annul the agreement they entered into with the Butchers and Grocers' Clerks Association last winter.

"The plea made by some of the customers is that during the half-holiday allowed on Saturday during the heated term they do not care to be bothered in the selection of eatables for the next day's dinner. They argue that it is their wish to spend the afternoon without any thought as to the morrow; their desire being more for going on jaunts than going for joints of beef."

All of which goes to show that it is a very hard matter to compel a whole people to keep Sunday if they don't want to keep it.
