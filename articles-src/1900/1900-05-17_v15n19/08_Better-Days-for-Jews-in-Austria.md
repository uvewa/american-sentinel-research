The following from the Chicago Israelite shows that toleration if not religious liberty is making some progress, at least so far as the Jews are concerned:

"At last there is a gleam of light shimmering through the darkness which envelops the Jews of Austria. The ministry has dared finally to speak a word in defense of the Jewish citizens of the country. It has declared that the blood accusation is untrue. This official declaration must do much towards quieting the agitation that the machinations of the anti-Semites have aroused. It was given by the Statthalter, Count Keilmansegg, in answer to an interpellation made by the deputy, Dr. Ofner, and was as follows: 'The so-called blood accusation, i. e., the accusation that the ritual murder of Christians is commanded or permitted by the regulations of the Jewish faith or by the Talmudical-rabbinical writings, has been declared to be without foundation by the most illustrious Christian scholars of the Roman Catholic church. The government regrets the spread of this accusation the more keenly since it cannot disregard the fact that it endangers the peace of the people.' He declared further that the government would take steps to punish all who were responsible for the charges brought against the Jews. This may be the beginning of better days for our coreligionists in the Austrian empire. May it prove so."

But while conditions are improving for the Jews even in popish Austria, Sabbath-keeping Christians are still fined and otherwise harried in "free America."
