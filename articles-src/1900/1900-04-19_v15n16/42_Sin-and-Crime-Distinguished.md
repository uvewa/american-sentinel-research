Sin is the transgression of the law of God; crime, the transgression of the law of man. But the law of God must be transgressed in thought and motive, of which the act is only the outward expression; while the law of man prohibits the outward act only. The sin is committed in the heart before there is any act of which the state can take cognizance as a crime. Hence the same thing cannot, strictly speaking, be both a sin and a crime; and the spheres of civil government and of religion do not cover common ground.
