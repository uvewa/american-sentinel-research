In an outline of the situation now existing in the Philippine islands, Mr. Frederick Palmer says in *Collier's Weekly*:—

"The sensation of the hour is the report that Archbishop Chapelle told the provincial of the Dominican brotherhood of friars that the friars were to be returned to their parishes and receive the same support from the Government as they had received under the Spaniards. A denial was immediately announced, but this did not allay the fears of the native population. Two days later they sent a delegation to Gen. Otis. It comprised most of the members of the supreme court, which we have re-established. (Every native member is opposed to the retention of the friars.) They asked what the intentions of the governor were regarding the frairs. He replied that the Filipino people were to enjoy the same religious liberties that the American people enjoyed under their constitution. Natives are also presenting petitions to the archbishop. They are all of the same tenor. They ask for the expulsion of the Spanish friars, and for either the establishing of a native priesthood or the assignment of American Catholic priests to the parishes. Throughout the islands at this time there are but few native priests to solemnize marriages, baptize children, bury the dead or hold church services. The natives are beyond question devout Catholics, as they understand Catholicism, and hate both Spanish friars and Protestantism. On the other hand, the number of Spanish friars in the islands was 3000. America has not 500 priests to spare. There are but few who know Spanish and none who understand the native dialects. They would labor under this disadvantage."

How much of this hatred of Protestantism is due to the fact, as the natives view it, that the army which has conquered them and scattered death and desolation through their country, represents Protestantism? This should be a serious question for Protestant missionaries. Undoubtedly the papal ecclesiastics there have advocated this widely, and by means of this seeming reproach upon Protestantism have greatly strengthened the papacy's hold upon the people, and correspondingly lessened the chances of Protestant missionaries for successful work. Is not this the view of the Philippine conquest that should have been taken by the Protestant churches. We believe it is.
