A radical change in the discipline of the Methodist Church is reported to be under contemplation by the representatives of this leading Protestant body. As stated in the *New York Press*, of April 11, it is as follows:—

"Dancing, card playing, theater parties and many other amusements heretofore under the ban of the Methodist Episcopal Church may be indulged in soon by the members of that church without breaking rules. Three State conferences in the East have asked the General Conference to permit these amusements, and there is said to be a widespread and general desire in other State conferences that the General Conference take this action. The State conferences that have taken this action are the New York, the New York East Conference, which embraces Connecticut, and one of the New Jersey conferences.

"At the New York Conference yesterday, on the motion of the Rev. E. S. Tipple, of St. James's Church, of this city, the following memorial to the general body was adopted:—

"That, Provided the committee on the constitution of the church shall decide that paragraph 24 of the Discipline is constitutional, the General Conference be memorialized to omit from paragraph 248 the incomplete catalogue of prohibited amusements and to substitute for the omitted clauses a paragraph in the chapter of "Special Advices" entitled "Christian Conduct." This chapter urges members not to follow any pleasures 'as cannot be used in the name of Jesus,' and 'that they avoid the very appearance of evil.' This would remove the specific injunctions against dancing, card playing, theaters and like amusements.

"In the New York East Conference the question was brought up by Prof. W. N. Rice, of Wesleyan. It was decided by a large majority vote to ask the General Conference to strike out the rule.

"One of the arguments that has been urged against the rule has been that it was practically a dead letter; that the young folk danced, attended theaters and card parties. In the New York East Conference yesterday the Rev. J. M. Buckley said the clause never should have been adopted.

"Should the General Conference act on the recommendation of the State conferences—and the general belief is that it will—the move will be the most radical made in the Methodist Episcopal Church in many years."

If the rule against indulgence in carnal amusements is practically a dead letter in the Methodist Church, it is because it has not been enforced; and if this is so, the bars against worldliness have already been let down and only the empty form of church discipline remains as regards these worldly pleasures. This will naturally tend to facilitate additions to the church from the world, but it was not by such means that the church of Wesley and Whitefield rose to its present position of power in the earth.
