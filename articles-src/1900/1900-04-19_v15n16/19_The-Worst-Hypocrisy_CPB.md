All hypocrisy is detestable, but that variety seems most hateful that under the guise of "Christian civilization," or "benevolent assimilation," enslaves less enlightened peoples in the interests of "chartered companies," gigantic trusts, or "protected infant industries."

The following from a Chicago paper is apropos:—

"The Philippine archipelago is not, it seems, the only locality where the natives stupidly and stubbornly refuse to recognize those 'blessings and privileges of enlightened Caucasian civilization,' which General Miles so eloquently described in June, 1898. The people of the Congo Free State are said to be somewhat discontented under the benign sway of the Congo company, which is controlled by that wise and virtuous prince, Leopold, king of the Belgians. The company, it seems, requires the natives to produce a certain quantity of rubber. If they fail to do so cannibal soldiers employed by the company are let loose upon them and pillage and massacre follow. This has led to some resistance, which is feelingly described by the company's officers as 'a rising of the natives against Christianity and civilization.' And, of course, the 'rising' will be put down if every native has to be killed in order to vindicate Christianity and civilization. There seems, however, to be one consideration which has been overlooked by Leopold and his philanthropic associates. If all the natives are killed where will the rubber come from? Wouldn't it be better to kill only half of them, say, pour encourager les autres—thus advancing Christianity and civilization and conserving the rubber interests at the same time?"

Talk about the wickedness of the antediluvian world; it is doubtful if its crimes were more Heaven-daring than those now perpetrated in the name of "Christian civilization." C. P. B.
