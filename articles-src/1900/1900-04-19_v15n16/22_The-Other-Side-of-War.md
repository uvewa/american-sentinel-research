London "Daily News."

There are infinitely touching scenes to be witnessed daily in Pall Mall, scenes which may well make one ask whether war as a cure is not worse than the ill it professes to alleviate. There are two bureaus for giving information concerning the dead and wounded. That for the officers is at the western end of the War Office in Pall Mall; that for the non-commissioned officers and privates is at Winchester House, St. James's Square. These two bureaus are beset all day long with inquirers, whose pained anxiety and keen emotion, only too apparent for the brave endeavors at concealment, are distressing to witness.

Type written foolscap sheets pinned to a frame on the wall give the grisly details of the dead and wounded. There is the list of the dead and then the list of the wounded—that is all. The throng, sometimes four or five deep, presses continually in front of these lists.

The War Office might do better than this, one would think, and give more facilities to anxious folk for scanning the returns of the killed and wounded. As things go, it happens at times that troubled, anxious people, fearing the loss of some dear one, have to wait for a longer period than their patience can bear before catching a sight of the returns. The type written letters might, without difficulty, be duplicated or quadruplicated, so as to relieve the pressure.

A tall, elegantly-dressed woman sweeps out into the corridor from the clerk's room. Her lips are twitching, her eyes dilated, her face as white as a sheet. She has just heard that her son, who was wounded in the Glencoe fight, is in a serious condition. "No amendment, madam," is the clerk's stereotyped reply to her inquiries. She goes her way through the lobby out into Pall Mall, a pathetic figure of sorrowing motherhood.

And here a sweet-faced girl comes timidly up the steps and takes her stand just where the crowd thins towards the end of the frame. Not for worlds would she betray emotion, but there is something touchingly suggestive in the keen intentness with which she searches the lists of wounded. The foremost of the throng instinctively make way for her as, unconscious of the interest her presence creates, she makes her way along the line eagerly scanning the grim lists. Then she goes with a quick step into the clerk's room, and you may see the flutter of a white handkerchief as she raises it to her eyes.

Here is a father come to learn the latest news of his boy, some young lieutenant, perhaps, wounded at Glencoe or Elands Laagte. The father is an old officer himself, and the orderlies on duty salute as he marches past them. He is away for five minutes, and when he returns from interviewing the clerks, his face is white and hard.

But it is not for him to show emotion. The Queen's service demands much sacrifices, and though his father's heart may bleed, no one shall read upon his face that he grudges the sacrifice of his son. And then, perhaps, like a soldier, he will reflect that it is all the fortune of war.

The scenes at Winchester House are far more poignant, because the actors in them give unrestrained expression to their emotions. Women are here from Aldershot, Hounslow, Woolwich; indeed, from all the camps within easy distance of London. They cry softly to themselves in the corridors, and will spend hours and hours about the building waiting for further news of the loved ones away in Africa. Those who know that the worst has happened go away with their sorrow, but the majority who have friends and relatives on the wounded list cannot be persuaded to leave. Incessant and persistent in their anxious inquiries, they nevertheless meet with the tenderest consideration at the hands of the clerical staff.

This is the reverse side of the medal of war, the aftermath. A common sorrow, a shared anxiety unites all classes. The general's wife, the colonel's lady stand side by side with the sergeant's "missus" and the wife not on the strength of the regiment before these dreaded lists. And you may see in Pall Mall many kindly womanly offices of condolence and pity discharged. Alike to those who have lost and to those who go as sympathetic spectators the scene is harrowing, at times even agonizing.
