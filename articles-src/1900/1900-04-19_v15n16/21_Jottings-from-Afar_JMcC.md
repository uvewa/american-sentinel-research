BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

In the province of Cordova, in this Republic (Argentina), there is a large clerical party, who are leaving no stone unturned to introduce quite a novel idea in the way of ecclesiastical worship. A short time ago the metropolitan of the Greek Church sanctioned a scheme, which will facilitate in a wonderful manner, the recurrence to divine worship, as practised in the Greek Church. The scheme is as follow: each train—from now on—will carry a chapel car, in which an altar will be erected, and the ceremonies of the Oriental Church gone through, in exactly the same routine as though transacted in a Greek Church. Those having charge of these services will be a friar, a priest, and a sacristan. Thus travelers are expected to avail themselves of these opportunities to "keep themselves religious" during the journey.

This idea has found great favor among the fanatical Catholics of Cordova, who are agitating the question quite vigorously, asking the provincial government to decree in favor of this "holy scheme," since the inhabitants of the city are more incredulous than ever before, and it is requisite to make an effort to bring them face to face with teachings of the mother church. A large subsidy is demanded by the ecclesiastical party to carry into execution this plan.

Some time ago the editor of the *Tribuna Libre*, in the city of Cordova, was taken prisoner by order of the bishop of Cordova. His crime was that week by week he wrote articles in his paper attacking the errors of the Catholic Church. The bishop, instead of controverting the heresy (as he termed it) of the journal in question, being all powerful in that ultramontane city, had the editor conveyed to the jail, where he is now, not being allowed communication with the outer world. The colonel of the regiment stationed in Cordova, influenced by the Catholic bishop, threatened with punishment any military officer who should introduce the *Tribuna Libre* into the barracks. Not content with this the bishop has sent out a pastoral letter, which he ordered to be read in all the churches, in which he warns every Catholic against buying, or advertising in, or helping to print, or even touching, this awful, heretical paper. He concludes by saying: "Such as will not give heed to our counsels and warnings, we excommunicate and curse."

These are the weapons which Rome is accustomed to use. She is well skilled in their use, since she has had 1,600 years of practise with them. She does not want to "waste" time in persuading a man by argument; no! she uses other arguments than those of reason,—the civil sword, coercion, excommunications, papal bulls, etc., etc. Rome has not changed, but she clothes herself with different raiment than that she wears in Spain, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and other fanatical lands when she appears before the British and American public; to them she poses as the defender of religious liberty, and the maintainer of equal rights. Let us not be deceived by her guile.

Since President Roca has come to power, the government has made concession after concession to the Catholic Church. The last move on the politico-religious chess-board is, the sanctioning by the government of the renewal of diplomatic relations with the papal see—the which were interrupted many years ago.

All arrangements have now been made; and soon the papal delegate, or internuncio, will have arrived upon the scene of his future intrigues.
