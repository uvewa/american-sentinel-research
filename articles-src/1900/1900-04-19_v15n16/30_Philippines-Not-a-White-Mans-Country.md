DR. M. L. HEFFLEFINGER, of Huntsville, Ala., who served as army surgeon in the Philippines, was wounded near Manila last November, and is now at home, bears this testimony regarding the conditions affecting the health of Americans in those islands:—

"I should like to advise all my old neighbor boys and friends in Texas against enlisting for service in the Philippines, and not to allow the allurements of a commission to induce them to enter the service in that country. I do not believe any of our men can endure that climate longer than two years, and feel certain that our entire army now there will have to be returned by that time, or bury the major portion of them there. It is not a white man's country, and Americans can never become successful citizens. This country has a poor conception of the true status of affairs over there."
