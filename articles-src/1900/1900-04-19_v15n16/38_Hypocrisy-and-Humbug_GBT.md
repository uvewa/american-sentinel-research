* The New York World, of April 5, 1900, speaks editorially of the Sunday closing of the Paris Exposition; and after touching upon America's obligations in the matter as a guest of the French nation, says:—

"There is much hypocrisy and humbug in Sabbatarianism at home. Let us not make of it our most conspicuous exhibit in Paris."

It is quite true that there is much "hypocrisy and humbug" in the matter of Sabbath observance, especially where Sunday laws are enforced. In fact all that a law enforcing Sabbath observance can do is to make hypocrites. The rest is in the Sabbath and not in the law, and no legal enactment can give this rest; therefore, no human law can make a man a Sabbath-keeper. And there is much "hypocrisy and humbug" in acting like a Sabbath keeper when you are not.
