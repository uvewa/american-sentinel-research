The following from an Australian religious journal tells more in regard to the spirit of the times than can be told by all the arguments of the people who proclaim that the world is nearing the millennium:—

"TWO PICTURES.

"A few days ago vast crowds thronged the streets of Adelaide to see our troops embark. The send-off was most enthusiastic. It was an intensely hot day, over 100 degrees in the shade. And yet for all that, thousands of men, women, and children stood for hours in our streets oblivious of heat and fatigue. Two days later—a Sunday—a very hot day likewise, a correspondent in one of the papers declares there were not 500 people in the churches, and he says in the largest and oldest church in Adelaide there were only four people. No doubt the stay-at-home folks of that day would say it was too hot to go to church, and deem this a sufficient reason."
