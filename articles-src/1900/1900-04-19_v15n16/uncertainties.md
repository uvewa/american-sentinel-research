# Uncertainties Log

## Volume 15, Number 16 (April 19, 1900)

### General Notes
- OCR source: Mistral OCR → Sonnet article splitting
- Image references (img-0.jpeg through img-4.jpeg) in original OCR were not transcribed as they appear to be page scans and advertisements
- Page headers and footers showing "AMERICAN SENTINEL" and page numbers were omitted as per instructions

### Specific Uncertainties

#### Article 35: "Settling the Etiquette of 'the Court'"
- **Line reference:** Final paragraph
- **Uncertain word:** "perullity"
- **Context:** "rather than rail against a thing so pitiful in its perullity"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Notes:** This appears to be an archaic or possibly misread word. The context suggests it may be "puerility" (childishness), but the OCR clearly shows "perullity." Preserved as appears in source.

### Author Identification Notes
- **H. F. Phelps (HFP)** - Article 15: Author initials appear at beginning as byline
- **C. P. Bollman (CPB)** - Article 19: Initials "C. P. B." at end
- **John McCarthy (JMcC)** - Article 21: Full byline at beginning
- **G. B. Thompson (GBT)** - Article 38: Full name and location at end

All other articles without explicit attribution were marked as "editorial" per the 1900 editorial structure (Alonzo T. Jones, editor).
