**Writing** of "Missions in South Africa," Rev. Charles S. Morris, Field Secretary of the African Baptist Industrial Mission Society, says in *The Examiner:*—

"Without the missionaries the condition of the natives would be worse by far than if the foot of civilized man had never touched South African soil. Civilization simply has no message for a savage but death and extermination, unless it is accompanied by, or better still, forerun by the gospel of Jesus Christ. The devil of heathenism, when not cast out by the Son of God, seems to get the seven evil spirits of civilized sin, and together they go back and re-enter the savage, and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Without the missionaries the natives, who here and there are becoming somewhat educated, who here and there wear civilized clothes, and thousands of whom worship the true God, would be wandering skin-clad, daubed in red paint; the women, as in all heathen countries, man's beast of burden and his toy; the men strutting from kraal to kraal, drinking Kafir beer, selling their daughters for so many cattle, or bargaining for other wives—all steeped in vice, degraded, superstitious, hopeless, reprobate."

And yet we hear it proclaimed everywhere that the only hope of the savage is "civilization," forced on him with bullets if necessary—which "has no message" for him "but death and extermination," and carries with it to him "the seven evil spirits of civilized sin."
