The long-standing question of Government appropriations for sectarian Indian schools came up unexpectedly in Congress for discussion April 7. It was precipitated by the following amendment offered by Senator Jones of Arkansas to the Indian appropriation bill which was then before the Senate:—

"That the secretary of the interior may make contracts with present contract schools for the education of Indian pupils during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, but shall only make such contracts at places where the Government has not provided facilities for all the children of school age residing thereat, and to an extent not exceeding the number of children in attendance at said contract schools at the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900."

A lively discussion ensued, which demonstrated the fact that the sentiment for continuing Government contracts with the sectarian schools is by no means dead in Congress notwithstanding the action taken by that body on the subject some years ago, which was thought then to have settled the question against such a policy. It is evident that Cardinal Gibbon's request that Congress reopen the whole question of appropriations for Catholic Indian schools, made some time ago, was not without a good foundation for hope of its favorable reception there.

The following is a press report of the discussion:—

"Mr. Thurston in charge of the bill, opposed the amendment, taking the position that the Government should pursue a policy of providing its own schools. He deprecated any reopening of the question which six years ago had been a subject of disturbance and serious discussion throughout the country. The matter, he thought, had been settled at that time by the adoption of a policy of reducing the appropriations for contract schools 20 per cent each year until the contract schools should have been abandoned entirely. He stated that the secretary of the interior had advised the committee that all Indian pupils could be provided for in the government schools. He deemed it the true policy of the Government to carry on Indian schools without reference to any religious sect.

"Mr. Jones made a strong appeal for the adoption of his amendment. He said it was not a revival of the contract system, but was appropriation simply to permit the secretary of the interior to enter into contract for the accommodation of the Indian pupils who could not be accommodated in the government schools. He declared that if such an amendment was not adopted, 2600 Indian pupils would be without school facilities after the present fiscal year, as the government schools were entirely inadequate. Mr. Thurston stated that the contract schools were established by the Catholic Church for missionary purposes and for the advancement of a great Christian purpose. He said that the commissioner of Indian affairs had authority now to purchase the buildings of the contract schools, but the Catholic Church, desiring to continue the work of the schools, declined to sell them to the United States. He was satisfied that in any event there would be no diminution of school facilities.

"A stirring speech was delivered by Mr. Vest of Missouri. Prefacing his remarks with the statement that he had always been a Protestant and had no sympathy with any of the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church, he pronounced a brilliant eulogy upon the Jesuits for their work among the Indians. Mr. Vest paid tribute to Booker Washington for his great work among the colored people of the South. Prof. Washington had struck the keynote of the negro problem, he said, by teaching the colored youth how to labor. This, he added, was the true secret of the success of the Catholics in their work among the Indians. This great undertaking had gone forward until, Mr. Vest said, 'the A. P. A. and the cowards who are afraid of it,' had struck down the appropriation for the continuance of the work. He declared he was ashamed that any American should uphold such work of a secret political society. He would denounce it if it were the last accent of his life. He ridiculed the A. P. A. for adopting a resolution demanding his impeachment for saying in the Senate what he was now saying. Mr. Vest eloquently told of the results of the work of the Jesuits among the Flathead Indians, saying that the Jesuits had rescued these Indians from degradation. He declared that the Jesuits were not doing the work for love of the Indians, but 'for the love of Christ.' 'In my opinion,' he said, 'every dollar put by the Government into the Indian schools might as well be thrown into the Potomac river with a lead weight attached, or burned up with the idea that the smoke, by some mystic power of idolatry, would accomplish the work for which it was appointed.'

"'I do not believe,' said Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts, addressing the Senate in a brief reply to Mr. Vest, 'that it is right to tax one man to support another man's religion.' Upon that proposition Mr. Lodge maintained it was not right to appropriate Government money to support any branch of the Protestant church, yet, he stated, when he opposed the payment of money for the support of Catholic schools, he was called a 'bigot' or 'an insectivorous politician.' It was a plain and simple principle, he said, that the public money should not be used for the support of any sect or religion. 'I never belonged to a secret society in my life,' continued Mr. Lodge, 'but I'm not to be deterred from doing what I deem right by having the name of one flaunted in my face.'

"Mr. Vest asked Mr. Lodge if he had not supported the taxing of Catholics in Massachusetts for the support of the common schools. Mr. Lodge replied that he had, but as the common schools were open to all and taught no creed he regarded the taxation as perfectly proper. 'I attack no creed,' said Mr. Lodge, 'I recognize the great work accomplished by the missionaries of all denominations and that done by those to whom the senator from Missouri so eloquently refers. The sacrifices of the missionaries are among the most beautiful pages of our history, but they cannot affect the principle which I have laid down.'

"Mr. Gallinger of New Hampshire opposed the proposed amendment in an earnest speech, in the course of which he referred to the work done by Dr. Duncan among the Metlakatla Indians. Mr. Vest followed with a beautiful story of the same work. Mr. Shoup of Idaho called attention to the fact that while Mr. Duncan's work was the most notable, in his opinion, ever accomplished by one man among the Indians, he had performed it without one dollar of assistance from the United States Government. The debate was closed by Mr. Carter of Montana, who pleaded for school facilities for the Indian children in Montana. He said there were 1073 children in Montana to-day who would have to be educated in the contract schools or go without education in any form, as the facilities supplied by the Government were inadequate. An aye and nay vote on the amendment was demanded. The vote was ayes 14, noes 21, not a quorum, and the Senate adjourned with the amendment still pending."

The position demanded by the principles of free and just government was clearly stated by Senator Lodge. To give to these or to any sectarian schools money raised by taxation, is to tax people to support a religion in which they do not believe—an act declared by the founders of the Government to be "sinful and tyrannical." Tax money is raised by force, and the support of religion by such means is the support of religion by force. And this embodies the whole principle of a union of church and state.
