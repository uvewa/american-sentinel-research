BY H. F. PHELPS.

BOARDING the street car on a recent morning, I picked up a paper left on the floor by some earlier passenger. The first thing that met my eyes was this:—

"SUNDAY LAW IS UPHELD."

What is called "The Barbers' Sunday Law," of Minnesota, has been a bone of contention among the barbers for some time past. A test case, that of Paul J. Pettit, plaintiff, vs. The State of Minnesota, was carried to the Supreme Court of the State. This court affirmed the decision of the lower court, and also the law itself as in harmony with the constitution of the State.

The case was appealed to the highest court of the nation. A decision was rendered April 9, 1900, by the Supreme Court of the United States, upholding the so-called barber law of this State. The decision was rendered by Chief Justice Fuller, and was concurred in by the balance of the court. Justice Fuller says that the United States Supreme Court has uniformly recognized State legislation respecting the observance of Sunday laws as an exercise of police power. A number of authorities were cited in England and this country touching the question whether shaving on Sunday is a work of necessity. "In view of all the facts," the decision reads, "we cannot say that the legislature has exceeded the limits of its legislative power in declaring that as a matter of law keeping, barber shops open on Sunday is not a work of necessity or charity. While as to other kinds of labor they have left that question to be determined as one of fact, we recognize the force of the declaration suggested and perceive no adequate ground for interfering with the wide discretion confessedly necessarily exercised by the state in these matters by holding that the classification was so palpably arbitrary as to bring the law into conflict with the federal Constitution."

It is passingly strange that men do not see the principle involved in these Sunday laws. The real question is one of individual right,—the right to do as one wills, provided always that the equal rights of another be not infringed—not whether this or that be a work of necessity or not. What inalienable right is violated, pray, when a man shaves another, or does not shave him? or, when a man submits, or does not submit, to be shaved on Sunday, or any other day?
