A movement has been begun in the Presbyterian Church to secure a revision of the "Confession of Faith." A press dispatch dated at Little Falls, N. Y., April 10, gives this report:—

"The Utica Presbytery, in session here, was thrown into a turmoil to-day by an address from the Rev. Dr. Taylor, of Clinton, formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Rome, who advocated the elimination from the Confession of Faith of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of chapter 3.

"These paragraphs cover the doctrine of election and reprobation, for the repudiation of which Dr. Hillis of Brooklyn resigned from the Chicago Presbytery. The Rev. R. W. Brokaw, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Utica, supplemented Mr. Taylor's address by saying the session of his church had passed resolutions to change the objectional paragraphs. A resolution to eliminate the paragraphs was referred to the committee on bills and overtures."

It seems to be felt by thinking men in the Presbyterian Church that the time has come when the discarding of some of the doctrines so dear to John Calvin and men of similar mind, is absolutely necessary to the church's prosperity; and they are right, at least as far as they go. The creed of Calvin's day is not suited to this day. Its effect is simply to drive out the more enlightened and honest minds on the charge of heresy. As one observer has said: "With all the heretics driven out, there should be nothing to disturb the serenity of the members left within the fold, or their admiration for one another. If this thing continues, however, the Presbyterian Church will sometime find itself in a death-like intellectual stillness."

The bars of the creed ought to be let down, and no others erected in their place. A creed is a barrier to truth, but cannot be a boundary of truth. In following the pathway of truth, men must sooner or later run up against this barrier, and then there is trouble in the church. The creed may be enlarged—its boundaries extended beyond their former place—but they cannot be so extended as to enclose the truth, for the truth of God is infinite. Men must either stand still within the creed, which would mean spiritual death, or pass over the boundaries of the creed in the course of their progress to the heights of divine knowledge. The only proper creed for the Christian Church is the Word of God. That Word, we are divinely told, "is not bound." It can neither be bound by human might, nor bounded by human wisdom.
