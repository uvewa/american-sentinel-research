### A NEW ENGLAND CLERGYMAN BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED.

"New Haven Register," April 9.

REV. DR. NEWMAN SMYTH, in his service at Center Church yesterday morning, said some straight-from-the-shoulder things regarding the latter day observance of Fast Day as a public holiday. He compared the modern attitude toward the day as a holiday with the meaning of the day when it was established, and said some sharp things about the modern methods.

Dr. Smyth read the proclamation, and then suggested that the day as a public holiday be abolished. He read the governor's proclamation for the first time in several years. It will be remembered that for the last two years he has refused to read the proclamation for the reasons stated in his address yesterday.

Dr. Smyth said that he would read the Fast Day proclamation with the public suggestion that the last year of this century might be a fitting time to bring this custom to a close. The proclamation, he said, contained an apology for its own issuance in the statement that it was a custom instituted by a generation which feared God and kept his commandments. It urged the people of this State to devote the day to the State, to duty and to God.

"Those were noble words," said Dr. Smyth, "and it would be a grand thing if it was done by the people of Connecticut. It might influence materially the nominations in coming political conventions, if the people generally should do that. But as a matter of fact the day would be observed as a public holiday under the mask of a day of fasting and prayer, and very probably the following day the attendance and business of the police courts would be increased throughout the State." This custom had been abolished in other States; we had clung to it because we disliked to give up all formal recognition of the relations of the state and the church. But the church should accept nothing which is not real.

So long as the custom continued the churches of our order would respect the proclamation of the civil authority by holding service on the appointed day; but Good Friday to devout minds was hallowed by more sound associations than the civil power could lend to it.
