The Philadelphia Public Ledger makes this reference to recent difficulties at "the court," as the seat of political and social life at Washington is now termed:—

"A thrill of gladness will be felt throughout the land when it is learned from the court journals that 'the bitter fight which has raged during the winter (at Washington) as to social precedence bids fair for settlement,' and that 'the intricate problems have received the careful consideration of the highest authorities, and the round of social festivals will be inaugurated next season under a simple and easily-comprehended system of rules. The imperative necessity of adjudicating the claims of the speaker of the House and the president of the Senate has compelled the promulgation of a new and regular order of precedence."

The Ledger proceeds to state the new rules which have been promulgated as the final decree of the "highest authorities" in the matter, and after some further remarks, concludes thus:—

"Let no one who remembers the republican simplicity, decorum, dignity, and democracy of the official life of our Government during the presidency of Washington or Lincoln cry out against this stilling of the 'hitherto stormy sea' of court life at Washington; it is quite harmless, as harmless, indeed, as it is grotesque; it isn't a real court which our 'highest authorities' have set up; the court is as sham as a palace of lathe and stucco. It's a petty sham and childish folly; it is merely a bad imitation, an impudent counterfeit of the real thing; it is a Brummagen court of an oride nobility, and rather than rail against a thing so pitiful in its perullity let 'the highest authorities' be congratulated in the briefest manner possible, from Oshkosh to Pride's Corner, that this tempest in the social teapot of the Capital has been settled; as the very least which can be said about it will be the very best which can be said about anything so absolutely absurd and pretentious."

The "court" may be absurd enough in itself; but as an evidence of the change that has overtaken the once prominent democracy of the nation, it is not without significance.
