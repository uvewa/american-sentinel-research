PROFESSOR HYSLOP, of Columbia College, who has devoted much time and effort of late to "investigations" of spiritualistic phenomena produced by a prominent "medium," has as a result severed his connection with Columbia, and presumably will not be heard from again outside the occult domain whither he has entered. When Spiritualism once thoroughly gets hold of a person he is unfitted for anything else.
