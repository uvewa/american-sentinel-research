A SHORT time since there was a pulpit-and-newspaper controversy over the proposition to close Convention Hall in Kansas City, Mo., on Sunday. The hall, we understand, was built by public subscription and has been used as a sort of institute for the exhibition of the products of the State and for other purposes similar to those to which Madison Square Garden is put in New York. The pulpit won in the debate, but the victory was short-lived, for the building was destroyed by fire last week. If the decision of the managers had been the other way, and it had been determined to continue the Sunday bicycle and horse shows, the moral from a theological point of view would be obvious. As it is, no lesson seems to be taught.—Exchange.
