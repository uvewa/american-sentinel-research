THE following opinion relative to the question of the jurisdiction of the Constitution over American territory other than the United States, was furnished by Mr. Magoon, a law officer of the War Department, in response to a request upon that department by resolution of the House of Representatives. The opinion relates to the island of Puerto Rico, and after referring to Spain's cession of the island, says:—

"Thereupon the territory conveyed became part of the United States and as such subject to the Constitution. No further action by Congress was necessary or possible. The Constitution does not depend upon Congress for authority in any part of the United States. The reverse of the proposition is the fact. From this time on Congress must look to the Constitution for authority to legislate for Puerto Rico."
