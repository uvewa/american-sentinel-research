AN advocate of Sunday laws has called our attention to a decision by the Supreme Court rendered in 1885, in which it is affirmed that "Laws setting aside Sunday as a day of rest are upheld, not from any right of the Government to legislate for the promotion of religious observances, but from its right to protect all persons from the physical and moral debasement that comes from uninterrupted labor. Such laws have always been deemed beneficial and merciful laws, especially to the poor and dependent, to the laborers in our factories and workshops, and in the heated rooms of our cities; and their validity has been sustained by the highest courts of the States."

***

However such laws may have been deemed, even by the learned judges of the courts, the testimony of experience clearly disproves the claim that they are "beneficial and merciful, especially to the poor." Under such laws poor men have been fined, thrown into jail, worked in the chain gang, and their wives and children left without support. We see nothing beneficial or merciful in such proceedings.

There is a difference between a law giving every person the privilege of rest one day in the week, and a Sunday law. Under the former no persecution for religion's sake would be possible; but under the Sunday laws persecution has been frequent, under the impulse of plainly-shown religious animosity. The advocates of Sunday laws want Sunday laws and nothing else. They may seek to hide behind the plea of the benefit and mercy of a weekly day of rest, but a mere day of rest is not what they want. The day of rest must be Sunday and no other. Sunday, and not rest, is the essential thing in their view.
