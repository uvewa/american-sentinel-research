According to the report made by a son of ex-President Hayes, as told in the following press dispatch from Washington, the government established on the island of Sulu under the American flag, as yet fails to realize the first essentials of stable government—security to life and property:—

"WASHINGTON, April 11.—Lieut. Col. Webb Hayes, a son of the late President Hayes, now in the Philippines with the Thirty-first Volunteer Infantry, will quit the army as a protest against the submission of his superior to 'diplomatic' robbery by a Dato of the Sultan of Sulu.

"Colonel Hayes is coming home immediately, and will resign as soon as he arrives.

"During the campaign just ended, Colonel Pettit sent an officer and several men to an island near the Sulus to capture an officer of Aguinaldo's army who was hiding there.

"The little party upon reaching the island were told by Dato Atto that, according to the provisions of the treaty signed by the Sultan and General Bates, American soldiers could not land with their guns.

"The young officer in charge at first demurred, but finally gave way, and the soldiers disembarked without arms.

"They were immediately surrounded by the Dato's soldiery and other natives, who relieved them of their tobacco, money, and watches. The officer was fearful of offending the Dato's men, and he made no protest of consequence.

"He asked that Aguinaldo's officer be surrendered to him.

"'More tobacco,' demanded one of the Dato's lieutenants.

"More tobacco was given and another request made for the insurgent officer.

"'Give us $20 in gold and we will find him for you,' said the Dato.

"The officer in charge produced the $20 and the prisoner was turned over to him.

"Lieut.-Col. Hayes said he could not afford to be connected with a regiment which had been subjected to such indignities without redress. Colonel Pettit is said to have requested that Lieut.-Colonel Hayes be relieved."
