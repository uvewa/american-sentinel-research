A press dispatch from Paris, dated April 9, states the following in reference to the question of opening exhibits at the coming Fair:—

"The French authorities have decided that all exhibits at the Exhibition are to be open to the public on Sunday, and the United States exhibits are within this regulation.

"The United States National Pavilion is not within this category, and the question of its being opened or closed on Sunday the French officials have left entirely to Commissioner Peck."
