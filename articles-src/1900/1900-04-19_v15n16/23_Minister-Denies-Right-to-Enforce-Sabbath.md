Before the ministerial union of Richmond, Va., recently, the Rev. J. B. Hawthorne read a paper denying the right of the civil authorities to enforce an observance of the Christian Sabbath. He declared further that he did not recognize the right of the President nor of the governor to call upon the people to observe Thanksgiving day. Their Thanksgiving proclamations should be regarded merely as suggestions, and nothing more.
