The Turkish empire occupies a position altogether unique among the nations. Nominally independent, it has existed ever since August 11, 1840, only by the sufferance of "the Powers." Many times it has seemed that the Turk must speedily be driven from Europe and his territory divided between neighboring states, but as often some unforeseen circumstance has prevented this consummation. It is true that national existence for Turkey rests upon nothing more substantial than the jealousy of other powers, but thus far this has sufficed to prevent the end which everybody recognizes as only a question of time.

The present Sultan, Abdul Hamid II., has shown a skill in diplomacy second to no crowned head of Europe. His history is thus briefly sketched by the "Chicago Tribune:"

Abdul Hamid is a Turk and Mussulman of the old school. He is 58 years of age, and the innovations of modern civilization have left little impression upon him. He rules Turkey as his predecessors ruled it, and has only yielded grudgingly to the progress of the age.

He became the ruler of the Ottoman Empire in August, 1876, at a moment when the Servian and Bulgarian provinces were in the revolt which immediately preceded the Turko-Russian war, and when the combined powers of Europe were exerting their utmost pressure to compel Turkey to adopt new policies.

### DANGER TO HIS EMPIRE.

Upon his accession to the throne Abdul Hamid was confronted by the immediate danger of the disintegration of his empire. At that time Turkey in Europe included Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovinaia, and Thessaly. These provinces were not only in a state of revolt but Russia and Austria were known to have designs upon territory which would extend their own frontiers to the Mediterranean. The dissolution of Turkey was freely predicted in every capital of Europe, and the strife between the powers for possession of the broken parts of empire, for the spoil of Constantinople, and the control of the Dardanelles promised to embroil all Europe in general war.

Abdul Hamid undoubtedly realized that it was too late to save the Balkan provinces, but he was quick to recognize in the general European situation the opportunity of saving his throne and his footing in Europe and of still maintaining Constantinople as the seat of Mohammedan power.

## CZAR KNOCKS AT CONSTANTINOPLE.

For the first time he played his game on the chess board of Europe. All the world knows what followed. The war with Russia lost Servia and Roumania to the Sultan. Bosnia and Herzegovinaia went to Austria, but Montenegro was erected into a buffer state that for the time blocked Franz Josef's pathway to Salonica. The Czar's victorious armies were at the gates of Constantinople, and Turkey's position in Europe hung only by a thread.

Then it was that Abdul Hamid taught Europe its first lesson in Oriental statecraft. By a secret treaty with Lord Beaconsfield the Sultan ceded to Great Britain the Island of Cypress. In return Lord Beaconsfield guaranteed the territorial integrity of Asia Minor and sent the British fleet through the Dardanelles.

## CHECKS RUSSIA WITH ENGLAND.

Russia was checkmated. The Czar at once realized that his troops marching into Constantinople would be shelled by the British fleet. He was reluctantly compelled to give up a project long dreamed of by Russia and to submit to the terms of the treaty of Berlin, dictated by an European congress demanded by Lord Beaconsfield, who really acted as the agent of the crafty Sultan.

In June, 1878, the powers were compelled to take steps to secure the enforcement of the terms of the treaty of Berlin with reference to the ratification of the Montenegrin frontier. In this controversy the Sultan lost. He endeavored to save himself by changing his ministry, thus giving Great Britain almost complete ascendency at Constantinople. He watched the negotiations of the powers closely, waiting to make the most of any apparent disagreement. But in the end he failed, being compelled to cede Dulcigno to Montenegro, but not until after having received two ultimatums backed up by the allied fleets of the powers.

Sultan Abdul Hamid's position in Europe was rapidly becoming precarious. Nearly every power had claims upon him. He owed money to every banker in Europe. He could only pay in territory, as cash he had none. The territorial demands of Greece were still unsatisfied and the Russian war indemnity yet unpaid.

## PLAYS FRANCE AGAINST BRITAIN.

So long as the concert of the powers existed the Ottoman Empire was doomed. This was Abdul Hamid's situation in 1880 and 1881.

The English and French rivalry for possession of Egypt gave Abdul Hamid the coveted opportunity for breaking the concert of the powers. The powers had united in pressing the demand for the completion of the Berlin treaty with reference to the territorial claims of Greece. The Grecian government was clamoring for a settlement and was actively preparing for war. Gladstone had succeeded Beaconsfield and was encouraging Greece. Austria was suspected of designs in Salonica Bay. Gladstone, reversing the policy of Beaconsfield, sided with Russia.

The Sultan saw in the situation an opportunity to divide the powers. He appealed to France, reminding the republic of its interests in Tripoli and Tunis, to which England was hostile and Germany and Austria friendly. England and France were at once embroiled in a quarrel over northern Africa, Russia siding with England.

## SULTAN'S THREAT OF WAR.

The powers were pitted against each other and the European concert broken. The Sultan fortified the Dardanelles, called the redefs to their colors, and made a brave show of preparing for war. His tactics partly succeeded, for, although in the end he was compelled to give in to the demands of Greece, he only gave a part of the territory originally demanded.

In 1886 the powers again came together to consider the Bulgarian question after the revolution which finally ended in Prince Alexander's resignation. Russia and Austria, working together, demanded the restoration of Prince Alexander, who was entirely under Russian influence. Germany and Italy took the same position. The Sultan appealed to England, asserting that Russia was intriguing to secure permanent control of Bulgaria from which to menace Turkey with another advance on Constantinople.

The Sultan's appeal to England was not misplaced, for Gladstone had been succeeded by Lord Salisbury, who regarded Russia as England's natural foe. As a result England refused to recognize the treaty of Berlin as binding. The European concert was broken, Russia was compelled to consent to the election of Prince Ferdinand as ruler of Bulgaria, and that province was kept under the suzerainty of Turkey, Russian influence for the time being destroyed.

## AMERICA'S FIRST EXPERIENCE.

The United States' first experience with Turkey came during President Cleveland's administration, after the Armenian massacres of 1893-94. The United States and Great Britain both presented demands for indemnity and the pressure of the two governments became acute. The Sultan adopted the ruse of calling upon a conference of the powers to adjust the claims, knowing that the policy of the United States precluded the participation of this government.

The result justified the Sultan's statecraft. The powers joined in appointing a commission of inquiry, to which President Cleveland, following traditional American policy, held aloof. President Cleveland, however, did direct American Consul General Jewell to accompany the commission and make a report to the United States government from the evidence gathered by the delegates of the powers. The Sultan refused Consul General Jewell permission to make such a report. Great Britain was compelled to act jointly with the powers. As a result British claims for indemnity have been involved with a mass of general claims and the demands of the United States were lost sight of.

## RUSSIA AGAINST ENGLAND.

In 1895 the powers again joined in a concerted effort to compel the Sultan to consent to reforms in the administration of Armenia. Great Britain favored a naval demonstration and sent a fleet to the entrance of the Dardanelles. The Sultan promptly appealed to Russia, asserting that England contemplated the seizure of territory in Asia Minor. Russia and France, both interested in Asia Minor, naturally refused to endorse a policy of force and the European concert was again broken.

In 1896 Great Britain threatened the Sultan with the occupation of Constantinople until the reforms in Armenia were put in operation. The Sultan replied to the threat by asking the Czar to appoint officers to inspect and strengthen the fortifications of the Dardanelles and giving the Russian fleet permission to pass through the Bosphorus. Great Britain was again balked.

Just at present Turkey is unquestionably under Russian influence, and it is believed that if the United States pushes its demands to the extent of making a show of force the Sultan will promptly appeal to the Czar.
