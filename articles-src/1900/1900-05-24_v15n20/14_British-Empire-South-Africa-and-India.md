The present situation in two large districts of the British empire affords a crucial test of the character of the "Christianity" of "Christian nations," of which Great Britain stands a conspicuous example. The two districts in question are India and South Africa. The British nation is spending millions in killing men in South Africa, while millions of its subjects in India are dying from starvation. The figures are given by a writer in the Springfield Republican, thus:

"The Boer war up to April 1 had cost the British government about $100,000,000. This is at the rate of nearly $20,000,000 a month. It was stated by one of the speakers at the New York missionary conference Sunday night that $1 a month would suffice to support the life of a single person in the famine district of India. Thus it may be said that the British government is currently expending enough money in killing people in South Africa for the sake of crushing their liberty, to feed 20,000,000 of its starving subjects in India, where, with outside aid, less than 6,000,000 are being cared for."
