Another important step bearing upon the establishment of imperialism as the national policy of the United States, was taken recently in the form of a decision by Judge Lochren of the federal circuit court, applying specifically to Puerto Rico, and in general to all the territory controlled by the government outside the United States. The decision is of importance because it comes from the federal judiciary, which heretofore had not spoken upon the great question of the right and authority of this nation to govern people in other lands without their consent.

The federal judiciary is one of the three coordinate branches of the national Government, and its attitude in this matter is of special interest and importance in view of the fact that both the other branches—the law-making and executive bodies—have pronounced and proceeded to act in harmony with the assumption that the nation had such right and authority—that the Constitution of the United States does not apply to territory outside the United States, and hence that Congress and the President are not bound by the Constitution in dealing with the people of such territory, but can make and enforce such rules for their government as they see fit.

The decision of Judge Lochren is squarely against this view; but this decision does not of course speak for the whole federal judiciary; and until the Supreme Court has pronounced upon the question it will remain undetermined whether or not this branch of the federal government will give its sanction to the proceedings of Congress and the President in the matter, and so fully commit the nation to the imperial policy. Judge Lochren's decision for the moment casts a stumbling block in the way of the establishment of this policy, and it remains to be seen whether his view will be affirmed by the higher federal courts, or whether any obstacle which this one branch of the government can interpose will be sufficient to stay the forward march of the powerful forces enlisted in its cause, which have already advanced so far toward its realization.

As an important link in the chain of circumstances determining the settlement of this great question of national policy, Judge Lochren's decision is worthy of especial note, irrespective of the view one may hold touching imperialism as a national policy. We quote only such parts of the decision as touch directly upon this subject:

"The contention on the part of the United States is that by the cession the island of Puerto Rico did not become an integral part of the United States, nor subject to the Constitution, but merely an outlying province or dependency to be ruled by the absolute will of Congress untrammeled by any provision of the Constitution; and, second, that the war with Spain was not ended so as to displace the jurisdiction of the military commission until the exchange of ratifications of the treaty on April 2, 1899, and that then because the Constitution had no force in that island such jurisdiction continued until displaced by the provisions of some act of Congress.

"This contention on the part of the government, that territory ceded to and brought under the sovereignty of the United States is no part of the United States, and outside of the Constitution and its guarantees, is strenuously urged, and an elaborate argument of a law officer of the war department, as well as arguments of several distinguished senators, in support of this contention have been presented and carefully considered. The arguments are ingenious, but, in view of the history of the country and the terms of the Constitution and the very numerous decisions of the supreme court, all to the contrary, I do not find them persuasive.

## LIBERTY AND TYRANNY.

"Our general Government was founded by the men of the Revolution, who had rebelled against the arbitrary power asserted by Great Britain, to govern her outlying colonies at the will of her parliament. They established this Government upon the asserted theory that all just powers of government come from the consent of the governed. They founded, as described by President Lincoln in language not yet forgotten, 'a government of the people, by the people, for the people.' It will be, indeed, marvelous if it is made to appear that these men who then founded our national government so constructed it that it is capable of ruling with unlimited power a subject people who have neither guaranties to protect them nor any voice in the government. This is foreign absolutism—the worst form of tyranny.

"If the Constitution does not extend to Puerto Rico and our other new acquisitions of territory, Congress has the untrammeled absolute power to establish subject governments, or make laws for such territories; it has the power to establish dependent monarchies or satrapies, state religions and even slavery. The argument of one of the senators referred to that the last clause of the thirteenth amendment prevents the establishment of slavery is obviously lame and impotent, for if the Constitution does not extend to those parts of the domain of the United States, nor limit Congress in its powers of legislation over them, by what process will this single clause of an amendment of that instrument detach itself from the skin of the parchment, and alone fasten itself upon these new territories? * * *

"The argument, much repeated, that if the national Government of the United States has not the power to deal with these new territories untrammeled by the Constitution, its power is less than that possessed by the other governments of the civilized world is admitted. It proves nothing. The national Government of the United States is one of very limited powers. In respect to its own people, in its entire domain, and generally, except in nations, and concerning matters expressly committed to it by the Constitution, its powers are much less than that possessed by other governments. No one will dispute this.

"The national Government of the United States was created, and its powers and jurisdiction granted and limited by the federal Constitution. Its powers can only be increased by amendment of that instrument. * * *

"The power of the general Government to acquire additional territory rests upon its Constitutional power to make war, which may result in conquest, and its like power to make treaties, which may bring territory by cession. The power to govern such acquired territory results from the power to admit new states and to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States. * * *

"The novel doctrine that the power of Congress to govern territory ceded to the United States may be conferred by a foreign sovereign, by and through the terms of the treaty of cession, and that the general Government can exercise powers thus granted by a foreign sovereign, independent of and in disregard of the Constitution, until Congress, mayhap in the future, shall by its enactment see fit to extend the Constitution over the territory, is contrary to the holding of the Supreme Court of the United States above cited, to the effect that the general Government is one of enumerated powers and can claim and exercise no power not granted to it by the Constitution, either expressly or by necessary implication. It is clear that the general Government cannot legislate over territory where the Constitution from which its every power is derived does not extend. The Constitution must be in force over a territory before the general Government can have any authority to legislate respecting it. No foreign sovereign can invest the general Government with any legislative power. * * *

"The plain, obvious and undeniable fact is that the general Government of the United States, created by the Constitution, and possessing no vitality or power not directly drawn from that instrument, can only exist and legislate where that Constitution is in force; and that every tract of territory that comes under the sovereignty of the United States comes necessarily under that Constitution, which alone gives life to that sovereignty, and beyond which that sovereignty must cease. * * *

"Further discussion or citation of authorities upon this branch of the case seems to me to be needless. It must be held that upon the cession by Spain to the United States of the Island of Puerto Rico, that island became a part of the dominion of the United States, as much so as is Arizona or Minnesota; and that the Constitution of the United States, ex propria vigore, at once extended over that island; and that this extension of the Constitution gave Congress, whose every power must come from that instrument, the authority to legislate in respect to that island as a part of the United States territory.

"It follows that all the provisions of the Constitution in respect to personal and property rights, including the right to trial by jury in criminal prosecutions, became at once, when the cession was completed, a part of the supreme law of the land." s.
