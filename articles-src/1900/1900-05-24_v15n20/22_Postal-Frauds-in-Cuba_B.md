The country and more especially the administration has been startled rather rudely by the discovery of gigantic frauds in the Cuban postal service.

A man named Neely, treasurer of the postal service for the island, is accused of embezzlement of the funds in his custody to a large amount, the shortage being variously estimated at from $30,000 to $100,000. It is said that "if possible Neely will be sent to Cuba for trial, that a native jury may pass upon his case and administer punishment if his guilt be proved. Neely is under heavy bonds in New York, and Governor Roosevelt says Governor General Wood's request for his extradition will be granted. This matter is within Governor Roosevelt's discretion, in the absence of any formal arrangement for the return to Cuba of persons accused of crime."

Havana dispatches state that the public is not excited over the looting of the postal funds, but views the matter with ironical amusement. "The average Cuban," it is said, "expects, after his Spanish experience, that public officials will steal. He thinks it a good joke that Americans engaged in showing the Cubans how to govern should fall into Spanish practices."

This cynical view of official morality is not shared by the national administration, remarks an administration paper. "The looting of the Cuban postal funds is regarded as a grave reflection upon American integrity, and an unendurable humiliation. The administration is resolved to put an end to the scandal at once, to punish the offenders as severely as possible, and to convince the Cubans that when the United States promised them honest government it meant exactly what it said.

"This nation occupies a position of trust in Cuba that makes such offenses as that charged against Neely even more outrageous than the plundering of our own treasury. The administration's determination to let no guilty man escape is fully approved by the country."

If the Cubans are to be suitably impressed with the absolute honesty of the American government it will be necessary not only to punish Neely and his pals, but to establish such a censorship of the press as will effectually suppress a large share of the news from this country, especially during the coming political campaign. It is said that this city has a floating debt of $13,000,000 in excess of the legal limit, every cent of which represents fraudulent transactions, if not out and out stealing. Then there is the story of Captain Carter's operation at Savannah, besides divers other steals and jobs, some of these directly connected with the war for the deliverance of Cuba, all of which ought to be suppressed before a proper impression can be made upon the untutored Cuban mind.
