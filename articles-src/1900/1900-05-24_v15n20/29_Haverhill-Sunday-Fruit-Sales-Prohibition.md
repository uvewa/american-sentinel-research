The sale of fruit on Sundays has been stopped at Haverhill, Mass., by order of the city marshal. Some fruit dealers wanted to close on Sundays and complained to the marshal about other dealers who wanted to keep open; so the latter are compelled to close in order that the former may keep Sunday without financial loss.
