Many people in this country hold to the idea, which has been fortified by several court decisions, that Christianity is a part of the "law of the land." It is surprising that a conception which so belittles Christianity should be held by members of the Christian church, and put forward by anybody in behalf of religion; yet it is by church people that this doctrine is most zealously maintained in its traditional semblance of truth.

Of course, if Christianity is a part of the common law, it is enforceable upon all the people as such and religious freedom can no more exist here than in any land which maintains a state religion. This manifest truth is sufficient in itself to stamp the idea of common-law Christianity as one altogether at variance with the American conception of government.

But even if American principles of government were in harmony with such a thing, it is utterly impossible that Christianity should be incorporated into the civil law. This is because of the nature of Christianity, as being a system devised by the Omniscient, for a purpose infinitely transcending the purpose of civil government. The greater cannot be incorporated into and become a part of the less. The infinite cannot be embraced within the finite.

So far from being merely a part of the civil law, Christianity is infinitely more than all human law could possibly express. Christianity is not a *part* of anything; it is a complete system in itself. The law expresses justice, but Christianity embraces all justice, and much more than this. It embraces all divine truth. It embraces mercy, without which it would avail nothing for the transgressor. It embraces all the attributes of the divine character. In short, it is nothing less than life, even the life of its author, Jesus Christ. And as "God was in Christ" when the Saviour of mankind walked and taught on earth, and in exemplifying Christianity the Saviour was revealing God to the world, it must be true that Christianity is the very life of God (which is manifested still through human flesh), and is therefore as infinite and illimitable as God himself. It can no more be a part of anything than God can be a part of anything. God is all and in all, and Christianity is the all in all of perfect living.

The conception therefore which would make Christianity a part of the law of the land, is infinitely short of the truth, and calculated to work harm in proportion to the degree of error it embodies. Christianity can no more be enforced upon the people, as the law of the land is enforced, than God himself can be enforced upon them. God does not force himself upon any person, and cannot be forced upon any one, by any power in the universe, much less by any power on earth. This truth all professors of Christianity ought to know, and they of all people on the earth should be foremost to oppose a doctrine which places Christianity in so false a light before the world as does this doctrine which makes it subservient to human laws.
