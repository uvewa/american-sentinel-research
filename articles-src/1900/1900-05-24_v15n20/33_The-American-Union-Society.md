A society called "The American Union" has been organized in Brooklyn, N. Y., with the aim of advancing the interests of the public school and other American institutions. It claims a membership of 22,000. Foremost among its specific objects is that of enforcing "the law providing for the reading of the Protestant Bible each day in the schools." In itself, of course, the reading of the Bible is most excellent, but the place for this very essential feature of proper child training is not in the public schools supported by the tax money of atheists and Christians alike. The Bible itself condemns such a course by enjoining upon men to do unto others that which they would have others do unto them.
