Liberty is not a luxury; it is a necessity.

No strength from union can be gathered in a union of church and state.

The only proper basis of civil legislation is the demands of civil justice.

As there is no religion apart from a church, so there can be no union of religion and the state apart from a union of church and state.

All the world has no more right to deprive a single individual of any natural right than a single individual would have to deprive all the world of such a right.

If the state ought not to oppose any religion, it ought not to help any religion; for the various religions of the land being opposed to each other, the state cannot help one without opposing another.

Majority rule in religion is not for the good of the majority. In religion, the endorsement of the majority affords no guaranty of truth; and without such a guaranty, religion is worthless, and its enforcement upon any person becomes an outrage.

In religion, the state, like the individual, will naturally be guided by the church. Hence union of the state with religion, or a religious state, means church rule in state affairs.

The same principle which would justify the state in enforcing the true religion, would justify it in enforcing a false religion, since the state is not infallible, nor its laws and standards unchangeable, and it has the same right to enforce a religion at one time as at another.

If the state has a right to bind the conscience of an individual, it has also a right to loose the individual conscience and substitute its own standard of right and wrong in the place of any and every other standard. But the state cannot be a saviour to any person, nor afford justification for any before the bar of God.
