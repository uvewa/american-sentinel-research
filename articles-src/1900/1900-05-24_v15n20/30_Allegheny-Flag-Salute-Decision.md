At a recent meeting of the Allegheny (Pa.) board of school controllers, says the Pittsburg Post, the question of the "flag salute" was considered, and it was decided not to make this exercise compulsory upon the pupils of Allegheny public schools, contrary to the wishes of the Allegheny G. A. R., who had passed a resolution calling on principals and teachers to enforce the salute each morning in their schools.
