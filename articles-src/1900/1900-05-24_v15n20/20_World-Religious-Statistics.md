The York (Pa.) Gazette, of May 6th, publishes some interesting statistics that go to show that, contrary to the prevailing idea, so-called Christians outnumber nearly two to one the adherents of any other religion, while all the others outnumber the Christians less than two to one. These statistics are credited to a French statistician, who states that there are in round numbers 477,000,000 Christians, 256,000,000 of the followers of Confucius, 190,000,000 Hindoos, 177,000,000 Mohammedans, and 148,000,000 Buddhists.

Of course it goes without saying that only a small proportion of those who are called Christians are such in reality, since in such an enumeration as this the entire population of such countries as the United States and England is counted as Christian.
