"The Review" of Buffalo, N. Y., notes that a society exists in France for the promotion of Sunday observance, and a strong effort has been made by it to secure the closing of the Paris Exposition on Sunday. It is said that in making this effort "the society did not rely upon the assistance of the French people, but rather upon the influence of Englishmen and Americans." That is, in its efforts to secure the closing of the Exposition on Sunday the society appealed not to the people who manage the Exposition and who patronize it, but to outside influence. It was their purpose to compel the closing of the Exposition, not that anybody would have been better off for closing it in such a way, but it would look better and be more respectable.

"The Review" very sensibly remarks that, looking at the question from a purely business standpoint, and taking into consideration the peculiar views of the Parisians, it does not seem to be a very logical and desirable thing to close the Exposition on Sunday. "Even should the directors conclude to observe Sunday, that fact would have absolutely no effect upon the Parisians. They would continue to regard the first day of the week as a holiday." And that is just all the effect compulsory observance has upon anybody anywhere—simply no real effect at all. If Sunday were indeed the Sabbath by divine appointment, the only possible good that could come to anybody from observing it would have to come through voluntary and not forced observance.
