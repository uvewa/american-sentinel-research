In a recent speech in Congress on the Navy Appropriation bill, Senator Lodge said:

"My reasons for desiring more ships and desiring them quickly, is my belief that the safety of the United States depends upon the strength of our navy. We do not need the navy for the protection of our insular possessions. The danger lies in our own great coast line and in the defense of the Monroe doctrine in this hemisphere. We are about to enter upon the construction of an isthmian canal. Whether it will be better to fortify that canal or not is yet an open question. But to control that canal, to defend it, to hold it open for our commerce and for the commerce of the world, even though it be against an enemy's fleet, we must be the naval masters of the Caribbean Sea.

"We would be foolish indeed if we should close our eyes to the possibilities of the situation. We could never allow the Danish islands to pass into any other hand than ours. The Monroe doctrine is a great protection to the United States, but I am by no means sure that some European nation (perhaps one whose navy is now receiving such rapid increase) may not test the Monroe doctrine."

Though the Senator did not mention Germany by name, his meaning was unmistakable, and his words have elicited sharp retorts from the German press.
