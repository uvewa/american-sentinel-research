The changed attitude of Methodist church leaders toward worldly amusements as related to the church discipline, is indicated by the following, spoken before the Methodist conference in Chicago by Prof. C. W. Pearson, of the Northwestern University:

"Our present opposition to science and to progressive biblical scholarship alienates the educated and thoughtful; our present apathy in regard to social questions keeps away the wage-earning classes and the poor; our present attitude toward amusements repels all healthy and cultured people, and especially the young and joyous, to whose best development innocent amusements are as necessary as instruction and work."

By letting down the bars against "progressive biblical scholarship"—that is, the "higher criticism"—and against "amusements"—which means theater-going, card parties, etc., the church will not "repel" so many people and probably will not suffer a loss in membership as was the case last year; but such means of increasing church membership contrast sharply with those employed with such marvelous results by the apostles and the early Christian church.
