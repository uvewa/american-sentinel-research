In a recent address delivered before the Savings Bank association in New York City, on "The Aristocracy of the Dollar." Colonel T. W. Higginson said:

"I remember in my youth there was a certain gentleman who was suspected of being a millionaire. What is the possession of a million dollars now, let us say, within the precincts of this Chamber of Commerce? Respectable poverty.

"Aristocracy of birth and aristocracy of wealth have up to this time divided the world between them. The aristocracy of birth has steadily lost prestige for many years.

"Year by year, for the last century, the assimilation of the aristocracy of birth with the aristocracy of wealth in the English House of Lords has gone on steadily. The change is distinct gain."
