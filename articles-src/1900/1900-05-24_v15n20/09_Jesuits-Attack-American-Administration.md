A recently published letter from Manila states that early in April the Jesuits distributed a pamphlet in that city, in which is set forth the "truths which Christians must observe." Among the things most strongly condemned by the Jesuits in this pamphlet are religious tolerance and recognition of civil marriage. Consequently this act of the Jesuits is considered by many to be an attack upon the American administration. The pamphlet in question says:

"The commands of the church must be obeyed in the same manner as the law of God.

"You must subject your own judgment to that of the church, and think exactly as the church thinks, for the church cannot be overcome.

"You must reject and condemn the Masonic sect, so frequently rejected and condemned by the Supreme Pontiffs.

"You must reject and condemn liberty of worship, liberty of the press, liberty of thought, and the other liberties of perdition condemned and rejected by the church.

"You must also reject and condemn liberalism, and also modern progress and civilization, as being false progress and false civilization.

"You must utterly abominate civil marriage."
