In a recent speech Lord Salisbury, the British premier, sounded the alarm of war before the English people as no British statesman has sounded it before in many years, and the fact of his customary conservatism added to the sensation produced by his words. But Lord Salisbury is in a better position than are the people to know the exact facts of the situation, and the virtual alliance existing between England and the United States makes his words mean much for the American people as well.
