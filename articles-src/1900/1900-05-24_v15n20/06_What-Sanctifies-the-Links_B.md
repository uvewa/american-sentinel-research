The Inter Ocean of the 15th inst. has an article under the above heading in which are stated some facts very significant as showing the growing disregard for Sunday as a sacred day.

"Sunday golf is now played openly on all the links in and round Chicago," says the "Inter Ocean." "What is more, it is played by church members in good and regular standing." The astonishing part of it is that "there is not a word of complaint at Lake Forest, in Evanston, or in Lake View against this condition, although three years ago each of these suburbs protested vigorously against 'Sabbath desecration' by the golf players. So complete has been the revolution in religious circles that it is said the golf players of some fashionable North Shore suburbs take their golf outfits to church on Sunday morning, stand them in the lobbies until services are over, and then proceed directly to the links, where they dine and pass the remainder of the day either as players or spectators of the noble game."

This seems remarkable indeed, inasmuch as the ministry of the "Sunday keeping" churches has been laboring so long and so earnestly to impress upon the minds of the people the thought that Sunday is a sacred day. But according to the journal from which we quote, "it seems that the pastors have come to accept Sunday golf either as a necessary evil or an innocent recreation, or both. At all events, the absence of all pulpit criticism is evidence of the fact that they have ceased to contend against it."

"There is nothing harmful in Sunday golf, as the golfers see it; not a thing," continues the "Inter Ocean." And the modifying clause, "as the golfers see it," might well have been omitted, for in Illinois there is no law either human or divine against doing on Sunday anything that may be lawfully done on other days, unless the doing of it disturbs the peace.

But it is the known absence of divine law especially which emboldens church members to spend a portion of Sunday in playing golf. The pulpit and religious press have both been at considerable pains to impress upon the minds of the people the thought that the fourth commandment of the Decalogue is of no force as applied to the seventh day of the week, the very day which it specifically mentions. And it is not strange that accepting that view touching the day specified in the divine law they readily adopt the same view of the relation of the commandment to the first day, a day not named in any commandment, and inferentially referred to only as one of the "six days" upon which the Creator worked.

Continuing the discussion of golf, the Inter Ocean says: "The recreation is as innocent of guile as any game could possibly be. It is healthful from both a physical and a moral viewpoint."

Thus far all is clear sailing. Certainly, Sunday golf is perfectly proper for the respectable residents of Chicago's most eminently respectable suburbs, "but," as the "Inter Ocean" says, "precisely the same is true of Sunday fishing, Sunday hunting, Sunday base ball, Sunday bicycling, and Sunday horse racing." It is indeed true that "those who find pleasure in Sunday sports of any kind or all kinds are unable to see where there is any harm in them." And it is equally true that all of these sports are just as innocent upon Sunday as on other days, unless it can be shown that they are not in keeping with the character of the day; hence, examine this question from any possible standpoint and one is brought face to face with the question of the divine authority of Sunday as a sacred day.

If the divine Sabbath law applies to Sunday, then clearly not only Sunday golf but all Sunday games are wrong, and ought not to be indulged in by Christians. But the "if" is so large that only those who refuse to consider it candidly can get around it, under it or over it.

In their efforts to explain away the claims of the seventh day, the friends of Sunday have destroyed in the minds of the people the force of the only divine Sabbath law, hence in the absence of civil law on the subject, and even in the face of civil statutes, even church members are quite disposed to do about as they please on Sunday.
