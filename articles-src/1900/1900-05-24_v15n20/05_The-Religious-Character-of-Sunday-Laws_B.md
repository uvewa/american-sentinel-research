There is not the least shadow of doubt that Sunday laws are enacted and enforced because of the supposed sacred character of the day. The codes of most of the States style Sunday either "the Sabbath" or "Lord's day." Blackstone treats infractions of Sunday laws under the heading, "Offenses against God and religion;" and in this he is followed quite generally by American authorities. In New York, we are told by Judge Kent that "the statute has for over a century recognized the sanctity of the day and punished its violators." In Georgia, the code styles Sunday "the Lord's day;" and in Bass vs. Irwin (49 Ga., 436), it is declared that as such "all courts and magistrates are to consider it;" while in Saltar vs. Smith (55 Ga., 244), it is plainly said that "the code but re-enacts the law of the Almighty." In Arkansas the language of the court (18 Ark., 186) is that "the day is set apart by divine appointment as well as by the law of the land." In Pennsylvania (Johnston's case, 22 Pa., 102), the courts recognize "divine command and human legislation;" while in Iowa (Davis vs. Smith, 1 Green, 406), we are told that the day is "established by laws both human and divine." See "The Legal Sunday," page 113.

But notwithstanding the array of evidence of the true character of Sunday laws there are many who attempt to defend them as merely "civil statutes," "sanitary measures," "police regulations," etc.

Much is made because of the assumed fact that "nobody is required to observe the day religiously;" "nobody is required to do a single religious act on that day," etc. And such arguments are advanced even by men who declare that "take the religion out and you take the rest out;" and again, "You cannot long preserve the Sabbath [Sunday is meant] as a day of rest unless you preserve it as a day of worship."

But whatever is true of the actual language of the various statutes, it is certain that religious observance is the thing sought to be secured by them. This is evident from the language of "the usual exemption" of observers of "another day." Such exemption usually runs as follows:

Arkansas: "Persons who are members of any religious society who observe as Sabbath any other day of the week than the Christian Sabbath, or Sunday, shall not be subject to the penalties of this act, so that they observe one day in seven, agreeable to the faith and practice of their church or society."

Connecticut: "No person who conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath, and who actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall be liable to prosecution for performing secular business and labor on the Sabbath provided he disturbs no other person while attending public worship."

The Indiana code provides that "nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect such as conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath," etc.

Iowa is the same as Indiana, while Kansas exempts "any person who is a member of a religious society, by whom any other than the first day of the week is observed as a Sabbath, so that he observes such Sabbath."

Examples of exemptions might be greatly extended for they are very similar in all the States having exemption clauses for the benefit of Sabbatarians; but it is unnecessary. They all show very plainly that the object of the law is to secure "conscientious" observance of a day, for only "conscientious" observers are exempt. And in two instances which we have cited, to be able to claim the exemption the individual must be a member of a religious society, by whom other than the first day of the week is observed as a Sabbath.

Thus in at least two States Sabbatarians might use the Sunday law to enforce discipline upon unruly members, for by the terms of the statute any one who does not keep the seventh day "conscientiously" may be prosecuted for working on Sunday.

Again, in either one of these States the Sunday law subjects members of Sabbatarian families to the temptation of joining such Sabbatarian church simply to be secure against prosecution for Sunday labor, for to be entitled to the exemption the individual who would claim it must be "a member of a religious society that keeps a day other than Sunday as the Sabbath."

Thus, viewed even from the most favorable standpoint, Sunday laws are distinctly religious in character, and are designed to secure religious observance of the day, or of some other day in lieu thereof.
