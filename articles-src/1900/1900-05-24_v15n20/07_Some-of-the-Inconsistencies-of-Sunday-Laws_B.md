Some weeks ago Representative Charles R. Saunders of Boston introduced a bill in the Massachusetts legislature the purpose of which was to so amend the Sunday law of that State as to permit the sale of cigars and other forms of manufactured tobacco on Sunday. To a reporter of the Boston Post, who interviewed him upon the subject, Mr. Saunders said:

"It is hard to believe we are at the threshold of the twentieth century when a woman, trying to earn an honest livelihood, can be arrested in Massachusetts, fined and ordered to be imprisoned, unless the fine is paid, for selling a cigar on Sunday. Yet this is just what happened last August to Catherine Graham of Revere.

"She was licensed by the town to keep open her dining room on Sunday to supply people with food and drink. This she did, and to some of them she also sold a cigar. She was arrested and fined $10, and the Supreme Court a fortnight ago decided that the conviction must stand under the Massachusetts law.

"Drugs and medicines can be sold on Sunday, but the Supreme Court decided in 1889 that cigars were not drugs or medicine. The sale of cigars, however, on Sunday has continued at hotels, druggists, common victuallers and newspaper stores with little or no objection.

"Two Sundays have passed since the decision of the court called the matter to the attention of the authorities. Notice was given that all sales of cigars on Sunday were illegal, but there is no evidence that the sale was diminished to an appreciable extent.

"Where any regard whatever was paid to the notice, some simple device was used to evade the law. If a 5-cent cigar was wanted, a Sunday Post was sold for 8 cents, and a cigar thrown in. One who must have a 10-cent cigar paid 13 cents for his Post.

"A plate of beans and cup of coffee, usual price 15 cents, sold for 20 or 25 cents, with a 5 or 10-cent cigar as a gift. To have an entire community making a laughing stock of a law of the commonwealth and chuckling at its evasion is an injury to public morals. It tends to breed disrespect for all law.

"Moreover, what real reason is there for prohibiting the sale of cigars on Sunday? Horses and carriages which rattle through the streets, disturbing people more or less, can be let on Sunday purely for pleasure, and so can yachts and boats. Street railway cars, ferry boats, steamboats and railroad trains are all legalized on Sunday.

"I do not use tobacco myself, but its sale on Sunday should be legalized for the comfort of those who do and to stop universal desecration of the law. It will make no change in the practice of years. It will simply make legal what is bound to be done any way, and do away with a deal of hypocrisy.

"Instead of Sunday being a day of cheer and sunshine, the policy at the founding of the colony was one of repression and severity. In those days there was a union of church and state. No one could vote who was not a church member. When in doubt upon a question the civil magistrates consulted the elders, who were clergymen. The result was the usual evils which throughout history accompany such a union."

Mr. Saunders' position against the Sunday prohibition of tobacco selling was well taken. Of course tobacco is not a necessary of life and is even injurious, but it is just as necessary as Sunday papers; and it is no more injurious on Sunday than on other days. To prohibit it one day in the week is thoroughly illogical, but no more so than is all restrictive Sunday legislation. Mr. Saunders' remarks bear just as much against all Sunday legislation as against the special feature of the statute which his bill proposed to amend. B.
