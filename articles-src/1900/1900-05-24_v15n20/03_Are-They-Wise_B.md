Hon. John J. Ingalls, some years ago a conspicuous figure in the United States Senate, says in a recently published article:

"Irrespective of creeds and theology they are wise who would recognize God in the Constitution, because faith in a Supreme Being, in immortality and the compensations of eternity conduces powerfully to the social order by enabling man to endure with composure the injustice of this world in the hope of reparation in that which is to come."

But Mr. Ingalls does not explain how recognizing God in the Constitution can have any influence with the individual faith in "the compensations of eternity." Certainly he would not have us understand that the people will not believe in these "compensations" unless vouched for by the government.

It seems strange to find Mr. Ingalls among the "Reformers" who would put God into the Constitution, since if we mistake not he was of the opinion not so very many years ago that "neither the Sermon on the Mount nor the Ten Commandments have any place in politics." He doubtless told the truth as to the general practice, and that may be all he meant by the statement. Certainly his more recent utterance, quoted above, is sadly out of harmony with the former one, if by it he intended to express his own sense of the fitness of things moral and things political.

Faith in God and obedience to the principles enunciated in the Sermon on the Mount and to the Ten Commandments ought to control in every walk in life, and where these cannot go men ought not to go; but they must be written in the individual heart, not in constitutions nor upon statute books. B.
