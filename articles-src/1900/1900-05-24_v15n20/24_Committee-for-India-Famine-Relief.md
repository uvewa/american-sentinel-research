A committee of one hundred has been organized in New York to aid in the relief of famine-stricken India. Bishop Potter said at the meeting for organization, that it was a curious fact that the famine was due to England's good government, which by putting a stop to tribal wars with their vast loss of life has caused a multiplication of the people beyond the power of the crops to supply them in case of drouth. Of course the bishop intended no reflection upon the British government in making this statement. The only possible blame that can attach to the government for the famine is in the fact that while millions are starving in India the government is pouring out treasure like water in killing thousands in Africa. But for the African war England might be doing much more than she is for the relief of famine sufferers.
