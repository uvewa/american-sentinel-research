Some quotations made from European journals by the Springfield Republican (Mass.) throw what that paper calls a "sobering illumination" upon the regard in which the Monroe doctrine has now come to be held in Europe, thus:

"The London Economist pokes fun at the Monroe doctrine, and says: 'It has become so increasingly illogical that the older diplomacy will not consent to recognize it, and will undoubtedly, when the emergency arises, deny that it can be an excuse for compelling any European power to surrender its purposes.' The Saturday Review questions whether we have not 'voluntarily abandoned all moral claim to insist on the recognition of the Monroe doctrine by Europe;' our right to do so has always been challenged, but now that the United States 'has chosen to appear as a conquering power in eastern seas and among the West Indies, the claim is being gradually exposed in all its naked extravagance.' The Outlook is of the same mind: 'The sole ground upon which the United States can successfully maintain their exclusive influence on the American continent is that they shall not interfere on other continents. The rule applies to men and nations alike, that in requiring others to attend to their own affairs, you must define your own business and stick to it.' The force of these statements must be admitted."
