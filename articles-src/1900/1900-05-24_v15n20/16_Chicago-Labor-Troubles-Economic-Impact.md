The general manager of the Union Traction Company of this city estimates that the labor troubles are costing the company $1,000 a day in loss of receipts. "The managers of other transportation systems," it is said, "both surface and elevated, have expressed like views and it is probable that the labor difficulties which have prevailed during the last sixty days have reduced street and elevated railroad earnings by something like $100,000. The receipts of the street railroads have long been regarded as one of the most trustworthy indications of the state of city business." Commenting upon these facts a daily paper says: "It would be a modest estimate to say that every 5 cents missed by the transportation companies represents at least 25 cents missed by the butcher, the grocer, the dry goods merchant, druggist and landlord from the same cause. This loss is the injury inflicted incidentally upon general business, quite apart from the losses suffered directly by those who are engaged in the struggle. It suggests the extent to which the general public is interested, on the economic side, in what is commonly called the labor question, and how important a right treatment of that question is from the point of view of the public."
