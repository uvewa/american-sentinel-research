The present expense of maintaining the United States army, says an authority who writes in the Saturday Evening Post, is "$330,000 a day, or $1,375 an hour, or $229 a minute." "The curious feature in the whole case," he adds, "is that the politicians are trying to hide the fact that we are maintaining a large army, and if we are to pursue our present plans the size of it may have to be increased. Thus in the legislation that is proposed there is the most painstaking care to keep from any one the idea that we are drifting toward the enormous war expenses of a modern power. At the same time, when we add to these figures the one hundred and forty-odd millions which we are paying out for pensions, we exceed the army expenses of any nation on earth, with the possible exception of Great Britain, whose expenditures in South Africa may form the greatest total in the history of warfare. It is a striking contradiction of ideals that just after the Peace Conference at The Hague, where disarmament was discussed, every nation that took part in the feast of concord has since increased its expenses either for war itself or for appropriations for war. It all goes to show that we are still far from general brotherhood."
