Concerning the famine in India, the question has been asked, "Could it not have been prevented in some way by the government?" To this inquiry Rev. Rockwell Clancy responds in the Christian Endeavor World:

"If government could control the weather, then it might be possible to prevent famine. India is dependent on the great monsoon for its harvests. The monsoon blows over the land from the Indian Ocean, and first touches the southwest coast during the latter part of June, and then spreads over the country. The rains should continue till the end of September. The failure of the monsoon means famine."

Of course government cannot control the weather in any degree, and hence cannot prevent failure of crops; but the amount of money spent in organizing, drilling, equipping, and maintaining armies, and in building and maintaining navies would far more than suffice to relieve all the distress caused by famine in these days of rapid communication, when all the world is no larger, practically, than a single state a hundred years ago. And this to say nothing of the increased production if the men now withdrawn from industrial pursuits to learn the art of destroying life, were engaged in producing those things which sustain life. If the money which England is spending in the South African war were being spent in India in feeding the starving people, there would be no famine. It is true the crops failed in a large district, but it is stated that in the whole country there is grain enough to feed the people, but those who need it have not the means to buy. These facts are a fearful commentary on the boasted civilization of the nineteenth century, to say nothing of Christianity.
