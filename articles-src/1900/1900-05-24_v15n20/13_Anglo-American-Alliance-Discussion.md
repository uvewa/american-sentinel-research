The often-asserted but frequently denied alliance between this country and England refuses to down. The discussion of the question has been revived by the following language attributed to Ambassador Choate at a recent dinner in London:

"From people who have such mutual interests as these [American and British] you do not need loud professions of friendship. It would be hard, indeed, to dissolve such ties [as those between America and England], and actions speak louder than words."

Commenting upon this utterance the Inter Ocean, a strong administration organ, says: "Joseph Choate is this country's chief diplomatic representative abroad. Therefore his public utterances must always be measured by the diplomatic standard. Measured by that standard, his words can mean nothing less than that a diplomatic understanding—actual and binding—exists between the governments of the United States and Great Britain."

The Inter Ocean hastens to deny that any such understanding does exist, and to roundly denounce Mr. Choate for intimating such a thing. Meanwhile the people generally are left in uncertainty concerning the matter, but with the growing conviction that Mr. Choate's words did not belie the facts.
