The statement made last week, that millions of people in this country are pushing forward the project to make this a "Christian" government, so that the "revealed will of God" will be enforced as a part of the law of the land, may seem to the reader to grossly exaggerate the facts; nevertheless it is every bit true. The whole National Reform scheme is indorsed by Rev. Francis E. Clark, president of the great Christian Endeavor Society, which alone contains over two million members. Then there are the Christian Citizenship League, American Sabbath Union, W. C. T. U., Epworth League, League for Social Service, etc., aggregating millions more, all zealously working with the idea and aim of Christianizing the state. They do not realize that evil results will follow; they are for the most part excellent, earnest people, who think they are doing God service. But their ignorance and blind trust in the assurances of their leaders will not at all affect the nature of the result. Some of the worst things that ever happened in human history came as the result of a zeal that was not according to knowledge.
