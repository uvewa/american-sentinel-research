"The question of denominational union," says the Literary Digest, "is fast becoming one of the most important questions of the day in all Protestant lands. In Germany, as we have lately pointed out, a strong movement exists for the federation of the state churches, amounting to nearly fifty in number; and federation is one step on the road to organic union. In Scotland, the Congregationalists and the churches of the Evangelical Union—sometimes called Morrisanians—amalgamated their forces a short time ago; and the Free and United Presbyterian churches are to become organically one next October as already mentioned in these pages. In South Australia the three leading Methodist denominations and in Canada all the various Methodist bodies, have for some years been one. This is an encouraging record.

"Besides this measure of union already attained, there are promising movements under way in England. All the great Protestant churches outside the Establishment have for some years had a strong federal organization, as we have several times pointed out. During several years past an attempt has been made to unite organically two of the Methodist bodies—the Princeton Methodists and the Bible Christians. Both are off-shoots of the original Wesleyan parent stock, but separated from it on questions of church government. According to the London correspondent of The Advance (Cong.), the consummation of this event will be delayed for some years, however, since the two bodies can not agree on the subject of lay representation in the conference.

"In America, the recently organized Federation of Churches reports substantial progress, and will begin the new century with bright prospects. The recent success of federate mission endeavors in the great Ecumenical Council in New York, and the deliverances of the Methodist Episcopal General Conference in Chicago last month on the subject of Christian unity, are also regarded as favorable signs pointing to greater comity between the churches. It is significant also that the Protestant body which has made by far the most notable gain in membership during the past nine years is the one which refuses to be called by any other name than Christian or Disciples of Christ. This body, according to Dr. Carroll's latest statistics, in The Christian Advocate, gained 477,345 members during that period—a gain of seventy-one per cent.—and has now advanced to the sixth place among the Christian denominations in numerical strength."

Were these churches what churches ought to be, merely organizations for evangelistic work—if their object was purely gospel work,—there could be found in these facts nothing but cause of rejoicing. But when we remember that the church of to-day is becoming more and more political continually, we cannot close out eyes to the danger that lurks in this movement. The testimony of history is that gigantic religious combinations to effect political objects are always dangerous, and since the church is using her power more and more continually in this way there is danger to liberty of conscience in church federation.
