Yellow fever has reappeared in a threatening manner in Cuba, and now the question is being asked why it is necessary to maintain garrisons of United States troops in the island, exposed as they must be to the danger of attack from the dreaded scourge. The question is especially pertinent in view of the promise made by the Government to withdraw its forces when pacification was established, there being as complete peace in the island now as there is in the United States. The answer to the question must come from Washington.
