The Toronto World of June 29, reports a meeting of the executive board of the Ontario Lord's Day Alliance, in Toronto, at which "a report was made of a government investigation into the question of the necessity for opening the canals on the Lord's day." The investigation was not finished, and the question will be argued before the government at an early date.

The new secretary of the Alliance, Rev. J. G. Shearer, is to begin on August 15 a five or six weeks' tour of the Maratime Provinces and Quebec, accompanied by Rev. F. A. Cassidy, of Guelph, Ont., and together they will organize Lord's Day Alliances in that territory similar to the one that is now prominent in Ontario. Evidently this move is intended as a step toward securing Sunday legislation by the Dominion parliament.
