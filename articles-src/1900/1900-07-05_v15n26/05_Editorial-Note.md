The mission of Christianity is to proclaim "liberty to the captives" and "the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound." Isa. 61:1. Who can harmonize this truth with the shutting up of people in prison by means of the Sunday laws, in the alleged interests of the "Christian Sabbath" and for the promotion of "Christian morality"?
