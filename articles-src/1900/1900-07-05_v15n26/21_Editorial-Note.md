The St. James Gazette thinks that "China is teaching the United States the impossibility of a great trading nation avoiding imperialism," and adds: "America's experience will teach her it is not the desire to grab distant lands, but unavoidable destiny that drives Great Britain ever forward. Washington has no choice but to protect the imperiled American citizens, and having once interfered in China to protect her interests, she shall never be able to shake from her shoes the dust of the celestial empire."
