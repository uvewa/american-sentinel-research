A dispatch from San Juan de Porto Rico, under date of June 27, says: "At a teachers' conference, held here yesterday evening, Dr. Saldana, a member of the insular board of education, during the course of an address remarked that the Catholic religion should again be introduced into the public schools of Porto Rico.

"Dr. Campos Valladares, a Portuguese Presbyterian, superintendent of public instruction in Brazil, took exception to Dr. Saldana's remark, and, turning to Bishop Blenk (the bishop of Porto Rico), he said, in substance, that the Catholic church had been negative in results in all the South American countries, asserting that the illiteracy prevailing there was due entirely to the church's influence. This remark caused great excitement. No sooner were the words uttered than Bishop Blenk jumped to his feet, and, striking the table with his closed fist, shouted: 'It's a lie,' adding, 'I will not sit quietly and hear the church of which I am the representative in Porto Rico produced in such language.'

"After a painful silence, by a common impulse the adherents of the bishop shouted as with one voice: 'Long live Catholicism,' and the incident was closed, though it has aroused much feeling."

This is a point upon which Rome is very tender. It was very inconsiderate, to say the least, for Dr. Valladares to give utterances to such a distasteful truth in the presence of a Catholic bishop. Possibly, however, he did it to give the bishop opportunity to show what manner of spirit he was of.
