The more the advocates of Sunday laws try to maintain the day as a civil institution, the less will Sunday appeal to the minds of men as a religious institution. The day cannot be both civil and religious, and to advocate its observance from a civil standpoint can only detract from what is said in its behalf from a religious standpoint, and weaken the religious regard for the day which the advocates of Sunday laws really wish above all other things to secure. The more its observance is decreed by law, the more will Sunday take on the character of a holiday rather than a holy day.
