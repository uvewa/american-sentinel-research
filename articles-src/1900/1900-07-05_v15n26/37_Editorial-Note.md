The St. Petersburger Zeitung remarks that "the United States government is reported to have ordered its consuls in South America to report on the numbers and attitude of the German settlers in South America," and then adds, "It is hardly to be believed that the Washington government can be so foolish as to meddle with matters which are absolutely no business of theirs. Germans have a right to settle where they please, as numerously as they please." "It is notable that the French press," says the Zeitung, "also aims to make Germany and the United States enemies. The French have not forgiven the disaster to Spain, and they are anxious to involve the United States in a quarrel with a real power."
