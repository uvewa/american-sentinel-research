A Seventh-day Adventist barber of Newark, Ohio, named Dorsey, was arrested for keeping his shop open Sunday, June 19, and was fined $13 and costs, amounting in all to $17. This was done at the instigation of the barbers' union. The Sunday law of Ohio provides an exemption for those who observe the seventh day, which Mr. Dorsey has regularly done; but this did not interfere at all with the prosecution brought against him for working on Sunday. And this illustrates about how valuable these Sunday law exemption clauses are as a protection to conscientious observers of the seventh day, when their enemies are determined to make them trouble for doing Sunday work. This is the third case of prosecution of conscientious Christians under the Sunday laws that we have reported within a month.
