# Uncertainties Log - v15n26 (1900-07-05)

No significant uncertainties were encountered in this transcription. The Mistral OCR output was generally clear and readable.

## Notes

- The OCR source contained some table formatting artifacts in the masthead section that were preserved as closely as possible to the original layout.
- Page header numbers (402-416) were noted but not transcribed as article content.
- Advertisements on pages 14-16 were not transcribed as article files per project guidelines.
- One date on page 16 appeared as "CHICAGO, JULY 5, 1906" in the image caption but context confirms this should be 1900 (likely an OCR or printing error in the original scan).
