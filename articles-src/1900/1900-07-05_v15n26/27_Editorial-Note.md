The New York Herald, hitherto credited with strong leaning toward imperialism, now says:

"Imperialism is a military, not a commercial ambition, and is one that, by a strange fatality, destroys those that cherish it. The republics of history lie buried in the ashes of empire. Is the United States getting ready to be added to the heap?"

Nevertheless we believe that the imperialism that now afflicts the United States is commercial rather than military. It is inspired by the greed of the classes rather than by the mistaken "patriotism" of the masses.
