Former Congressman Brigham H. Roberts, of Utah, was convicted recently in the District Court in Salt Lake on the charge of sustaining the relation of husband to each of two women at the same time. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $150 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for one hundred and fifty days. "Notice of an appeal to the State Supreme Court was given on the ground that the information upon which the defendant was tried charged that the offense had been committed in Salt Lake county, while one of the women lived in Davis county. This practically amounts to contending that a man is not guilty of polygamy or kindred offenses provided he only has one wife in each of the twenty-seven counties in the State."
