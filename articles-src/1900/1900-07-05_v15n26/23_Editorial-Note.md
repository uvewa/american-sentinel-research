The Inter Ocean's London correspondent thinks that "Germany dreams of an empire to rival Great Britain's; at present she seeks a great share of the world's commerce; and soon she will be willing to use her guns to get it and to defend it; she avows no territorial aspirations, but if the opportunity arises she will exploit South America as England has exploited Africa."
