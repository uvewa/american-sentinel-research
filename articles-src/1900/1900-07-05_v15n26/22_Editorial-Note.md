A correspondent of the N. Y. Independent, writing of saloons in Manila, says: "I do not believe our advent to the Philippines has yet caused any appreciable increase of drinking among the islanders; this effect may possibly come later. We have brought our own vices to this land, and up to the present time we alone indulge in intemperance. When the Filipinos consider the matter at all, they say our men are fools not to realize their excesses will eventually kill them, and they marvel at the American lack of self-control in the matter of drinking as exemplified by our army."
