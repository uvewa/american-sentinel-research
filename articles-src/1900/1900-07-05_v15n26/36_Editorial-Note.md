The Koloniale Zeitschrift (Berlin), one of the jingo members of the German press says:

"The Americans no longer connect ideas of liberty with the views expressed by Monroe. Materialism, imperialism, and low selfishness are their predominant motives, as the annexation of Hawaii and the Spanish-American war have shown. The Monroe doctrine is a mere phrase, which does not find approval in South America or in Europe. But phrases frighten nobody, and it is doubtful that the Yankees want war for the sake of phrases. The power of the United States is not overrated in Europe as much as in America. The Americans should remember that their offer to take part in the settlement of Crete was met by a pitying smile, and that their hero Dewey became silent when Admiral von Diedriches ordered his ships ready for action. If the United States were actually to uphold the Monroe doctrine, the answer would come from the mouth of cannon."
