A PARTIAL report which has been made by the Philippine Commission, affirms that independence is not desired by the more intelligent classes in the islands. It does pronounce, however, in favor of leaving the question of title to property claimed by the religious orders to be settled by the courts of justice, and even suggests the propriety of dividing this property up into small parcels, to be sold to the people. Meanwhile a new Philippine Commission, with a United States Circuit judge at its head, has been appointed by the President, the special mission of which, it is said, will be the establishment of a civil government for the islands.
