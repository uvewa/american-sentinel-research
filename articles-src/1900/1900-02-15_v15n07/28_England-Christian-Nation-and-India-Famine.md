If England were a Christian nation, would she be more aroused over the fact that a republic in South Africa opposes the march of her empire through that continent than over the fact that many millions of her subjects in India are stricken with famine, suffering from hunger and disease,—men, women, and little children wasting to skeletons—who must perish unless some friendly hand is reached out to help them? Would England now be spending her millions and taxing all her mighty resources to conquer a foreign people and deny to them the right of self-government, instead of to relieve the dreadful distress of human beings in India who look to her for help, if she were truly a Christian nation? Who can answer this question in the affirmative?
