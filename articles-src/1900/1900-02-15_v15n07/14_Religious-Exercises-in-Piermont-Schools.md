The controversy in the public schools at Piermont, N. Y., growing out of the attempt to compel attendance of the children at religious exercises, which was opposed by Catholic parents, has been settled by the following decision rendered by State Superintendent Skinner:

"It is a violation of the school law to compel children to attend religious services after the hour of school opening, and the reading of the Bible in the public schools is also prohibited. As far back as 1838 the superintendent of common schools laid down this decision: 'Neither the common school system nor any other social system can be maintained unless the conscientious views of all are equally respected.'"
