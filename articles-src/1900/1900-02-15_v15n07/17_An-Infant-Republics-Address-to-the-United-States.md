The following is an extract from what is described by London newspapers as a remarkable document emanating from the office of the Secretary of State at Pretoria, capital of the Transvaal Republic, dated December 16, 1899. It is an appeal to the great powers of the world against being starved into submission by Great Britain, but seems especially addressed to the United States, of which power it says:—

"Since, in 1870, the President of the United States acknowledged our republic as a sovereign state, Americans have flocked here in numbers. In every instance the hand of fellowship has been extended to them. Not a single case of disagreement is on record, but with the first war note of the oppressor we are informed that America is acting in league with the enemy. If our sister republic has no sympathy with us, if the boasted condescension of the British is to be preferred to sincerity and truth, we will no longer believe in the justice and integrity of the American nation, and her profession of Christianity we will consider empty sound."
