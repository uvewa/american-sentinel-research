LAST Sunday morning "Father" McGrath, a Roman Catholic of this city, with his flock was admitted to the Lafayette Ave. Baptist Church, and later in the forenoon to the Episcopal Guild Hall. In both places he conducted the regular service of his church. Altar boys were in attendance to chant and perform their part, and full mass was said. Mr. McGrath was deeply moved by the "Christianity" manifested by these Protestants toward him and his people. Well, what is Protestantism here now anyway? ADDIE BOWEN.

Buffalo, N. Y., Jan. 12, 1900.
