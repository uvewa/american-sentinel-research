Not long ago a well-meaning critic of the AMERICAN SENTINEL took exception to some things the SENTINEL was saying of the policy of the present American administration, and in support of the objection cited the Scripture text "thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people."

This only illustrates the necessity for such a publication as the SENTINEL is designed to be. There is no "ruler" of the American people. This is a government of the people by the people. But there are powerful forces actively at work in the Government which if not checked must very soon result in creating a ruler for the people and turn this Republic into a monarchy. There are those in high political office who are willing to assume and accept power to which they have no right, and make themselves actual rulers of the people if the people are not vigilant to preserve their rights.

And right at this time, when vigilance and a clear discernment of the situation are so much needed, there are many who, like our critic, have the idea that to criticise the acts of the administration is to speak evil of the ruler of the people. That is just why it is necessary to call attention to the departure from republican principles in the Government. The SENTINEL is only pointing out that there is no "ruler" of the American people, and ought to be none; and if the people would view what it says in the proper light, they would be aroused to prevent the consummation of the monarchical movement that is in progress. But if already they have the idea that the Executive at Washington is a ruler of the people instead of their servant, what hope can there be for the maintenance of free government unless they can be aroused to their error?

There are, and should be, rulers of the American people, but no ruler; there should be government "by the people" of the people, but no government of the people by one man, or by any scheme which does not allow full popular representation.
