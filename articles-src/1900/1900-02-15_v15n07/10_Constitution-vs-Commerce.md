The problem with which the Government has to deal in determining the political status of the newly-acquired island territory—the conflict which is presented between "sentiment" and trade interests, between the demands of the Constitution and those of commerce—is described in this quotation from an article on "Government in Our New Possessions," by Judge H. G. Curtis, of the Insular Commission, in *The Outlook*:—

"Free trade must, of course, follow any declaration or action which brings these islands within our boundary limits and makes them an integral part of the Union, because the Constitutional provision is imperative that rates of duty shall be uniform throughout the United States, and no duty can be charged on goods imported from any State. This includes territories and districts as well as states; otherwise we would collect in New York duties on goods from Arizona, and from New York to the District of Columbia or any other territory.

"This is one of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution. It was the leading cause for calling the Constitutional Convention; it was the only reason assigned in the 'Virginia Resolutions' which started the movement for a Constitution and a more perfect union. The islands of Porto Rico and the Philippines can and would supply, with their soil and cheap labor, all the sugar which the United States could consume, all the tobacco which we could use, and all the semi-tropical fruits, rice, and many other things that could find a market in the United States. All would come in competition with the products of this land, which we have so long striven to protect.

"Free from all duty or control, all our tobacco industries in eight States, all the infant and projected beet-sugar industries, and all the fruit-growing of California and Florida, would be irretrievably ruined. Is the mere sentiment of giving to these people a territorial government or legislation passed by Congress worth the injury to our own people and productions which it must entail? Are not our own people, who have made this country great, entitled to some consideration? Shall we be driven upon these rocks by the baseless cry of 'imperialism' or 'militarism?'"

This only illustrates the inevitable difficulties in which the nation has become involved by the unamerican policy of foreign conquest. The ship of state has to be steered between Scylla and Charybdis, and danger is discerned upon only one side of the course. There are trade evils to be encountered if the Constitution is adhered to; but all the dangers they present are as nothing to those which lie in the way of what is now described as "outside the Constitution." Imperialism and militarism are rocks which have wrecked and are wrecking the greatest governments the earth has known. There is no safety save in a return to the former course.
