ROMANS 13:1 is often quoted to prove that all should yield implicit obedience to civil government, right or wrong. But the fact is that it teaches something very different from this, namely, that every soul should be subject to "the higher powers"—"the principalities and powers in heavenly places" (Eph. 3:10)—all of which are in turn subject to Jesus Christ. In short, Rom. 13:1 simply puts in other phrase the latter part of Acts 5:29: "We ought to obey God rather than men."

Nor is this a strained interpretation. The Scriptures plainly teach that Christ's is the higher power. Speaking by inspiration of God, as we learn from Num. 24:5–7, Balaam said: "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his King shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted."

Again, in Ps. 89:27 we read these words: "I will make him my first-born higher than the kings of the earth."

These texts both, beyond a doubt, refer to Christ. "Water," singular, is frequently used in the Scriptures as the symbol of divine truth. To the woman at the well, the Saviour said: "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water." He would have given her the word of God, which "is living and powerful." (Heb. 4:12), and which "is spirit" and "life." John 6:63.

But "waters," plural, is used as a symbol of "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." Rev. 17:15. With these facts in mind, read again Num. 24:5–7, and it will be at once apparent that the import of Balaam's prophecy is that by the pouring out of the water of life through the preaching of the divine word, God will have children in every nation; which is also plainly declared in Rev. 7:9, where in describing the throng of the redeemed, John says: "I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne."

Such is the kingdom of Him who is "higher than Agag"—"higher than the kings of the earth;" and whose are "the higher powers."

To the Ephesians, the apostle wrote of the power that the Father wrought in the Son "when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion." See Eph. 1:15-22. This authority Christ now has "as a son over his own house; which house are we."

God's people, while in the world, are not of the world, even as he is not of the world. See John 15:19. They are "strangers and pilgrims in the earth." Heb. 11:13. They are sojourners "in the land of promise as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles." Verse 9. Like Abraham, they look "for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Verse 10. They are subjects, not of earthly rulers, but of the heavenly King, for in behalf of all such it is plainly declared, "Our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body." Phil. 3:20, R. V.

But being subjects of the heavenly King does not exempt us from being subject to the eternal principles of justice ordained by God himself. All men "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." Governments exist in the overruling providence of God to conserve these rights. Hence, Christians "must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience" sake." They must obey, "not with eye-service, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart."

"There is no power but of God." Said the boastful Pilate to the Saviour, "Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and that I have power to release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above." Thus it appears that even the power by which men commit sin is from God; hence the charge of the Lord against the children of Israel: "Thou hast made me to serve with thy sins." Isa. 43:24.

Civil government, as we now know it, was no part of God's original plan, any more than was divorce which he subsequently permitted through Moses. God designed to govern man himself through love, and that he might do this he endued him with social and moral qualities. He gave him love of order, a sense of justice, and the instinct of self preservation. These attributes in unfallen men would make them the willing subjects of the Creator. The same attributes would lead fallen men to associate themselves together for mutual protection and cooperation, and to secure that order which men naturally desire. God is never taken by surprise. He provides before hand for every possible contingency. He provided civil government as a means whereby a race of rebels might be saved from anarchy and consequent self-destruction.

"God is love," and when in consonance with his character he cannot, because of man's sin, do for him what he otherwise would do, he does the very best thing that can be done under the circumstances. The original law of marriage contained no provision for divorcement. Because of the hardness of their hearts Moses permitted it. "But from the beginning it was not so." Matt. 19:7, S. The Creator himself would not compel those to live together who were not united in heart; and so the Lord through Moses permitted divorce. But this is not and never was intended for those who are truly the children of God. To permit men to put away their wives when there was no agreement in the married life, was simply the best thing that even the Creator could do for those who, because of the hardness of their hearts, were not subject to the divine marriage law.

In like manner, to permit civil government among men, was the best thing that God could do for a race that had refused his divine rule. Since men would not willingly submit themselves to their Creator in all things, as they would not yield themselves to the God of love that he might work in each one to love his neighbor as himself, they must, for the preservation of the race, be compelled to submit themselves one to another in civil things, that is, in their relations one with another. "But from the beginning it was not so."

"The powers that be are ordained of God;" that is, the genus of government is implanted in the very nature of man. It was this governing power that gave Adam such complete mastery over the beasts. And it is because some men have more of this power than others that some are natural leaders. But while God has ordained governmental power, he has no more ordained the abuse of this power than he has the abuse of any of the powers of mind and body so often misused. The misuse of any God-given power (and all our powers are God-given) is sin. And it is sin just as much in the ruler as in the subject. Even nations are subject to the supreme rule of right. This principle is recognized in the Declaration of Independence in the statement that the United Colonies have "full power" to do all "things which free and independent States may of right do."

And this higher law of right is the rule of the Christian. He asks not, What says the civil code? But, What is right? Not, What says the state? But, What says the God of heaven? Thus, always and in every place he is subject to the "higher powers," to the "principalities and powers in heavenly places." And being thus subject he wrongs no man, for he loves his neighbor as himself, and "Love is the fulfilling of the law." C. P. B.
