A CORRESPONDENT inquires how we can know which day is the seventh day commanded to be observed as the Sabbath. "Unless a record of the seventh day has been kept from creation down," he says, "no one can tell when the seventh day comes round."

There are several proofs by which our friend can determine just when the seventh day comes round.

First, the seventh day is the day immediately preceding the first day of the week. We never heard that anybody had any trouble in locating the first day of the week; and as the indefiniteness of the seventh day is always asserted as an argument for the observance of the first day, the latter is conceded to be a definitely-located day, and from this as a basis the seventh day may be found, as stated.

But if our inquirer does not make his statement in behalf of Sunday, but believes the first day to be as indefinite as the seventh day, then we can cite him to the fact that not only has a record of the original seventh day been kept from creation down, but the seventh day itself has been so kept.

The original seventh day was the seventh day from the beginning of creation; and the setting apart of that day as the Sabbath for mankind, made the week. The weekly cycle of time has existed from Adam's day to our own.

The Creator blessed and sanctified (set apart) the original seventh day, and his law declares, "the seventh day"—the one he blessed and sanctified—"is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and commands "in it thou shalt not do any work." If the original seventh day were to become lost, this part of the divine law would fail, because men could not remember to keep holy a Sabbath day which they had lost track of and could not find; and God would be unjust in requiring of mankind something they could not perform. If there were any possibility of his Sabbath day becoming lost, that possibility would no doubt have been in the mind of the Creator when he ordained the Sabbath, and he would have taken measures for its preservation. So to question whether the seventh day has been lost or not, is really to question whether the purpose of God in giving the Sabbath has failed or not, which is to question whether God is omniscient and omnipotent, or is no real God at all.

The Creator pointed out the Sabbath day to the Jews shortly after they left Egypt; and as he certainly knew which day was the seventh day, it is certain the Jews at that time knew when the seventh day "came round." And they began as a nation to observe the Sabbath at that time, and have continued its observance from that day to this. So our inquirer has only to make note of the day observed by the Jews, to know just what day is the seventh day commanded by the Creator.

Finally, it is recorded of the holy women who came to the sepulchre of Jesus to anoint his body, that they "returned and prepared sweet spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment." And the next day, when they came again to the sepulchre, was "the first day of the week." So the Sabbath day according to the commandment—which was the day God sanctified and blessed at creation—is located at the time of the resurrection of Christ as being the day immediately preceding the "first day of the week." And the first day of the week has certainly not been lost since that time.

There has never, indeed, been any occasion in the history of the world for the week to get lost. From earliest times, its different days were dedicated to the different heathen gods, from the sun to saturn, and they were as prominent in the transactions of the world anciently as they are to-day. They could no more get lost anciently than they can to-day.

Both the heathen world and the people of God have preserved the week, with its seventh day, from earliest times down to the present; and their records agree to-day, and always have agreed. So it is absolutely beyond question that the seventh day of our week and the seventh day of creation week are one and the same day.
