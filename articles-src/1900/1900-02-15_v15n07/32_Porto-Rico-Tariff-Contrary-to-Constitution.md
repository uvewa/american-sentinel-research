THE imposition of a tariff upon Porto Rican products, now that the island belongs to the United States, is clearly contrary to the Constitution, and is vigorously denounced by American journals, even by those which have favored the policy by which Porto Rico became United States property. The Evening Post, of this city, says this proposed measure will be "an act of unparalleled and shameful cruelty," "so cruel, so heartless, so charged with disaster and starvation for 1,000,000 human beings, that to adopt it would entitle Spain, or Russia, or even Turkey, to send missionaries to us." And The Independent, as we mentioned last week, condemns it in terms hardly less strong.

But what else was to be expected? The imperial policy is a heartless policy; and why should any one who advocates it be surprised that heartless measures should be the outcome? It is all only what is demanded by the "interests of trade," and these interests are in most governments the controlling force to-day.
