NEGOTIATIONS which have been in progress for some time with Great Britain, in respect to rights claimed by the latter touching the prospective Nicaragua Canal, have been concluded, and the United States is to build and operate the canal. But it is realized that the canal must be fortified to guard American interests in case of war with a naval power; and this question will receive the attention of the Government. And now an engineer who has been connected with the preliminary work already done comes forward and says the best way would be for the United States to annex Nicaragua and Costa Rica; and then "we would be able to do whatever we wished regarding the canal." This is very suggestive of more "expansion."
