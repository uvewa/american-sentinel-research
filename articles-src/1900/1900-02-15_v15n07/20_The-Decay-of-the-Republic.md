### THE CONTRAST OF TO-DAY WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, AS SEEN BY AN OBSERVER OF FOUR SCORE YEARS.

Highland Park, Ill., Jan. 25, 1900.

**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:**

Your little paper, the SENTINEL, is the most pithy, forceful and cogent publication that comes to my table among more than a dozen prints of the day. I read it for the comfort and consolation it gives me by calling my mind back to the halcyon days of boyhood, of the first quarter of this waning century, when patriotism was not measured by dollars, nor love of liberty a grinning pretense; in fact, to the days when the great American Republic was buoyant with hope and growth, and monarchists and imperialists were not suspected to have a habitat within our national limits. But alas, as I enter my four score years and calmly wait my sunset whose rays are wrapped in drifts of lurid smoke, I rather court the hour, than dread the moment's pain, of ceasing to look on our decaying Republic. Already it has passed beyond reclaim. Would that I had gone before my eyes had looked upon power and dominion as paramount to individual liberty!

Webster prayed that his dying eyes might not look upon a dissevered union; but little did he then pause to reflect that "union," power and dominion are and always have been the basis of human bondage and individual servitude. We slaughtered half a million of our people, destroyed twelve billion dollars worth of property, starved and mained more than half a million more, in a four years' domestic war, all for the "union," which is now only another term for "dominion." To do that we raised, equipped, and educated three millions of soldiers, and by so doing laid the foundation for an imperial military monarchy, which is as firmly buttressed on wealth and military power and a military spirit of our people, as is the empire of any nation on earth. We cannot turn back, we cannot change a destiny, which we have, for forty years, almost unanimously acquiesced in, however much parties or individuals may have differed at intervals as to methods.

Therefore let me say, your golden words of wisdom, which fill your every issue of the SENTINEL are wasted on noxious air. Individual liberty must become a myth save as to our rulers; not of the populace, nor need it be, for the populace have had their day, and have proved to be both ignorant, criminal and corruptible.

I read your most excellent paper, however, for auld lang syne, and then file it in our little city library, where I hope it meets the eyes of many of our people. It will at least serve to show how far we have already drifted from the moorings our grandsires marked for our safety. COL. P. T. TURNLEY.
