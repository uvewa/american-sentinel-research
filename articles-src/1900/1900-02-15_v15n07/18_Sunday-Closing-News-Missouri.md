### MISSOURI.

A friend in Quenweg, Mo., sends us the following newspaper reports of a crusade for the enforcement of the Sunday law against saloons, in Jasper County and vicinity:—

"Jasper County was drier yesterday than the worst prohibition town in Kansas. From Central City to astute Carthage not a drop of liquor was sold over the bar. Even in Webb City and Carterville, where for years the saloon men knew no Sunday, the mandates of the law were respected. Joplin saloon men were given a tip last Saturday, so it is said, that Prosecuting Attorney Shannon had made up his mind to prosecute any further violations of the Sunday-closing law, and inasmuch as the officers had been kind enough to put the saloon-keepers on their guard, the latter readily took the hint. Of course the saloon men do not like it, but they must stand for it. Sunday has always been counted as the biggest day for the liquor business in Joplin, and if the closing is to be made permanent, some of the numerous places will be obliged to close up!"

"Prosecuting Attorney H. L. Shannon is arranging to file information against ten or a dozen Joplin liquor license holders who failed to close their saloons last Sunday in compliance with an order from the attorney in question. Delay is necessitated in filing the information by the difficulty in ascertaining just who is proprietor of each saloon. The records must be consulted.

"Joplin's saloons closed up on Sunday of their own accord, just before the grand jury went into session, and this fact was perhaps responsible for their not getting the notification to close at the same time Carterville was notified which caused some complaint at the latter place. Now, however, several Joplin saloons still open Sundays, and will be proceeded against.

"Webb City saloons have been kept closed on Sundays of late by the city authorities, though at one time it was so generally recognized that her saloons kept open anyway that the city added $10 to the regular monthly license of $50 for Sunday opening."
