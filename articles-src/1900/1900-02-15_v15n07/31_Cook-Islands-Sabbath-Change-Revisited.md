THE governmental authorities in the Cook Islands have recently, by law, changed the Sabbath observed there from the seventh to the first day of the week. Previous to this, everybody had been observing the seventh day and working on the first day, even those people who believed in Sunday observance and by whose efforts the change to Sunday was brought about. But now, people in the islands who believe in observing the seventh day, are to be punished by fine or hard labor for continuing to do what all the people were doing only a short time before, and what had always been done since the islands were first discovered. (See p. 99.) This is the spirit of all Sunday legislation.
