Here is a paragraph from a report of the recent assault on Ladysmith:—

"The men on both sides are reported to have fought like demons, the horror and bewilderment of the scene presenting a picture without parallel in the experience of those who took part in the encounter."

The expression used, "fought like demons," is a well-known one in the description of battles. It is very appropriate, too; but if, as we are continually assured, war is consistent with Christianity, and is even at times a part of Christianity, why do we not sometimes hear of men "fighting like angels"? Surely this ought to be the case when two "Christian nations" engage in war. Ah, everybody knows that there is nothing angelic about war, and it is only Jesuitical casuistry that enables anybody to reconcile it with Christianity.—London Present Truth.
