The following "Sabbath law" has, after much agitation upon the subject, been enacted by the Parliament of the Cook Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean:

"CHRISTMAS DAY ACT, 1899.

"An act to regulate the calendar and assimilate the days of the week and months to those of other countries east of the 180th degree of longitude.

"Be it enacted by the parliament of the Cook Islands, with the approval of the British resident.

"The short title of this act shall be the 'Christmas Day Act, 1899.'

"2. The 25th and 26th of December of the New Zealand Calendar shall be observed as the Christmas day within the islands of the Cook group, and shall be treated as one day, and be called the 25th day of December, 1899. It shall further be held that the day following the said 25th shall be Tuesday, the 26th day of December.

"3. It shall not be lawful for any one to follow his or her calling or ordinary employment, or do any work for profit or reward on the Sabbath day, as fixed by this act.

"Provided always that work of an urgent nature such as loading or unloading of vessels, shall not be deemed to be prohibited by this section.

"4. Any offense under this act may be punished by a fine of not exceeding ten shillings, or in default not exceeding three days' hard labor on the public roads."

The purpose and significance of this action are well stated by an exchange, as follows:—

"The 'Sabbath day as fixed by this act' is Sunday. The first missionaries who labored in these islands, and through whose labors the people were induced to profess Christianity, took no notice of the day line (longitude 180°), but kept on reckoning the days of the week just as they did at home. Therefore what they called the first day of the week was really the seventh day. All these many years the natives have been observing the Sabbath day, supposing that it was Sunday. But since seventh-day Christians came among them the difference has become so conspicuous that the people who believe in Sunday observance began to demand that the calendar be corrected by law and so 'assimilate the days of the week to those of other countries.' The Catholics began the agitation, and the missionaries of the London Missionary Society joined them in the effort.

"Of course this is all done in order that there may be no mistake in the matter of Sunday observance. It did not make any difference until the fact was emphasized that the day on which the people observed the Sabbath was the Sabbath of the commandment—the seventh day of the week. As long as they observed the day as Sunday, the first day of the week, it was all right; but when some began to observe it as the Sabbath of the Lord, which it really is, the importance of being like the world was suddenly appreciated. Observing the Sabbath on the seventh day was a blow to Sunday observance which the advocates of the Sunday Sabbath could not endure; hence the civil law was called in to rectify the matter, and give to the first day of the week the prominence deemed to be its due. Sunday observers often argue (when other argument fails) that it does not matter which day you keep, if you observe one day in seven; but the argument usually includes the provisos that that one day be on Sunday, and that the institution be supported by state law."
