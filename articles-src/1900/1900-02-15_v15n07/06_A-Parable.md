BY ROYAL HUBBELL.

A good little boy sat upon his mama's doorstep industriously powdering and sifting brick-dust with which to scour the cutlery.

This was a laudable and innocent occupation; but a big, bad boy came along, bent on mischief.

"Your dust is weak, little boy," said he; "here, take some of this black sand and mix with it; and here are some nice little sticks for you to play with."

APPLICATION:— The N. W. C. T. U. and other similar societies were using the scouring religion of Christ to cleanse rusty and spotted humanity. What could be more beautiful? But wily Satan ever on the alert says: "Oh, but your religion is too weak by itself! Here, take some of the black sand of politics and civil government and mix with it to make it strong!"

And, one of these days' many innocent and undesigning people will awaken to the fact that the little fiery match-stick of sectarian hate has touched the black and white powder of politics and religion: and there will burst the bomb of religious persecution that will cripple and scar many of their brethren for whom Christ died.
