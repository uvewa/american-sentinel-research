Why cannot we be honest in our utterances touching the territories we have recently acquired? Really, it would save time and trouble, to say nothing of life and treasure, to come out frankly with the announcement that we have annexed these possessions in cold blood, and that we intend to utilize them to our profit and advantage. All this talk about benevolent assimilation; all this hypocritical pretense of anxiety for the moral, social, and intellectual exaltation of the natives; all this transparent parade of responsibility and deep-seated purpose—all this deceives nobody, avails nothing, helps us not an inch in the direction of profit, dignity, and honor. We all know, down in our hearts, that these islands, groups, etc., are important to us only in the ratio of their practical possibilities. We value them by the standard of their commercial usefulness, and by no other.—Washington Post (D. C.), Jan. 14.
