BY B. W. MARSH.

NEVER in the history of mankind has there been such a disposition to say one thing and do another as at the present time. The sayings of the people are as directly opposite to that which is actually being done as is possible for them to be. The history of nations could be made up of violated promises and unredeemed pledges, and the Scripture that "there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land," would in this strange time seem to meet the completeness of its fulfilment. The situation as summed up by the prophet and apostle is sufficiently startling to awaken anyone who cares to lay their words alongside present-day happenings. "Ever learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth," says the apostle, and the prophet adds, "In transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter." 1 Tim. 3:7; Isa. 59:13, 14.

The unfulfilled promises, and broken pledges lying at the gateway of nations are sufficient comment on this awful truth. Here is one from the Denver Evening Post:—

"Says Peace but Intends War. Russia's Part in the Oriental Overture about to Begin is Very Clearly Indicated. The czar has given the most pronounced vocal assurances of his peaceable inclinations and intentions. *This was the necessary prelude.* With that assurance taken seriously nobody can look for military movements in Russia. Yet 75,000 troops have left Tiflis in Transcaucasia for Baku on the western coast of the Caspian sea. From there they will cross at once to Krasnovodsk, whence they will proceed to Kanschka, the frontier station on the borders of Afghanistan. Events rapidly transpiring there make their advance on Herat a necessity. Believing in the peaceable assurances of the czar, the British, in India have of course nothing to fear, not until the Russians are massed on the Indian frontier.

"It was probably an oversight on the part of the czar that he failed to couple with his peaceable assurances a statement that Russia is not making any preparations for war. He might have said that, for it is the truth. *All preparations have already been made.* In Siberia as close to the frontier of British India as it is possible to take them without crossing the line, 250,000 troops are now assembled. Meanwhile England is calling for volunteers to go to South Africa, the regular force having been exhausted. *The British are depending on the czar's peaceable assurances, and the czar on his army made ready for the fray.* General Yonaff, recently designated for the especially-important command of the Russian forces in the semi-Reitschensk district, has already established his headquarters in Kanschka, while the Russian squadron in Port Arthur and in the Persian gulf is increasing. It is well to bear this in mind, together with the peaceable assurances of the czar."

And now word comes from St. Petersburg that Russian rule is about to be established in Persia through the medium of an immense loan payable in seventy-five years. The whole scheme is plain enough; Russia is forcing an outlet to the sea. If she cannot get it through the Dardanelles, she will be satisfied for the present with the Persian gulf. She assures England that she means peace, and for fear that England will interfere with her peaceful(?) intentions, she has amassed an army of 325,000 men on the Af. han and India frontier to enforce respect for her peaceful assurances while she throws her web around Persia, and presses a little closer about the Sick Man of the East. "They say and do not;" they say, "Peace, peace, when there is no peace," and "when they shall say peace and safety, sudden destruction cometh upon them." And who can say that the time has not come?
