## Article 08, "They Say and Do Not"

- **Location:** Body text
- **Issue:** The word "Afghanistan" appears to be partially obscured or garbled in the OCR; the phrase reads "Af. han and India frontier" where a period and space break what should be "Afghanistan." The OCR likely split the word across a column or line.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Af. han and India frontier" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source, since this is an OCR artifact reflecting the original print column break.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the intended word is clearly "Afghan" (i.e., Afghanistan), but the OCR has introduced a break. Transcribed faithfully per the OCR source.

## Article 22, "Smoking Stunts the Growth of Boys"

- **Location:** Opening word
- **Issue:** The article begins "WRATEVER" in the OCR source, which is clearly an OCR misread of "WHATEVER" (the "H" was misread as "R").
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "WRATEVER" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source per accuracy policy. Reviewer may wish to confirm against the original PDF.
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "WHATEVER" in the original; the OCR error is clear, but the transcription policy requires preserving what the OCR source provides unless confirmed otherwise.

## General Note

This issue was split from the Mistral OCR dump. The OCR source was of generally good quality. No library stamps or physical damage noted in the OCR output. The page structure (8 pages per issue, 16 pages in OCR numbering due to double-sided scanning) was consistent throughout.

The "Af. han" fragment in article 08 and "WRATEVER" in article 22 are the only two notable textual anomalies requiring documentation.
