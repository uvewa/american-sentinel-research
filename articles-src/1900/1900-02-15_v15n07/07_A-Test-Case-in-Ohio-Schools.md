BY ROY F. COTTRELL.

For several weeks an intense interest has been taken in a religious educational controversy between the teachers and the school board of New Antioch, Ohio. The opening exercises conducted by the principal consisted in Scripture reading without comment, and prayer. The assistant required her pupils to commit and recite in concert the Lord's Prayer as found in their Third Reader. The Board of Education being agnostic in sentiment, opposed this action; and, as the teachers would not yield, the matter was laid before the Court of Common Pleas. There a decision was rendered in favor of the Board: but, as the majority in the district are in sympathy with the teachers, the case has been appealed to the Circuit Court, and its verdict is now awaited. In the interim the school building has been locked against the teachers.

A weekly journal, in speaking of the bitter feeling caused by this "religious war," says: "It is simply agnosticism in the form of law vs. the Christian religion." But this conclusion neither logically nor rightfully follows. The fact that one lifts his voice against any religious exercises in the public schools, however brief or seemingly unimportant, does not place him in opposition to the Christian religion. On the contrary, the principles of true Protestantism forbid all state institutions from holding or teaching anything that favors in the least degree, any form of religion, whether Christian or pagan.

Our Saviour said, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's:" and in return Caesar (the state) is to demand only those things which are within his sphere. Outside this, in all matters that embrace our duty to God, rights of conscience, belief, or practise, the state has no sovereignty.

But is not this "a Christian nation"? and is it not just that the majority should rule? It has been declared such by our highest judicial authority. Is not that sufficient? Let us see. Has Caesar the power to make one individual a Christian? Has the highest earthly tribunal power to Christianize a nation? Never. God alone can change the heart of man, or proclaim a theocracy; and, until his Spirit operates and controls the individuals that make up our Government, it is not "a Christian nation."

Let it be granted that the majority make a profession; does this effect the principle involved?—Not at all. Given the right to favor a general form of religion and the principle is surrendered; for, that which sanctions a general form may with equal right sanction a particular form to the exclusion of all others. No person is to surrender his right to think and believe, and if a man has no faith in religion shall he be compelled to place his children in a school where religious exercises are held? And, more than this, shall his means be appropriated to support a system with which he has no sympathy?—Certainly not.

"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical." Justice is justice: right is right; and the slightest deviation from it is wrong.
