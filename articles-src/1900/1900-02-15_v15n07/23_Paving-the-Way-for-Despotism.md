### THE FRUIT OF THE NEW DOCTRINE OF GOVERNMENT "OUTSIDE THE CONSTITUTION."

"Springfield Republican."

The Senate committee on Porto Rico goes the full measure of the unconstitutional demands of the imperialist policy. It not only denies that the Federal Constitution is binding upon Congress in tax and tariff legislation for this and the other island dependencies; it denies that the Constitution is binding upon Congress in any particular where the territory of the United States, outside of the States within the Union, is concerned. For the majority of the committee say:—

"It is within our discretion to make the inhabitants of Porto Rico citizens of the United States or not; so it is within the power and discretion of Congress to make the inhabitants of the Philippines and other islands we may acquire citizens, or withhold that quality from them. It is also within the power of Congress to regulate and restrict and prohibit, if thought advisable, the passing of the inhabitants of the Philippines or other islands from their country into ours, or to prevent the products of their labor from coming into unjust competition with the labor of this country."

The sweeping and revolutionary nature of this contention will best appear by referring to the constitutional rule of citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States." But the committee say that persons born in Porto Rico or the Philippines, even though subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are not citizens and cannot be citizens until Congress chooses to confer that quality upon them.

Then it follows of course that when the Constitution provides that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude "shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction," it is within the power of Congress to establish slavery in Porto Rico or the Philippines or not, just as it chooses. For if the constitutional law of citizenship does not extend to all places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, the constitutional law of slavery does not extend any further. And if the people of the islands are not or are not to become citizens of the United States, what is or will be their status? What are they? To what power do they owe allegiance? And if to the United States, does our claim to their allegiance carry with it no reciprocal obligation in conferring the rights and privileges of citizenship? They would seem, according to the committee, to be political non-descripts—mere ciphers in the affairs of nations. They are political slaves and might almost as well be made industrial slaves, and it is accordingly meet that the Thirteenth or Slavery Amendment should be abrogated along with the Citizenship Amendment.

The Constitution again provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of press or speech. But as the Constitution is not binding on Congress when the territories are concerned, Congress can make what religious or newspaper laws it pleases in the territories. Congress is prohibited conditionally from passing bills of attainder or ex-post facto laws; but if the Senate committee is right it can pass all such bills and laws it pleases in the case of the territories. It can grant titles of nobility in the territories. It can, in short, do anything. It is bound by no restrictions. The fundamental law of the nation is suspended when it comes to the territories, and Congress is so far the most absolute despot that ever ruled—entirely without any responsibility to the subject people over which it exercises an unrepresentative sway.

This is the very flower and essence of imperialism. It only remains to be asked how long the Constitution is likely to remain binding upon Congress in the case of interstate legislation after it has so lightly been tossed aside in relation to all other territory coming within the jurisdiction of the United States.
