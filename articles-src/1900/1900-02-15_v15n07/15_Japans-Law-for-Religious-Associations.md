A PROPOSED law for the control of religious associations in Japan has been presented to the Japanese House of Peers, and from present indications it is thought likely that it will be passed. The proposed measure is interesting in that it puts Christian churches on the same plane as regards rights and privileges that is occupied by Buddhist societies and temples. No taxes are to be levied on "buildings and premises used for propagating religion or performing services," or on "buildings established within such premises for the residence of teachers of religion." This is substantially the same as the provision of American law against the taxation of church property.

"The only point against which reasonable objection can be raised," says an American religious journal, is the following:

"No kyoshi [teacher of religion] can give public expression to his opinions on political affairs, or engage in any movement of a political character."

This has called out a protest from a number of Japanese Christians.

Such a provision is, of course, an unjustifiable restriction upon personal liberty, yet it shows how keenly the Japanese government appreciates the truth that political measures starting from religious sources are likely to be productive of harm; and also that—sad to say—a profession of Christianity is no guaranty that an individual or an organization of men will not work against the government or try to manipulate politics so as to place their religion in a position of political advantage.
