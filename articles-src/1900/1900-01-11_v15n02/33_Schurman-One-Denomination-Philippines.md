PRESIDENT SCHURMAN of the Philippine Commission, in a recent speech before a religious assembly touched on the evils of sectarianism in the foreign missionary field, and expressed the wish that only missionaries of one denomination be sent to the Philippine Islands. "I do hope," he said, "that when we send the missionaries we will decide beforehand on one form of Protestant Christianity. Send only one type of missionaries. . . . I hope that before sending missionaries to the Philippines the different denominations will unite on some common platform."

This leads *The Independent* to point out and deplore the evil of sectarianism in the foreign field, and to inquire, "What can be done to remove the scandal?" It fears that nothing can be done "until the denominations here are federated." But how will church federation remedy the situation unless the churches represented decide that only missionaries of one church shall go to this foreign field, and unless this decision is enforced upon other churches? Are we to see, ere long, the authority of the United States exercised to carry out the dictates of what might well be termed a church trust, regarding missionary work in its foreign territory? We shall, if such suggestions can be put into effect.
