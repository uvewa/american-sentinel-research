The following plea for religious liberty was made in a recent discourse by a Baptist minister of Rome, Ga., the place where Mr. J. T. Eaton, Seventh-day Adventist, was recently tried and convicted for the crime of breaking Sunday. The speaker, Rev. J. D. Winchester, gave a true statement of Baptist principles upon this great subject:—

"Civil government cannot patronize religion without violating the sacred rights of conscience, and that is persecution. Therefore it is contrary to the principles of religious liberty for the civil government to appropriate money for religious institutions. I declare to you that I am opposed to the employment by the Government of chaplains for Congress and for the army and navy. I am opposed to a law forcing the Bible into the public schools, and I am opposed to a law which punishes a man presumably for working on Sunday, but which in reality, seek to color it as you may, punishes him for religiously keeping Saturday. There are not enough legislatures, courts, jails and chaingangs in the land to make me be anything else religiously than a Christian and a Baptist, and I would suffer this right arm severed from my body before I would quietly acquiesce in an attempt of the state to force anyone else to be a Christian or a Baptist.

"I have little sympathy with the sect known as the Seventh-day Adventists. I would use every Bible means to show them their error and get them out of it, but I don't ask the aid of the Government in this task if I should never succeed. It is simply none of the Government's business. Here I stand, I can do no other. God help me, Amen."
