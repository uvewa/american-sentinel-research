A RIGID Sunday law was enacted by the last legislature of New Brunswick, and the measure was passed, we are informed, by a majority of only one vote. A little activity on the part of the friends of religious liberty, in presenting this side of the Sunday question to the members of this legislative body, might easily have turned the majority vote the other way. But now the mischief is done, and a much harder effort will be required to undo it.
