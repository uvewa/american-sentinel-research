"POLITICS and Religion in France" is the heading of an article in the current number of the "Missionary Review of the World," which could be read with profit by every person in this country.

The author, Rev. Reuben Sailliens, of Paris, says: "Underneath all the political agitation in France over the Dreyfus affair, there is a great religious problem which has to be solved. The destinies of France hang in the balance. It is the old fight, renewed, between the spirit of Rome and the modern tendencies toward liberty and parliamentary government. At present Rome is doing her best to reconquer France."

How the battle is waged is briefly but plainly told. "It is affirmed by good authorities," says Mr. Sailliens, "that the convents and religious congregations hold ten thousand million (10,000,000,000) francs worth of property"—a sum amounting to nearly $2,000,000,000; and this in addition to a large "amount of movable property in stocks and funds," the aggregate of which is unknown. "All that money," writes Mr. Sailliens, "goes into the war; in support of daily papers, in schools competing with the school-boards, in institutions of higher learning, where young men are prepared for the army and navy, thus furnishing staple institutions with officers who are devoted servants of the church."

Exactly the same influences are at work in this country. The secular newspaper press of the country has for years been very largely subservient to the church of Rome. Neither of the great political parties dares to offend that church whose "devoted servants" are to be found occupying prominent positions in every department of the Government, especially in the army, the navy, and the Supreme Court. The peculiarly sad and alarming fact, however, is that misguided Protestants, who have ceased to protest against the foundation principles of the papacy, are working hand-in-glove with this mediaeval system for the subversion of religious liberty in this Republic. And yet, very many who are doing this know it not.
