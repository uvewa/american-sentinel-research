WE print on another page an extract from an interesting volume just issued by F. H. Revell Co., entitled "The Peril of the Republic," by P. T. Magan, Dean of the Battle Creek College. The book is written to set forth the departure from the safe and right principles of government that is to be observed in events that are to-day making history for the United States. If this Republic is in peril, every citizen of the Republic ought to know it; for the Republic cannot be in peril and safety still remain for the citizen. The author of this work presents facts from current and past history, considered in their relation to American principles, to show that a real peril of great magnitude does threaten the Republic to-day, and the reader cannot fail to derive valuable instruction, nor, we think, to be convinced of the truth of the author's conclusions. The book contains 196 pages; price, one dollar. For sale at this office.
