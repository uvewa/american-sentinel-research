WHAT other thought but that expressed in the above heading can come into the mind as one reads of such deliverances from the judicial bench as are recorded in the following? We quote from the Journal, of this city:

"The commonest principles of justice and humanity must be lacking in the brain of a man who can sit in a Judge's chair and say solemnly to a jury:

'If a railroad company kills a child, its parents should be satisfied with $1 damages. Children are a source of expense to their parents, and are of no pecuniary benefit.'

'Yet this is the expressed opinion of Supreme Court Justice Gummere, of New Jersey. Only one dollar for the life of every child killed under the wheels of a train or trolley car. The market value of an ordinary dog is five times as much. A pig is worth more.

"Where is the heart of a man who can place the value of the lives of his children at $1 each because they are 'a source of expense' and of 'no pecuniary benefit'?"

"What an encouragement to reckless motormen or engine drivers. They can afford to run over and kill children every day in the year without materially interfering with the stockholders' dividends.

It is not the pecuniary benefit to be derived from such damage suits that parents of dead children look for. It is the restraining influence which a penalty of $10,000 or $20,000 always exerts upon reckless companies that must be considered.

"Scarcely less foolish than the opinion of Justice Gummere is that delivered by Justice Robinson, of the Superior Court of Connecticut. He says:

'Provided the railroad company killed the man painlessly, $10 is sufficient damages for his relatives. The relatives must prove that the man suffered pain to get more. The fact that the body is mutilated does not prove it.'

"Here is another gem of jurisprudence. A man put to death painlessly is worth $10. A man who suffers some pain is probably worth $100. On the other hand, and in accordance with the same rule, a man who is run over by a trolley car and dies shouting praises for the company would have to pay for the privilege."
