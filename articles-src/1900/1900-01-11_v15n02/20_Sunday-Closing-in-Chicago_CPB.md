For something more than two weeks Chicago has been agitated to quite an extent by one of the semi-occasional Sunday-closing movements that are wont to sweep over American cities at irregular intervals.

So far as the writer has been able to learn, the present agitation had its origin with small tradesmen, butchers and grocers, who complain that they are "compelled" to keep open on Sunday.

The first effort was to secure general Sunday closing by agreement. But this was found to be impracticable because of the widely-divergent views on the subject among the grocers and butchers themselves. Some favored Sunday closing during the winter months. Some thought better to close after a certain hour in the morning; while some would close all day, and some not at all.

As is usual in such cases appeal has been made to the law-makers, and the Board of Alderman have been asked to pass a general Sunday-closing ordinance. Pending action by the city, a good many are closing voluntarily, some for a portion of the day and some all day; thus proving beyond dispute that nobody is forced to keep open if he does not want to do so.

It is only greed of gain that "compels" anybody to keep his place of business open when he does not want to keep open. Indeed, nobody keeps open when he does not want to. The fact that he keeps open is evidence that he wants to keep open. It is true he might wish that conditions were such that he could make the same amount of profit in fewer hours. But the thing that he does is the thing that he wants to do under existing circumstances.

It is not at all likely that Chicago will adopt a Sunday-closing ordinance at present. Such an ordinance would have but little chance of survival in the courts as at present constituted in Illinois. Indeed it seems doubtful if anything short of a constitutional amendment or flagrant disregard of that instrument would afford any substantial legal basis for Sunday legislation in this State, either state or municipal.

It seems strange that men are so short-sighted as to be willing for a few paltry dollars to surrender to the state their inalienable rights. Who does not see that the same authority that can require men to rest on Sunday can as readily, and with just as much reason, prescribe the manner of that rest? Oh, for more of that sterling manhood that puts liberty above pelf.

One of the evening papers has espoused the Sunday-closing movement, and publishes something on the subject almost every day. But so far this newspaper champion of this movement speaks only of "moral suasion" as the means to be relied on to secure the desired end. To this there can be no objection by any one, except to the idea that so few have the moral stamina to act independently in such a matter. Of course very many of those who complain that they are "compelled" to keep open on Sunday, have more or less conscience in the matter. Having been taught that Sunday is sacred, they feel some degree of condemnation for doing business on that day; but this conviction is not sufficiently strong to cause them to act upon it, unless they can be secured from financial loss in so doing. And it is this sort of "morality" that is fostered by all Sunday closing that is not absolutely independent and voluntary, whether secured by agreement or by compulsion.
