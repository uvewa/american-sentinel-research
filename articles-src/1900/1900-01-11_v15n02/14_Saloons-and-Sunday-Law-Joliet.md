A CRUSADE against the ninety saloons of Joliet, Ill., is now on. The point of attack is their violation of four laws, viz., selling after 11 P.M., keeping open Sundays, selling to minors, and selling to drunkards. *Mida's Criterion*, commenting on the fact, says:—"If the saloons kept to the law, they would not be so vulnerable."—*Union Signal*.

Then why allow the saloons any law to "keep to"? Why, by a Sunday law, or any other law, make them less vulnerable to the forces of temperance?
