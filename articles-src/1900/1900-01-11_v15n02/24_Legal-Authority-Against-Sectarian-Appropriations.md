The question of the rightfulness of the appropriation of public funds for the support of institutions under sectarian control—which has just been answered in the affirmative by the Supreme Court—is one that has several times claimed the attention of the courts in different States. We present here a brief summary of decisions given upon this question, furnished us by a lawyer of Washington, D. C.:

"I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from all intermeddling with religious institutions, or with their doctrines, discipline, or exercises. This results not only from the provision that no law shall be made respecting the establishment or free exercise of religion, but from that also which reserves to the States the powers not delegated to the United States."—5 Jefferson's Works, page 236.

"To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."—12 Hening's Statutes, page 84.

"The rights hereby asserted are among the natural rights of mankind; and if any act shall hereafter be passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right."—Id.

"Justice Story, in the case of Terret vs. Taylor (9 Cranch, p. 49), says: 'The Revolution might and did take away the public patronage, the exclusive cure of souls, and the compulsive taxation for the support of the church.'"

"But, Mr. Allison claims that these principles do not apply to sectarian institutions here. Speaking of the St. Rose Industrial School and the House of the Good Shepherd, he says: 'And they are both industrial schools.' (Hearings before the subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, U. S. Senate, p. 92). The House of the Good Shepherd in St. Paul, Minn., was an industrial school of the same sort, but in the case of Farmer vs. St. Paul, Chief Justice Start said: 'As a legal proposition [the question of propriety aside] the city council [of St. Paul] had as much power to establish and declare any church in the city a workhouse for female prisoners, and to authorize the city courts to commit any female convict to the custody of the rector or pastor of such church, as it had to declare the House of the Good Shepherd, or any other institution not subject to public control, such a workhouse.' One of those things which are not lawful under any of the American constitutions,' says Judge Cooley, 'is compulsory support, by taxation or otherwise, of religious institutions' (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 5th edition, p. 580).

"In the case of Cook County vs. Children's Indian School (125 Ill., 564) this doctrine was emphatically approved. In that case two industrial schools, one conducted by the Sisters of Charity, of Emmetsburg, Md., and the other by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, finding themselves denied access to the public treasury of Chicago, resorted to indirection, and under the advice of their bishop, the members of those institutions set up a third corporation to act as a decoy for their benefit; and the city authorities made contracts with this spurious corporation for the training of children; the children being turned over to the original corporations, and the money paid to them. The position taken by their counsel in support of their claim to the people's money was precisely the same as that taken by the Senate subcommittee; that even though the two institutions were controlled by a church and were the recipients of all the money paid to appellee (the spurious corporation), yet that they were not to be denied the money, provided that there was only a consideration for the money paid. But the court denounced that theory as 'extremely dangerous,' and went on to explain why it was so. 'If they are entitled,' said Judge Magruder 'to be paid out of public funds, simply because they relieve the State of a burden which it would otherwise be itself required to bear, then there is nothing to prevent all public education from becoming subjected, by hasty legislation, to sectarian influences . . . the prohibition of the Constitution would be powerless to prevent the money of the taxpayers from being used to support such institutions. . . . It is an untenable position that public funds may be paid out to help support sectarian schools, provided only such schools shall render a quid pro quo for the payments made to them.' —125 Ill. p. 571.

"The State of Nevada, ex rel. The Nevada Orphan Asylum vs. Hallock, State Comptroller, is another in which this question was fully discussed. The Nevada Orphan Asylum had set up an industrial school(?) as a pretext for state aid. The institution was conducted by the Sisters of Charity, of Emmetsburg, Md., and Hallock, the Comptroller, refused to audit a claim presented for an amount which had been appropriated for their use by the legislature. Chief Justice Leonard said: 'The Constitution prohibits the use of any of the public funds for any such purposes, whether parents wish it or not. If all the children in the asylum were Catholics, and all their parents or friends wished them to be taught Catholic dogmas, these facts would not make the institution non-sectarian. It is what is taught, not who are instructed, that must determine this question.'—16 Nevada, page 383-4."

This illustration of Roman Catholic "charity" was reported recently by The World, of this city:—

"A bright little girl had been taken from the Hudson County, New Jersey, Almshouse several months ago and indentured to a family named Norton. Mrs. Norton died and the child was transferred to the family of Frank R. Baldwin, who has a beautiful home at No. 29 Winfield ave., Jersey City.

"The child liked her new home immensely. But yesterday Father McDowell, of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church, heard of the case and complained to Freeholder Joseph Murphy.

"'It is against the rules,' said he, 'to transfer an indentured child from one family to another. The law also prohibits a child of one religious faith to be indentured to a family of another faith.'

"So the child was sent back to the almshouse."
