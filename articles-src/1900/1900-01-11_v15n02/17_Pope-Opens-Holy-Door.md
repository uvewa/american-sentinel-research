THE Rome correspondent of the N. Y. Sun said in a dispatch dated the 24th inst.:—

"The interesting ceremony of opening the Holy Door of St. Peter's was performed to-day by the pope with all the pomp that accompanies the solemn functions of the church. The event marked the beginning of the Holy Year."

After the ceremony the pope said: "I have opened a new era, in which may God give peace." That the pope has power to open a new era by this ceremony at St. Peter's, is an idea in keeping with the general character of papal assumptions.
