THE Sunday laws of the States contain—with few exceptions—a "usual exemption" for observers of the seventh day; which is supposed to make such laws unobjectionable. But when analyzed, this "exemption" is found to be really a condemnation of the Sunday law on the ground of consistency. If the law is one that interferes with conscience, or with rights, it has no good reason to exist; and if it does not interfere in this way, why exempt any class from its penalties? But as we show elsewhere in this issue, this "usual exemption" clause is not to be taken at its "face value."
