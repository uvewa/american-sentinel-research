It is "an important decision," says the Catholic Monitor of the Supreme Court's affirmation in the case brought to restrain the United States treasurer from giving public funds to a Roman Catholic institution. And it repeats: "This decision has a wide-reaching importance."

Of course it has; and no one understands better what this "wide-reaching importance" is than these Catholic authorities who appear to be so innocent of any intention to serve the purposes of the Catholic Church through these institutions supported by tax-paying Protestants.

A Roman Catholic hospital is an institution of the Catholic Church, established to serve the purposes of the church. There is not a Roman Catholic institution in existence that does not have as its primary and leading purpose, the spread of the Roman Catholic religion. All Catholics the world over are instructed that the interests of their religion are to be put before all other interests in their lives, and that their first and highest duty is to the Catholic Church. And when money is paid to Catholic institutions, that money goes directly to advance Roman Catholic interests, and would not go more directly to that end if paid to the Catholic Church itself.

And now if this Catholic institution in question—Providence Hospital, in Washington, D. C.—can be incorporated and endowed in this way, how many other Catholic institutions of like character can be devised and incorporated and endowed from the public funds in the same way? How much money can the Roman Catholic Church receive from the Government in this way, and where is there any logical stopping-place in this process of tapping the Government treasury for the support of the Catholic Church?

More than this: What is to prevent other churches not over-scrupulous about their means of support, from taking the cue thus furnished them and going into the same business?

The late decision of Congress to appropriate no more public funds for the use of sectarian institutions appears to have been completely reversed. The movement to appropriate such funds for church purposes has been revived; and the question is, Where will it end?

All this money is raised by taxation; and the more of it is given to the church the heavier must the burden of taxation become. On this point the South American republics afford an impressive warning, which should not be overlooked by the people of the United States.
