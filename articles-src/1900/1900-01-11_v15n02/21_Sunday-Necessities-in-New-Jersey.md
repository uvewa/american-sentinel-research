*"New York Journal," Jan. 1.*

RECORDER SENIOR has established a queer precedent at Paterson, N. J., in an action under the old statutes known as the Blue Laws.

Last week he declared guiltless a number of barbers who were accused of doing business on the Sabbath, reasoning that shaving has become a positive necessity, and that the Blue Laws, which bar almost everything but prayer on Sunday, make an exception of the absolute necessities. The decision caused some surprise, as the barbers and their friends had not a doubt that the law was with them.

Yesterday the Recorder gave his decision in the closing crusade against selling meat on Sunday. He decided that these sellers were guilty of an infraction of the law and therefore punishable by a fine of $1 and costs.

A comparison of the two rulings shows that it is necessity to get shaved on Sunday, but that it is needless to eat.

At about the same time of the day in Passaic city a barber and two dry-goods merchants were being fined for keeping open on Sunday.
