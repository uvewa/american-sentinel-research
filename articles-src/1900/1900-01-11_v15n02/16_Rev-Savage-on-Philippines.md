THE Rev. M. J. Savage, who religiously seems to be identified more closely with the Spiritualists than with any other body, in a recent "sermon" said:—

"I believe the attitude we have taken in the Philippines to be unimpeachably right. Nobody on the face of the earth ever paid any practical attention to that beautiful saying of the Declaration of Independence, 'Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.'"

Mr. Savage sees plainly enough that "the attitude we have taken in the Philippines" is consistent only with the idea that the doctrine of government by consent of the governed is of no practical importance.
