Too MANY people in this world are like this "peaceable" clergyman mentioned in an Australian journal as one of the speakers at a celebration in Melbourne:—

"For himself, though a man of peace, he was willing, whenever the time came, to show with a rifle where his own interests were. He did not think he would make a mull of it either. He had handled a rifle in his younger days, and he had not forgotten how to carry it."

The real man of peace does not show where his interests are by getting into a fight.
