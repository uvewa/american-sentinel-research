A great "Pan-American Exposition" is to be held in the city of Buffalo in the first year of the twentieth century. In connection with this exhibition the question is of course raised, as it has been in connection with similar enterprises, whether it shall be opened on Sundays; and already a protest against Sunday opening has gone forth from the Presbyterian Synod of New York. At the last convention of that body this resolution touching the question was adopted:—

"As the conservation of the Christian Sabbath, as a day of rest and worship, is essential to the preservation of the liberties of the American people, and also all American institutions inclusive of the American home, the American Christian Church, and the American Republic.

"Resolved, That the Synod respectfully but earnestly urges the directors of the Pan American Exposition to be held in Buffalo in 1901, to close the gates of the Exposition every Lord's day during the continuance of said Exposition."

This of course throws upon the directors, if they heed the request, the burden of determining which day is the "Lord's day"; and we hope that if the directors consider this question they will be guided in their conclusions by the testimony of Scripture, which is the only competent testimony to be had on this point.

Another resolution passed by the Synod was the following:—

Resolved, That the Synod of New York expresses its earnest disapproval and condemnation of the Sunday newspaper as a violation in letter and spirit of the law of God and of the State, and greatly injurious to the religious and moral life of the people, which both church and state are bound to protect and promote."

This is a plain declaration in favor of union of church and state; for if the state is bound to protect and promote religion, there must be state laws favoring religion, since the state can act only through its laws. And what more did a union of church and state ever present, as regards the state, than laws favoring religion? As there are many conflicting religious beliefs, the state in favoring religion would be obliged to select some particular belief; and to favor some particular belief by law is to uphold that belief by law, which is to enforce it by law. And no union of church and state, we repeat, ever required more of the state than that it enforce particular religious beliefs by law.
