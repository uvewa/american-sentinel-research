## Possible OCR Errors Preserved As-Is

The following apparent errors have been preserved exactly as they appear in the OCR source, per the transcription rule of preserving original text. They may be OCR errors or original printing errors in the 1900 publication. Verification against the original scan is recommended.

---

### Article 04 — "Government by a 'Single Mind.'"
- **Location:** Body of article, quoted passage from Harper's Weekly
- **Text as transcribed:** "retroggression"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "retroggression" (preserved exactly)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely a misprint or OCR error for "retrogression"
- **Reason:** The word appears in a direct quotation from the Harper's Weekly article; if the original printing had "retrogression," this is an OCR error; if the original had "retroggression," it was a typographical error in the source newspaper. Preserved as found.

### Article 11 — "Some Reasons for Staying Away From Church"
- **Location:** Body of article
- **Text as transcribed:** "flaming pacards"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "pacards" (preserved exactly)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "placards"
- **Reason:** "Pacards" is not a word; "placards" fits the context perfectly. May be an OCR misread of the original printing.

### Article 07 — "The Nation's Birthright"
- **Location:** Body of article, reference to Jefferson
- **Text as transcribed:** "Monticillo"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Monticillo" (preserved exactly)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error or original printing error for "Monticello"
- **Reason:** Jefferson's home was Monticello. The variant spelling "Monticillo" may have appeared in the original printing of "The Peril of the Republic" by P. T. Magan, or it may be an OCR error. Preserved as found.

---

### Article 25 — "'Expansion' and Prosperity"
- **Location:** First word of article
- **Text as transcribed:** "Disparches"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Disparches" (preserved exactly)
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "Dispatches"
- **Reason:** "Disparches" is not a word; "Dispatches" fits the context. This appears to be an OCR misread.

## Attribution Notes

- Article 11 ("Some Reasons for Staying Away From Church") is attributed to "Dr. C. H. Parkhurst" per the byline "*By Dr. C. H. Parkhurst.*" This is a reprint from an external source, attributed to the named author. No original publication name given beyond the author attribution, so `original_publication` is set to the author name.

- Article 09 ("On the Way to Imperial Rule") is attributed to *Springfield Republican* (Mass.) per the subheading. This is a reprint with the source publication identified.

- Article 25 ("'Expansion' and Prosperity") ends with "—Springfield Republican" indicating a reprint.

- Article 07 ("The Nation's Birthright") is identified as "From 'The Peril of the Republic,' by P. T. Magan" — a reprint from a book, not a periodical.

- The opening editorial notes (file 01) before the first `---` divider have no author attribution. They are unsigned editorial aphorisms.

- The short note "THE state has no right to attach its penalties..." (file 03) appears between articles with no attribution and is treated as editorial.
