"According to the census of 1895," says *The Defender*, "the number of persons in gainful occupations in Massachusetts is, in round number, 1,075,000. Possibly 150,000 of these have some connection with Sunday work. Of these, at least 113,000 will be found in household domestic service, in agriculture, or in the fisheries. Of the 37,000 others, 17,994 are in transportation service of various kinds as classed upon page 6, *ante*. The remaining 19,006 are distributed through hotel and restaurant service and other employments of a more or less personal nature."

"On the basis of 150,000, there are over 10,000,000 Sunday workers in the United States. On the basis of 37,000, over 3,000,000."

It will be observed that outside of domestic and hotel and restaurant service, the number of people whose Sunday work is not voluntary is very small.
