*By Dr. C. H. Parkhurst.*

SOMETIMES there is no good in going to church. It depends principally on the church. It is often claimed that church attendance is on the decrease. People are not going to be drawn in by being scolded for staying out. Nor are they going to be drawn in—in a way to hold them—by being coaxed in by artificial seductions. A good deal of money is put into the artistic trimmings of sanctuary service. There is no objection to the artistic if it is wrought into the body of the service, and not availed of simply as so much millinery put on to make the service more presentable. The advertising of sensational topics is another way the pulpit takes to worry the truth into reluctant hearts of advertisement-captured congregations. It does not hold the people, but it does cheapen the pulpit and set the house of God in the same row with the dry-goods stores, millinery shops and other institutions that put big headlines in the newspapers and flaming pacards in the front windows. We may call the rank and file of people very godless, but they are able to distinguish remarkably well between fact and fiction in matters of religion. I believe that ninety people out of a hundred would respect God's house if they were sure that it is God's house more than it is man's. It takes a good deal besides a pulpit, a choir loft and a spire to make a church.
