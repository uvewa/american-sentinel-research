THE Sacred Heart Review, an influential Catholic paper, published in Boston, declares that Catholics in the United States must organize so as to be able to throw their united political strength against that which invades their rights of conscience. It speaks with the air of one whose rights of conscience are already being trampled under foot. And what are these rights of conscience for which it contends? Oh, there has been a reduction in the Government appropriations for Catholic Indian schools; and it is proposed to establish free schools after the American pattern in Puerto Rico! These two are the principal "wrongs" from which they are suffering.

As has been often pointed out in these columns, any appropriation at all of Government money for Catholic Indian schools is wholly contrary to the American principles of government separating church and state. It is a concession to the papacy, a denial of the principles of political freedom and a menace to the liberties of the people. And because the Government will not pursue, or show a disposition to recede from, this unjust, un-American church-and-state policy, the Catholics—so far as this journal represents them—declare that their "rights of conscience" are invaded!

And likewise of the complaint about free schools in Puerto Rico. That island is now under American rule; and to tolerate longer the old Catholic church-and-state regime in education there would be to give that regime the sanction of the Government, to deny the American principle of church-and-state separation, and justify the papal principle of church-and-state union. As well might the Catholic school system be set up by the Government here in the United States, so far as the effect on American principles is concerned, as to be maintained under American authority in Puerto Rico. Yet the refusal to maintain it is another invasion of the "rights of the Catholic conscience."

In other words, the Catholic conscience, as delineated by this influential Catholic paper, demands that the Government deny the rights of conscience of all Protestants. Such a conscience was never educated by the Word of God.

And now a Catholic organization, a Catholic party, is called for to demand and force from the Government this recognition of papal principles. A vast new field for papal effort to secure recognition from the United States, has been opened up by the acquisition of the new territory taken from Spain; and Roman Catholics in the United States are to be organized to secure the fullest advantage offered by the situation. Verily, the nation is expanding, and in no direction faster than toward Rome.
