It is announced by the secretary of the "Philadelphia Sabbath Association" that that organization, working in conjunction with several committees of citizens, after numerous conferences with the mayor and his subordinates, "have planned to make special efforts for the enforcement of the Sunday law," "on and after January 7, 1900."

"THE law affords protection to all in remembering the Sabbath day in accordance with the original appointment of our great Creator," says secretary Mitchler of the "Philadelphia Sabbath Association," in speaking of the Pennsylvania Sunday law. Yet individuals who conscientiously remember and keep this "original appointment" of the Creator have been prosecuted under this very law. The practical tendency of man-made "Sabbath laws" is to turn men away from God's Sabbath law, and cause them to forget his "original appointment" altogether.
