We are informed that the announcement made in the SENTINEL of December 21 last, of the arrest of a seventh day observer under the Sunday law, at Citronelle, Ala., was incorrect, no arrest having been made. We are glad to know this was a mistake, though made on what we supposed was reliable information.
