J. H. Kellogg, M. D., in "Good Health."

Christian Scientists do not seem to recognize the fact that the human will is just as tangible and real as is the divine will; that the human body is a manifestation of God in the flesh; that man, in all his relations to his fellow men and to God, is either keeping in the divine order and in harmony with God, or going out of the divine order and contrary to God.

Disease is simply a condition which results from going wrong, from being out of the divine order. In a certain sense, disease is not an evil, as the Christian Scientist claims, but a good.

Suppose we take a simple illustration of this idea. When a person gets a sliver in his finger, there is pain and swelling in that place; after a while the matter which forms around the sliver, lifts it out. This is nature's process of getting rid of the sliver; the pain is incidental to the effort of nature. If the least little speck of dirt gets into your eye, how it smarts and burns; the tears flow; the eye becomes red, the lid closes, and you are tempted to think you would be a great deal better off if your eye did not smart when specks got into it. But as a matter of fact, how much better off would you be? Your eye would soon be full of specks and cinders, its transparency would disappear, and it would finally be of no service whatever. Pain, then, is a conservative process; it is a necessary and actual fact, by which the body is warned against evil.

Disease is a remedial process. The same power that is within us and that cures us is the power that makes us sick, and illness is the process by which we get well. Sickness and suffering are only incidental to the remedial process.

People do not get well in consequence of any sort of hocus-pocus, or magic. No one can effect a cure by hiding away in a corner and "fixing his mind upon your case," or by giving you an "absent treatment." This is a kind of magic unworthy of a Christian age, and there is no foundation for faith in it.

The power in which we must have faith if we would be well is the creative and curative power which exists in every living thing.

This healing power is not away off outside of us and within the reach of just one certain class of persons. The only true healing power in all the universe is God, the great intelligence and force that is behind everything, in all existence. That power is in you, and if you are sick it is because God is trying to do something for you that you can not do for yourself. If you are weary, it is because you need rest. If you are suffering pain, it is because you have been doing something that will destroy you if you persist in your course. Pain, weariness, disease, then, are our good friends. They are the agents by which God endeavors to lead us back into the right road.

The truth, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap," applies to physical no less than to spiritual sowings. Believe this, for there is nothing more certain. Sow to health, cultivate health, and health will spring up and grow in you. Cultivate the tree of health, and it will bear fruit, and you will find yourself improving physically year by year.
