*The Osservatore Romano*, the official organ of the Vatican, published recently the following propositions under the heading, "The Civil Authority of the Pope." They define the authority claimed by him, and state the grounds upon which, in the Catholic view, it is established. Notice how the union of church and state follows naturally the proposition that the Christian Church has a visible earthly head. Accepting that proposition as true, no logical defense can be interposed against the invasion and subversion of human rights by a union of church and state. And conversely, a union of church and state demands the creation of a pope. The two are inseparably united.

The propositions are as follows:—

1. The church is a completed organization established as such by God upon earth, the invisible head of which is Christ, the visible head of which is the pope in Rome. [A hydra-headed church].

2. The church is a religious organization with the purpose of serving mankind in securing eternal salvation.

"3. But the church is at the same time the kingdom of God here upon earth, and therefore cannot be of this world, as it does not originate in the world.

"4. Since the kingdom of Jesus Christ comes from heaven, it has also been created for heaven, and has there both its origin and its consummation.

"5. The divine Founder, Jesus Christ, is entrusted with both the highest priesthood and the highest kingly power; he rules and governs the religio spiritual body that constitutes his kingdom and is the kingdom of God.

"6. In the church, therefore, the idea of a kingly power and of a priesthood is intimately and indissolubly connected, and as the church upon earth has been established upon Peter, and Peter is upon earth its head in the place of Jesus Christ, its heavenly head, thus too everything that is in Christ and in the church can also be claimed for Peter.

"7. Accordingly, like Christ, Peter is both a priest and a king.

"8. The priesthood embraces the authority of the magistracy; the royal power includes the power to govern, as the church is a real and perfect society.

"9. Every society of necessity has a fundamental law and a permanent government. Without the former there would be no moral unity; and without the latter, no social unity.

"10. The pope is accordingly the master [maestro] of the law and the head of the government of the society and the kingdom of Jesus Christ, being invested and delegated for this purpose by Christ himself.

"11. Accordingly both as a teacher and as the head of a government, the pope has no one over him except Jesus Christ.

"12. The pope can accordingly be dependent upon no one except the power and the sovereignty of Jesus Christ.

"13. Then the pope has no equal upon earth nor any superior [in tutto e daper tuto].

"14. It is a logical conclusion that the pope of a necessity in every particular in which the spiritual association of Jesus Christ comes into relation to human society must be the sovereign.

"15. The pope is accordingly the sovereign in the church and also in the world, in the divine and in human society, over against men and nations, over against princes and potentates.

"16. As the church is universal, it includes each and every other society; as it is the kingdom of God, it covers also all other kingdoms; as the pope is the sovereign of the church, i. e., of the kingdom and the society of Jesus Christ, he is also the sovereign in every other society and in every other kingdom.

"17. The sovereignty of Christ, which is the same as the sovereignty of God, is the basis of every other authority; every other authority is founded upon this, whether it be human or divine, civil or political, private or public authority.

"18. Therefore the religious and the spiritual sovereignty of the pope includes also the civil and the political authority throughout the world."

And from these the Osservatore Romano deduces these conclusions:—

"1. Jesus Christ has made his church free.

"2. He has thereby made it sovereign.

"3. The church, and accordingly the pope also, must be free and sovereign.

"4. The pope is free and must be free, not only in religious and spiritual, but also in temporal and material respects.

"5. The pope can accordingly, neither in spiritual nor in temporal respects, be a subject; he must be a sovereign and a ruler.

"6. When, therefore, the pope declares that he must be absolutely free and a ruler in temporal respect also, it is contrary to the faith, contrary to reason, and contrary to history to maintain that this is not correct."
