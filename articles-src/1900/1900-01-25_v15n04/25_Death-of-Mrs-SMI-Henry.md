WITH deep sorrow we make note of the sudden death (from pneumonia) of Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, whose contributions have often enriched the columns of this journal, and who was an untiring worker in behalf of liberty of conscience as well as in other lines of Christian work. Mrs. Henry was long prominent in the work of the W. C. T. U., and was still connected with that organization at the time of her death.
