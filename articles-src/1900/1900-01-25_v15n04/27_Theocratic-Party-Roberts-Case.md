THE theocratic party who are busy in the lobbies of the capital at Washington at every session of Congress, are trying hard to exercise an influence upon Congress in the Roberts case, in such a way as to establish a precedent for excluding members from Congress on moral grounds. They have in mind the exclusion from Congress of others besides polygamists and Mormons; and with such a precedent established they would with the help of their powerful religious allies be able ere long to virtually dictate "moral" grounds of admission to the national legislature.
