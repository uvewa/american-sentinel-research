WORLD has been received from Mr. J. T. Eaton, of Rome, Ga., that sentence has been pronounced upon him by the court, under the decision recently rendered against him for not keeping Sunday. The court at the conclusion of his trial suspended sentence, and Mr. Eaton hoped that the suspension might be indefinite; but he has now to pay a fine of $15 and costs, or serve one hundred days in jail or the chain-gang. We have not yet learned what course he has decided to pursue in the matter.
