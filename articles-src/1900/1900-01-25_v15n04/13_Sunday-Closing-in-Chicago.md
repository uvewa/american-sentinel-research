STEADY progress continues to be made by the Sunday-closing movement in Chicago. Sunday, January 7, every business house in the eastern portion of the stockyards district was closed, and the western portion is expected to follow suit. The movement, says the Chicago Times-Herald, of January 8, "is assuming a general character, and it is said the business district to the west of the yards will be closed next Sunday. When this is accomplished the work will be taken up on the North and West sides and continued until Chicagoans are educated to make their purchases for Sunday on the preceding day."

In one of the hardest districts of the city, (from a Sunday-closing point of view), petitions for Sunday closing were circulated among all the merchants, and only one of them refused to sign the petition. This one opened his store Sunday morning, January 7, to do business as usual, but was speedily "brought to time" by the Sunday-closing committee, in the following way. One of the chief advocates of Sunday observance was making a tour of the district Sunday morning, (breaking Sunday thereby), to see if the merchants were keeping Sunday as they had agreed. A committee of the Sunday closers were with him. They discovered the solitary open store. At once "pickets supplied with printed copies of the Sunday-closing resolutions were placed near the store on either side, and every possible customer was presented with one. After the pickets had been at work half an hour the merchant locked up his store and informed the committee that it would remain closed not only yesterday but every Sunday hereafter."

One feature of the movement in this city is an appeal that has been made to consumers not to purchase anything on Sunday. It is declared that to purchase groceries, etc., on Sunday is an indication of shiftless housekeeping, and it is expected the ban of this idea will influence many to guard their reputations by doing no Sunday shopping. A city alderman asserts that "the movement has come to stay," because the majority of the people favor it.

It is, of course, the right of every storekeeper to close his store on Sunday in harmony with his convictions of right or of sound policy; and it is likewise the right of individuals favoring Sunday closing to persuade any and all others whom they can to accept and practise their views. This is no interference with religious liberty, and there is none until the point is reached where someone is compelled to close on Sunday, or to refrain from work, against his will. And this point will very likely be reached if the present movement continues; for it will be but a step, after the people have been "educated" to do all their shopping before Sunday, and to favor that system, to secure a city ordinance forbidding Sunday trading. The Sunday closers are not likely to rest satisfied until they have fortified themselves behind the law.
