THE Scriptures constitute a valuable text-book on the subject of "manifest destiny." The destiny of men and of nations is there made very manifest indeed, and one needs only to believe what he reads in order to know all about the subject. "The soul that sinneth it shall die," may be cited as an illustration. That is manifest destiny for one class of people. On the other hand, "he that believeth and is baptized [thus having his sins removed] shall be saved;" and this is manifest destiny for another class of people. The governments and kingdoms of earth are spoken of in Psalms 2 and Daniel 2 as being finally broken in pieces to make way for the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God (see also Rev. 13, last half); and this is manifest destiny for the governments. And that this is so, no Christian can consistently deny.
