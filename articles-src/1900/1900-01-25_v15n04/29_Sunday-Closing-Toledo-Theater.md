THE Sunday-closing movement in Toledo, Ohio, so far as regards Sunday theaters, has received an unexpected set-back; the jury in a test case having brought in a verdict of "not guilty." What further action, if any, will be taken by the "Pastor's Union," which had charge of the prosecutions, is not stated.
