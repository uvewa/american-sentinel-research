### SALOONS AND GAMBLING HOUSES KEEP SUNDAY.

Ottawa, Ill., Jan. 7.—All the saloons and gambling houses in this city were closed to-day, and for the first time in a long period Ottawa was a "dry town." This condition was due to the action of Mayor Malony, who called the saloon men together yesterday and informed them that hereafter all saloons must shut up at midnight Saturday and remain closed on Sundays.

The mayor notified the liquor men that there would be no prosecutions for violations of his order, but that all offenders would have their license revoked. The gambling-house proprietors were also notified to close their establishments, and strict orders were given the police to report all violations.
