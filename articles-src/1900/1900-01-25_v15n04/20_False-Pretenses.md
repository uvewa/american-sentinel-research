*The "Truth Seeker."*

The corresponding secretary of the Philadelphia Sabbath Association, T. T. Mutchler, has an article in the *Times*, of that city, defending the Sunday law of 1794, which the association is endeavoring to enforce. The law prohibits all sorts of business and pleasure during church hours. Its scope may be judged from Mr. Mutchler's account of what it is designed to accomplish. He says:—

"The object of the law is the protection of all citizens from infringement of their sacred rights. The laborer shall not be compelled by his employer to work on that day; the business man shall not be compelled to remain at work by his lawless competitor; our children shall not be subjected to temptation by the open candy shop on Sundays; nor should drug clerks be compelled to sell merchandise on that day, but only required to sell medicine during certain hours; church services shall not be disturbed by the passage of milk wagons or other vehicles for business purposes. The law affords protection to all, in remembering the Sabbath day, in accordance with the original appointment of our great Creator."

The last sentence is a plain misstatement of fact. The day originally appointed by the Creator was not Sunday, but Saturday, therefore this law has nothing to do with the Sabbath. The last sentence of the paragraph also contains a falsehood. The law is designed not for the protection of rights, but for their violation.

The laborer, he says, "shall not be compelled by his employer to work on that day." No; and he never was . . . but under the law the laborer is deprived of the right to earn wages on Sunday, and is compelled to loaf. "The business man shall not be compelled to remain at work by his lawless competitor." No; and he never war; but the Sunday law compels him to close when he would be open if he lived in a free country. And so it is all the way through. Children will not be tempted to spend their money for candy, but they will be coerced into giving it to the church; drug clerks will not be compelled to sell medicine, nor were they ever; but they will be fined if they do, and sick people may die for want of medicines on Sunday because God set apart Saturday and hallowed it!

We get at the nub of the matter when it is said that with the law in force "church services shall not be disturbed by the passage of milk wagons or other vehicles for business purposes." At the National Reform Convention in this city last month one of the speakers mentioned the time when chains were stretched across the streets of the city during meeting hours, so that the way was closed to vehicles, and he recommended a return to the custom. He deemed it "Christian liberty" that when one man desired to make himself heard in an address to the air, a hundred other men should be compelled by law to suspend their affairs until he had talked himself out. The plan is to treat all as criminals on Sunday and shut them up. It would be as beneficial as relieving a man from the necessity of working for his living by putting him in jail, only it makes no provision for feeding him during his compulsory idleness.
