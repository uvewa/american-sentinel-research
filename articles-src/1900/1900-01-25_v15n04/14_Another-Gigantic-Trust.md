ANOTHER gigantic "trust" is announced as about to be formed—a railway trust—which will unite the great trunk lines of railway between the Atlantic seabord and the Mississippi. All ticket offices of these roads in the principal cities will be abolished, and all city, general, traveling and district freight and passenger agents and solicitors of these roads in the United States, Canada, and Europe will be dispensed with, and altogether 50,000 or more men will be thrown out of employment.

This forcing of people out of employment is one of the worst features of the trust system. The object, of course, is to save the money paid to these employees in salaries; but while the immediate result may be what the trust magnates anticipate, the policy in the end must prove "penny wise and pound foolish." These 50,000 unemployed men, the victims of this "trust," will swell by nearly that much the great army of idle, discontented and desperate men, who at every favorable opportunity become the fomentors of industrial disturbances—strikes, riots, etc.—and intensify the conflict between capital and labor. The country can never be prosperous while a large percentage of those who should be wage-earners are out of employment, and it is poor policy on the part of the capitalists to lessen the general prosperity of the country in this way.
