A CONTROVERSY between Catholic parents and the public school authorities has arisen in Piermont, N. Y., and sixteen Catholic children have been dismissed as the result. The Catholics object to the nature of the religious exercises at which attendance is made compulsory in the schools, saying that the exercises are not non-sectarian. The controversy gives an illustration of the difficulties which grow out of the attempt to give religious instruction under civil authority.
