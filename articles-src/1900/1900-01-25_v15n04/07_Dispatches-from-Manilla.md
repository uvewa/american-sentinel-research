DISPATCHES from Manilla dated January 18, state that "the religious question is overshadowing the insurrection." The "religious question" is the question whether or not the Filipinos are to be relieved of the intolerable burden of the Catholic friars. The people fear that, as it is evidently the purpose of the United States to leave the Catholic interests in the islands undisturbed, the abuses from which they have suffered under the domination of the orders of friars are to be continued. General Otis has informed them that the friars will not be forced on them if against their wish, and Archbishop Chapelle, the Catholic overseer appointed by the pope and the President, has said that he would not attempt to force the friars on the people if they did not desire the friars to fill the curacies. We do not see the use of the small word "if" in these assurances. That the Filipinos do not want anything at all to do with the friars, has been made too plain for any possible question.
