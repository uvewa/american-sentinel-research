# Uncertainties — v15n04, January 25, 1900

## OCR Error: Date on Page 16

- **Location:** Page 16, top of page, running header
- **Issue:** OCR reads "NEW YORK, JANUARY 25, 1500." — clearly a recognition error for "1900"
- **Transcribed as:** Not transcribed (it is a running header/page date, not article content)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — obvious OCR misread of "9" as "5"

## "WORLD has been received" — Article 24 (J. T. Eaton)

- **Location:** Page 16, note about J. T. Eaton
- **Issue:** The note begins "WORLD has been received from Mr. J. T. Eaton..." — this is almost certainly "WORD has been received" but the OCR reads "WORLD"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the word is set in small caps in the original, matching the pattern of other all-caps sentence openers in the "News, Notes, and Comment" section. "WORD" is the correct reading; "WORLD" is an OCR error.
- **Transcribed as:** "WORLD" — preserved exactly as OCR produced it, but this is flagged as a likely OCR error for "WORD"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "WORD" is contextually correct but original scan was not available for verification

## Unknown Author: John McCarthy — Article 12 ("Echoes from the South")

- **Location:** Pages 8, byline "BY JOHN MC CARTHY"
- **Issue:** John McCarthy is not in the known authors list for the American Sentinel
- **Transcribed as:** "John McCarthy" with initials "JMC"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name is explicitly stated in the byline; initials assigned as JMC pending verification
- **Note:** Dateline at end reads "*Buenos Ayres, Argentina.*" — consistent with a South America correspondent

---

## Unknown Author: B. O. Wade — Article 19 ("What Does It Mean?")

- **Location:** Pages 11-12, attribution "Tokio, Japan. B. O. WADE."
- **Issue:** B. O. Wade is not in the known authors list for the American Sentinel
- **Transcribed as:** "B. O. Wade" with initials "BOW"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — name explicitly stated; dateline "Tokio, Japan" confirms foreign correspondent
- **Note:** Initials "BOW" assigned pending verification against records

---

## "Christian Science" Article — Attribution Question

- **Location:** Pages 7-8
- **Issue:** The article begins "J. H. Kellogg, M. D., in 'Good Health.'" — this indicates a reprint from the journal "Good Health" by J. H. Kellogg. However, no closing source attribution in the pattern "—*Good Health*" appears at the end; the source is stated in the opening line instead.
- **Transcribed as:** `attribution: "reprint"`, `original_publication: "Good Health"`
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the opening phrase explicitly identifies the source publication

---

## Short Aphorisms on Page 1 — Section Attribution

- **Location:** Page 1, seven short paragraphs before "The Same Now as Always Before"
- **Issue:** These untitled paragraphs have no explicit author attribution. They appear to be editorial aphorisms typical of the Sentinel's front-page format.
- **Transcribed as:** Attribution "editorial" for each
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — consistent with editorial practice; could theoretically be by ATJ as editor

---

## "NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT" Section

- **Location:** Pages 9-11
- **Issue:** The section header "NEWS, NOTES, AND COMMENT" appears once but the content continues across multiple pages. Individual items within the section are not always clearly delimited.
- **Decision:** Each topically distinct paragraph or group of paragraphs has been treated as a separate article file. The section heading itself was not given a separate file.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the separation reflects clearly distinct topics

---

## La Lardi — Spelling Uncertainty

- **Location:** Page 8, "Echoes from the South"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "*La Lardi*" — this may be "*La Tarde*" (a common newspaper name in Spanish-speaking countries) or another title. The OCR may have misread the original.
- **Transcribed as:** "*La Lardi*" — preserved as OCR produced it
- **Confidence:** LOW — "La Tarde" would be more plausible for a Chilean journal name; original scan not available for verification

---

## "Moûsenor Labarca" — Accent/Spelling

- **Location:** Page 8, "Echoes from the South"
- **Issue:** OCR reads "Moûsenor Labarca" — likely "Monseñor Labarca" (Monsignor Labarca); the OCR may have misread the Spanish honorific.
- **Transcribed as:** "Moûsenor Labarca" — preserved as OCR produced it
- **Confidence:** LOW — "Monseñor" is the standard Spanish ecclesiastical title; flag for review against original
