THE expression, "the American colonies," is once more coming to be a common one in the language of English-speaking people, as the newspapers of the day attest. We say "once more," because it was a common expression once before, more than a hundred years ago. But the Declaration of Independence came, and after that the expression "the American colonies" could not stay. It was plain enough at that time that these two were absolutely incompatible. But now this expression has been revived, and, of course, the Declaration of Independence has been cast aside. The two cannot abide together now, any better than they could in 1776.
