IT IS reported that Archbishop Chapelle, who has charge of Catholic interests in the American colonies, has an agreement with the Administration whereby the Catholic Church is to retain $20,000,000 worth of real estate in the Philippines—just the sum, by the way, that was paid Spain for the whole territory. Also "the Archbishop is to select the property."
