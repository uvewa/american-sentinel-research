### THE SABBATH QUESTION IN JAPAN.

Under the heading "The Sabbath and Society," the November issue of the Voice, (Tokio), says: "It is not strictly correct to speak of the first day of the week as the Sabbath. Sunday is not the Sabbath." "But," says the editor, "it was a rather disagreeable surprise to have the peace of our quiet hours on a recent Lord's day disturbed by the busy carpenters pounding away on a neighbor's house."

The editor refused to give "the heathen any explanation for the disturbance of the peace" on the Lord's day (?), and after some long quotations from St. Sigori's Theology as an excuse for Catholics who work on Sunday, he gave his industrious neighbor the following charge:—

"Certainly a man can violate every precept of good order, if he goes outside the habitations of other men; but where the good order and well-being of society is involved, and an injurious example is set in the community, the question of relationship is involved."

This writer arranged the first meeting for the purpose of uniting the various denominations in Japan into a "oneness in principle and work."

How this meeting was received is shown by a report of it that appeared in the Japan Times, from which I quote:—

"Many in the audience, no doubt were surprised to find the honest opinions of many men of their own creed and color in perfect harmony with the idea of Christian unity and oneness that inspired Mr. Snodgrass to arrange such a meeting. We hope to see a continuation of this most worthy movement."

With the well-being of society bound up in the proper observance of the "Lord's day:" and the "Lord's day" the only point in common among the various denominations, it is not difficult to see what this "oneness in principle and work" will be.

The great question to be decided before this union is perfected is, Who shall lead?

In answer to the question, the Koye, (Catholic) says:—

"The principle of liberty of conscience, of which the Protestants make so much, has proven a snare, and a delusion to them. Unitarianism is its natural result. In making freedom of belief the foundation of the church, the Protestants have built upon sand. To talk of union among Protestants is mere idle prating. What have they to unite them? Do they not advocate independence of judgment? Is it not a case of there being no standard to which all will alike bow? This cry for union shows that they are ill at ease, and well they may be. What elements of union are there in the whole system? We are united because our church is founded upon the teachings of Christ transmitted by St. Peter. Our church distinguishes between truth and error and we all obey her. But it is the very essence of Protestantism to split up into a hundred sects. There are Protestant sects that have nothing to hold them together, except the name they bear, which is no more useful for the purpose than a sign board."

The "standard" is the authority of the Catholic Church; and in return to it, we are told, lies the only hope of union.

This conflict is none other than "the last great conflict between truth and error:" and this "the final struggle of the long-standing controversy concerning the law of God; a battle between the religion of the Bible and the religion of fable and traditions."
