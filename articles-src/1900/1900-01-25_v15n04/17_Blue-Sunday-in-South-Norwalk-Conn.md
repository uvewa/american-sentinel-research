### THE MAYOR'S FIRST ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THE CONNECTICUT SUNDAY LAW.

South Norwalk, Conn., Jan. 14.—To-day was the first Sunday of the enforcement of Mayor Charles G. Bohannon's unique conception of the Connecticut Sunday law, a slightly revised edition of the old Blue Laws which made the Nutmeg State famous years ago. Contrary to the strict letter of the law, which provides that work of necessity only may be carried on, the mayor decided that ice cream, soda water, shaving, and boot blacks were a necessity, while he placed a strict taboo upon cigars, confectionery, fruit and nuts. Hundreds of South Norwalk people went to Norwalk for their Sunday smokes, much to the chagrin of the South Norwalk dealers, for the feeling seemed to be that if the trade flocked to Norwalk it might teach the mayor a lesson.

The trolley cars were crowded during some portions of the day. Some of the South Norwalk cigar dealers sold soda water and gave away a cigar with each glass, but the majority closed up and spent the day "roasting" the mayor. The police were kept so busy watching stores to detect the sale of cigars that the saloons had it all their own way. It looks as if the present police force of the city will have to be trebled if the mayor desires both the cigar and liquor end of the law watched on Sunday.
