A NOVEL development in the journalism of the United States is the suppression of news in the interest of a political party. There have been a good many examples of this, but the last week afforded a salient illustration. Many of the papers that reported the speech of Senator Beveridge made hardly an illusion to the fact that Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, replied to it, and yet the Congressional Record shows that Mr. Hoar spoke about forty minutes in reply, and adduced a mass of evidence against Mr. Beveridge's contention that certainly is entitled to the most candid consideration. Perhaps whatever the senior senator from Massachusetts says is so utterly contemptible that it is amply sufficient for purposes of public information to report the fact that he spoke, without alluding to anything that he said, but the time is not far back when it was assumed that whatever he said deserved the attention of his countrymen. Another example of the same thing is the scant reference in many papers to the correspondence Secretary Gage submitted to Congress the last week. You read them in vain to discover that in it there was any such document as the Hepburn letter. It is to be expected that journals that are committed to a political party will support that party through thick and thin. But it has not heretofore been supposed to be creditable to a great journal to suppress material facts and to refuse to give the news for fear of its effect.
