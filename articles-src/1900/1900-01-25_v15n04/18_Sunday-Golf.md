There is much agitation in various districts not far from this city over the question of permitting Sunday golf. This game presents one of the most troublesome obstacles in the path of the advocates of Sunday enforcement which they have been obliged to meet. None of their stock arguments upon which they rely to create public sentiment in their favor, seems to fit the case of Sunday golf; and the only argument which does fit the case is one which too fully exposes the animus of the Sunday movement to suit their purposes. So this form of Sunday desecration has enjoyed greater immunity from the prohibitions of the Sunday statutes than almost any other.

Ordinary labor on Sunday could be declaimed against and prohibited on the ground of sympathy for the poor workingman, who was being "compelled" to labor seven days in the week. Sunday theatricals, shows, pleasure resorts, etc., could be condemned on the ground of immorality, or of requiring work on the part of employees who, it might be supposed, would be glad of the opportunity to rest on Sunday and attend church. Of Sunday baseball it could be said that the noise of the game disturbed residents in the vicinity. But what of Sunday golf? That has obviously no bearing upon the poor workingman's right to rest; nor can it be said that it is immoral, or that it interferes with anybody's Sunday rest. It is necessarily a quiet game, one that must be played outside of a city, and that is witnessed by but few. Yet it involves the same disrespect of Sunday as does Sunday labor or Sunday shows, which is the whole point in the controversy for Sunday enforcement. This respect must be secured and Sunday golf suppressed. But all that can be said against Sunday golf is that it shows disrespect for Sunday as a church day; it violates a religious institution. This is poor ground indeed upon which to ask the interference of the civil authorities, but the advocates of Sunday laws are obliged to take it, and thus to reveal the real object for which they are working.

They were obliged to base their denunciations of Sunday golf chiefly on the ground that it is a sin. But the claim that it is a sin rests on the claim that Sunday is the divinely-appointed Sabbath, which has to be taken for granted without any Biblical proof. And even admitting it to be a sin, there is still no ground for undertaking its suppression by civil law, except the wholly untenable ground that any thing sinful is a proper subject of legislation.

To the advocates of Sunday enforcement, however, all objections are simply obstacles to be overcome, and if a proposition is inconsistent or un-American, it is only to be pushed so much the harder. That Sunday golf is a sin is the ground taken for a vigorous denunciation of it by a revivalist, for example, who is conducting meetings at Babylon, Long Island. He is reported as saying that "Sunday golf playing is an outrage" which "should not be tolerated in a Christian community." This seemed to rouse his audience, some of whom are no doubt more intolerant of sin in other people than in themselves; and it is reported that Sunday golfers in Babylon "are in for trouble."

In general, Sunday golf in the State of New York is, according to report, on the increase. The New York Tribune says that—

"In spite of vigorous protest from the more conservative element Sunday golf has evidently come to stay. There is a growing laxity at all the large courses in the observance of the Sabbath, and whereas two years ago a prize competition was unheard of, now several of the leading clubs are holding regular tournaments on that day. A few of the older organizations, like Morris County, are still holding out for a strict prohibition of all Sunday games, but even there the younger members are eager to do away with the restriction. Much as it may be regretted by some, golf is gradually becoming a Sunday sport, and it seems only a question of time before as many matches are held then as on other days of the week. The example furnished by the Lakewood Golf Club gives an illustration of the trend of popular feeling. When first organized one of the clauses of the constitution laid special emphasis on the restriction of Sunday matches. Since that time there has been a growing element in the club which has sought to vote down this clause, and this season after a warm discussion they have gained their end. Hereafter Sunday sport will be enjoyed in the same manner as at the Country Club of Lakewood, and the links will doubtless be well patronized."

In New England, however, especially in Massachusetts, the tide against Sunday golf is still strong. There is much agitation over the question in Boston, says the Tribune; "and one or two cases seeking to prohibit the sport on Sunday are now before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. In several instances the police have been called upon to close the links, and at the Riverside Golf Club all Sunday play has ceased owing to a notice from that quarter that no games would be permitted. The Massachusetts Legislature in 1895 passed a law that whoever takes part in a game, sport, or play of any kind on Sunday is liable to a fine of $50, and it is this law which the police say they can invoke to back up their demands. The members of the Brookline Country Club, one of the most fashionable organizations in the Boston district, were recently informed by the board of directors that whoever made use of the links on Sunday did so at his own peril, and since that time there has been a noticeable falling off in the number of contests on that day, but the sport is not wholly prohibited."

A new impetus to the Sunday-law crusade will be required to suppress Sunday golf in this State and city; and a new and mighty impetus will be given it at no distant day. Of this we do not have the slightest doubt.
