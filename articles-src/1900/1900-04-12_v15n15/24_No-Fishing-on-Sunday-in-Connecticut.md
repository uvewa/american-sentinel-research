COMING down from the days of Cotton Mather is an old law so blue that indigo would be but a tint beside it, which prohibits fishing on Sunday.

Anyway, in West Haven, town of Orange, the select-men got together and had sworn in a dozen special constables, who were ordered to conceal themselves in the underbrush and nab the fishermen.

It was a success. Seven fisherman were gathered in under an old statute that has been inoperative for more than fifty years. The prisoners include several well-known New Haven business and professional men and two New Yorkers. They will all be fined generously this morning, and as they generally gave fictitious names, they will not be known, and the church-going people of West Haven will rejoice.
