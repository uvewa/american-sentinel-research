The following statements concerning Easter, made by the Rev. R. S. MacArthur, D. D., a prominent clergyman of New York City, should be of special interest to believers in its observance who hold to the example of Christ and the apostles as constituting the guiding rule of Christian practise:

"Easter Sunday is known as the Christian Passover. The word and the festival are a survival of the old Teutonic mythology.

"The old Saxon name was 'Oster,' or 'Osten,' meaning rising. The German form is 'Ostern.' The English name is derived from the Teutonic Goddess of Spring, known as 'Ostera,' or 'Eostre,' whose festival occurred at this season of the year."

"Easter is the grandest and most joyful of all church festivals. In the early days, its celebration lasted a week, closing with the following Sunday as the Easter octave. There is, however, no trace of the celebration of Easter as a festival in the New Testament times, neither in the writing of the apostolic fathers, gocrates, the ecclesiastical historian, distinctly states that neither Christ nor his apostles enjoined the keeping of this festival. Origen teaches that if we dwell on the great spiritual truths taught by our Lord, every day will be an Easter.

"Later the observance became very general. The churches were ornamented with great wax candles. The faithful saluted each other with a holy kiss and with the salutation: 'Christ is risen!' To this the response was: 'He is risen indeed!' This beautiful custom is still observed in Russia, where Easter is observed with imposing ceremony.

"In several pagan festivals there lurked great religious truths; they were unconscious prophecies of great spiritual realities; they were transformed into Easter."

How it is that a festival of which nothing is to be learned from the precepts or practise of Christ and the apostles, but everything from the practise of the ancient heathen, becomes the "grandest and most joyful" of all occasions to the Christian Church, we must leave for others to explain.
