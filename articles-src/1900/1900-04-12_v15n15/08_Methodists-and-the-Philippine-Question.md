The Methodist Preachers' Meeting which convened recently in Philadelphia, adopted resolutions relating to missionary work in the Philippines, the preamble of which said:—

"God in his wise providence has recently redeemed from bondage, despotism and superstition more than 10,000 souls for whom Christ died, and has brought them under the sheltering folds of our flag, and made them partakers of our inheritance of liberty."

This coming to the notice of the American League of that city, the latter body addressed a letter to the Methodist gathering, which in reference to this preamble, said:—

"The adoption of this preamble indicates to the American League that the members of your body are not well informed regarding the acquirement of the Philippine Islands. Our league has abundant official evidence to prove that the islands were not thrust upon us by an all-wise Providence, but rather that our administration coveted them, as Ahab did covet Naboth's vineyard; that the people of the islands, who formerly trusted us and loved us as deliverers, have been basely deceived and maltreated, and that they have good reason to hate and suspect the American people."

The letter further made a request for a hearing to be given by the Methodist body to a representative of the League, who would address them on "The Philippine question from a Christian and American point of view."

The reception given this letter made plain the Methodist attitude in reference to the questions involved in the Philippine conquest. As the action of a representative Methodist body, it is worthy of note. It is thus described:—

"As soon as this letter was presented objection was made to its being read, and when the secretary announced that the letter was from an anti-imperialist organization there arose a storm of protest. The secretary, amid great laughter, moved that the letter be referred to the committee on immorality and vice. Then another brother moved its reference to the committee on legislation, which was seconded. That was its burial. Rev. Dr. Lippincott appealed to the meeting to grant a hearing to the League, or at least to hear the letter, and two ministers called for 'fair play,' but the motion to refer without reading was carried amid the derisive laughter of the expansionists present. During the discussion one member called out, 'You need not fear to hear the truth,' to which there was a response, 'We don't want to have this matter discussed here,' a sentiment which was loudly applauded."

In view of this a secular journal takes the Methodists to task with these judicious words:—

"Ah, brethren, brethren, not so fast. Your action and your temper vividly recall episodes of the ante-war period when the question of slavery was vainly ruled out, but returned again and again and remained to divide like a sword. The 'unsettled question' overturned and overturned again until in God's good time, in infinite sadness and turmoil, the settlement came. Impatient arrogance and 'derisive laughter' ill become those who preach and teach the words of Him whose gospel was justice and peace. Further, Christian men can never afford to be cowardly and impolite. It belies their professions. In this light the Philadelphia episode was not laughable; it was deplorable and unworthy."
