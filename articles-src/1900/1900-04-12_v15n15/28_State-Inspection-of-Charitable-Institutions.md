"UNDER a recent decision of the [New York] Court of Appeals," says the New York Sun, "there are now nearly seven hundred institutions of one kind or another in our State in many of which persons are restrained of their liberty, that are not subject to the visitation or inspection of any department of the State government, or of any State authority of any description." These institutions contain about 30,000 inmates. This statement presents one phase of the situation as regards personal liberty in this State.

An effort is being made to amend the laws relating to State inspection of these institutions, but it is vigorously opposed by Mr. Elbridge Gerry, controller of the society which bears his name, and Mr. Gerry affirms that in this opposition he has the support of the Catholic Church in this city, and denounces the bill for State inspection as a measure instigated by the A. P. A.

The truth of Mr. Gerry's assertion, while called in question by some, is certainly supported by consistency, for it is well known that the Catholic Church always resists to the utmost any effort to secure State inspection of the nunneries and similar institutions under her control. The very fact that such opposition is exerted against any measure that might place these institutions on trial before the public, is proof that practises are conducted within them which will not bear the light of publicity. State inspection means a curtailment upon arbitrary power, which is arbitrary because it feels itself answerable to nobody. "Power belongeth unto God," says the Scripture, but it cannot safely be given to man, save only as its continuance is made dependent upon its just exercise of it, as the people from a full knowledge of his doings may decide. No objection can be made against publicity for the conducting of these institutions which is not a confession that injustice is practised within them, and a plea for its continuance.
