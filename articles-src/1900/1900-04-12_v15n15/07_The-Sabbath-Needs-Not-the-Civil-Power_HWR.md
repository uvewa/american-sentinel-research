There are thousands of honest-hearted people in the world who believe in Sunday sacredness because they have thus been taught. They have supposed that Christ and his apostles observed the first day in the same manner that God and Christ observed the seventh day at creation. Such are surprised to learn that cessation from Sunday labor was not prohibited by the apostles in their day, but was by a heathen emperor hundreds of years after the death of all the apostles. This is the truth, however, and we will give a quotation agreeable to this:—

"The Sunday was at first distinguished merely by peculiar prayers and passages of the Scriptures. It does not appear to have been strictly observed as a day of cessation from labor before the reign of Constantine. By the decree of that emperor (A. D. 321) public business, and military exercises, were suspended. The council of Laodicea (A. D. 360) forbade labor in general terms."—Brande's Encyclopedia, p. 1203, Art. "Sunday."

By this quotation it is seen that it was by the decree of a Roman emperor that public business and military exercises were suspended on Sunday. But this was not until A. D. 321. Cessation from labor alone does not constitute Sabbath-keeping. We cannot keep the Lord's Sabbath by simply ceasing to labor on that day. There is more to Sabbath keeping than this, as we shall presently show. From the quotation from the author just made it would appear that in Constantine's time the idea of Sabbath-keeping was that of a cessation from labor alone. Hence the decree was issued requiring a cessation from labor on Sunday. But this was for Sunday-keeping and not for Sabbath-keeping. This idea still prevails in the minds of thousands who thus keep Sunday after the method of the Romish church, and by her authority.

When Christ created the world in six days, he rested upon the seventh; but as he was not physically tired, he could not rest physically. In order for any one to keep the Sabbath as it should be kept, he must enter into the spiritual rest of Christ. That rest cannot be found upon any other day than the seventh. It cannot be found where it is not, and as it was on the seventh day and on no other day, it cannot be found elsewhere. That spiritual rest which entered into the Sabbath can not be found in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days, for the obvious reason that it never entered into any of those days. So of a truth we can never observe the Sabbath on any of those days named. But as it took this spiritual rest to create the Sabbath it is plain that the Sabbath is something spiritual; therefore, no atheist, deist, infidel, Protestant, Catholic, or any other human being on the face of the earth can keep the Sabbath holy without entering into Christ's spiritual rest. They may all cease to labor on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and even then they will not have kept the Sabbath—the rest—of the Lord. No matter if they voluntarily or compulsively abstain from physical labor on any one of these days, that in and of itself is not Sabbath-keeping.

So we can see by this true position what Sabbath-keeping is, and how unjust a civil law is that attempts to compel any one to keep the Sabbath. It is an attempt to coerce such to do what is an impossibility for them to do. Therefore, we are uncompromisingly opposed to Sabbath enforcement by civil statute. It cannot be done, because the Sabbath is a spiritual institution. Then let no one legislate in favor of the Sabbath of the Lord, or its rival institution. The Lord will take care of his Sabbath and of those who observe it, and will punish those who do not care to keep it; and he will do all this without the aid of civil power or legislative enactments. No Christian will ever ask for a civil law to compel obedience to the Sabbath. That is all contrary to the Spirit of Christ. The divine Legislator has enacted a Sabbath law for all mankind, then let man respect that law and he will not want a civil law to compel others to do as he does, or to punish them if they do not.
