CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS in Rhode Island, at a recent State convention, identified themselves with the movement for enforcing Sunday observance, by the adoption of the following resolution:—

"WHEREAS, Rhode Island has attained the unenviable notoriety of being the only New England State that tolerates Sunday ball games and Sunday cycle races: therefore be it

"Resolved, That the Christian Endeavorers of Rhode Island in convention assembled do utter their earnest protest against such a flagrant violation of the law of the State, and do call upon all law-abiding citizens, and especially upon the citizens of the towns where these violations of the law have occurred to combine for the suppression during the coming year of these Sunday sports, which have so disgraced the name of the State."

Rhode Island may consider itself very fortunate if it suffers from no worse "disgrace" than that occasioned by ball games and bicycle races within its borders on Sunday.
