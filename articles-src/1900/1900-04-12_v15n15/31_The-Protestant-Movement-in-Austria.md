The away-from-Rome movement in Austria still continues, and with increasing success according to the official Protestant organ of Austria. This journal says:

"During the past three months, in German Bohemia alone, the number of converts from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism was 836, namely, 374 men, 246 women, and 216 children. This makes a total in this province alone since the organization of this movement of 2,794 persons, namely, 1,404 men, 759 women, and 631 children. Only eighteen pastorates contribute to this report, which does not, therefore, embrace the other German provinces of the Austrian empire."

The movement is mostly confined to the cities, and the majority of the converts enter the Lutheran Church, although in Austria the Reformed Church is numerically the stronger of the two. "The evangelical cause is rapidly gaining ground in those districts that in the Reformation period were under Protestant influence, but where this church and creed were crushed by the counter Reformation inaugurated by the Jesuits, who, however, were not able to crush out the Protestant memories in the populace." "The fact that only a comparatively small number of children are found among the converts is to be explained from the fact that, according to the law of Austria, children between the ages of seven and fourteen are not allowed to change their church. Probably the most remarkable feature in these statistics is the fact that the number of men converts is almost double that of the women. A large proportion of the men are young and unmarried. We have here a repetition of the fact so noticeable in the period of the Reformation, that the women cling much more tenaciously to traditional religious views than do the men.

"When it is remembered that the Protestants of Bohemia numbered only 140,000 persons, the addition of these converts is a noteworthy increase, especially to the Lutheran Church, which had hitherto only a membership of 60,000. Some congregations have actually doubled their membership."
