A JOINT demand by Great Britain, France, Germany, and the United States has been made on the Chinese government for the suppression of the Chinese anti-foreigner society known as the "Boxers," within two months' time. Unless this is done, the governments represented in the demand will land troops and march them to the provinces of Shan-Tung and Pe-Chi-li, "to protect foreign residents."

There being no strong central government in China, and governmental affairs in that vast country being in a very unsettled state, affording opportunity for secret political and revolutionary societies to flourish almost unopposed, it is quite likely that the Chinese government will be unable to suppress the "Boxers" within the space of time allotted; and then the forces of the "Christian" governments will feel themselves absolved from any further obligation to respect Chinese territory, and will enter and forcibly take possession of the country. And then, if this report be true, the United States will be in armed possession of territory upon the mainland of Asia.
