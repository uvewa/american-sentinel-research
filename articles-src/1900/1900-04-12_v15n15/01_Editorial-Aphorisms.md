**NO PERSON** can gain moral strength by leaning on the law.

**CIVIL** law may be an obstacle to conscience, but never an aid.

**RELIGION** cannot be bound by binding the men who profess and teach it.

**TO ENFORCE** a religious observance is to put law in the seat of conscience.

**THE** more the church enters politics, the more will politics enter the church.

**RIGHT** and justice were established before there was any such thing as a majority vote.

**SABBATH** rest is an excellent thing in itself; but it never does the person any good upon whom it is forced.

**THE** powers that be are ordained of God, but the voice of the former must not be mistaken for the voice of the latter.

**THE** enforcement of the Sunday laws makes more real disturbance on Sunday than is caused by any amount of honest labor.

**CONSCIENCE** may sometimes lead an individual wrong; but without conscience, another power will control the individual which will always lead him wrong.

**MAN'S** prohibition can never stand where God has planted his permission; and he has permitted labor on the first day of the week, both by precept and by his own example.
