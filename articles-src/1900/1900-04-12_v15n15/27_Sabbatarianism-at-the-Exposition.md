IN accepting the courteous invitation of the French government to join the brotherhood of nations in a display of our resources at the Paris Exposition we accepted all the obligations of courtesy as a guest of the French nation. It would show a curious disregard of those obligations and of the customs of that country if we should now insist that the ample space assigned to us on our request should be barred and bolted and shut out from public view on Sunday—the one day in the week on which the great body of visitors to the exposition would have the best opportunity of examining and profiting by it.

There is much hyocrisy and humbug in Sabbatarianism at home. Let us not make of it our most conspicuous exhibit in Paris.
