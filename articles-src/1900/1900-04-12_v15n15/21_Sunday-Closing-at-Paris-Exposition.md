The question of Sunday closing of exhibits at the Paris Fair is being agitated in England as well as in the United States. From the following press statement published April 4, it appears that the attitude of the British government is not so yielding toward the agitators for Sunday closing there, as is the case in this country; also that the American commissioner at the Fair has decided to close the national pavilion on Sundays, notwithstanding the objection of the French authorities:—

"Lord Kinnaird, in the British House of Lords yesterday, asked the government to support the United States in opposing displays on Sunday at the Paris exposition. The premier, Lord Salisbury, replied that the government was fully aware of the feeling in the matter, but had no shadow of authority to deal with the subject. It was entirely a question for the authorities of the exposition. Their objection to shutting certain shops on Sunday was that the general appearance of the exhibition would thereby be seriously injured, and they did not think themselves justified in adopting the suggestion. Opinions of the most diverse character were entertained on this subject, the premier continued, but in France the opinions generally were not precisely in accord with those of Lord Kinnaird. The government had done all that was possible in making representations on the subject to the exhibition commissioners."

"Regarding the Sunday opening question, Commissioner Peck has received a petition signed by a mass of American exhibitors in the engineering and machinery section, which is situated in the park of Vincennes, requesting permission to remain open on Sundays, Sunday being the only day in the week on which they expect a large attendance, owing to the park being out of the way for most Parisians. They, therefore, wish to show the machinery in motion on that day. Commissioner Peck has decided to close the national pavilion on Sundays."
