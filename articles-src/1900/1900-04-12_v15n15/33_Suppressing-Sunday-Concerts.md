**The March issue of the Christian Statesman** prints the following account of National Reform work recently done in Allegheny, Pa.:—

"Allegheny, long celebrated as a Sabbath keeping city, was recently threatened with a form of Sabbath desecration that has invaded other cities. Concerts on the Lord's day in Carnegie Hall were proposed for the coming spring and summer. When the evil has rooted itself in Pittsburgh, as it seems to have done, sympathizers hoped to extend it across the river. A meeting was held February 9 in the United Presbyterian Seminary Building, at which a committee was appointed to meet with the city councils and arrest, if possible, this innovation at its very inception. The old and specious plea is made in the name of religion that such 'sacred' concerts will be for the moral and spiritual welfare of the masses of the people. But in fact these concerts prove to be in every instance, the enemy of all true religion. Being secular in themselves, they help powerfully to secularize the Lord's day. The word 'sacred' is a mere cover for what has as little of the idea and purpose of the Sabbath as the ordinary musical programs of other days of the week.

"Since the above was written the proposed innovation has met with what we trust may prove to be a crushing defeat. The *Pittsburgh Times* of March 7 gives the following account of this encouraging victory for the Sabbath: 'The Committee on Public Works of Allegheny councils last night returned the ordinance providing for Sunday concerts in Carnegie Music Hall to councils with a negative recommendation. A dozen or more ministers were present to protest against the measure. When the measure came up H. M. Davidson read the ordinance defining the powers of the committee over Carnegie Music Hall, which showed that the hall could not be let for the purpose of holding entertainments of any kind on the Sabbath. Chairman William F. Trimble ruled Mr. Davidson out of order and an appeal was taken from his decision, which resulted overwhelmingly in opposition to the decision of the chairman. A vote was then taken on the ordinance, which resulted in its unanimous defeat.' It is due to Prof. John McNaugher, D. D., chairman of the National Reform Executive Committee, to state that the initiative which resulted in this victory was taken by him, and that every step was marked by his customary tact and efficiency."

We have nothing to say in defense of the character of these entertainments, because we do not know anything about them. But the character of a concert has nothing to do with the question of its prohibition on Sunday. Suppose it is not a sacred concert—what concern have the civil authorities with such a question? Do the mayor and city council exist to define sacredness for the people, and compel the people to abide by their decisions in the matter? Is this the purpose for which they are chosen to office?

If an entertainment is evil in itself why not prohibit it on all days? And how can it be prohibited on Sunday only, as being not of a sacred character, without making a plain acknowledgment that the law forbidding it is in the interests of religion, and constitutes so far as it applies a union of church and state?
