WHILE prayers for the success of the British arms in South Africa are encouraged among English Catholics by Cardinal Vaughan, prayers for the success of the Boers are, it is said, permitted by Cardinal Logue of Ireland in those districts where anti-British feeling is especially strong. This state of things is rather perplexing to those people who have said so much about the unity which prevails in the Catholic Church.
