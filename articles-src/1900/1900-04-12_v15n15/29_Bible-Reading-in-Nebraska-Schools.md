The state superintendent of public schools in Nebraska has decided that the Bible may be read in the public schools. The matter was laid before him in a case from Gage county, where one family wanted the teacher enjoined from using the book, although all others favored it. In his decision Mr. Jackson said: "There seems to be nothing in the laws of Nebraska that would prevent the simple reading of the Bible in our public schools. I am of the opinion that in this enlightened age and Christian land the public school teacher ought not to be deprived of reading the Bible or of repeating the Lord's prayer."
