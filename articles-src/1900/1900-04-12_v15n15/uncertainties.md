## Article 30: "Some Facts About Easter"

- **Location:** Body of article, second large quotation from Rev. R. S. MacArthur
- **Issue:** The text reads "gocrates, the ecclesiastical historian" — this appears to be a OCR error for "Socrates" (Socrates Scholasticus, the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian who indeed wrote about Easter). The original printed text may read "Socrates" but the OCR source has "gocrates."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the lowercase "g" at the start of a sentence strongly suggests a scanning/OCR artifact, likely a capital "S" misread.
- **Transcribed as:** "gocrates" (preserving exactly what the OCR source provides)
- **Confidence:** LOW — almost certainly "Socrates" in the original printed text, but the authoritative original printed document has not been consulted to confirm.
- **Reason:** Following the project rule that the original printed document is authoritative; since only the OCR dump is available, the OCR text is reproduced exactly. A reviewer with access to the original should verify.

## Article 27: "Sabbatarianism at the Exposition"

- **Location:** Second paragraph
- **Issue:** The word "hyocrisy" appears in the OCR source — almost certainly "hypocrisy" in the original.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — "hyocrisy" is a clear OCR error (missing 'p').
- **Transcribed as:** "hyocrisy" (preserving the OCR source exactly)
- **Confidence:** LOW — the original printed text almost certainly reads "hypocrisy."
- **Reason:** Same as above; reviewer with original should verify and correct.

## Page 15: Signs of the Times advertisement

- **Location:** Advertisement on page 15
- **Issue:** The OCR text contains clearly garbled text: "It preaches the righteousness for faith which results in right dolomites which are the most popular and most popular in the preacher's mind. It is the most popular read and read in the preacher's mind. It is the most popular read in the preacher's mind, and is the most popular in the preacher's mind, physical, and religious worlds..." — this is clearly a severe OCR failure on advertising copy.
- **Decision:** This is an advertisement and has been omitted from the article files per the project instructions (skip advertisements).

## Attribution: "Liberty in the United States" (file 32)

- **Issue:** This letter is signed "CARL RAPP" and dated "Chicago, March 30." It is a letter to the editor from a reader, not a staff-written article. It has been given `attribution: "explicit"` with the author as "Carl Rapp" and short code "CR," as the author's name is explicitly stated. This is not a standard known-author code from the project list, but the attribution is unambiguous.
