As has been announced, Russia is about to drop the old Julian calendar to which she has held hitherto in divergence from the practise of other lands, but she looks askance at the Gregorian calendar which the other nations use, declaring that it also is seriously defective, and that a new one altogether is needed. A New York paper says:—

"Russia proposes to the world to abolish both the Julian and the Gregorian calendar. In the month just closed the Russian calendar dropped one more day behind that of the Western church, thus making a difference of thirteen instead of twelve days, which has prevailed between the two throughout this century. The difference has been more and more of a nuisance in proportion as Russia's commercial and other relations to Western Europe have increased. The Julian calendar, to which the Russian church and state adheres, is a pagan calendar. The commission appointed by order of the czar, under the direction of the Russian Astronomical Society, assisted by representatives of the different ministries and learned bodies, unanimously agree that the defects of this Julian calendar are such as to require reform, but they consider the Gregorian calendar—which we use—as almost equally erroneous, and can not accept it. Several times it has been rejected, the last time in 1830 by Czar Nicholas I. This astronomical commission has perfected an entirely new calendar, in which common years have exactly three hundred and sixty-five days and leap years three hundred and sixty-six days. It is claimed that the new system is so near to the real solar year that not more than one day's difference can occur in a hundred thousand years. If Russia adopts it and the Protestant states of the West will not, Russia will be one day in advance now, and two days in advance from 1920 inclusive."
