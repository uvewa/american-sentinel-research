The following words spoken by Andrew Carnegie in an address to the young men of a Baptist church in this city, are worthy of repetition before every audience of young men in the country. His theme was "Stepping-stones to success in business."

"Before I had any stepping-stones, I had the most magnificent foundation for them. I was born to the blessed heritage of poverty. I hope I speak to poor young men. I hope the burden of riches has not been laid upon any of you at your time of life. When it is laid upon a young man, and, notwithstanding all its great temptations, he acts his part well, he is entitled to double honor. He is the very salt of the earth. We hear a good deal in these days about poverty—oh, abolish poverty! But the saddest day that civilization ever saw will be that in which poverty doesn't win its way. The poor, thank God, we will always have with us. God doesn't call his great sons from the palace. The first thing that a young man can do as a stepping-stone is to resolve to do more than his duty. If he doesn't do that, he is not in the race."
