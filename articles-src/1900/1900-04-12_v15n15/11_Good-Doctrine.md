One of the objections which this paper urges against what is termed the "National Reform" movement, which proposes to have church people run politics, and none but professed Christians put in office, is that such an arrangement is bound to interfere with the rights of conscience of the individual. Religion in politics leads to the Inquisition, to Torquemeda. One of the chief expounders of this new doctrine thus pretends to dispose of the above objection, which he stigmatizes as a "high sounding claim."

"What are meant by rights of conscience? and what is an infringement of them? Has any citizen a right of conscience to object to the Thanksgiving proclamation by our President and State governor? Has he a right of conscience to object to the employment at Government expense of Christian ministers to pray in Congress or State legislatures? A certain citizen doesn't believe in these things: must they be abandoned as an infringement of his rights? The name of God in our State constitutions offends him: is this an infringement of his rights of conscience?"

At the risk of being the target for some of the epithets which the writer of the above proceeds to apply to those who disagree with him, we will say that we object to all of the above. Thanksgiving proclamations may be seemingly innocent of themselves, but once admit the principle of the right of the Government to even suggest in religious matters and you have the entering wedge of church and state. And who that has witnessed the unseemly scramble, lobbying and wire pulling among the clergy at the opening of a session of the legislature to see which one of them shall obtain the coveted three-dollar-a-day job of opening each session with "prayer" has been otherwise than disgusted with religion as thus manifested? And a statute that imposes such things upon an agnostic clearly interferes with the rights of conscience.

We beg to call the attention of the "National Reformer" to a truth which they have temporarily lost sight of, and that is that an infidel has as many rights in this country as the Christian, and to tax him to support chaplains, or to force him to sit and hear them in our legislative halls is clearly an imposition upon him and an infringement of his rights. Christ reasoned and plead with humanity but never used force, or called to his aid the civil law. Said he, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not."

Would that his pretended followers would really follow him, and do the same.
