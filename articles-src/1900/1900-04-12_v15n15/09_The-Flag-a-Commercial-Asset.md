Our Washington correspondent reports that the diplomatic corps is much interested in the question "How far the United States would go in the direction of intervention to preserve the independence of Corea and to prevent the influence of Russia from becoming paramount in Asia." That is to say, would the United States enter a warlike combination against Russia in the far East? This is an odd question for the diplomatic corps to be asking so soon after Secretary Hay's great diplomatic "triumph" regarding the "open door." If the "open door" has been secured, as is so strenuously claimed, through Mr. Hay's letter-writing, why should there be any talk about forcible intervention by the United States in Russia's plans in Asia? According to universal agreement, America has no interests in China beyond the "open door."

The London Spectator's comment this week on the "open door" correspondence is very curious and brief. In the case of any other power the correspondence would be purely academic, it says, but the Government at Washington has a way of considering such letters as contracts, and, with the support of Great Britain, would probably not hesitate to enforce them. In other words, the correspondence is purely academic, yet the United States intends to get what it wants in Asia by using its war power. This sagacious interpretation of the situation recalls the speech of John Barrett, in New York, not long ago, in which he reported Assistant Secretary Hill as saying that the United States must now have a precedent in some commercial dispute in Asia in order to prove that it purposes to enforce, even at the risk of war, its commercial program. So it appears from various sources that force is at the bottom of the "open door" question and that the United States Government's eastern program, in so far as it is developed, leads logically to problems in armies and navies. The letters that Mr. Hay has received settle nothing in behalf of peace, for within a week of their publication the question is asked if the United States would not intervene to stop Russia's advance in Corea, and the hint is dropped that America would not hesitate to threaten war in order to enforce her own interpretation of an "academic" correspondence.

The question said to be agitating diplomatic circles can be stated more broadly than in terms of intervention in Corea, or other parts of China. Cecil Rhodes recently referred to the British flag as a "commercial asset." A great question of the near future with us is whether the American flag is to be treated as a "commercial asset." For years commercialism has used the Government to protect the home market from foreign competition by means of the tax power, and now it proposes to use the war power in order to secure the foreign market.

Under the new program, the nation will be led into foreign wars, if need be, just as in the past it has been induced to tax itself. The commercialism of England is absolutely dominant in the British empire to-day; shall the commercialism of the United States become no less absolute, and drive the nation through immeasurable struggles in arms for the sake of the almighty dollar?
