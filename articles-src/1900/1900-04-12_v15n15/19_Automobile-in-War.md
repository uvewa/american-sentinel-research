In press comments touching the development of military ideas in Europe, we note the following:—

"France has been quick to see the possible advantages of the automobile in time of war, and Germany is not to lag behind. The emperor has offered a prize of $20,000 for the best carriage adapted for use on the road or in the field. A squadron of armor-plated automobiles, armed with quick-firers, and perhaps with scythes on the wheels in the style of the ancients, would certainly strike terror to a foe if it got near enough."
