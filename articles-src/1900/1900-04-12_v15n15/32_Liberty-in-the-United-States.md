**Editor American Sentinel:** I can't see how Mr. McKinley can oppose Sunday opening of the exposition in Paris, when at the same time men in the Government's employ here are put in irons because they refuse to work on Sunday.

I read in a paper the other day that a woman in Pennsylvania was lately arrested for sweeping her house on Sunday. How shall we understand this? There seems to be three controlling powers in this country:—

1.  The President and Congress.
2.  The church and the priest.
3.  The labor union.

If a man refuses to work on Sunday as did those on the Government transport "Sedgwick," the power of the United States puts him in irons. If he does work on Sunday, the church and priest put him in jail; and if he goes to work on Monday (as a non-union laborer) then the union labor men crush him just as surely as anything else. And in spite of all these they boast that this is a free country!

Yours sincerely,
CARL RAPP.
Chicago, March 30.
