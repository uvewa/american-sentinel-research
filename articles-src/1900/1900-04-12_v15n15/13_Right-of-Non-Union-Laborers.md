The right of "non-union" laborers to obtain and hold employment without opposition from the labor unions, was the subject of a recent decision by Justice Jenks, of the Supreme Court of Kings County, N. Y., which is worthy of note.

Jacob Pfang, a non-union stone worker, applied for an injunction restraining the Machine Stoneworkers' Union from interfering with him by ordering strikes against his employment. Mr. Pfang said in his application that he has been driven out of employment a number of times by the Stoneworkers' Union in this way.

Justice Jenks denied the application, and based his decision on a precedent furnished by the English House of Lords in the case of Allan vs. Flood, which was rendered on Feb. 19, 1898. In this case the complainant said that he was driven out of employment by others refusing to work with him. Lord Watson, in announcing the decision, is quoted as saying: "It is in my opinion the absolute right of every working man to exercise his own opinion with regard to the persons in whose society he will agree or continue to work. They [the workingmen] were not under any continuing agreement with their employers, and if they had left their work and gone out on a strike, they would have been acting on their right whatever might have been thought of the propriety of their proceedings."

The logic of the decision is undoubtedly good, but it makes plain the fact that civil government is unable to preserve under existing conditions one of the unalienable rights of every man—the right to work in any honest employment unmolested by his fellowmen. This arbitrary dictum of the trade unions is held by them to be a necessity; but it is tyranny none the less.
