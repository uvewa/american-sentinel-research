THE terrible ravages of the opium trade in China is indicated by the number of suicides. In Yunnan province there are on an average of 1,000 attempted opium suicides per month. The average for the whole of China is not less than 600,000 per year. Dr. William Park says there are over 800,000, and that the number of deaths from opium poisoning is not less than 200,000 a year.—Ram's Horn.

And opium was forced upon China by one of the foremost of the world's "Christian" nations.
