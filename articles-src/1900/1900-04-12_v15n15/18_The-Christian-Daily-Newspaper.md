The "Christian daily newspaper" idea has taken root in the mind of a Methodist pastor in Baltimore, and has led him to decide on an effort to interest Christians in Maryland in such an undertaking. A circular on the subject has been sent to clergymen and heads of religious societies throughout the State, presenting the following pledge:—

"We, the undersigned, feel the need of a pure Christian daily newspaper published in the city of Baltimore. We promise that if the Christian Citizen is ever published we will subscribe for it on the following express conditions: It is to cost two cents a copy. It is to exclude from its columns all advertisements of the liquor business, prize fights, Sabbath desecration, court investigation of the unclean, theatres and everything which is corrupting to public morals. It will advocate only that which is consistent with pure Christian citizenship. It will have no political leaning, but briefly state the actions of all political parties. It will be entirely undenominational."

When a sufficient number of subscribers is obtained to make it an assured financial success, the subscription list is to be turned over to seven well-known "Christian business men" to have entire charge and control of the enterprise, and after paying the actual expenses of the publication all the clear profits are to be given to public charity, such as the Friendly Inn, the Boys' Home, the Prisoners' Aid Association, or to any other good cause which said board shall select. Those contemplating subscribing to the paper are requested to sign the pledge and return to the Baltimore pastor.
