THE idea that God, if not actually an ally of the British cause in South Africa, is at least favorable to the fighting that is being done by the soldiers in the field, finds expression in a recent act of the British commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts. He has lately ordered copies of a new prayer, written by the Archbishop of Armagh, Anglican Primate of all Ireland, to be distributed to the soldiers of his army in South Africa, expressing the earnest hope "that it may be helpful to all of Her Majesty's soldiers." It puts into the mouths of the soldiers petitions such as the following:

"Fill me with Thy Holy Spirit that I may lead a new life. Spare me to see again those whom I love at home, or fit me for Thy presence in peace.

"Strengthen us to quit ourselves like men in our right and great cause. Keep us faithful unto death, calm in danger, patient in suffering, merciful as well as brave, true to our Queen, our country, and our colors.

"If it be Thy will, enable us to win victory for England; but above all, grant us the better victory over temptation and sin, over life and death, that we may be more than conquerors through Him who loved us, and laid down His life for us, Jesus our Saviour, the Captain of the army of God. Amen."

In seems never to occur to any of the parties concerned that an answer to the prayer for the Holy Spirit, for the new life through conversion, and for victory over temptation and sin, were it realized throughout the army, might send the entire command back to England in revolt, resolved never again to kill their fellowmen for the sake of empire, or to fight again in any cause with carnal weapons.
