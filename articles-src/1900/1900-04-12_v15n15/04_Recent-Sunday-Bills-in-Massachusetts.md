The March number of *The Defender*, organ of the "New England Sabbath Protective League," gives a summary of recent efforts made to secure legislation in that State affecting the observance of Sunday. Several attempts were made to modify the existing Sunday law, and the views expressed by the "Sabbath Protective League" and its allies regarding such attempts are indicative of the religious animus which inspires the defense of such intolerant legislation.

The Defender says:—

"There have been four bills introduced before the present legislature relative to the Lord's day.

"(1st) H. No. 167, to which reference was made in the last Defender, was reported against by the Judiciary Committee and defeated in the House without discussion. It proposed to open certain stores and all bakeries on Sunday. It was vicious and outrageous in character and met with opposition on all sides."

Is there anything "vicious and outrageous" in allowing bakeries and certain other stores to be open and transact business? What is there that is "vicious and outrageous" about a bakery? We do not know. We never knew them to be other than harmless and useful institutions. And if they are such six days in the week, how come they to be different on the remaining day? They are not different, of course. But there is a difference in the day. It is because of the peculiar character of the day that a bill allowing bakeries to be open at such a time is regarded as "vicious and outrageous."

But what is the difference in the day? Oh, Sunday is a religious day; it is called the "Lord's day" and the "Christian Sabbath." That is why the state is asked to enforce its observance, and why any bill that would modify the law in that respect is denounced as "vicious and outrageous." And yet state enforcement of religion is not supposed to exist anywhere in this country!

Of the opponents of this bill present at the hearing given upon it, the statement is that "nearly all the denominations had their representatives." We have never yet seen or heard it explained why religion always furnishes the support for laws which are declared to be not at all religious in character.

Of the second bill *The Defender* says:—

"(2nd) H. No. 247, is an attempt to repeal the law of 1899 making Sunday a close season for birds and game. It is selfish, brutal and impious, and should be buried deep and forever."

Much at least of the killing of birds and game that is done by the "sportsman" is no doubt selfish and brutal. But why should a bill permitting it be called "impious" for other than a religious reason? Here again is seen the religious animus which underlies the movement of which *The Defender* is the exponent.

The third bill is described as being "an attempt to weaken and destroy the game law of 1899," which "its friends should be permitted to withdraw," as was believed would be done.

The fourth bill was one favoring Sunday observance, and of this *The Defender* says:—

"(4th) H. No. 931, was introduced by the friends of the Lord's day. It asks that the three words 'or an entertainment,' as found in the law of 1895, be expunged. This modest and reasonable request is made because those three words are an entering wedge to profane and demoralizing secularities, which are admitted under the guise of charity and religion. The secular Sunday evening entertainment is generally of a questionable character. A large percentage of the proceeds obtained from it goes into the pockets of its projectors rather than to charitable and religious societies, to be used entirely for charitable and religious purposes."

We naturally query what these "profane and demoralizing secularities" may be which make the Sunday evening entertainments of a "questionable character" under the present law. Are these features of the entertainments profane and demoralizing simply because they are secular? or are they demoralizing in themselves and such as would be of questionable character any evening in the week? If the latter, the ground of objection to them should not be that they are performed on Sunday, but that they are evil in themselves. We do not condemn murder, or theft, or assault, because it is done on Sunday, but because it is in itself a crime against humanity. To argue that a crime should be prohibited because it is done on Sunday, or that a thief should be punished because he committed the theft on Sunday, would be nonsensical. Hence if these Sunday evening entertainments are criminal in their nature, it is contrary to right and reason to object to them simply because of the time at which they are conducted. A crime is a crime irrespective of the days of the week; and that which is not a crime on one day, is not a crime on any day. And to condemn an act on one day only in the week, is to justify it on all other days of the week.

If on the other hand these "profane and demoralizing" features of the tabooed entertainments are simply features which are not suited to the religious observance of the "Lord's day," then the effort to prohibit them is plainly based on religious grounds, and aims to favor a religious belief, through the exercise of the power of the state. It is a plain attempt at religious legislation.

And as such, it is in harmony with the avowed object of the "New England Sabbath Protective League;" for the League proclaims in its official organ that it "is formed for the purpose of defending the Sabbath," as "a divine institution," against "encroachments upon its sacredness by business and pleasure." The League simply asks the State legislatures of New England to enact laws to preserve the sacredness of a divine institution. And such legislation is plainly religious, if there is any connection between sacredness and religion.

A hearing on the bill against Sunday secular concerts was given March 6, but with what results we have not yet learned.
