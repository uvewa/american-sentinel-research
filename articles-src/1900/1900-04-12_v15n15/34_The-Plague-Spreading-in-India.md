The plague has now taken hold of Bengal and is spreading fast. As I predicted there is a recrudescence in Calcutta. The plague mortality has been rising steadily since the end of January, and the returns for last week show 199 deaths. The outbreak in Calcutta has not yet alarmed the native mind and large numbers still refuse to believe that the disease is plague at all, but comfort themselves with the title of bubonic fever, milder forms of which they think they have known in Bengal for many years.

The regulations being so mild there is no ground for any complaints against the authorities. Should plague really develop seriously, as in Bombay and Poona, the organization must show itself as helpless as it is insufficient. The rate of general mortality now exceeds 50 per 1,000 per annum, the normal being about 37. There is every indication of a very serious development. The outbreak in the Patna district has much increased, but it does not seem to have attracted much public attention. Nearly 1,000 deaths occurred last week. The people refuse to follow the traditional plan of evacuation. Some one appears to have poisoned their minds just in the same way as some one poisoned the minds of the people of Calcutta with regard to inoculation. The consequence is that the disease has spread rapidly and is now threatening South Behar.

Of Bombay city the record is terrible, no less than 2,701 deaths having occurred during the past week. The number of those dying from plague is greater than has ever been known. The death rate is over 170 per 1,000 per annum. The official returns only give the small number of 641 deaths from plague. Smallpox is still raging, but probably does not account for more than 300 deaths in the week.

The plague expenditure in Bombay has been very large. A recent return shows that up to Dec. 31, 1899, the total expenditure was Rs. 4,081,208 (equal roughly to about £270,000). The returns for the whole of India give 2,597 deaths from plague. It would probably not be far wrong to double this estimate. In the Jullunder district of the Punjab more villages are being attacked.

The latest weekly plague statement for India, ending February 24, shows a marked increase in the number of deaths, and the week closes with 3,184 fatal cases, against 2,597 in the previous week. The increase is due to the further development in Bombay and in the Bengal presidency. In Bombay city the general mortality again surpassed the previous maximum and 2,831 deaths were recorded. Of this number 263 were attributed to smallpox, but the official figures only return 768 deaths as due to plague. If the truth were known, probably 2,000 deaths occurred from plague alone. This terrible general mortality very nearly touches a rate of 180 per 1,000 per annum. In Calcutta the outbreak is developing very rapidly and now, after only five weeks' increase, the plague mortality is double what it amounted to during the worst week of last year.
