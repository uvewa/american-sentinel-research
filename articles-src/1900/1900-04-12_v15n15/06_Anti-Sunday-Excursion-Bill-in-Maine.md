The following bill aimed at Sunday excursions in Maine will be introduced at the next session of the legislature of that State:—

"The rates for travel on Sunday on all railroad trains operated in whole or in part in Maine, and all steamboats, electric roads, and all public conveyances shall be in all cases the regular passenger rates of said railroad, steamboat, electric road, or public conveyance; and in no instance for any purpose on Sunday shall excursion rates or any rate less than the regular passenger rate be granted by any means or in any way, directly or indirectly, to any person or persons by any railroad, steamboat, electric road, or any public conveyance, under penalty of a fine of ten dollars and costs, for each and every passenger carried for less than the regular passenger rate.

"Nothing in this law shall be construed as in any sense affecting any Sunday law now in force."

In view of this proposed measure it is interesting to note the provisions of a section of the Maine Sunday law, as follows:—

"SECTION 20. Whoever on the Lord's day, keeps open his shop, workhouse, warehouse, or place of business; travels, or does any work, labor or business on that day, except works of necessity or charity; uses any sport, game, or recreation; or is present at any dancing, public diversion, show, or entertainment, encouraging the same, shall be punished by fine not exceeding ten dollars." (Italics ours.)

From this it is apparent that Sunday traveling and Sunday recreation in Maine are forbidden by the Sunday law of that State, and therefore Sunday excursions are prohibited, unless they can be accomplished without travel or recreation. And therefore the proposed anti-excursion bill regulating Sunday travel, is, by its implied justification of the same, really against the Sunday law of the State.

And this is, no doubt, the reason for the provision that nothing in the proposed measure shall be construed to affect in any way the existing Sunday law. But if it does not in any way affect the law—if it is not, as has been shown, really against the law—what force can be given to its language at all?

We do not see that the Maine Sunday law needs any amendment to make it cover all the ground of possible Sunday desecration. It prohibits both work and recreation; so that the person who does not want to go to church or occupy himself with religious devotions, must get through the day as best he can in idleness. It cuts off from him every source of occupation except such as is provided by that being who is always finding "work for idle hands to do." What more can the Sunday-law people want than this? Why do they not go to work to enforce the Maine Sunday law as it is?
