GOVENOR Leary of the island of Guam, one of the new American possessions in the Pacific, has been deposed from his office and recalled to this country, for reasons thought to be connected with the following proclamation, issued by him to the people of the island:—

"Government House, Agana, Guam, Aug. 25, 1899.

"General Order, No. 4:

"The celebration of feast days of the patron saints of villages, etc., will not be permitted. The churches and their members may celebrate their feast days within the walls of their churches, chapels or private residences, in accordance with the regulations for the maintenance of public peace.

"Unless otherwise ordered, the only public holidays recognized will be Sundays and holidays authorized by the United States statute laws and by proclamation of His Excellency the President of the United States.

RICHARD P. LEARY, U. S. N. Governor."

It is thought by some that this proclamation amounts too nearly to an assumption that the Constitution of the United States extends over the American possessions in the Pacific; which, as known is contrary to the position held by the administration.
