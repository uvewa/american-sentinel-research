The following call for a week of prayer "in behalf of a better observance of the Lord's day," appears in the April issue of *The Defender*:—

"Our nation is declared by the Supreme Court to be 'a Christian nation,' and in nothing is this more apparent than in the respect shown to the Sabbath. Because we believe it to be of divine origin, of perpetual obligation, and its observance essential to the welfare of the individual, the prosperity of the church, and the perpetuity of the state, therefore—

"1st. Let us pray God to quicken the conscience of Christians everywhere that his will, revealed in his Word and in secret counsel with him, may be the guide as to what we shall do on the Lord's day.

"2d. Let us, as Christians, for the sake of the laborer and his family, observe the rule laid down in the following resolution passed at a great labor convention not long since:—

"We believe all men should have the privilege of this day, that they may spend it with their families, or as they desire in rest or worship, and we ask laboring men everywhere to avoid doing that which requires others to labor on the Sabbath.

"3rd. Let us teach that not only was the Sabbath given for worship and rest, but, also, that Christ most emphasized that true Sabbath keeping is not doing nothing, but doing good, and most fundamental of all, that the day is given to wean us from selfishness, in order to which selfish pleasure is to be given up no less than selfish work. Isa. 58:13, 14."

This week of prayer is to be observed April 22–29. We trust that the occasion may be one of profit to all concerned in it, and that a closer adherence to the Word of God touching Sabbath observance, both in belief and practise, may result to many from their prayer and study. One thing is certain, however—they will find in that Word no warrant for a law to enforce Sabbath observance upon the people, and nothing which will justify them in doing detective work, or hiring others to do it, on the "Lord's day."

It would seem to us that a declaration from the Lord would more appropriately introduce a call to prayer for the "Lord's day" than one from the Supreme Court, honorable and distinguished though that body be. Still the Supreme Court's declaration is right to the point, while the Scripture contains nothing that is to the point in behalf of observing Sunday.

Nor does it make out a very strong case for the nation's Christianity to say that "in nothing is this more apparent than in the respect shown to the Sabbath." The great complaint made by Sunday observance advocates is that Sunday is not respected even by church members, to say nothing of the multitudes constituting the remainder of the people. Certainly if the respect shown to the Sabbath in this country is to be balanced against the disrespect shown to it here, the scale will show an overwhelming preponderance of the latter; and if this is the best evidence to be had as proof that the nation is Christian, then certainly the opposite doctrine must be considered as established by the existing facts.
