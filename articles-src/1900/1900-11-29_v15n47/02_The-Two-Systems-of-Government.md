THERE are in the world to-day, and have been more or less from earliest times, two general theories or systems of government. One of these systems recognizes a sphere of thought and activity belonging solely to the individual, independently of any and all other persons in the world. The other system sees the individual as a mere unit in the aggregate of human society, having no proper sphere of action save such as pertains to the whole body of the people among whom he is politically included.

The one system holds up the doctrine of natural rights; the other system cares not about rights, but only about what is expedient.

The one system declares that just government must be by consent of the governed; the other declares that an individual may justly be governed without his consent.

The one system recognizes that man came into being through the act of a Creator, to whose authority the individual must be always amenable; the other system makes the individual amenable always to a human authority, either that of a monarch or that expressed by the will of the majority.

The one system is based on Christian principles; the other system is atheistic.

To admit that all men have "certain unalienable rights," is to admit, as did the founders of this Republic, that there is a Creator from whom all men derive their existence. To deny that all men have such rights, on the other hand, is to assert that all men derive their existence from some other source.

The National Reform scheme of government, by denying that all men have "certain unalienable rights," represents political atheism; and those who confess themselves to be atheists, by denying the existence of a Creator, likewise deny that men have unalienable rights. Both these parties belong, politically, in the same class. They uphold the same general system of government. One party, represented by the National Reformers, claim that the government is from God through themselves as his chosen servants, and they ignore the rights of such as differ from them upon the plea that all must be subject to the will of God. The other party, who openly deny the existence of a Creator, have nothing to say about the will of God, but hold that the will of the people must always prevail over that of the individual. These two parties assume different premises, but arrive at the same conclusion; their schemes of government amount to the same thing in the end; starting from different points of belief they ultimately come together on a common political platform—they find themselves united in maintaining that an individual must be governed in all things by the will of the majority—united in doing away with the individual conscience, the one party by affirming that it must be subservient to the state conscience, and the other by denying the religious foundation upon which conscience rests.

The sole foundation of the other system of government, which exalts the individual by recognizing that it exists to serve the individual and not to be served by him, is Christianity. Men may scoff at individualism as an outgrown theory, but Christianity upholds it. Christianity represents self-government in its perfect form, government in which individual freedom attains its acme. While God endures Christianity must endure; and while Christianity endures individualism has a sure support. It may stand discredited among the ephemeral systems of time, but it is the chosen government for eternity. s.
