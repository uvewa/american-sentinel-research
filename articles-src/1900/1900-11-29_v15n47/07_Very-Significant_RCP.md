During the annual convention of the Missouri W. C. T. U., held in Kansas City, Oct. 31 to Nov. 2, 1900, part of the program for the forenoon of Oct. 31 was devoted to Sabbath observance. During the afternoon the president's address, a very able paper on the living issues of the present time, made a very favorable comment on the work of Spiritualism as a potent factor in the present reform work.

Thus we see that those who are expecting to see the time soon come when religious laws shall be enforced are beginning to turn their eyes favorably toward Spiritualism, Satan's masterpiece of last-day deception, as an aid in the accomplishment of their purpose. Truly the Word of God is a light that shineth in a dark place. The wise heed its warning and are safe.

R. C. PORTER.
