A PUBLIC meeting of the "Lord's Day Alliance," of the Dominion of Canada, was held in Toronto, Nov. 9, 1900.

In a short opening address, the chairman stated that the Alliance is engaged in a work of "stupendous difficulties." This assertion was repeated. The fundamental principle of the organization, that its object is to retain existing legislation for Sunday observance and secure more, was also announced.

Quite a number of resolutions were passed in regard to various forms of Sunday desecration. The subject of railway traffic received considerable attention, and when the resolution in regard to it was considered, one member remarked that the Alliance is not yet able to combat such a powerful evil, so for the present that form of Sunday desecration would better be let alone. None of the other members seemed to share this sentiment, however, and it was stated that while we are lopping off the branches, we need to take care of the trunk of the evil. The matter of successfully combating this form of Sunday labor was a matter of considerable perplexity. It was proposed to obtain petitions from the citizens of the sections of the country through which such offending lines run, remonstrating with the officials in regard to the matter. But then it was stated that experience had shown that railways considered such petitions as so much waste paper. The idea of obtaining stricter legislation was met with the assertion that it would be impossible to get any legislation through which a railway would not run an express train at the rate of sixty miles per hour on Sunday, if it could make money by so doing. It was very much regretted that during the past year Sunday traffic, freight and passenger, local as well as through travel, had greatly increased. The only successful way of accomplishing the purpose seemed to be by agitation of the question and creating a general sentiment against patronizing Sunday trains.

The resolution to make a strong effort to get the Saturday half-holiday established by law was warmly advocated; also to compel all places of business to close by nine or ten o'clock Saturday night. The object of these measures is to enable the people to have opportunity to take necessary recreation, and finish their work in ample time so they may not be so tired out that they are not disposed to attend meeting on Sunday, the arm of civil law being thus invoked to interpose in behalf of the churches so that they may be better filled with worshipers at the Sunday services.

As to the evil of the Sunday newspaper, it was stated by one member that the recent efforts of two leading dailes in London, Eng., to establish Sunday issues were met by defeat so that they discontinued these Sunday papers after a few weeks' trial, and that this was not done because of any law interfering with their work, for there was no law there to interfere with the publishing of Sunday papers; but the Sunday issues were discontinued simply because the sentiment of the people against them was so strong that they were a financial failure.

The Women's Christian Temperance Union was mentioned as the strongest ally of the Alliance. It was also stated concerning the contact of the Alliance with the saloon, that it is not fighting the saloon only so far as the saloon violates the Sunday law. This would indicate that the W. C. T. U. had, to some extent, left its high and holy calling and come down to give its strength to enforcing a religious observance on unwilling citizens.

A resolution was passed that called for a change in the law so that those who are convicted in the lower courts of violating the Sunday law, may not be allowed to appeal their cases to the higher courts. This resolution met with some opposition in view of the fact, which must be plain to all, that this would greatly abridge the right of the citizen. This would be a very evident return to the tactics of the Dark Ages, as indeed all religious legislation really is. But in no other way can religious observances be enforced upon the people, but by depriving them of their rights, both civil and religious.

The necessity for increased funds for carrying on the work of the Alliance was strongly urged, the statement being made that "if the people know that we have several thousand dollars and the law to back us up, we can carry through almost any project we undertake." Money is power, and law is power, that is true; but there is still another power with which the Christian ministry is supposed to be best acquainted, that is the power mentioned in Rom. 1:16, the power of the gospel. How would such a declaration as this do as a substitute for the one advanced? "If the people know we have the love of Christ and the power of the gospel to support us, all our efforts to do them good will meet with success"? Would not this be more in harmony with the principles of Christianity?

As already stated in the convention, the Sunday newspapers were most successfully brought to an early extinction in London, Eng., without any law to interfere with them, merely because they did not have the support of the sentiment of the people. Why not take that as an object lesson, and labor not for the enactment and enforcement of law on this purely religious question, but to "persuade men" as the apostles did? And again: If law is secured, how much of a barrier is it against mighty corporations, in view of the statement that any railway company would run an express train right through such Sunday legislation at the rate of sixty miles an hour, if it wished to do so?

As was admitted in the meeting, the influence of many ministers in riding on the cars themselves on Sunday has a powerful influence in favor of Sunday trains. Yet the avowed object is still maintained—to retain all existing Sunday laws and obtain more. At the same time a movement is set on foot to greatly restrict the liberties of the citizen by taking from him the right to appeal to the higher courts when convicted of Sunday violations in the lower courts. So the object before the Lord's Day Alliance and its adherents is really: *More law* for religious organizations or establishments, *and less liberty* for the individual citizen.

As did the Papacy of old, so do these now, disclaim any part in arresting Sunday violators. They simply claim to act as informers, and turn offenders over to the civil authorities, thus assisting those who make the arrests. This basis of operation, adopted by the Alliance, is the same screen behind which those who caused the apprehension of so-called heretics hid in days gone by.

Without doubt these movements are intended by their promoters to work for the ultimate good of society and of citizens; but, like Saul of old, they seem to be moved by a mistaken zeal. It is to be hoped that many of them will imitate his example of abandoning carnal weapons and civil and ecclesiastical indictments, for the spiritual weapons of faith and love.
