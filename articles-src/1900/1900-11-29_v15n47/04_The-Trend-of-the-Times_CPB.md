One of the most significant things announced recently is that it is gravely proposed to authorize the President of the United States to maintain "a regular army of such size as to him may seem fit." This proposition is supported by no less influential men than Senator Hawley, chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, and Senator Proctor, ex-Secretary of War.

Probably there is not a man in the country who would use this power more wisely or more moderately than Mr. McKinley, but he is only human, and even were he more than he is, according to the unwritten law which governs the presidential succession he can be President only four years from the fourth day of next March. Then another will take his place whose ambition may be tempered by less sterling moral principles than seem at least to govern the life of the present chief executive.

The King of Prussia and Emperor of Germany, "war-lord" though he be, has not as much power either as king or emperor, nor as both together, as it is seriously proposed to put into the hands of the President of the United States. The Prussian Diet, more jealous of the rights of the people than some American statesmen at least, refused as far back as 1862 to give such power to the king, than whom few statesmen and soldiers in Europe have ever stood higher in the estimation of their fellow-men. In 1886, the Reichstag in passing the army bill guarded with jealous care the rights of the several German States, giving the emperor only certain well-defined powers.

We can not believe that an American Congress will enact the proposed legislation, but equally strange things have happened. Indeed, this that is proposed is only one of the straws showing the direction of the wind. The people are becoming careless of their rights on the one hand, while on the side of government the drift is toward despotism. We are not alarmists, but we can not close our eyes to patent facts.

Don't forget the "special" for next week.
