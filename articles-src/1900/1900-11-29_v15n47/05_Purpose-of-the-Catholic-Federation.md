According to the Catholic Standard and Times (Philadelphia), one object of the Catholic federation now being organized in this country, is the protection of Catholic interests in the territory taken by the United States from Spain. "We must never forget," says the Standard and Times, "that the Catholic population of those islands have been deliberately placed outside of the American Constitution, and subjected to the principle of taxation without representation. They have none to look to, then, in the whole world, for the protection of their interests, spiritual and material, but their fellow Catholics of the United States."

But we have from Bishop Messmer, who undoubtedly speaks with authority on the subject, a full outline of "the objects and methods of organization" of this movement, as regards both the religious and the civil fields of its activity. The Standard and Times copies it from the Catholic Tribune:

"The aims of the federation in the religious field, Bishop Messmer thinks, should include these subjects: Education (Catholic schools, colleges, universities); literature (periodical press, books, Catholic literary societies, Catholic Truth Society); Catholic societies; Catholic emigration, homes, colonization, homes for Catholic sailors; Catholic conventions and demonstrations, Catholic congresses, State and national; secret societies. In the social field: The poor and orphans (St. Vincent de Paul societies, Catholic aid societies); the laborers (labor unions, strikes); marriage and divorce, the Sunday observance, the drink problem, the theatre, gambling and prostitution, obscene literature.

"In the civil sphere the Bishop proposes these objects: Religious rights of Catholics in State institutions (reformatories, prisons, workhouses, orphans' and insane asylums, etc.); in the public schools (sectarian exercises and Bible, anti-Catholic text-books, discrimination against Catholic teachers, Catholic candidates for graduation and diplomas, compulsion in State schools, etc.); chaplains in the army and navy; veterans' homes; the Catholic Indians; taxation of church property; State support of sectarian (Protestant) institutions; corruption in politics (bribery at elections, in the legislature)."

Did you notice that Sunday observance is mentioned as one of the things this federation is designed to push forward? Thus one more great organization is to be added to the others already in the field, whose whole energies may at any time be turned in the direction of enforcing the Sunday institution upon the people.

From the statement of the objects of this federation included in its "civil sphere" of activity, it is plain that questions touching the relation of church and state, and also matters involving the antagonism of Catholicism against Protestantism, are to be agitated and pushed to the front in this country by this Catholic organization. In all this the Papacy sees much to be gained.
