To this question THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY gives, as it has ever given, a negative answer. It denies that any class of people, Protestant or otherwise, have the right to use compulsion upon others in the sphere of religious observances. But it is interesting to note the fact that the right of Protestants to say how Sunday shall be observed is boldly denied by the Church of Rome. That this is a fact is plainly stated in the following from the Catholic Press, the leading organ of the Papacy in Australia, the occasion of its utterance being an agitation which has been going on in New South Wales regarding "Sunday desecration:"

"But there is something still wanting to a full statement of the untenable position taken up by those sticklers for "Sabbath" observance. What right, anyhow, have these gentlemen as Protestants to lay down the law as to what is to be done or not done on Sunday? Sunday is a Catholic institution, and its claims to observance can be defended only on Catholic principles. If the 'Bible and the Bible only is the religion of Protestants,' if 'whatever is not read therein nor may be proved thereby' has no claim on their faith or observance, what scrap of title can they show for all their dogmatic insistence as to the requirements of the Lord's Day? From beginning to end of Scripture there is not a single passage that warrants the transfer of weekly public worship from the last day of the week to the first. Thus Sunday observance is an incongruous adjunct of the Protestant faith, utterly out of keeping with its fundamental principle, and strongly suggests a religion that suffered sadly from too much hurry in the making.

"If any Sabbatarian wants to know the proper method of spending the Sunday, the Catholic Church is the natural source to apply to for information. Under her direction the Sunday supplanted the Jewish Sabbath, and she is, therefore, the best fitted to settle any dispute as to its claims."

These are statements which should cause Protestants to do some serious thinking before proceeding further with the enforcement of Sunday observance. Does not the Church of Rome know what she is talking about in this matter? We have not only her own word, but that of history and of Scripture, to assure us that on this point she speaks the truth.
