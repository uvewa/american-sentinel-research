# News, Notes . . . and Comment

A CANDY peddler in New York City was arrested on a recent Sunday, says a New York paper, "for the heinous offense of selling his wares to children on their way to Sunday school."

***

SUNDAY, the 18th inst., the Sunday law was strictly enforced in West Superior, Wis. A press dispatch states that "Superior never saw such a quiet Sabbath. The mayor's order to the chief of police was obeyed to the letter, only such places as livery stables, street-cars, restaurants, and others expressly excepted in the city attorney's opinion, being permitted to run."

***

THE Christian Endeavor World reports that "it is no dream that the Hyde Park, Chicago, Christian-citizenship committee has begun an aggressive campaign to secure Sunday closing, to publish a list of grocers selling wines and liquors, and to induce people to abstain from patronizing department stores that sell liquors in their grocery department or restaurants. They are toning themselves up for the work by having 'Elijah Tone,' and Dr. Martyn's 'Christian Citizenship' read at their monthly meetings."

***

CONSIDERABLE agitation was recently stirred up in Asheville, N. C., by an effort of some of the people, headed by several clergymen, to prevent a Sunday concert announced to be given in that place. The concert was given, whereupon those opposed announced that the manager would be prosecuted under the Sunday law, which, while silent on the subject of concerts, does prohibit Sunday "labor." This, however, required a warrant, and as the warrant could not be legally served on Sunday, the manager escaped by taking an immediate departure from the town.

***

THE Catholic Standard and Times characterizes as a "cock-and-bull story" the newspaper report extensively circulated, that the Pope had recently said: "I pray God to so illumine President McKinley's mind that he may avoid the dangers of imperialism." "When the authentic version of the matter comes to hand," says the Standard and Times, "we shall most certainly find that if such words were used by the holy Father at all, they were accompanied by qualifications which would give them a widely different meaning from that which, taken by themselves, they would seem to bear."

***

A POLICY similar to that adopted by the Spanish General Weyler in Cuba for enforcing submission of the people to Spain has been adopted by General Kitchener in the Transvaal for the purpose of enforcing submission to Great Britain. In Europe and even in some parts of England the system is condemned as inhuman.

***

THE American commander-in-chief in the Philippines ascribes the persistence of the inhabitants in resisting American rule, to "ethnological homogeneity, which induces men to respond for a time to the appeals of consanguineous leadership, even when such action is opposed to their own interest." We fail to see how this throws more light on the subject than would the simple statement that the Filipinos are fighting from love of liberty.

SOME idea of the difficulties in which the English state church has become involved through its connection with the civil power, may be gathered from this statement in the English Churchman of Nov. 8: "For some time past the desirability or otherwise of instituting legal proceedings against some well-known London vicars, who are alleged to be conducting the services of their churches in a manner at variance with ecclesiastical law, has been under the consideration of leading Protestant churchmen."

The offending vicars are guilty of using incense in the church services, and in various other ways imitating the worship of the Church of Rome. Legal proceedings can be taken to oust these Romish vicars from their "livings," under the Church Discipline Act, passed by Parliament in 1840.

It appears, however, that the vicars have no intention of leaving, but will, as one of them said, "resist to the very utmost" the attempt to re-establish Protestant forms of worship in their churches. The result is, as stated by the *St. James Gazette*, that "the Bishop of London is on the horns of a dilemma. If he exercises his Episcopal veto, he will be greeted with a howl of execration." On the other hand, if he "allows the prosecution to proceed, vicars of numerous churches who recently curtailed their exuberant services at the Bishop's request, have arranged to reintroduce their forbidden ceremonies. This," says the *Gazette*, "would entail complete anarchy."

A Protestant state church is at best no further away from Rome than the border line between Protestantism and Rome, and naturally presents an inviting field for the "missionary" work of disguised Romanists. This is the trouble to-day with the Church of England.

The following words, uttered by a prominent Methodist clergyman from South America, to an immense audience of Methodists in New York City, on the occasion of the General Missionary Conference in that city, are worthy of note:

"A former speaker has said a condition where half of the world is pagan and the other half Christian can not endure long. The same can be said with as much truth of a state of affairs where Christendom is divided into two great camps, with Protestantism on one side and Greek and Roman Catholicism on the other. The time is upon us when anew the questions which appeared in the Protestant Reformation will begin to agitate the world, and demand to be pushed to their final issue."

Several severe arraignments of the Catholic Church were made by this speaker and others, which were received by the audience with "tremendous applause."

"ARE we all savages?" inquires *The Independent* in an editorial alluding to the wholesale massacres perpetrated by certain of the "Christian" powers in China. "Can none of us," it asks, "boast that our Christian culture has taken the brute out of us? We fear that even among us in America a mob of men can become a pack of wolves. Such savage mobs have we seen in New York, in Mansfield, O., in many a labor riot, and many a lynching crowd. They have chased negroes through the streets determined to kill; they have stripped and covered with tar a harmless preacher; they have cried 'scab' and tried to murder workingmen; they have stripped women naked and then shut the doors against them; they have stormed jails and taken out their victims and hanged them; they have seized men suspected of crime and burned them at the stake. We can shrink in horror from the incredible tale of Russian barbarism on the Amur; but it is not incredible, for we have millions of Cossacks right among us in this Christian land, who would do the same thing, or who have done as horrible things, if not on so large a scale."

And why is this so? Simply because, we answer, civilization does not mean Christianity. The trouble with the perpetrators of these outrages, and with the men who perpetrate the fearfully corrupt rule in our great cities, against which *The Independent* and other papers so loudly protest, is not that they are not civilized, but that they are not Christianized. Civilization alone does not take the "brute" out of anybody; indeed, a civilized brute is the worst kind of a brute, because he is the most intelligent kind. Mere knowlege of the truths taught by civilization, or of truth in any realm of science, does not confer power upon an individual to do right. If it did, the devil would be one of the best beings in existence.

The truth which this points out is a very important one. The people need to distinguish clearly between civilization and Christianity. This done, they will see that not civilization, but Christianity, is that which is to bless and uplift the inferior races of mankind. Not the soldier, but the Christian missionary, has the "right of way" in the Philippines, in Cuba, and in every benighted quarter of the earth.
