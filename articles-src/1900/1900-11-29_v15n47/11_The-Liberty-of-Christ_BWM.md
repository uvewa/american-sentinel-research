Christ is the executor of the divine plan of salvation. Self sacrifice is the secret of its power. With his own life Christ bought a world of sin, and ratified the contract with his blood. Adam traded the world to the devil for the privilege to die. The Lord shouldered the responsibility of death, and by death bought the right to let man live. And this right of life the Redeemer is pledged to bestow upon all who will recognize his authority as the Life-giver. This is life by virtue of a gift. In the gift is bound up the privilege of growth. In Christ no restriction is placed upon life, conscience, or action; this is liberty, the liberty of Christ. For, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." Sin is the only element of bondage on earth, and Satan is the inventor of sin, and all who are slaves to sin are in bondage to the devil; for "know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness." For, "Of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought into bondage."

## The Purpose of God.

The inhabitants of heaven are free; they are free from one another, and free from themselves. Their pleasure is good, and their profit is the glory of God. Before man sold his right to live, he enjoyed the liberty of Christ; but he traded the liberty of life for the bondage of death: he gave himself to be a slave to a taskmaster whose only pleasure would be the suffering and death of his subjects. His treatment of the human race stirred the pity of heaven, and God's own hand held out a release for all. He had compassion for a race of slaves, and offered them the best his universe contained, the gift of liberty, liberty in his Son. If love could win the human family the world would be converted. For this the eternal God is willing, and this is infinite love.

## Living Issues.

Liberty lives, and will live forever. It will triump over bondage as certainly as principle will conquer passion. The issues of life are battles waged in the human heart, of liberty or bondage, victory or defeat. Christ is a revelation of liberty, and during his earthly ministry his life was a battle royal; and the lesson taught the universe was liberty in death.

The traditions of the elders taught that the church is the source of power, therefore they demanded of the Lord his credentials. Spiritual usurpation is the most dangerous element that can fall into the hands of man. It is as much more dangerous than temporal usurpation as the power of Satan is greater than the power of man. The Pharisees were usurpers; their claims to power and authority were glaring assumptions that could not stand the test of truth. Christ is heaven's representative of power and authority. He is the genuine, all others are counterfeit. As usurpers, the Pharisees could only demand; as the rightful heir, who alone possesses power and authority, Christ could command.

## The Climax.

Iron-hearted Rome could subdue armies and waste kingdoms, but it could not resist the unjust demand of a Jewish rabble. Before its tribunal innocency could not plead his outraged cause. Purity and virtue were crushed beneath the feet of cruel passion and revenge. Upon the block of human injustice, with a Roman Pilate on the judgment seat, the Son of God was made to suffer at the hands of an impassioned church mob. The power of the church was greater than the sovereignty of Rome, and the guiltless was condemned to die. If usurped power could triumph then here is victory, the greatest that usurpation can bestow. But from the ashes of apparent defeat arises the flame of victory. The pathway of liberty may lead through the garden, the judgment hall, to the cross, and into the tomb; but priestly plotting and worldly power can frame no law, can hollow no tomb, and can make no seal that can restrain its power. And even now, while the vesper bells of time are tolling the death knell of the world, the saints of the eternal God will wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb (not in the blood of their fellow men), and in a little while shall shine as the stars forever and forever.
