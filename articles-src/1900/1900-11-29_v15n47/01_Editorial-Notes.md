THERE is no moral value in forced obedience.

THE political atheist is not merely he who does not acknowledge God in the heavens, but he also who will not recognize God in the conscience of his fellow-man.

JUST government does not favor one class above another. Indeed, government should know only citizens, each of whom has rights equal to the rights of each of his fellow-citizens.

WITHOUT a Sunday law everybody is free to rest or to work on that day as he may choose. With a Sunday law nobody is free, but all are compelled to stop work. Thus Sunday laws do not operate to promote human freedom.

To enjoy Sabbath rest means something more than merely stopping work. Because an individual stops work on the Sabbath, it does not follow that he is going to feel rested at the close of the day, or be physically benefitted by the intermission. The Sabbath without *religion* is neither restful nor beneficial.

THE declaration of Scripture that "every one of us shall give account of himself to God," constitutes an unanswerable reason why every one of us should be free from coercion in religion by a power which can say nothing to God in our behalf.

THE one sure antidote for intolerance is love. No one can be intolerant toward any person whom he loves; and as Christianity fills an individual with love for all men, in Christianity lies the world's hope of the long-sought era of universal peace and good will.
