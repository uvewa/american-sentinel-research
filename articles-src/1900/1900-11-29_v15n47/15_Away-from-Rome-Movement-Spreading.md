## "AWAY FROM ROME" MOVEMENT SPREADING.

From the New York Independent.

The agitation in Austria against the Roman Catholic Church, which began as a distinctly German movement, and has been confined chiefly to the German provinces, is now spreading among the other nationalities of that empire. For several months already the crusade has been gaining ground among the Slavs. In the Catholic province of Slavonia the newspapers are engaged in a determined attack on the church of Rome, chiefly for its antagonism to the best elements of modern culture. One of the liberal papers says that if the people of Slavonia had created their civilization on the basis of Protestant principles they would now be a powerful nationality. "Show us a clerical poet, or author, or artist, or savant who has done any permanent good to our people. Catholicism and culture are mutually antagonistic."

Among the Czechs the movement is also steadily spreading, being under the special leadership of the indefatigable Doctor Ishka, whose program includes the organization of a national Czech Church entirely independent of Rome. This leader is really an Old Catholic, and although refused acknowledgment as such by the Old Catholics of Germany only last year has found a warm advocate in Ignaz Kutshern, the editor of the Old Catholic *Volkruf*, the official organ of this body in Austria, who warmly indorses the agitation of Ishka and an anti-Rome movement side by side with that of the Germans. The organization of an Old Catholic National Church of the Czechs is also declared by leading Protestant churches of Austria as a healthy antidote to a radical clerical reaction which is believed to be on the way.

Ishka's propaganda has been so pronounced that the authorities of the state recently arrested him in Prague while delivering an address, on the ground that he was plotting to estrange the Czech people from their old faith, and that he was in complicity with Russian protagonists of the Pan-Czech movement, having also received funds for his work from St. Petersburg. So far, however, the "Away from Rome" cry among the Czechs seems to partake somewhat of an academic nature, and has not penetrated the masses. This latter the church authorities very much fear, on account of the well-known reverence the Czechs maintain for the memory of Huss, which could readily be made a battle-cry. In the meanwhile the movement is constantly growing in the German provinces, and is now almost entirely a religious and non-political movement.

The total number of conversions to the Protestant Church in these German provinces for the twelve months ending April, 1900, as officially reported by the state authorities, was 7,665, of whom 7,224 came from the Roman Catholic Church, which, however, gained 975 converts from Protestantism during this period, making a gain in favor of the Protestant Church of 6,690. The total increase so far has far surpassed the ten-thousand line. The "Away from Rome" propaganda has evidently come to stay, and is one of the fixed facts of modern religious life.

It is impossible to have and enforce a Sabbath law without some degree of interference with personal freedom in Sabbath-keeping.

It is stated that "Oom Paul" will, on his arrival in Holland, issue a proclamation to the world for the justification of his cause and with the hope that arbitration may yet come to the aid of the Boer republics.
