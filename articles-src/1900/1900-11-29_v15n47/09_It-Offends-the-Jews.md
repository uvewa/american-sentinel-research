We reprint the following from the *Jewish Chronicle* (Mobile, Ala.), not because we have any disposition to criticize the expression "Christian charity," as does the *Chronicle*, but because it illustrates the impropriety of a religious address to the people by a person acting in a political capacity. Such proclamations must needs give offense to some class of the people on religious grounds. A proclamation from the chief executive of a State or of the nation is necessarily addressed to all classes of people in the State or the nation, and it is discourteous, to say the least, to address an atheist as though he believed in God. But either the Thanksgiving proclamation does this, or else it ignores the atheist altogether, and treats him as a political nonentity; and this from the person (governor or president), who, in his political capacity, represents the atheist as fully as he does the Christian. Of late, also, the Thanksgiving proclamations have shown a tendency to give offense to the Jews. It is so in the present instance, and it will be remembered that one issued by President Cleveland did the same, by making a direct allusion to Christ. The *Chronicle* says:

"President McKinley is out with his Thanksgiving proclamation. In speaking of the grand united effort made by all the citizens of the land to alleviate the distress in 'the tragic visitation that overwhelmed the city of Galveston,' he refers to the 'sympathy and Christian charity,' which proved that 'we are one united people.' The President in speaking of the sympathy and charity shown by the citizens of the country might have left off the qualifying term attached to the word charity. Charity knows no creed. It is neither Christian, Jewish, Mohammedan, nor any other of the numberless creeds that make up the religious world. It is simply charity. I am well aware of the sense in which the President and our neighbors generally employ this term in this connection. But it is a wrong use, and it is about time that the world should know it. There is no such thing as Jewish virtue or Christian virtue. Virtue is virtue the world over. Honesty is honesty, truth is truth, justice is justice, whether Jew execute it or Christian perform it, and the sooner our neighbors learn this the more apt they will be to render that justice and that charity which they are accustomed to denominate Christian, but which in reality is nothing more nor less than charity without the qualifying term."
