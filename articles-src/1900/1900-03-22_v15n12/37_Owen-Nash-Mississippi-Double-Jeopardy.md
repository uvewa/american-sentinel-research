We publish this week a communication from Elder R. S. Owen, of Amory, Miss., relative to the proceedings that have been instituted against him there on the charge of breaking Sunday. Mr. Owen and a member of his congregation, Mr. Nash, were tried last July on this same charge and were acquitted; yet now, although no new charge has been brought against them, they are again placed on trial, contrary to the principles of justice and the general law of the land that the life, liberty, or property of any person shall not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. We do not believe this action is in any sense representative of the people of the State of Mississippi. No doubt the general sentiment in the matter is much more nearly represented by the protest published in connection with Mr. Owen's letter. The one thing it does fully represent is the Sunday law. Such extraordinary perversions of justice are never attempted in a good cause.
