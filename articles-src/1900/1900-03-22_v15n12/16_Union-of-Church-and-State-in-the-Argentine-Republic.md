One has but hastily to glance over the pages of history to see the disastrous consequences of the illegitimate union of the church with the state. Wherever such a condition of things has existed, there we may be positively sure of finding in the judicial or ecclesiastical annals, records of base injustice, religious persecutions, or continuous boycotting of the minority who happened to differ in matters of religion from the majority.

The Argentine Republic is no exception to this rule. There, the form of government is based on the same principle as that of the United States; each State being permitted to have its own legislative halls and pass its own laws. Unhappily, for the best interests of the inhabitants, there exists here an acknowledged union between the state and the Roman Catholic Church.

Recently, in one of the Argentine states.—Santiago del Estero, the provincial legislature, has passed a law, which compels all the officials employed by the state, to be present at the religious ceremonies performed in the Catholic Churches, upon all the national feast days, and obliging dissentients to forfeit one half of their monthly remuneration for each failure to comply with this statute. No reasonable person can fail to see the injustice of such a statute; since the holders of government positions are not allowed to think and act for themselves in matters of conscience, but must hold themselves in subordination to the religious dictates of the state.

In the United States, our friends the National Reformers, would call this an invasion of natural rights, a usurpation of God-given privileges. And such indeed is the truth. But what is the difference may I ask, between the pretensions of the Catholic Church and those of the National Reformers? Really there is no difference. The Catholic Church compels the observance of her feasts, but goes a step further, by obliging her adherents and others to be religious—at least for one hour on certain feast days, while the National Reformers would content themselves with enforcing an exterior observance of the feast days which they decide upon as necessary. But the position of both parties are essentially similar.

The consequences of applying such coercive measures in matters of religion, which deprive man of the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, are disastrous to the moral condition of any community. The enforcement of such statutes can have but one result, viz., to convert the timorous dissentient into a hypocrite, by compelling him to conform outwardly to the adopted views of the majority, or the persecution of those who are too conscientious to barter their conscience to the demands of every fanatical throng that may present itself.

No man has the right to demand obedience in matters of doctrine from another. Every man has the perfect right to do as he may wish, so long as he does not infringe the equal rights of his neighbor. God has given man the right to choose to worship him as he may desire, and not as a majority may adjudge; or to refuse absolutely to worship the Creator at all. And immediately any person or power steps in to hinder the free exercise of this right, such person or power is guilty of stealing the divine prerogative by constituting itself the supreme judge of the domain of conscience.

Where such a condition of things can happen, a union of church and state does really, if not nominally, exist.

The sad results of the past should help us to engrave upon our memories, with indelible letters, the words of that noble-hearted, disinterested man, General Grant, who in the latter end of his days, implored his fellow-citizens "to keep the church and state forever separate."

"Do unto others as you would they should do unto you," is the rule of every true Christian.

Buenos Ayres, Argentina.
