The efforts at securing a better observance of Sunday in Philadelphia are going forward with rather more persistency than is usual in connection with similar efforts. There are parts of the city in which retail stores of all kinds have paid no attention to the Sunday law for a long time. This has been especially true of cigar and candy shops. This effort encounters many difficulties. The police are lacking in zeal, and the friends of Sunday claim that they are very indiscreet, intentionally or otherwise, in their effort to enforce the law; thus bringing the movement into disrepute. Beyond all this the friends of Sunday seem inconsistent in that no effort is made to check the widespread disregard of the law on the part of the greater corporations.

A committee of the Evangelical Conference, meeting in Philadelphia on February 26, 1900, reported strong resolutions against the Sunday newspaper, and declared that the desecration of Sunday increases steadily, through picnics, excursions, camp-meetings, and the like. The committee recommended that each member of the conference—the conference is made up of several thousand clergymen—should preach at least one sermon on the Sabbath question during the month of May next. In the interest of Sabbath reform we hope that this resolution will be carried out, and that those clergymen, instead of making some slight discussion of the work of the police in enforcing Sunday laws in Philadelphia, will really preach upon the Sabbath question in its larger and deeper meaning.——Sabbath Recorder.
