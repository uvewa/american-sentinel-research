Cleroymen of Indianapolis have undertaken to secure the abolition of the army canteen by a novel plan, which it is hoped will prove successful. The plan is "that a day shall be set apart in which all Christian people shall close their houses of business and factories, and that services in all the churches shall be held, in which prayer shall be offered that the President may be directed divinely to abolish the system. It is a part of the program that all Christians shall also abstain from food from sunup to sundown on the day fixed for prayer."

We certainly hope some way can be found for the abolition of the army canteen, and that this effort may bear fruit in that direction if it does not accomplish all its promoters have in view.
