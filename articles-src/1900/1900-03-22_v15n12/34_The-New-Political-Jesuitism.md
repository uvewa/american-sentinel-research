*By Rev. Joseph Henry Crooker.*

A POLITICAL doctrine is now preached in our midst that is the most alarming evidence of moral decay that ever appeared in American history. Its baleful significance consists, not simply in its moral hatefulness, but in the fact that its advocates are so numerous and so prominent. It is this: A powerful nation, representative of civilization, has the right, for the general good of humanity, to buy, conquer, subjugate, control and govern feeble and backward races and peoples, without reference to their wishes or opinions. This is preached from pulpits as the gospel of Christ. It is proclaimed in executive documents as American statesmanship. It is defended in legislative halls as the beginning of a more glorious chapter in human history. It is boastfully declaimed from the platform as the first great act in the regeneration of mankind. It is published in innumerable editorials, red with cries for blood and hot with lust for gold, as the call of God to the American people.

But how came these men to know so clearly the mind of the Almighty? Was the cant of piety ever more infamously used? Was selfishness ever more wantonly arrayed in the vestments of sanctity? Is this the modern chivalry of the strong to the weak? Then let us surrender all our fair ideals and admit that might alone makes right. Is this the duty of great nations to small peoples? Then morality is a fiction. Is this the gospel of Jesus? Then let us repudiate the Golden Rule. Is this the crowning lesson of America to the world? Then let us renounce our democracy.

This doctrine is a political Jesuitism infinitely more immoral than that of the old ecclesiastics. It is the maxim of bigotry, "The end justifies the means," reshaped by ambition and greed. The mask is too thin and black. The colonial motive is not love for others. It is described by the word unwittingly put on their banners: Expansion, the expansion of our selfish selves. This teaching unbars the bottomless pit and lets loose upon the world every demon that ever vexed the human race. It unchains every wild passion that has lingered in man's blood since it flowed upward from the brute. It turned every thumbscrew that tortured heretics. It piled the fagots about every burning martyr. It laid on the lash that drew blood from the back of every suffering slave. It prepares the path for the despot to reach his throne of tyranny and arms him with instruments of oppression.

It was against this denial of both God and humanity that the barons hurled themselves at Runnymede. For its overthrow, Old Ironsides fought at Naseby and Marston Moor. To banish this theory of human affairs from the new world Washington suffered at Valley Forge and contended at Yorktown. To destroy the last vestige of this hateful policy, Grant conquered at Appomattox. This is not true Americanism, but the contradiction of every principle for which we have contended and in which we have gloried for over a century. This is not the upward way of civilization, but the backward descent to barbarism.

If this be duty, let us recite no more the Master's creed of love. If this be destiny, let us proclaim no more the rights of men. If this be patriotism, let us sing no more "America." We must rewrite the "Star Spangled Banner," and make its theme the praise of conquest and colonization. We must erase the motto, "E. Pluribus Unum," and inscribe instead, "One nation in authority over many people." We must tear up the Declaration of Independence and put in its place "A summary of the duties of colonists to their master." But this is political atheism.

Something more than the welfare of distant peoples is at stake. We condemn this teaching and policy, not simply to secure justice to the brown man, but to insure justice and freedom for ourselves. The motive of our protest is more than friendship for him; it is devotion to principles of liberty that are the necessary conditions of universal human progress. The feelings of sympathy and justice ought to rule us in these relations. But every advocate of our present national policy outrages these sentiments whenever he makes his defense. His words ring false. And yet the heart of the matter lies far deeper. The true glory of America is imperiled. The happiness of our descendants is assailed. The mission of America as the representative and guardian of liberty is in question. The perpetuity of free institutions hangs in the balance.

We cannot worship this golden calf and go unscourged. We cannot violate the principles of our Government and enjoy the blessings of those principles. We cannot deny freedom across the ocean and maintain it at home. This nation cannot endure with part of its people citizens and part colonists. The flag will lose all its glory if it floats at once over freemen and subjects. We cannot long rule other men and keep our own liberty. In the high and holy name of humanity, we are trampling upon the rights of men. But Nemesis will wake. The mask will fall; our joy shall be bitterness; we shall find ourselves in chains.

Most of all, we lament the stain that has come to our flag, not from the soldier carrying it, but from the policy that has compelled him to carry it in an unjust cause. . . . What we most deplore is the surrender that we as a nation have made of our leadership in the world's great work of human emancipation. What we most bitterly mourn is that we, by our selfish dreams of mere commercialism, have piled obstacles mountain high in the way of progress.

What is most surprising and most alarming is the fact that large numbers of our people still call this national ambition for conquest and dominion a form of exalted patriotism. But we are surely under the spell of a malign influence. A false Americanism has captivated our reason and corrupted our conscience. May this hypnotic lethargy, induced by the glittering but deceptive bauble of imperialism, speedily pass away; and may these fellow-citizens become again true Americans, free to labor for the liberty of all men and intent on helping the lowly of all lands to independence.
