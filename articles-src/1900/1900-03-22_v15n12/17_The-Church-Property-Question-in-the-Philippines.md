So far as conquest confers a right of ownership, the United States now practically owns the Philippine Islands. The most valuable property in these islands is the church property, and the question of the disposal to be made of this property is one the Government has not yet decided, and which is causing much perplexity. On the one hand stands the Catholic Church reaching out her hands for the property, claiming it is rightfully hers, and on the other hand it seems clear that the property belongs to the Government and cannot be turned over to the Catholic Church or any church without violating the principle which forbids church establishment. The situation is discussed in the *San Francisco Argonaut*, from which we quote:

"Another embarrassing phase is the church property question. Millions of dollars' worth of property in the islands is claimed by the Roman Catholic Church. But what is the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines? Is it the papacy? Is it the friars or monastic orders? Is it the Filipino people organized into parishes? Do these people own their parish churches? Or does the Government?

"Lew Wallace, Jr., in a recent article makes a striking argument to prove that it is the Government. He maintains that the Spanish crown obtained from the papal See grants to all regions west of the Azores; that the Spanish crown, in addition to conquest, thus acquired papal title to its colonies as well; that the Spanish crown even nominated officials of the church; that the Spanish crown allowed them the use of certain lands for religious purposes, such as churches, monasteries, nunneries, burial-grounds, etc.; that the Roman Church did not acquire title in fee, but only in usufruct; that there are in existence no deeds granting any such fee; that the title to such property is therefore not vested in the Roman Catholic Church, its bishop or its monastic orders; that it remained in the Spanish crown; that the Spanish-American war, by conquest and by treaty, transferred all property of the Spanish crown to the United States; that therefore the church property in the sometime Spanish islands is now the public property of the United States.

"Mr. Wallace's argument seems absolutely clear and uncontrovertible. It points with steadfast finger the path which the United States should follow. The Government is at present wavering, but any other course on the islands would result in a popular outburst on the mainland. If the United States Government donates this, its public property, now used for church purposes, to the church of Rome, or that church's monastic orders, it would perform a possibly pious, but certainly imprudent act. The first amendment of the Constitution prohibits an establishment of religion. To give valuable public property to the Roman Church for its support and maintenance would certainly be an establishment of religion. Any such act by the President—who now rules the islands—would be unlawful. Any statute by Congress authorizing such act would be unconstitutional. . . .

"Mr. Wallace's argument seems to us incontrovertible. The so-called church property in the Philippines has become the property of the United States. The best use to which the United States can put it would be to turn the monasteries and nunneries into public schools, and to utilize the revenues from the vast landed possessions to maintain these schools. Thus property once used for presumably beneficent ends will continue to be used in such directions, for nothing is more beneficent than the maintenance of public schools. If the property so long clutched by the Roman Catholic monastic orders in the Philippines should be devoted to educating the Filipinos in American public schools, it would surely prove that out of evil good may come."
