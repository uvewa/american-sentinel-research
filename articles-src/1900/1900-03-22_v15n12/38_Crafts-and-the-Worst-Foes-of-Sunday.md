In a summary of "recent gains and losses" for Sunday observance, by Rev. W. F. Crafts, which was a feature of one of the issues of the Topeka Daily Capital, under the Rev. Mr. Sheldon's control, the writer says that the "worst foes" of Sunday observance are "Christians who patronize Sunday trains, Sunday newspapers, and Sunday mail," in which are included ministers as well as lay members of the church. Mr. Crafts remarks that "with such news coming in from the church, we cannot expect much from those who represent the state."

Of course not; yet this same Mr. Crafts and many others who say the same thing are diligently working to reform the state in order that Sunday desecration may be stopped. Why not begin on the "worst foes" of Sunday first, and institute a reform in the church that will eradicate the church's demand for Sunday desecration? Why try in the name of religion to estop the state from giving to church people that for which they are all the time asking?
