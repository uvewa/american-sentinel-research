It seems strange that the people of any so-called Christian nation could find it in their heart to justify war on the basis that it is "one of the finest methods of national money-making it is possible to conceive of," yet this is what in effect we find in a leading English magazine; and the remark is made that during the past thirty years, the victorious nations in war have regarded their bank account with a considerable degree of complacency, and have come to agree with the remark which statesmen make, that "there are some things worse than war." Then the writer goes on to enumerate: Japan in her war with China, made a clear profit of £31,000,000; Germany in her struggle with France, over £200,000,000, and Russia's bill to Turkey for seven months' fighting was for £141,000,000, of which not a quarter of it was actual expense. Life, limb, blasted homes, ruined lives, widows and orphans, seem to count for nothing before the insatiable desire for riches.—*London "Present Truth."*
