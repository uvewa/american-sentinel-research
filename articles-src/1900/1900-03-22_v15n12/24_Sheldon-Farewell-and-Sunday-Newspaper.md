MR. SHELDON'S farewell as a Christian journalist expressed the hope that the desecration of Sunday by the publication of newspapers will soon cease. As a publisher he avoided such desecration of Sunday by publishing the Sunday edition of the *Daily Capital* on Saturday afternoon. As people are usually busy on Saturday afternoon and evening, probably few found opportunity to peruse the Sunday *Capital* before the following morning; so that one of the main objections made to the Sunday paper may still apply to Mr. Sheldon's Sunday issue,—it comes into competition with the preachers; and all the more so in this case, it may be, because of its being strictly a Christian paper. The New York *Sun's* Topeka's correspondent affirms that an entire Sunday was spent in preparing for the Sheldon editions of the paper, and remarks that why the circulation of the paper on Sunday would be any more sinful than this, is a query that has not been explained.
