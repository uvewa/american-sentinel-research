From the Seattle Daily Times, of March 2, we quote the following with reference to a Sunday-closing movement which has been started in that city:—

"For some time past there has been a quiet agitation in favor of the week-day six o'clock and Sunday-closing idea, of the Seattle stores. That agitation has at last taken on a definite form, and beginning with Sunday next all retail clothing, dry goods, men's furnishing goods, boots and shoes, and groceries, will be closed. The above-named class of stores have all agreed to this, and with the exception of Saturday nights, the doors will be shut promptly at six o'clock and all day Sundays.

"The Western Central Labor Union, representing all the trades Unions in Seattle, has had the matter in hand for the clerks, and throughout the entire agitation has met with the most unexpected success in getting the merchants to agree to their proposition.

"On Monday night, March 5, all the trades unions of this city will meet at the labor headquarters on Third and Union for a demonstration that bids fair to excel in every way all past movements of a like nature. Three bands of music have been secured to head the procession, which will form in front of the labor headquarters. The line of March is as follows:—

"East from Third and Union on the latter street to Fourth; north on Fourth to Pike; west to First, south to Main, east on Main to Occidental Avenue, north on Occidental Avenue to Yesler Way, east on Yesler to Second, and then north to Germania Hall.

"Here the parade will be dismissed, and immediately following the dismissal the Union men will enter Germania Hall to hold a mass meeting in favor of the movement.

"The leaders of the several trades unions will deliver speeches indorsing the movement, and several sympathizers and supporters of the idea, business men about town, will also be heard from. . . .

"This movement has been a pronounced success throughout the Middle West, and there is no reason why it should not be here. For instance, Denver, Salt Lake City, Spokane, Portland, Helena, Butte, Vancouver, B.C., and throughout Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois, this system is working, and to the best effect.

"Better service in the above-named cities from the clerks was one benefit derived from the movement, and the merchants found their receipts to be as large, if not larger, than under the old regime."

So far as appears from this, the Sunday closing in this movement is voluntary, and not by demand or the enforcement of law. Every person has of course a right to close his place of business on Sunday, and if he chooses to do so this is no interference with religious liberty. If the Sunday-closing question can be settled by a voluntary agreement on the part of tradesmen to do no business on Sunday, the SENTINEL will have no objection to offer. It only asks that nobody be compelled to close on Sunday against his will. It only asks that no religious views of right be enforced by law. It only asks that everybody be left free, as God has made him, to observe Sunday or any other day, or no day at all, according as his own views of right may direct. It only asks that the civil law shall not be crowded into the domain of conscience.
