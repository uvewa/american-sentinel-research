MAYOR VAN WYCK of New York City has decided, by veto of a bill to relieve a Lutheran church from paying assessments for public improvements, that churches in this city are not exempt from bearing their part of the financial burden which such improvements impose. "The benefit to the church from any public work for which an assessment has been levied," he says, "is a direct benefit, as much as if the increased valuation of its property came from the erection of new buildings or the adornment of buildings already erected on its real estate. Retaining the benefit, it should bear its just proportion of the burden."
