### ARRESTS DUE TO RELIGIOUS ANIMOSITY. THE SENTIMENT OF THE COMMUNITY AGAINST SUCH WORK.

The readers of the SENTINEL will remember the trials of J. H. Nash and myself last July at Amory, Miss. for Sunday work. We were each tried in the justice court before a jury which returned a verdict of not guilty and we were acquitted. This we supposed would be the end of the matter and in ordinary cases of crime it would have been, for the law declares that an acquittal in such a court is a bar against any further accusation for the same offense. But while Sunday work is being done almost any Sunday by those who profess to keep the day: yet for one who conscientiously observes the seventh day as the Sabbath to neglect to pay due respect for Sunday is considered so heinous a crime that it would seem he must be dragged from one court to another till a jury can be found sufficiently blinded by religious prejudice to convict him. Hence the officer of the law has come and arrested Brother Nash, and I have been notified to appear before the circuit court at Aberdeen where we are called to answer the second time for the same offense. It is evident that the directors of this inquisition would have preferred a new case if they could have found one, for we have been informed by one man that he was offered a dollar to watch the Adventists on Sunday.

We are glad to say that this unjust, unchristian and unlawful treatment we are receiving at the hands of a certain class whom we need not describe, does not represent the better part of our community. We have honorable men of breadth of mind and character who are not afraid to speak against such injustice, and they have given expression to their sentiments in the following words which have been signed by the most prominent men of our community:

### "To Whom it may Concern:

"WHEREAS an effort is being made by certain parties, to bring hardships upon a class of conscientious Christian people in our community, known as Seventh-day Adventists, by arraigning them before the courts for the most trivial acts in the way of work which they may have done on Sunday, after resting on the Sabbath;

"Therefore, we, the undersigned citizens of Monroe County, Miss., do hereby express our dissapproval of any such proceedings as will lower the dignity of our State by thus using it as an instrument of persecution.

"Adopting the language of George Washington we believe that, 'Every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.'"

We expect to appear before the court next week.

R. S. OWEN.

Hatley, Miss., March 9.
