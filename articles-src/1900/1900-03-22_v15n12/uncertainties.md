---

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 9, "Sunday Observance Agitation in Cleveland, Ohio"
- **Issue:** Rev. Pickard's quoted speech contains "weever" — `"I don't know that weever had one."`
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "weever" (as in the OCR source)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — This appears to be an OCR artifact or a typographic error in the original for "we ever." Preserved as-is since accuracy requires preserving what appears in the original.
- **Reason:** Could not determine with certainty whether the original printed "weever" as one word or "we ever" as two. The OCR source shows no space. Preserved as printed in the OCR source.
