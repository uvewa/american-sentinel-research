The question of the validity of Sunday contracts is to be passed upon by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, says a report from Boston. The case is that of a young man who made a contract of marriage on Sunday evening, and now wishes to be absolved from fulfilling it. The matter was brought before a Boston judge, who ruled that a Sunday contract of this sort was valid and must be kept or constitute a basis for damages. As the general law is that contracts made on Sunday are not valid, it may be interesting to discover why they are binding in the form of a promise to marry, and not binding in other matters.
