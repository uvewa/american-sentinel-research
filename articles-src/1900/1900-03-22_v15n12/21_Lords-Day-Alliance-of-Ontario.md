THE Lord's Day Alliance of Ontario has appointed the Rev. J. G. Shearer, minister of Erskine church, Hamilton, to the office of Field Secretary, and Mr. Shearer has signified his decision, with the consent of his presbytery, to accept the appointment. This, we are informed, "is a significant step, and it is intended to start in motion a new wave of Sabbath reform in Canada."
