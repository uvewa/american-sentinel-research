ATTENTION is called by The Outlook to a decline that is manifest in two of the leading churches in this country, the Presbyterian Church and the Methodist Church. "Some time since," says The Outlook, "we pointed out the fact that the great Presbyterian communion was showing a decline in membership and in financial sustenance. Even greater astonishment comes in the discovery that the Methodist Church is now losing in numbers. Bishops Fowler, Ninde, and Joyce have issued an address to the church calling for a week of prayer, during which daily services are to be held in all Methodist churches throughout America. The address states that statistics for the last year show a decrease in the number of members in the church, and urges every Methodist to take himself to prayer, and to 'call mightily on God for help.'"

The Outlook offers the suggestion "that the decline in numbers in both the Presbyterian and Methodist communions is not altogether due to lack of prayer, but also and even more to a lack of 'works.' The churches have maintained themselves too much in touch with the classes, and too aloof from the masses. This fact has long been recognized by some intelligent church workers."

The first duty of the Christian Church, however, is to maintain itself in touch with its divine Head, Jesus Christ. If the church does this, she must always prosper; but there is such a thing as the church's severing herself from her Head in order to get in closer touch with the masses. The church of the fourth and fifth centuries did this, and was obliged to substitute a visible human head, which is all the head she has had ever since.

The true Christian Church, of course, is always the body of Christ; and her prosperity depends not upon numbers or wealth, but upon the spiritual nourishment and vigor constantly imparted from her divine Head. And as Jesus Christ was always in close touch with the masses, the "common people," so the church which is one with him will be in close touch with the people of all classes and conditions, and will not find it necessary to lower the standard of truth and righteousness to attain success.
