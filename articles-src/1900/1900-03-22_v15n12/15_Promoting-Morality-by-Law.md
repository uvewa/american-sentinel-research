Under the heading "An Attempt to Promote Morality by Legislation," the New York Sun of March 6 discusses a bill now before the legislature of this State making adultery a misdemeanor and punishable as such. It seems that adultery in this State is not punishable under the criminal code as it now stands. The Sun mentions a letter from Bishop Doane (Episcopal) of Albany, asking the Sun to cooperate with the bill, on the ground that "the State ought to assist the church to prevent sin;" to which the Sun replies that "the state has nothing to do with 'sin', which is 'transgression of the law of God.' The state deals only with offenses against man and human society."

The Sun's answer is certainly correct. The state has no business to join with the church to put down sin. To do so would be to join church and state, and reestablish persecution. The state can however and should, deal with adultery as a crime, where it constitutes an invasion of human rights. In this, as in all other matters, the state is bound to protect the rights of its citizens, and enact and enforce such measures as will best secure this end. But with adultery in the broad, scriptural sense, the state is powerless to deal and can accomplish no good by the attempt.

Neither can the state make men moral by laws against this sin. This is amply demonstrated by experience. The church, instead of asking the state for aid against it, should deal more rigidly with it in her own discipline. This is the suggestion the Sun makes in the matter. It says:—

"The church, however, here and everywhere else, has the power to punish adultery in its own members with ecclesiastical penalties, with which the state does not interfere, and as the offense is a 'sin' in its view it can proceed against it accordingly without any secular assistance. The Roman Catholic Church has no trouble in the matter and why should the Episcopal Church or any other be in worse case? When, for instance, a divorce is obtained in violation of the Episcopal canon and the parties or either of them marry new mates they are living in virtual adultery in its view and it is really such instances which have provoked the introduction of the bill in the New York Legislature; yet the church itself has full power to deal with these 'sinners' if it is so disposed. If, practically, the church law against them is largely a dead letter, what reason is there to suppose that the civil law would do any better? Actually, as we have said, the criminal punishment of adultery is so rare in the States which make it indictable, that their laws against it amount to nothing. Moral and social and religious law and sentiment only can administer the preventive punishment."
