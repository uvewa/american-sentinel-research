Speaking of the difficulties in which the Church of England has become involved through her dependence upon the state, an English exchange says:—

"A most pitiable state of things in religious matters has been revealed by the recently-issued intercession service for the soldiers. Objection having been made to the prayer for the dead, which occurs in it, the Archbishop of Canterbury has directed his chaplain to write that 'it has been decided by law that prayers for the dead are not forbidden in the Church of England.'

"This, however, does not satisfy everybody. The chairman of the Church Association has written a long letter to the Duke of Devonshire, Lord President of the Council, protesting against the prayer for the dead, and pointing out that it was ordered by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Lord President, sitting in council, 'and so without the knowledge of Parliament and probably without Her Majesty having any real cognizance of what was being done, a very grave constitutional change was attempted to be made in the doctrinal standards of the Church of England.'

"Of course the protest will not avail anything, for the leaders of the Church of England are determined to demonstrate its essential identity with the Church of Rome, a thing which those who oppose the new prayer are themselves unconsciously doing: for they base their protest not upon the Bible, which is the only real authority in matters of religion, but they appeal to man as against man; and this is Roman Catholicism. It is sad to see men looking to men, and depending upon human beings to know what they are to believe and practise. 'Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.' Whichever way such a controversy as this turns, the papacy is the gainer."
