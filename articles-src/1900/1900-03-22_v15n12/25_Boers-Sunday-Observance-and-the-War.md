IT is a well-known fact, of which mention has been made in the daily press, that the Boers are strict observers of Sunday, and have refrained on that day from bombarding the cities besieged by them, and have avoided all Sunday fighting when possible, while the British, on the other hand, have conducted operations on Sunday as usual, and have disregarded the day almost entirely. The Boers, we are informed, have on occasions been much shocked at the reckless profanation of Sunday they have observed going on in the British camps, where military preparations or sports and games have been the common occupation of officers and troops on that day. Accordingly, therefore, if there is any force or truth in what we have been so often and earnestly told by Sunday agitators, that disaster and the judgments of God surely follow the profanation of Sunday, the hand of the Lord should be against the British in the war and on the side of the Boers. But apparently it is just the other way. The British are sweeping everything before them, and the Boers are in constant retreat and asking for terms of peace. At first, before the British preparations had been completed, the tide of success was with the Boers, and this might have been pointed to as an indication of the divine favor for their strict observance of Sunday; but as the British became overwhelmingly superior in the number of their men and cannon, the tide turned, just as it might naturally be expected to do. The disasters consequent upon the profanation of Sunday have not appeared, and events are putting the plain stamp of nonsense upon the idea that Sunday observance and national prosperity are necessarily connected with each other.
