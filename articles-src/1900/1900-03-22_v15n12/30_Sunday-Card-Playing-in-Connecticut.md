An exchange prints the following:—

"It is reported that on the last day of January, 1900, six orthodox Hebrews, living in the city of New Haven, Conn., were arrested for playing cards on Sunday. They protested that since they observed the Sabbath, they were not amenable to the civil law for playing cards on Sunday. . . . Touching the question of consistency, it would be interesting to note how many persons, not Hebrews, were playing cards on that same Sunday in the city of New Haven. Perhaps New England courts recognize that there is no wickedness in playing cards on Sunday except on the part of those who have been religious enough to observe the day before as the Sabbath, and that men who ostensibly observe Sunday as the Sabbath may, without sin, or infringement of the civil law, add to the enjoyment of their 'rest-day' by card-playing. Great is the mystery of Connecticut justice."

It is hardly fair to call this "Connecticut justice." Connecticut is all right, but certain people in one of its cities are trying to enforce the Sunday law; and in any State where this is done, queer samples of "justice" will be shown up. It is Sunday-law justice, and that is a mystery always.
