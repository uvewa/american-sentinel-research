AT a recent Methodist ministers' meeting held in Baltimore, the following resolutions relating to the effort to modify the Sunday law in the State of Maryland, which was defeated, and to the later effort to enact a modified Sunday law for Baltimore, were passed and forwarded to the legislature:

"HON. WILLIAM DUNCAN, Chairman City Delegation, House of Delegates, Annapolis, Md.

"The Baltimore Methodist Episcopal Preachers' Meeting, in regular session this morning, adopted the following resolutions:

"Resolved, That we, the members of the Baltimore Methodist Episcopal Preachers' Meeting, representing more than eighty churches in this city, do hereby express our hearty gratitude to that large majority of members of the House of Delegates of the State of Maryland for their prompt defeat of the Sanford Sunday bill, that would have secularized the Sabbath and demoralized the people by legalizing the opening of some three thousand retail stores in this city upon God's holy day, and further that our representatives in this noble defense of the American Sabbath have been true to the best traditions and the highest interests of our beloved Commonwealth.

"Resolved, That we protest against further effort upon the part of Mr. Sanford and his allies to fasten upon Baltimore City his proposed demoralizing laws after they have been repudiated by the State and city."

Perhaps the Methodist clergy here represented have never heard that in California no Sunday law exists to protect the alleged sanctity of Sunday and the morals of the people; and yet Sunday is quite as generally observed in California as in Maryland, nor are the people more demoralized in the one State than in the other. Store-keepers as a general rule prefer to close on Sunday and if the Maryland Sunday law were entirely repealed the store-keepers' of Baltimore would, we doubt not, still close on Sunday as usual. The causes which determine in such a matter reach back of all Sunday laws, and cannot be eradicated or materially affected by them. The morality or immorality of a city depends upon the operation of influences which lie altogether beyond the reach of any Sunday law that can be enacted.
