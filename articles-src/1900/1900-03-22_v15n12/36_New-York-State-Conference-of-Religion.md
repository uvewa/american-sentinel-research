"The New York State Conference of Religion," is the name of a religio-political organization formed in this State last May, and which is now nearing a condition of readiness to begin its public work by the holding of meetings, etc. A meeting was to have been held in this city in April next, but for various religious and political reasons the meeting has been postponed until November. We find this notice made of it in The Outlook:

"The movement is an attempt of men who differ seriously in their religious philosophy, or theology, to get together for some practical interests wherein they are religiously agreed. It is not a congress or parliament of religions for a comparison of opposing views, but a conference of religion for the combination of religiously-planned efforts toward objects for which all truly religious men are concerned. Nine religious denominations are represented in the executive committee of the conference, viz., Baptist, Congregational, Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, Reformed, Unitarian, Universalist, and Israelite; and it is supported and indorsed by such men as Chancellor McCracken, Chancellor Day, President Allen, President Taylor, Dr. Allen of Tarrytown, Dr. Josiah Strong, and others whose names are on the list of the general and executive committees. The committee say:

"With a view to the ultimate junction of all religious forces within the State in co-operative efforts for those ends of moral and social betterment in which the religious spirit, whatever its outward forms, is agreed, it aims to bring to a common platform and a common endeavor the earnest-minded of all religious denominations."
