THE Rev. Chas. M. Sheldon's idea of editing a paper on the basis of answering the question, "What Would Jesus Do?" as an editor, is one that strikes different people in various ways, and which may be open to some criticism; but the attempt itself has much in it to be commended. It would be a great gain for society if the newspapers would print no scandal, would omit the details of crime, and would in all things aim to elevate the tastes and purposes of the public instead of seeking only to supply the public appetite without reference to the character of the thing supplied. But newspapers, like other branches of business, are conducted with a view primarily to making money; and undoubtedly the Rev. Mr. Sheldon's experiment, while it has succeeded for the time as a novelty, would not permanently be attended with financial profit. There are not enough people in the land who prefer that kind of a newspaper to one of the ordinary style. The vast majority of people are not Christians in the strict sense of the word, and only truly Christian people will want a truly Christian paper.
