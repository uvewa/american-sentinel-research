We note the following in *The Examiner*, a leading Baptist weekly of this city:

"The Woman's National Sabbath Alliance held its monthly meeting on Monday, February 26, in the Assembly Hall at 156 Fifth Avenue, New York. It was well attended and interesting. Reports from the secretaries and the treasurer proved the organization to be wide-awake and prosperous. An extensive correspondence is being carried on, and the Sabbath literature is being widely distributed, bringing to the office many tributes to its high character and its usefulness. Reports from standing committees and auxiliaries show that good and aggressive work is being pushed against Sunday saloons and cigar stores and Sunday sports. Strong protests were made against the patronizing of Sunday caterers, fruit and flower stores, and against Sunday social functions. There seems to be encouraging evidence that the leaven is working, and that there are less dinner parties and teas on the Sabbath than a year ago."
