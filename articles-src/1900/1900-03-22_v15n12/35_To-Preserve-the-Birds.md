A SINGULAR effect of irony is produced by this dispatch, received from Washington last evening:—

"Minister Conger has informed the State Department that, at the request of the diplomatic corps in Pekin, the Chinese government has prohibited the exportation of pheasant skins. The birds were being ruthlessly slaughtered to meet the demand in the European markets for their plumage."

This is the first official step taken in any country of the world to save the birds, unless the queen's prohibition of the use of egrets on the guards' headgear be considered such a step. Yet such steps must be taken, and very soon, too, by every nation, if the extinction of the human race is a thing to be avoided. There is no sort of doubt that this matter depends on the preservation of the birds, for reasons which must be well known: and at the rate that women are using up the birds of the world, their disappearance is really calculable. Millions of birds are not killed yearly without immensely diminishing the possibilities of the survival of the species most in demand, or, in truth, without making it absolutely sure that they will be exterminated. The slaughter must stop, and as a simple measure of preservation of the race the governments of the world have got to pass even more stringent bills than Senator Hoar has framed and advocated. It is not sentiment that will compel this, but the hardest of economic reasons.—Springfield Republican, March 8.
