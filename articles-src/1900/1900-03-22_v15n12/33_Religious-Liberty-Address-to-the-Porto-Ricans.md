*Translated from the Spanish.*

The right of every person to think on all kinds of questions, religious, as well as civil, and to form his judgment and to determine his attitude with respect to them without anyone introducing either civil or ecclesiastical authority, has always been a principle which is the motto and glory of the American Republic.

The only restriction that ought to be imposed is that this liberty for the individual who is guided by the infallible Word of God must not degenerate into libertinage and thus result prejudicially against the same individual and all others who follow it. By this is not permitted polygamy, lawlessness, anarchy, nor many other things of this character. The unfolding of these principles to the individual unprejudiced by the masses, which are, denying justice to none, but equal rights for all, or in other words, with malice towards none and charity for all, is the rule we have followed in all our legislatures and institutions. The Government was instituted to help and defend everyone in the exercise of these rights and privileges. It is not partisan, nor for the rich to override the poor, nor for the educated against the ignorant, nor of any one class against another, only this, that all respect and obey the laws. That all may know what are their dues and privileges, we have established in all places and for all classes our schools and churches.

So to us it appears that to be worthy and able to exercise these rights of American citizenship so as to insure our eternal salvation and adoption of all good sentiments, it is of primary importance that the Porto Ricans establish themselves firmly on this principle of Free Examination, or The Open Bible, and adopt it practically. The mission of the Evangelical churches from the great reformation exemplified in the 16th century has been to give emphasis to this right, and it is a duty to insist on it. Because of this we made it possible for the Bible to become public property and we established schools in all parts of the world. . . . We believe that God wishes all to be saved and filled with the knowledge of the truth. To discharge this sacred obligation we have come to this island and we offer to serve all those who wish to accept our efforts and assist in our meetings. We are in the position to celebrate marriage, make explanation of the Bible visit the sick, bury the dead, console the afflicted, and by all these means which are in our province promote the progress and wellbeing of those Porto Ricans who are our brethren.

Signed, EVANGELICAL PASTORS.

San Juan, Porto Rico.
