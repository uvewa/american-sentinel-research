A BILL is to be introduced in the New Jersey legislature making it a misdemeanor to refuse medical aid to persons dangerously ill, or to prevent such persons from being attended by a physician. The bill is aimed at the "Christian Scientists," who will, if it becomes a law, be liable to prosecution for taking charge of any case of dangerous sickness.
