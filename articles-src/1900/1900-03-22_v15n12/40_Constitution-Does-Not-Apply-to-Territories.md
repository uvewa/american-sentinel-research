Both branches of Congress have now decided that the Constitution does not apply to territory under the authority of the Government, outside the United States; or in other words, that such territory—Porto Rico, Hawaii, the Philippines, etc.—has a supreme and irresponsible master in the Congress of the United States. In the United States, Congress is amenable to the Constitution; but as the Constitution by this decision does not apply to this other territory, yet American authority does apply to it, it is simply to be governed at any time as Congress at that time may see fit. And now unless the Supreme Court shall give a contrary decision in the matter, the nation will stand fully committed to the system of government without a constitution, either written or understood. This is simple absolutism, and is a form of government in which every avenue is wide open to despotism. It is despotism in form, and if history teaches anything we may be sure it will speedily result in a despotism in fact.

Thus the Government now stands in the anomalous and untenable position of being half republic and half empire, half free and half despotic, unless the Supreme Court shall reverse the judgment. Once before it occupied this position, and the result was a Civil War. That was necessary to preserve constitutional government; but it would seem that the majority of people to-day do not prize constitutional government as did their fathers of forty years ago.
