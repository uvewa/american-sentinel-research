ONE very commendable thing about Mr. Sheldon's Christian newspaper was its exclusion of lying and fraudulent advertisements. Every paper is responsible for the statements made in its advertisements. It puts these out to its readers as being the truth, or at least as being true in the opinion of the publishers; and its readers have a right to view the advertisements as accompanied by the guaranty of the paper. And any journal, and especially a religious journal, which prints advertisements calculated to deceive and injure its readers, is not one whit higher in character than the liar and swindler for whom it is the means of finding victims.
