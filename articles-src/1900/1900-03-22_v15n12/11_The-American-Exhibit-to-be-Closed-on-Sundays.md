By order of the American Sabbath Union, through the chief executive of the American people, the American Exhibit at the Paris World's Fair will be closed on Sundays. We note the following on the subject in the Chicago Times-Herald:—

"The American section at the Paris Exposition will be closed upon Sundays by order of the President. A delegation representing the American Sabbath Union called upon the President several days ago and asked him to issue orders to Commissioner-General Peck to prohibit all labor by the workmen and the clerks connected with the American commission to the Paris Exposition on the Sabbath day and to close the American pavilion, and cover all the American exhibits on Sundays throughout the exposition. The President thanked the delegation for bringing the matter to his attention, and Secretary Hay at once prepared instructions to Commissioner-General Peck. Secretary Hay has received the following letter from the general secretary of the American Sabbath Union on the subject:—

"'Pittsburg, Pa., March 8.

"'The Hon. John Hay, Secretary of State,

"'Washington, D. C.

"'My Dear Sir: I had a very pleasant chat with the President yesterday with reference to the subject matter of our interview. I told him of the conference Bishop Hurst and myself had with you and of our entire satisfaction with the instructions that have already been sent to Commissioner-General Peck and Ambassador Porter.

"'The President inquired if I had suggested to you the advisability of sending a word of extra caution concerning the opening day—Easter Sunday. I replied that I had, and that you had the matter under advisement. The President spoke of your conversation with him relative to this matter, and said that he would advise with you further concerning it.

"'Allow me to assure you, Mr. Secretary, of our confidence in your wisdom in dealing with this question, and shall allow it to rest in your hands without further suggestion.

"'I am very sincerely yours,

"'J. W. HATHAWAY,

"'General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union,

"'203 Broadway, New York.'"

One might suppose from this that the American Sabbath Union, and not the American people, were behind the American Exhibit at the Paris Fair. If those whom the exhibit truly represents want it closed on Sunday, that is their right, to which no one will take exception; but why should the exhibit be closed merely to meet the mind of the American Sabbath Union? This ecclesiastical organization has done nothing to promote the Exposition, pays for no space at the fair, and yet demands that its "Sabbath" shall be on exhibition every Sunday while the fair continues. The only "reason" for this action is in the religious opinions of certain American clergymen.

All men, including clergymen, have a right to their own opinions; but this right is no broader in the case of clergymen's opinions than in other cases. No person has a right to set up his opinion by law as authority for others.

The civil authority has no business to act in this matter in deference to this religious union. The question of opening or closing the American Exhibit belongs to the American people, or to those whom the exhibit represents, and this intrusion of the American Sabbath Union is only a piece of impertinence that is characteristic of these religio-political organizations.
