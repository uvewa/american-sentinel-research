That the American Republic has fallen upon evil times has been evident for some time. And the evidence which proves this continues rapidly to accumulate. The vision of a seer is not required at this time to discover the paramount issue in American public life—the crisis which can not fail to hold with an irresistible and fascinating power the attention of every friend of liberty. Indifference is simply impossible with him who places any just value upon the principles of civil and religious liberty which have obtained some growth in the world during the last two or three centuries. This issue and this crises is the repudiation of the principles of American constitutional government; and it is an issue which will remain when the presidential campaign now raging is at an end.

## The Place of the Constitution.

The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of this country; the foundation upon which rests the whole governmental structure. Treaties and laws become of force only when made in pursuance of this fundamental law. The Constitution contains those things upon which the American people were once agreed in regard to their Government—the things to which they bound themselves and their representatives. If ever they find this law inadequate or unsatisfactory, they have agreed to constitutionally change or amend it. Though they should choose not only to alter it, but to reverse it entirely, every step toward that end must be taken in recognition of the Constitution and according to constitutional procedure. Not to do this is to destroy and overthrow the Government as it has hitherto existed, because the Constitution is the instrument which gave existence to the Government of the United States and by authority of which it has continued to exist. The sovereignty of the people, as Lincoln well declared, is not for the overthrow of the Constitution, but for the overthrow of those who pervert the Constitution. The Constitution has this place and this reverence because it was made by its framers the legal bulwark of the rights and liberties of the people. How well they guarded those rights in it may be judged from the fact that it has been the object of attack of every movement in the history of this country which has attempted the abridgement of any of those rights. This law is in force until it is changed by the people.

## The Natural Method of Subversion.

It is therefore a dangerous thing for the American Government—a day of more than ill omen—when public men treat this instrument as of no force whatever and determine to ignore it entirely. This is so plain that it would seem that any scheme, however foreign and antagonistic it might be to the letter and spirit of the Constitution, would by every subtlety and every argument possible be made to appear in accordance therewith or incorporated as a part thereof. This would certainly seem to be the most natural method of procedure; and it is a method which in most cases has been adopted by those who in the past have attempted to deny to others the freedom so ably guaranteed in the Constitution.

The movement which THE SENTINEL has opposed from the day of its establishment, and which for half a century has aimed at the subversion of the religious freedom guaranteed by the first amendment to the Constitution, sought for years to attain its object by an amendment to the Constitution. But at last when the Supreme Court in 1892 decided that this country, according to the language and meaning of the Constitution, was a "Christian nation" and therefore constitutionally authorized to enforce all or any part of what was deemed the Christian religion, the promoters of this movement have virtually ceased to agitate for an amendment, and are proceeding with the enforcement, wherever public opinion will allow, of what they deem the institutions and usages of Christianity. They proceed now without an amendment just as they intended to proceed on obtaining an amendment. So much for the overthrow of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.

## The Doctrines of Civil Freedom Denied.

To-day the doctrines of civil freedom with which the Constitution abounds, and which must stand or fall with religious freedom, are denied strongly and vigorously by a large and powerful element in this country. But even in this element are those who still have some realization of the true significance of the Constitution and who therefore hesitate at its complete repudiation. There is a disposition in some quarters to hold that this denial of civil freedom is constitutional, and some journals, not willing to appear boldly in defiance of the organic law of the nation, assert that taxation without representation and government without the consent of the governed by the United States over distant and alien peoples, is authorized by the expression in the Constitution that "Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States."

## The Constitution Abandoned—"This Nation Can Conquer Like Any Other."

But one of the oldest and most influential of American journals, and one which stands at the head of this large and powerful element, says that such an argument will not do, that "to center defense upon that claim is to trust to unstable security," and then following this, boldly and unequivocally declares that in this matter the Constitution must be abandoned entirely. This journal, the New York *Tribune*, on July 19, discussed this "defense" editorially, and among other things said:

"When territory is acquired by treaty, without engagement to take it into the Union, the Sovereign Nation has authority to rule it as it will, subject to the law of freedom instinct in its own being, or, as the President puts it, Congress has full legislative power, 'subject only to the fundamental safeguards of liberty, justice and personal rights.'"

"That is the view of the Circuit Court [in the 'recent decision upholding a special tariff for Porto Rico'] which bases our free hand in the new territories on their status outside the Union under the treaty."

The next day it said editorially:

"Every theorist who sets out to emasculate American sovereignty by constitutional limitations, gets himself into trouble. This nation can conquer, like any other. It can capture, occupy, and subject. * * * It can exercise sovereign authority over territory not annexed to the Union, like Cuba. * * * Anti-imperialism seeks to rob the American citizen of the one power in which he has the greatest pride. It seeks to strip him of the one operation which is to him dearer than any other—that government by the people, for the good of mankind, may one day bring the federation of the world."

These quotations are a part of the evidence to which reference was made at the beginning of this article. From them we learn that "the sovereign nation has authority to rule as it will, subject to the law of freedom instinct in its own being;" that American sovereignty to-day, instead of depending upon the Constitution for all its vigor, is of such a character that adherence to constitutional limitations would "emasculate" it; that this nation is now like any other, it "can conquer," "capture, occupy and subject;" that in this power the American citizen "has the greatest pride," and the operation of which "is to him dearer than any other."

## No Sovereignty for Subjugation and Oppression.

It requires no argument to show that these propositions are in direct conflict with American principles of government and in exact accord with every despotic system that has robbed men of their inalienable rights. There is no such thing as sovereignty to subjugate and oppress, to "conquer," "capture," and "subject." There are governments in the world to-day, it is true, that have never admitted this; but such sovereignty is opposed to the whole genius, spirit and letter of American institutions. At its foundation the American Government expressly repudiated such sovereignty. Compare the *Tribune*'s doctrine of unlimited sovereignty to conquer, capture, occupy and subject with the American doctrine, which was well expressed by John Quincy Adams in 1837:

"The people [of the colonies] who assumed their equal and separate station among the powers of the earth, by the laws of nature's God, by that very act acknowledged themselves bound to the observance of those laws, and could neither exercise nor confer any power inconsistent with them."

"All the legislators of the human race until that day had laid the foundations of all government among men in power, and hence it was that in the maxims of theory, as well as in the practice of nations, sovereignty was held to be unlimited and illimitable. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed another law, * * * a law of right, binding upon nations as well as upon individuals, upon sovereigns as well as upon subjects. * * * In assuming the attributes of sovereign power, the colonists appealed to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of their intentions, and neither claimed nor conferred authority to do anything but for right."

## Unlimited Sovereignty the Law of the Mob.

A self-governing nation does not do as it pleases. A people who govern themselves will abide by the forms and rules and methods of procedure, which experience and wisdom have demonstrated to be most sure and effectual in securing equal and exact justice. The *Tribune* may not be aware of the fact, but its doctrine is as revolutionary and anarchical as any that was ever howled through the streets. In 1793 its doctrine of national sovereignty was extremely popular in the French capital. When the people formed into mobs to take or destroy public or private property, to break up the sittings of their own legislative body, or to massacre the suspected, they eased their consciences with the argument that they were the people—the sovereign people. What mattered it if they were violating the Constitution they themselves had recently adopted? What mattered it if they were violating the laws enacted at their instance by their own representatives? It mattered not at all; they were the people—the "sovereign nation." Nothing could bind them; they could not bind themselves, for to admit that would be to "rob" themselves of "the one power" in which they had "the greatest pride," and to "strip" themselves of "the one operation," which was to them "dearer than any other"—the right of doing as they pleased, sometimes termed the "sacred right of insurrection."

Of course all this proved but one thing, and that was that they were utterly without the faculty of self-government. And so to-day, if there are people who are unfit for self-government they are those who, having known and enjoyed all the blessings of freedom, persist in violating and overturning the instrument which has proved to be the best safeguard for the rights of all the people of any protection yet set up by human legislators. People who do this judge themselves unworthy of freedom, and at the head of such people to-day is the New York Tribune.

Of course there is this distinction between the Tribune and the leaders of the Paris mobs. The Tribune does not want such sovereignty for the mob. It simply demands that such sovereignty be in the hands of a few select men who are perfectly satisfied that in themselves resides "the preponderance of wisdom and ability to govern," and who are perfectly sure that the inalienable rights of men will be amply protected by the government they control because of "the law of freedom instinct it its own being." The principle is the same in both cases, and is as dangerous in one of its manifestations as in the other.
