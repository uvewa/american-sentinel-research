The most dangerous anarchists are not those who commit overt acts of violence, but those who in the name of law and order override natural and constitutional rights.

The "red" anarchist, the anarchist who uses bomb, pistol, or stiletto, is less dangerous because his methods startle people and make them realize more fully than before the really beneficent character of wholesome laws honestly administered.

The anarchist who, while professing great loyalty to law, overrides the principles of justice, is the more dangerous because he is more respectable, his methods less startling, and his work more lasting and vastly more far-reaching.

## Anarchy in Mansfield, Ohio.

As the readers of THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY know, anarchy reigns in the town of Mansfield, Ohio. The facts are these. There is in that place a church of the disciples of Doctor Dowie, of this city. One of the tenets of this sect is "divine healing." Not long since one of the number in Mansfield refused the aid of a physician, with disastrous results both to herself and to the child that was born to her.

An outcry was raised against the sect, and certain elders or ministers who had gone to Mansfield from this city were mobbed, and roughly and shamefully handled, and were driven from the town and warned not to return.

A week later they did return, but were prevented by the sheriff and chief of police from leaving the cars, and were carried to the next town, to which point they were followed by an officer, who prevented their hiring a private conveyance by which to return to Mansfield.

A week later still, the same ministers secretly entered Mansfield by private conveyance, and going to their regular place of worship commenced religious services. A crowd began to gather, and very soon the mayor, sheriff, and chief of police appeared. But instead of coming to disperse the mob, they interrupted the meeting and compelled the Dowie elders to leave the town. Commenting on this occurrence, the Chronicle of this city, a paper far from friendly to Doctor Dowie, says:

"Lawlessness continues to rule the town of Mansfield, Ohio, where two of Dowie's missionaries were compelled to seek refuge in the county jail from a pursuing mob last Sunday. If the governor of Ohio had any backbone he would maintain the rights of those men if it took the entire national guard of Ohio to do it. The truth or falsity of the Dowie creed could be settled later."

It is said these Mansfield officers took this course to save the followers of Dr. Dowie from the wrath of the mob. But if such a course was necessary, what becomes of the constitutional guarantees of the rights of conscience and of free speech in the Ohio Bill of Rights? And what becomes of constitutional government in Ohio?

The governor of the State was appealed to for protection, but he replied that he could not act unless asked to do so by the sheriff of the county. But who does not know that had the governor notified the sheriff that he would be held responsible for any harm that might come to those men, and had the people been told by the officers that the right of free speech and of free religious worship must be respected, order could and would have been maintained? But the officers themselves, instead of enforcing the law, joined the mob in violating the law. So that now the highest law in Mansfield is not the constitution of the State, but the sweet will of the commune. Thumbs up, a man may preach what he believes in that city; thumbs down, he will be stripped of his clothing, painted blue and expelled from the place.

## Anarchy in New York City.

It is only a short time since that anarchy of the Mansfield sort manifested itself in New York City. A negro burglar shot a policeman, just as many a white burglar has shot officers. Commenting editorially upon what followed, the Daily Chronicle, the same paper already quoted, says:

"Investigation fully proves that the recent collision between whites and blacks in New York City was a police orgy.

"The negro who killed the white policeman could not have escaped justice if testimony showed that he deserved punishment. If the scales veered either way in such a case the accused was not likely to be the beneficiary.

"There was, therefore, not even the pretext of miscarriage of justice to condone the merciless fury with which the real or apparent crime of the negro was revenged upon hundreds of innocent colored women and children.

"The helpless, the industrious, the sober, were maltreated. All law was violated by the brutal club swingers and pistol flourishers on the blacks.

"Race conflict is at least intelligible below Mason and Dixon's line. North of it it is also intelligible. In the South its causes are historic. In the North its cause is the license a brutal policeman feels to use his club or revolver independently of constitutional restraints. It is not merely race hatred that inspires him, it is a wantonness in the use of power."

## A Menace to Popular Government.

So far as being a menace to popular government is concerned, the officers who upon an occasion of this kind makes common cause with the mob, is many fold more dangerous than the "red" anarchist who would, if he could, overthrow all government. That can never be done, but the despotism of unbridled passion may very easily take the place of the orderly and measurably just reign of statutory and constitutional law.

## What These Outbursts Show.

Such outbursts as these show that as a nation we are losing the faculty of self-government. Lawlessness on the part of a few is crime. When a community becomes lawless it is anarchy, and anarchy invites despotism. Indeed anarchy is the worst sort of despotism; it is so bad a despotism that the people will presently welcome a despotism of a few or of one as better than the despotism of the mob.

If government of the people by the people is to continue in this land the people must govern themselves. Failing to do this the time must come when an American Napoleon will arise, will sweep the streets of some of our cities with cannon and seize the reigns of government. The politicians are not saying as much as they did four years ago about the danger that the scenes of the French Revolution will be re-enacted erelong in this country, but the danger is greater now than it was then; and this not because of the probable election of any particular candidate, but simply because the people have lost in so large a measure the faculty of governing themselves.
