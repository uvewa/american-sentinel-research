"WHAT must be the attitude of Christians toward the Eastern question as it appears in China?" asks the Sabbath Recorder. Answering its own question, the Recorder says:

"Manifestly this, first, namely: It must be con-considered without any thought of revenge on our part, and, as far as possible, in the light in which it appears to the Chinaman. If we are to prepare the way for any future triumph of Christianity in that vast empire, which embraces almost one-quarter of the inhabitants of the earth, it must be because at this time the Christian nations shall give evidence that Christianity means more than the greed of commerce, and far more than the political aspirations of the crowned heads of Europe."

If the "future triumph of Christianity" in China is dependent upon the "Christian" nations taking a Christian course from Christian motives, surely there is small hope for any such "triumph." The so-called "Christian nations" are not Christian, and are not governed by Christian principles. China's only hope is in the decidedly non-Christian jealousy of the "Christian nations."
