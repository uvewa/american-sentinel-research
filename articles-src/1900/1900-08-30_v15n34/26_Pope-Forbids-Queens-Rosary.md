It is further announced from Rome that the Pope has forbidden Italians to recite a rosary and prayer composed by the widow of King Humbert shortly after his death, which she, in a letter to the Bishop of Cremona, had entreated might be used in churches and in families for the benefit of her dead husband. The ex-queen is a devout Catholic, and the Pope's action, which came without warning, has occasioned much surprise and indignation even among Catholics. But what is of more practical consequence, it has deeply incensed her son, the present king, and completely cut off all prospect of a reconciliation between church and state in Italy, for which many there were hoping. This, of course, is no calamity for Italy, for nothing could be worse for the state than such a reconciliation with the church as would suit the ideas of the Papacy, the papal system being fundamentally opposed to the divorce of church and state.
