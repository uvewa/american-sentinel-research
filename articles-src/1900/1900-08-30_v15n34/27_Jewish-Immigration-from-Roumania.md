**THE** following reason is assigned by a leading Hebrew paper for the unusually heavy Jewish immigration now pouring into this country:

"In Roumania the Greek Catholic government has discovered a new way in which to persecute Jews. It has ordered the organizing of all trades and handicrafts into guilds, something like our trades-unions. Each of these has the power to determine who may or may not be a member, and they can be relied upon to exclude 'aliens.' The law in Roumania makes all Jews 'aliens,' except a favored few who are rich enough to buy naturalization, even though their ancestors have lived in the country for centuries and borne all the burdens of citizenship, including military service. As the large majority of the Roumanian Jews are artisans, the results of this refined cruelty can easily be imagined."

Of course the only thing left for these people to do is to get out of Roumania. They very naturally turn their faces toward the United States.
