**HERE** is what the editor of a Baptist publication in New Orleans—the *American Baptist Flag*—says of the Seventh-day Adventists, on a basis, presumably, of some newspaper rumors that have reached him:

"On the island of Raratonga the Seventh-day Adventists have the ascendency, and it is probably the only place or country on earth where they do have it. Recently they have shown the spirit they are of by killing about fifty Christian people that wanted to use Sunday as the day of rest. In this country the Adventists make a great cry of persecution when they are not allowed to abuse the Christian Sabbath."

This editor is not slandering the Adventists, for everybody knows they have not the ascendency on Raratonga or anywhere else, and are not at all blood-thirsty; but he is slandering the Baptists, who have won and deserve the reputation of being fair-minded, truth-loving people.
