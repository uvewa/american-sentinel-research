Application has been made in New York for a charter for an association, the object of which is:

"The bringing into closer relationship the people of the United States and the British Empire by a general strengthening of the political, social, and commercial bonds which unite the two countries."

The granting of the charter is being opposed on the grounds—

"That the object of the said Transatlantic Society of America is contrary to the Constitution of the United States and the principles of the foundation of the Government of the United States.

"That if such charter was granted to the Transatlantic Society of America it would legalize acts which would otherwise be treasonable."

Inasmuch as treason against the United States consists only "in levying war against them or in giving aid and comfort to their enemies," it does not appear that the object of the association seeking this charter is treasonable, but it is clearly un-American.
