In the hearing on the Lord's Day Act, in Osgood Hall, Toronto, the question of the right of the province to regulate the operation of public works and corporations, such as railroads, canals, etc., was a very interesting issue, inasmuch as the entire Dominion is interested in these large corporate industries.

The advocates who were urging the right of the province to make Sunday laws were asked by the court if Ontario would have a right to prohibit traffic through the Welland canal on Sunday, for instance. The reply was that the province could do this. The question was then asked whether the province could stop traffic through the canal on other days of the week, or on every day of the week, if it saw fit. The question was a rather difficult one, but the final reply was that the province could not do that. Then the court asked: If the province has no right to close the canal on other days of the week, why has it a right to close it on Sunday? The true motive behind the Sunday law then had to be acknowledged. The reply was that it was because of the religious character of the day.

So, as much as its defenders may talk about the civil rest day, and the absence of any religious aspect to the matter, and claim that there is no desire to enforce any religious observance whatever, yet when the truth must be told it comes out that it is the religious phase of the institution that furnishes the real impetus to the whole movement.

As an example of faithfulness in the observance of the rest day, the counsel stated that anciently the Maccabees would not fight on Sunday. This is another instance of making Sabbath observance serve the cause of Sunday-keeping. As to what constituted works of necessity, the counsel held that it was a duty for a man to save his property, and therefore if a farmer had grain standing out that was likely to be injured by storm it was his privilege and duty to draw it in on Sunday. Such people as the Maccabees would be considered rather too strict.

## The Other Side of the Question.

As we have already stated, the counsel who spoke for the other side of the question occupied, but about one-sixth of the time those arguing for the Lord's Day Act used; but this shorter portion of time was well employed in presenting forcible arguments and valuable facts. It was brought out that it was not until A. D. 1595 that Sunday was put on the footing of the ancient Sabbath. The observance of a weekly rest day was shown to be a matter of morality and not simply of civil rights between individuals. The fact was brought out from Mr. Blackstone that the profanation of the Lord's day was classed as an offense against God and religion; also that the offense of Sunday violation was classed with heresy, witchcraft and apostasy. Of course it was punished for the same reasons and upon the same basis. Let this fact have due weight in the consideration of this subject. Then, if it is now proper for civil government to punish heresy, witchcraft and apostasy, it is also proper for it to punish Sabbath-breaking. But we have passed the days of forturing and killing heretics; we have passed the time of burning witches and imprisoning apostates, at least we all know these practices to be unjustifiable and wicked. Why keep up the practice (akin to the others) of fining and incarcerating men for laboring on Sunday? The glaring inconsistency of this is plainly seen in the light of these facts. The counsel also stated that if the province had a right to shut the Welland canal one day in the week it might do so every day in the week and thus interfere with the Dominion.

As to the distinction between passenger and traveler, the counsel showed that the distinction was merely imaginary; that there were numerous cases on record, some of which were cited, where men who were traveling on street cars or otherwise on Sunday on secular business, recovered damages for injuries received in accidents while on such journeys under the statute legalizing the conveying of travelers on that day. It was also stated that even carrying the mail or going to meeting could not be construed to be works of necessity.

Upon rising from his seat, after listening to the argument for nearly a week, his lordship paid a tribute to the ancient economy by remarking that the laws of Moses on this subject were much clearer than ours.
