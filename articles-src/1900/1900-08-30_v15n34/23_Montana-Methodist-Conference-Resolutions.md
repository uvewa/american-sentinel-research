The Montana State conference of the M. E. Church, held recently at Helena, passed a resolution commending "the onward sweep of our nation in its world-wide leadership," and rejoicing "that our domain widens and the beneficent institutions of our glorious country are carried to the uttermost parts of the earth." The conference also declared that "we look with alarm at the increasing indifference of our laymen in the matter of nominations for office," and urged "that instead of a tirade against inefficiency in office our officiary be present at the primaries and assist in nominating such men as will look to the enforcement of the law against the liquor traffic."
