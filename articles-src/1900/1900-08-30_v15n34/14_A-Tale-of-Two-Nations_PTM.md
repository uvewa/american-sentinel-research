### "The New Canaan."

In ancient days the Lord had said to Israel that she should dwell alone and should not be reckoned among the nations. This command was not an arbitrary one. It was given for the good of the chosen nation. God knew that it would be impossible for Israel to preserve the purity and simplicity of her governmental institutions, and at the same time become entangled in alliances with the nations of the earth, whose principles of government were altogether different from hers. God knew that the principles of the other nations only wrought oppression on the great mass of the people. He knew that if Israel became entangled with these nations that it would not be long, in the very nature of things, before her people would be suffering many hardships of a kindred sort. It was therefore in love, and that he might safeguard the ones whom he had brought out of bondage, that the Almighty ordained that they should dwell alone and should not be reckoned among the nations.

There is a touching simplicity about the early history of these United States. The feelings of the forefathers who crossed the broad Atlantic in the "Mayflower," their ideas concerning their own coming and mission in the earth, really form a very vital part of the history of this land. They held to the theory that England and the old countries beyond the sea were the land of Egypt; that the Atlantic was the Red Sea, and that America was the land of Canaan, and that the Indians were the idolatrous tribes, worthy only of devotion to the sword and to death. These ideas can be found in almost all of the important writings and sermons of the day. They form no small or unimportant part of the bibliography of the period. The term "The New Canaan" was freely applied to the country around the "Massachusetts Bay."

All of these theories and ideas may appear quite fanciful and foolish. Nevertheless there was a considerable strata of truth underlying them. In all of the contemporaneous records as well as in the later histories the coming of the Fathers to this country is spoken of as the "Puritan Exodus." And when we study into the very depths of those times it is easy to see that there were many really wonderful features connected with this wonderful movement.

A long dark night in the history of earth was brought to an end by the Puritan Exodus and the birth of the United States. "The Dark Ages" is not a mere fanciful term, nor is it a misnomer. It is the expression of the truth concerning the time to which the name is applied. People had sat in dark despair, and their inborn sense of manhood and womanhood had been outraged to such an extent by the kings who ruled over them that at times it seemed that it would become extinct forever. The Great Reformation of the sixteenth century had brought the golden gleams of the better morn; but the bright effulgence of the day was not ushered in until the time of the American Revolution.

That Providence was deeply concerned in the founding of the United States there can be no question. The frail colonies which have grown into the asylum for the oppressed of every land were not too insignificant for the watchcare of the Most High. Whatever may be said about the Puritans no one can deny that a deep religious fervor underlaid all that they did. It is beyond question that they came to this land for religious purposes; it is beyond question that they fled from religious oppression. They came to establish a nation in which principles of truth and purity should reign. They came to found a new Canaan where God might be worshipped according to the dictates of conscience, and where the oppressed of every land might find a resting place for their weary souls and bodies.

Some of their ideals may not have been realized. Some of their ideals may be absolutely impossible in this earth of perfect realization. But this much must ever be conceded, that America has become through them and those who have followed a place of refuge for the weary and the oppressed of every land on earth; and to God we pray to-day that this nation may not now put out its light, for should this dire deed be done, "then unto what nation can struggling humanity look for hope and inspiration?"

Physically and geographically God separated the United States from all the great powers of earth. He did so with a purpose. He set her off alone between the twin oceans that in spirit and in life, as well as in body, she might be separated from the age-worn iniquities of Europe, and that she might be untramelled in working out the good which he placed her in the earth to do.

P. T. MAGAN.
