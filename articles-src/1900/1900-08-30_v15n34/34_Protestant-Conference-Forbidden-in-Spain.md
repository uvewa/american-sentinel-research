A PROPOSED conference of delegates of Protestant churches in Saragossa, Spain, has been forbidden by the Spanish authorities on the ground that such a meeting would be a demonstration against the state religion. English and American residents in Spain are reported as being surprised and alarmed. But the course of the Spanish government is perfectly logical. A Protestant conference would certainly be against the Catholic religion, and the Spanish state being joined with this religion is bound to protect it as far as it can by the exercise of its power. The state can not be religious without laying its hand upon all religions opposed to the religion it has espoused.
