**POPE LEO**, says a dispatch from Rome, has written a letter to the Cardinal-vicar lamenting the fact that the free propagation of Protestantism is allowed by law in Rome, and urging Catholics to unite in endeavoring to lessen the damage from such "sectarian propaganda." Such a letter is characteristic of the Papacy, which has always appreciated the privilege of opposing ideas by physical force.

Physical force has no proper place in government, save to preserve the lives, liberties and property of the people.
