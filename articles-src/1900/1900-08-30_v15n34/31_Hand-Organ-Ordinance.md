An ordinance is before the Chicago city council prohibiting "the playing of a grind-organ before 9 A. M. or after 7 P. M., or on Sunday at any hour." Just what the object of the ordinance is does not appear. It is said to have the approval of the Chicago Federation of Musicians, and doubtless also of the dive-keepers. Hand-organ music is poor enough to be sure, but it is all that a good many people in Chicago have.
