AN idea which was strenuously opposed by General Logan and other army leaders who had much to do with instituting Decoration Day, is now coming again to the front in the G. A. R. organization; namely, that of transferring Decoration Day to Sunday—uniting patriotism with religion. This is significant, especially for those who oppose Sunday.
