The Rev. Joseph Cook, of Boston, in one of his famous Monday noon lectures, said: "We hear of protection for tin, wool, coal, salt, etc., but where is protection for Christianity?" As a Christian, Mr. Cook ought to have known that all the protection that Christianity needs is in the almighty power of its divine Author. The Scripture speaks of a people in the last days who will have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof. The whole National Reform scheme is a fulfillment of this prophecy. It is not always so plainly admitted as in the quotation from Mr. Cook, but admitted or not, it is ever the thought of the religio-politician that Christianity must have protection from the state, and that it can not compete with the forces of evil and successfully do its work without such protection. What could be a greater denial of the power of God in Christianity itself than such an appeal to a human power to enable Christianity to do its work?

## Christianity's Triumph Without "Protection."

The veriest beginner in Christian history well knows that for centuries Christianity did do its work and triumph gloriously over all the forces of evil, not only without any protection from any earthly state, but with the powers of earth arrayed in direct hostility to it.

It was in those victorious days that the prophet represents Christianity as crowned and seated upon a white horse, going forth conquering and to conquer. Without the aid of any human power, in a few years Christianity overspread the world, and had converts everywhere, even in king's palaces. It made the monarch of the Roman world tremble on his throne, for he clearly saw that Christianity meant the sacredness of individual human rights and the glorification of manhood, and therefore the death of all despotism.

These facts being well known to all, it must be that those who believe that now Christianity must have state protection in order to triumph, either deny that Christianity has now the power that it once had, or they assert that the forces that are arrayed against it now are greater than they then were. It were well, then, for all to become familiar with the forces that Christianity found arrayed against itself in those days when it stood alone so victoriously. These forces were chiefly represented by Judaism, Paganism and Orientalism. The conflict of Christianity with these will furnish the theme for several papers for THE SENTINEL.

First, we shall consider the conflict of Christianity with Judaism.

## Jesus Did Not Preach a New Religion.

Jesus was a Jew. Centuries before the incarnation Christ, the Son of God, the everlasting Word of God, had made the promises to Abraham which consecrated that people unto himself. He it was who had led them out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. He spake the law to them from Sinai; he led them through the wilderness, and in all their wanderings they "drank of that spiritual Rock which went with them, and that rock was Christ." Disciples were first called Christians at Antioch, but there were disciples long before that. In the olden days they called a true disciple as Jesus called Nathaniel, an "Israelite indeed."

All the truths of the New Testament are found in the Old Testament, and were once understood by the faithful. All the spiritual experiences of Christianity had, through the ever-present spiritual Christ, been experienced long before by the devout Israelite. Jesus never professed to preach a new religion. On the contrary, when he spake on the most profound themes of Christianity, as to Nicodemus on the new birth, he said, "Art thou a ruler in Israel, and understandest not these things?"

## The Divine Revelation Monopolized by the Rulers.

The new birth and all the other doctrines of Christianity are plainly revealed in the Old Testament, but they had all been lost sight of by the Jews, and because of this the Jewish religion had become ceremonial and formal and utterly lacking in the manifestation of the spiritual life and power. Traditions had been multiplied till they filled many volumes, and it required years of study to become familiar with them. The Scriptures, containing the words of salvation, it was thought could be understood only by being interpreted by tradition, and therefore by the priests and Rabbis and lawyers who understood tradition. Thus practically the Scripture was taken from the common people and put into the hands of the spiritual rulers, who only could understand and interpret it. These leaders of the people were therefore given almost unbounded authority, and were looked up to with superstitious reverence. "Still the basis of their supremacy rested on the popular reverence for the Sacred Writings. 'It is written' was the sanction of all Rabbinical decrees, however those decrees might misinterpret the real meaning of the law." (Milman's Hist. Chris., vol 1, page 189.) Thus, to the eyes of the people and in their own eyes also the Jewish rulers had a monopoly of the divine revelation.

Under these circumstances Jesus entered upon his sacred mission. Not having studied in the Rabbinical schools, and not having asked of the spiritual leaders the permission to preach, he went forth reading the Scriptures and expounding their truths. Under his touch the old words blossomed anew into wealths of meaning and beauty, of which the people had never dreamed. He set the sublimest truths forth in axiomatic forms. He did not quote authority as the Rabbis did, saying, "It is written." But more frequently he prefaced his remarks with the simple, "I say unto you." Is it strange that the people wondered and that they went away saying, "Never man spake like this man," "He speaks as one having authority, and not as the Scribes."

## Ecclesiastical Jealousy and Ambition.

Need we wonder that the whole power of the Jewish Sanhedrim was arrayed against Jesus and the religion he taught? It was their power to control the prejudices and superstitious passions of the people that caused the multitudes, notwithstanding the work of love Christ had wrought, to cry "Crucify him, crucify him." It was this same priestly power that, during the early history of the church, made the Jews in every city spy out the Christians and deliver them to the pagan persecutors, who excuted the laws, and so had the power of life and death. Of these Jewish leaders Milman well says: "They saw clearly that it was a struggle for the life and death of their authority. Jesus acknowledged as the Christ, the whole fabric of their power and influence fell at once. The traditions, the skill of the scribe, the subtilty of the lawyer, the profound study of the Rabbi, or the teacher in the synagogue and in the schools became obsolete, and the pride of superior wisdom, the long-enjoyed deference, the blind obedience with which people had listened to their decrees, were gone forever. The whole hierarchy were to cede at once their rank and estimation to an humble and uninstructed peasant from Galilee, a region scorned by the better educated for its rudeness and ignorance, and from Nazareth, the most despised town in the despised province." (Milman's Hist. Chris., vol. 1, page 191.) Any one familiar with the many methods by which ecclesiastical jealously and ecclesiastical ambition have ever opposed truth will know from this simple statement of the case, coupled with the inspired record, what Christianity had to meet in its conflict with Judaism.

## The Longing for a Political Messiah.

But it was not simply the ecclesiastical ambitions of the Jewish leaders that Christianity directly opposed itself to; it was the patriotism of the Jewish people as well. The whole thought of the age with the Jewish people was Messianic. Every heart, in so far as there was in it the manifestation of any spiritual life at all, was surcharged with Messianic longing. So wholly was this true that every Jewish wife felt herself accursed unless she could become the mother of a man child, for it was the tender wish of every mother that her boy might be the longed-for Messiah, the hope of his people, the desire of all nations. But all this longing was for a political Messiah, one who should deliver his people from the Roman yoke and establish the kingdom of Israel again in more than its Davidic glory, making it the head over all the nations of earth. As the religion of the Jews, by losing out of it the spiritual truths of its divine revelation, had become formal, instead of becoming dead and cold it had become political and intensely patriotic. Now, Jesus comes proclaiming himself the longed-for and promised Messiah. Yet he sets himself squarely against all these political ambitions and patriotic longings of his people, and so far from seeking to be crowned king he refuses the crown when they sought to force it upon him, saying, "My kingdom is not of this world." So far from promising them freedom from the Roman yoke he prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and even the overthrow of the beloved Jewish temple, so that there shall not be left one stone standing upon another of all the magnificent building. • Worse than all this, Jesus himself, at the instigation of the Jewish leaders, was crucified by the Romans, crucified most ignominiously between thieves, and yet his disciples persist in going forth and proclaiming to the Jews that this defeated (?) and crucified peasant of Galilee is the Messiah their prophets foretold. Instead of promising them the earthly power and glory they had expected and longed for, the disciples of Jesus boldly tell them that they must take up their cross daily and follow Jesus, if need be, to as ignominious a crucifixion. In their pride the Pharisees had been wont to consider prosperity and ease and comfort in this world as *prima facie* evidence that a man possessed the favor of God, and so was safe both for the here and the hereafter. But now this man who was despised and rejected of men, and apparently accursed of God, is persistently proclaimed King of the Jews.

## Christianity Grandly Triumphant.

It is not possible for any truth to be more entirely and absolutely arrayed against the aims, ambitions, hopes, longings and prejudices of any people and of any age than was Christianity against those of the Jews; and the very fact that all this was taught the people from the same writings that they had been familiar with for ages made the effrontery of it all the more unbearable; and yet, without any "protection" from any human power, without the aid of any state, by its own inherent strength, by the power of truth and by the Spirit of truth, and of Him who is the truth, Christianity triumphed grandly over Judaism, notwithstanding its utmost efforts to prevent it, and became a worldwide religion while Judaism is sunk into obscurity.

True Christianity has the same power to-day that it had then. Jesus expressly said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore and preach the gospel to every creature, and lo I am with you always, even *unto the end of the world.*" True Christianity to-day does not need or ask the aid of human laws. Judge Welch, chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, well said: "When Christianity asks the aid of earthly government beyond mere impartial protection it denies itself. Its laws are divine and not human. Its essential interests lie beyond the reach and range of earthly governments. United with government religion never rises above the merest superstition; united with religion government never rises above the merest despotism, and all history shows us that the more widely and completely they are separated the better it is for both."
