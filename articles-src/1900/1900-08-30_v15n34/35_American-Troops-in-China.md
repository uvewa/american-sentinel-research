THERE is much said about the desirability of a speedy withdrawal of the American troops from China, but nothing to that end is being done. On the contrary, a Washington dispatch to the N. Y. Tribune says that the "expectations that all the United States troops will be withdrawn from north China before winter sets in are giving way to a belief that a considerable force will have to remain there until next spring in order to properly safeguard American interests."

"Until next spring"—and what will be the situation in China next spring? Will it be more favorable to withdrawal than the present situation, or less favorable? Nobody can tell. Meanwhile it is evident that Germany and Russia and possibly Japan are bent on a military occupation of China, with war if the Chinese resist, and thus the outlook promises more serious complications there as time goes on.

It is pointed out by those who believe the Government can and should withdraw from China at once, that when the allies entered the Chinese capital in 1860, "Lord Elgin promptly treated with the Prince Kung"—the emperor having fled with his household to the interior—"and effected a complete settlement of the war within two weeks after the Chinese emperor's summer palace had been burned by the allied troops." Times have wonderfully changed since 1860.
