A MAN named Hege sends us a post-card from Asheville, N. C., stating it has been decided there that preaching the gospel on the public square in Asheville is a nuisance; that a Methodist clergyman had been arrested for the offense and put under bond.

It is conceivable that there might be circumstances under which preaching in a public place would be a nuisance, and as we are not informed of the circumstances bearing on this matter, we are not prepared to pass judgment. They must be very exceptional, however, to justify the course reported as taken by the Asheville authorities.
