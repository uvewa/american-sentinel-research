**"DURING** the decade which is closing the present century," remarks the *Saturday Evening Post*, "there have been over a dozen wars, and they have cost more than 200,000 lives and many hundreds of millions of dollars. The most important of these are the war between China and Japan in 1894 and 1895, the war between Turkey and Greece in 1897, the war between Spain and Cuba, the war between Spain and the United States, the war between the United States and the Filipinos, and the war between Great Britain and the South African Republic. At the present time several wars are going on and more are threatened. Great Britain has not yet conquered the Boers; the United States has not yet conquered the Filipinos; Great Britain is fighting in Ashanti, and the situation in China offers all kinds of complications. The nations are spending over a billion dollars a year on their armies and wars."

It was less than two years ago—January 11, 1899—that Czar Nicholas issued his famous rescript for the limitation of the evils of militarism, and on the 18th of May followed the international conference at the Hague. The uppermost thought was disarmament, or if not that an "understanding," to quote the words of the Czar's circular, "not to increase for a fixed period the present effective of the armed military and naval forces and at the same time not to increase the budgets pertaining thereto." The conference was in session over two months, and the chief result of the work was the agreement in favor of arbitration with the establishment of a permanent court of arbitration. Disarmament entirely failed.

But since that time more money has been spent in manufacturing instruments of war than at any other corresponding period in the world's history. Even in the United States, through whose efforts the arbitration victory was won, the war expenditures have been vastly increased, until now for all purposes they amount to almost a million dollars a day.
