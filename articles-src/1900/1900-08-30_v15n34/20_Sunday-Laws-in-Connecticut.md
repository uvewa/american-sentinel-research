The question of enforcing Sunday observance has been brought to the front in Ansonia, Conn., and neighboring towns, by the circulation of a petition calling for the closing of business places on that day. The prosecuting attorney, when interviewed by a reporter for the Evening Sentinel, expressed himself on the subject as follows:

"If it was a question of a violation of the law upon which all parties are practically a unit, such as cases of arson, rape, murder, etc., of course I should have no hesitation in regard to my duty. The Sunday law, however, is one on which there is no unity of opinion, and it is largely a matter of individual opinion or conscience.

"One man holds that he should keep one day, another that he should keep another; still another believes in keeping the day in one way, while another does not believe in anything of the sort. To put the matter briefly, it seems to me as if we as a whole people, do not want the Puritanical Sunday any more than we do the German beer garden Sunday."

The prosecuting attorney clearly recognizes the fundamental difference between Sunday laws and laws for the suppression of those things agreed on by all people as criminal; yet he feels himself bound to enforce the law if called upon to do so, as he finally said to the reporter:

"Certainly I shall not of my own volition attempt to settle the question, but if two persons will come before me and make complaint regarding an infraction of the law I shall, of course, as I have previously stated, prosecute the offenders."

Would it not be very much better if the whole force of the civil authority were directed to the suppression of crime—the protection of society against theft, assault, murder, etc., which at best are all too prevalent—instead of being in large part wasted upon the attempted enforcement of things concerning which people naturally disagree, and which many feel even conscientiously bound to oppose? Certainly it must be true that the former policy would render society more secure than does the latter.
