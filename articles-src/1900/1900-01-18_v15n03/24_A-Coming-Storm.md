The rumblings of a coming storm can be clearly heard in Colorado. Sunday baseball games are becoming very common here, and the main reason assigned by many for this desecration of Sunday is that the Seventh-day Adventists are teaching the people that Sunday is not the Sabbath and is not a sacred day; and therefore this great growing disregard for Sunday sacredness. They are called in this part of the State especially, the greatest and the worst enemies the churches have to contend with.
