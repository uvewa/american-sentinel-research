### WORKS OF NECESSITY vs. COMMON LABOR.

It was my privilege to attend church in a little hamlet on the outskirts of Paterson, N. J. The service consisted of certain passages of scripture being read by different ones among the congregation, which were dwelt upon by the pastor.

All went fairly well until one of the members read the fourth commandment, Ex. 20:8-11. After speaking at length upon the necessity of devoting the day (Sunday) entirely to God, the minister explained the difference between works of necessity and ordinary labor by using as an illustration a circumstance with which he had something to do as an adviser.

Said he, "An elder of a church where, I was at one time preaching, came to me and said he would, have to resign from the eldership of the church because he was afraid that holding such a position he would be a stumbling block to many. Pressing him for his reasons I found that he had a large melon patch, and was under contract to deliver several loads every morning in New York. This necessitated hitching up his teams, turning out with his hired man, loading up and starting for the city about six o'clock Sunday evening. In doing this his conscience condemned him, hence his resolution to resign. Said I to him: Brother—there is not the least shadow of a reason for your resigning; as elder of this church. This work is a work of necessity, [according to his contract with the New York dealer] and you can keep the Sabbath [Sunday] and hold communion with God driving to New York Sunday evening with your load of melons just as well as though you were in attendance at church."

That settled the farmer; he didn't resign; and, said the minister, "that man is still elder of the church, and is a good faithful worker."

This is Sabbath-keeping as taught through Sunday-keeping; and this is the kind of church to join if you have work which by contract calls for performance on Sunday. See 2 Tim. 4:1-4. A. R. BELL.
