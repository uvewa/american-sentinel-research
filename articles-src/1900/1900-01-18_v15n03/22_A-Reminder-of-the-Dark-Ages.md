We are reminded when we read of such occurrences as the following, that the Dark Ages—as regards superstition—still linger on the earth wherever the people are enlightened only by the light of Rome.

The people of the parish of St. Ignatius Loyola, in the province of Quebec, had placed over them, by authority of the bishop, a church warden to whom they strongly objected. A bitter controversy arose, which culminated in riot and bloodshed at a meeting held in the church to talk over the situation. Hearing of this, Archbishop Bruchesi decided to place the church under the ban, the effectiveness of which proceeding has been amply attested in papal history. The scene which ensued when this direful sentence was carried into effect is thus described:

"The ban was inflicted by Canon Archambault, the chancellor of the archiepiscopal palace of Montreal, in the presence of a weeping, hysterical multitude of parishioners in the Church of St. Ignace de Loyola. It was read with much pomp and ceremony and the excitement and lamentation following can scarcely be pictured.

"In a voice trembling with anger, Canon Archambault said to the parishioners:

"You have offended the three tribunals which every Christian should obey—the tribunals of civil authority, of God and of the church. The scandal is terrible. The newspapers are full of it, and soon it will be known in all corners of the earth how Catholics here betray the faith."

"The excitement reached a fever pitch as Canon Archambault scourged the parishioners for their disregard of church authority. Fainting women were removed from the auditorium of the church when he declared that henceforth the temple was deserted and that the sinning Catholics had turned God from their church. In the future, he said, they would do without the benefit of the clergy; no bells would toll, no high mass would be said.

"When it was declared that no offices of the church would be held, not even those for the dead, the canon was interrupted by a wail of lamentation that arose and echoed from wall to wall.

"In the presence of the congregation the church was then stripped of all the symbols and furnishings of the Roman Catholic faith. While men and women ran about weeping and crying for mercy Canon Archambault was taking the lead in the final act of placing the ban. When he tore the first decorations from the high altar men and women were prostrate on their knees protesting and weeping.

"Then the host was removed amid the wailing of the people and the chanting of the 'miserere.' The canon and his assistants made short work of it. The altars were stripped of every symbol of significance, and the church, save for the walls and seats, was soon bare of anything to suggest its purpose.

"The tolling of the bells followed as the parishioners were ordered to vacate the building. They went forth as a sorrowful multitude, and a panic followed at the entrance. Women fell in the aisles, and were carried out through the side entrances. Men gathered without and wept as the doors were locked and the keys taken by Canon Archambault for an indefinite period."

To this state of hysterical helplessness are people reduced who in their ignorance depend on the authority of man—the church—rather than on the Word and authority of God.
