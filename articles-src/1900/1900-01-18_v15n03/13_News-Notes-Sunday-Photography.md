The editor of a Hackensack, N. J., paper was recently suspended from the Christian Reformed Church in that place for having taken photographs on Sunday. He appealed the case to the higher authorities of the church, and at a session of the "Classes" he was reinstated. It would seem from this that Sunday photography is not regarded by the Christian Reformed Church as an infraction of the "Christian Sabbath."
