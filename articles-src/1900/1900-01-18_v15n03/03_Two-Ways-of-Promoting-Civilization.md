By Rev. C. H. Parkhurst.

To promote civilization by the use of swords and artillery is false to the word, example and life of Jesus Christ and of all his apostles, and alien to the entire genius of Christianity. If you say to that that there are places in the world where Christianity has sprung up as an aftergrowth of the military conquest—undoubtedly; but that does not alter anything so far as it relates to the point I have just made. It does not relieve filthy soil that flowers grow out of it. God is all the time doing that thing. It was indispensable to our Lord's mission that Judas should betray him, but that didn't help Judas any.

Or, you may claim that the powder-and-shot method of extending civilization is more feasible, works with greater promptness. A Krupp gun does quick execution; a missionary and a Bible are slow. I do not dispute that. . . . Thousands of ministers have practically been confessing to the world these last twelve months that Christ's way of saving the world will not work, and that when Paul said that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal he stated a principle that he would have recanted if he had lived longer and known more. . . . I should be sorry to have to conclude that the gospel is inadequate without gunpowder to support it, and when I do conclude that I shall stop preaching out of respect—at least, I shall stop calling myself a preacher of the gospel.
