Great numbers of people from Finland are about to emigrate to the United States, according to press reports. The Sun, of this city, says:—

"A most unusual emigration from Finland to the United States and Canada is expected this year. One steamship line has arranged to bring over 55,000 Finnish peasants. It is said that thousands of families will come here to engage in farming in the hope of bettering their condition and especially with a view to escaping the new political conditions imposed upon Finland, eleven months ago, by the Russian government."

The Finns are Lutherans, and in their emigration to this country have in view the escaping from the religious disabilities which they would inevitably suffer under the Russian Greek-Catholic rule. People who leave their native land for conscience' sake are the most desirable class of immigrants from the Old World.
