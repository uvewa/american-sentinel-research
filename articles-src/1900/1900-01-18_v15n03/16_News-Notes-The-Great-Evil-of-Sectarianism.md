The evils of sectarianism are great indeed but the great evil is not that it prevents honest souls anywhere from discovering the will of the Lord; for that will is plain to all from the Word of God. But people are not willing to believe God, and to let that mind—that humility—be in them that was in Christ, who "made himself of no reputation." They are not willing to follow Christ in preference to every human leader; to accept his Word as of greater authority than any human voice. And because of this the professors of Christianity have become divided into sects. The great evil of sectarianism is that which causes sectarianism, rather than anything which results from its existence.
