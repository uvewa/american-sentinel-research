COMMENTING on the idea expressed recently by Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court, that "the ancient enemies, Catholicism and Protestantism," are "drawing closer together," the New York Sun, which is good authority on the Catholic side of the question, speaks thus:

"The Church of Rome, surely, has neither abandoned nor in any degree lessened its claims; it still offers to Protestantism no possibility of unity with it, except on the condition of yielding to its authority and rendering allegiance to the papal supremacy. Within a very few years the pope, by refusing to accept the validity of the Anglican orders, has practically pronounced the whole Church of England heretical, schismatic, and destitute of an apostolic foundation for its ministry. The only terms Rome offers in the nineteenth century are the same as those it offered in the eighteenth century, and they will be the same in the twentieth century—unconditional surrender.

"The present pope, Leo XIII., is not one step closer to Protestantism in 1900 than was Pius VII. in 1800.

"Justice Brewer speaks of 'minor differences of creed and doctrine,' 'of little significance;' but there are no such differences between Rome and the Protestant world. The difference is deep and radical, full of great significance, and, as we have said, cannot be bridged over by any gush of sentiment. The two can never come together except by Protestants yielding and becoming Catholics or Catholics turning into Protestants. You might as well try to mix oil and water as to attempt to bring these two radically conflicting and diametrically and essentially opposing religious systems into harmony, without the complete surrender of the one to the other; and the twentieth century will not lessen that impossibility by one whit."

The "drawing together" of these two "ancient enemies," is due wholly to the backsliding of decadent Protestantism.
