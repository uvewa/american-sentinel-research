The Independent (N. Y.) makes note of the hope expressed by president Schurman, of the Philippine Commission, that "only one type of missionaries" will be sent to those islands by the churches in the United States. "We are the Lord's foolish ones," The Independent says, and "We have no doubt that the chief denominations, and a score of small ones, will all establish missions there." "Each sect, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Episcopalian, Congregational, Disciples, Seventh-day Adventist, will have its own organization. 'Join us,' 'Join us,' We are the true church,' will be the cry."

We do not know how much this cry may be raised in this foreign mission field, but whether much or little, it will not be the cry of the true church. "Join us," is not a Christian exhortation. The desire and aim of the Christian missionary is to see souls united to the Lord. And to this end he devotes himself to the fulfilling of the divine commission, "Preach the Word." He proclaims the Word of the Lord, and exhorts his hearers to the duty of obedience to God's commands, and then leaves the results with God. The Holy Spirit impresses upon hearts the truths of the Word to which the evangelist has called attention, and brings the hearer to the point of making a decision for or against them. And if he decides to obey the commands of God and walk in all his ordinances, there is no trouble at all about the question of which church he shall join. He will join the church that he sees to be keeping the commandments and observing the ordinances of the Lord. He will not want to join any other; and no other will want him as a member, or allow him to continue as one if his intention is plain to put his belief into practise. All this has been demonstrated by experience over and over again. There is but "one Lord, one faith, one baptism," and but one way of coming to the Lord, which is by faith in his Word. And that Word is not "yea and nay;" it presents no conflicting doctrines, offers no chance for two persons to believe it and still be in conflict in their religious practise. The way to life is entirely too straight and narrow for its travelers to miss being in the same company.
