"The whole Christian world," writes Professor Niemand, of Germany, "is in a mad fit of avarice. Such a widely-spread, stupendous and uncontrollable craze of aggression as is now affecting all the great powers has not recurred in human history since the Mohammedan era of European, African, and Asiatic conquest. The American Union, which remained longest out of the ranks, has caught the prevalent malady."
