# Uncertainties — v15n03 (1900-01-18)

## Attribution Decisions

### "Two Ways of Promoting Civilization" (file 03)
- **Issue:** The article is headed "By Rev. C. H. Parkhurst" but does not end with a `—*Source Name*` reprint attribution or with author initials in the standard Sentinel style.
- **Decision:** Treated as `reprint` sourced from "By Rev. C. H. Parkhurst" (his name as byline). The Sentinel regularly reprinted sermons and speeches by prominent clergy. C. H. Parkhurst was a well-known New York City pastor and reformer. No `author` field used since it reads like a reprint rather than a contributed piece.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the "By Rev." prefix suggests a reprint, but the exact source publication is not stated.

### "A Lesson in Sabbath (Sunday) Keeping" and "The Jersey Blue Laws" — Author A. R. Bell
- **Issue:** "A. R. BELL." appears at the end of both articles. This initials/name combination is not in the known authors list for the American Sentinel.
- **Decision:** Treated as `explicit` attribution with author "A. R. Bell" and author_short "ARB." Added to files accordingly.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — the name is spelled out fully in the text, not just initials.
- **Recommendation:** Verify against original scan if available. "A. R. Bell" may be a correspondent or occasional contributor.

### "Catholic Education" — Author John McCarthy
- **Issue:** "JOHN McCARTHY." appears at the end of the article with a dateline "Buenos Ayres, Argentina." This is a letter/contributed piece, not a known Sentinel staff author.
- **Decision:** Treated as `explicit` attribution. The full name is clearly stated. Author_short assigned as "JMcC."
- **Confidence:** HIGH.

### "A Coming Storm" — Author G. W. Anglebarger
- **Issue:** "G. W. ANGLEBARGER." appears at the end with an apparent Colorado dateline context.
- **Decision:** Treated as `explicit` attribution. Author_short assigned as "GWA."
- **Confidence:** HIGH — full name spelled out.

## Editorial Notes Section (page 16)
The final page contains several short editorial notes. Each has been given its own file (files 25–30). The page number running header "AMERICAN SENTINEL. 48" confirms these are part of this issue.

## OCR Quality
The OCR source is from Mistral and reads cleanly. No significant scan artifacts or uncertain character readings were encountered. The use of `&gt;` for block quote markers in the OCR has been converted to proper markdown `>` syntax in the output files.
