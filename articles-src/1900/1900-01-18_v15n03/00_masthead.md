AMERICAN SENTINEL

VOLUME 15. NEW YORK, JANUARY 18, 1900. NUMBER 3.

Published in the interests of Religious Liberty—Christian and Constitutional.

"IF ANY MAN HEAR MY WORDS, AND BELIEVE NOT, I JUDGE HIM NOT."—Jesus Christ.

> Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it may know that it is sent by some friend. Therefore those who have not ordered the Sentinel need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.
> (Entered at the New York Postoffice.)

Set for the defense of liberty of conscience, and therefore uncompromisingly opposed to anything tending toward a union of Church and State, either in name or in fact.
