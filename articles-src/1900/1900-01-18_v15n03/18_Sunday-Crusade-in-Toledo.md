### PREACHERS' UNION WARNS THEATER MANAGERS, WHO THREATEN TO CLOSE ALL SUNDAY TRAFFIC.

Brooklyn "Eagle," Jan. 7.

A COMMITTEE of the Toledo Preachers' Union has sent a warning to theater managers in Toledo, O., that arrests of all actors and employees will follow Sunday performances to-day. The managers, with one exception, have decided to resist the State law on this subject, and threaten, if stopped, to retaliate by closing all business houses, including drug stores, and to stop the street cars. An array of counsel has been engaged. It is tacitly understood that this is to be the first step towards closing the gates of the Ohio Centennial on Sundays in 1902. There are no Sunday ordinances in Toledo, Mayor Jones having forced their repeal through rigid enforcement on Sunday, when milkmen and newsboys were arrested, and the crusade which begins today will be under State laws.
