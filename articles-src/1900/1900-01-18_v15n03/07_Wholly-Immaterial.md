On page 29 of the Statutes at Large of the United States, may be found the following provision covering the point of appropriations of public funds for the benefit of sectarian institutions in the District of Columbia:

"And it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Government of the United States to make no appropriation of money or property for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding by payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church or religious denomination, or any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control; and it is hereby enacted that from and after the 30th day of June, 1898, no money appropriated for charitable purposes in the District of Columbia shall be paid to any church or religious denomination, or to any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control."

Of this statute Judge Hagner, of the District of Columbia, said that it is "so plain as absolutely to close discussion of the question." And what candid person can read it and say anything to the contrary? And yet Justice Peckham, of the Supreme Court—who, we are informed, is a Roman Catholic—in his decision awarding money from the U. S. Treasury to a hospital wholly under Catholic control, declared that the "fact that the hospital is conducted under the management of said church" is "wholly immaterial"!

It is safe to say that this Supreme Court official or any of his associates could not so word the statute in question that it would apply more plainly to the case of this Catholic hospital than it does as it now stands in the statute books of the nation. What is plainly "wholly immaterial" in connection with the case, is the will of the people expressed through this statute, as considered by the Catholic Church through a Catholic member of the highest national court.
