For many years New Jersey has been noted for its "lightning," but lately it has been acquiring notoriety in another way, which bids fair to add much to its reputation; namely, by the "Blue Laws." A tide of reform(?) is sweeping over the State, and wondrous things are being accomplished; but an extract from the New York World of January 9, given herewith, places Jersey City at the head of the list in the work of teaching its citizens that Sunday must not be profaned.

"BLUE LAWS IN JERSEY.

"Boys Who 'Shined' Shoes Sunday Were Fined $1 Each.

"One of the old New Jersey Blue Laws, which prohibits the performance of manual labor on Sunday, was revived in Jersey City Sunday. Two boys were arrested for shining shoes in the street after the noon hour.

"Police Justice Nevin said he had no alternative but to impose a fine. Each little prisoner contributed $1 toward the municipal fund."

The dignity of the law has been maintained(?). These two little shoe-blacks have been taught in a kindly manner the sacredness(?) of Sunday, and the world at large has been made better(?). Truly this is a Christian nation!
