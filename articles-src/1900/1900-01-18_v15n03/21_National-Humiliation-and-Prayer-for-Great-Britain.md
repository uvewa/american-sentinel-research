The question of the advisability of appointing a day of national humiliation and prayer, in view of the disasters to British arms and terrible loss of life in South Africa, is being discussed in England, and the following observations on the subject are called forth from the London Guardian. This journal does not overlook the elements of hypocrisy, inconsistency and general impropriety which are bound up with such manifestoes from the head of the civil authority, and pertain in general to the British system of an established church:

"The great objection to the appointment, by authority, of a national day of 'humiliation and prayer' is contained in a reminder that such days, at the time of the Crimean and Indian wars, merely anticipated the Bank Holidays of later date, with their concomitants of railway excursions, crowded public houses, and the rest of it. To close the public houses altogether on the appointed day, as they do in America on the day of a Presidential election, would possibly require an Act of Parliament, and one does not like to think of the sort of talk that would be let loose in debate on such a subject.

"One thing is the boggling of certain minds over the word 'humiliation.' One writer, a clergyman, and not the first comer, says in effect—'We have done nothing to be ashamed of, and why should we humble ourselves?' Yet at morning and evening prayers we regularly and most justly acknowledge ourselves to be miserable offenders. Other people are nervous about prayers for victory from tenderness of conscience as to the supposed implication of such a prayer that our cause is a just one, and its presumed arrogance. But again, we constantly pray that the Queen may be strengthened to vanquish and overcome all her enemies, and assuredly the compilers of the Prayer-book had no thought of asserting that the Sovereign must always be in the right in a quarrel. The prayer takes the human form of a special petition, for which there are countless spiritual precedents; but behind the prayers there is always the mental reservation that God alone knows the justice of our petition or whether it is for our good that it should be granted."

It might be well in the event of such an appointment to consider whether the nation is prepared to recall its troops from South Africa and grant independence to the Boers, if the conviction should be reached that the cause of the Boers is just. From a Christian standpoint, the admission that the nation might be in the wrong, and the consideration of the moral propriety of the war, would be absolutely necessary. But who ever heard of an empire pausing in its course to consider a question of morals? The idea has always been that the empire was in the right, and the seeking of divine aid was not for the purpose of enlightenment, but only to ask the sanction of Heaven upon what the empire was determined to do.
