ALL denominations in Philadelphia, including Roman Catholics, have joined in an undertaking to secure a religious census of the city, to be taken in one day—February 22. The enterprise is under the direction of the "Philadelphia County Sabbath-school association," and the statistics gathered will be placed in the hands of pastors and Sunday-school officials. It is at least suggestive of an assumption of religious authority which might readily be turned against the rights of the people.
