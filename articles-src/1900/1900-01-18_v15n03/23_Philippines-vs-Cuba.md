Why are 65,000 soldiers of the United States required in the Philippines, and less than 5,000 in Cuba, and why is there war in the one region and peace in the other? There we fix the responsibility. It is not upon those who have protested always and pointed out the honorable, better, and righteous way. In the one case this Republic wages a war of conquest; in the other we lift up liberty, teach the lessons of self-government, and protect the people in their home rights. In Luzon the hell of war exists; in Cuba there is quiet, and material upbuilding bravely goes on.—Springfield Republican.
