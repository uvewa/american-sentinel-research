WE give considerable space in this issue to a consideration of the policy of foreign conquest as affecting American principles of government, because the matter is now before Congress for their final action, and a speech has been made before that body which clearly defines the ideas and aims of the expansionist party. If we may judge from this speech, it is no longer pretended that an "imperial destiny" is not what that party has in view for this Republic.
