In South America it is well recognized among the Catholic authorities, that the "Salesian Fathers" are the most capable of all the religious orders, in the work of civilizing and teaching the Indians, as also in the colonization of the vast uncultivated territories of this continent. They therefore being acknowledged as the great papal educators down here, it will be interesting to quote from a South American journal an incident which reveals in an unequivocal manner, that the terrible spirit of the Inquisition still burns in the breasts of the Roman Catholic friars. We shall translate the following from a prominent Chilian paper:—

"The TENDER MERCIES OF THE SALESIAN FATHERS.

"The Imparcial of Huara has collected from the Peruvian papers, a denouncement made by the "Municipal" of Pisco, with the object of bringing to light the barbarous crimes committed by the Salesian Fathers in Hoji Redonda.

"In the said town the Catholic Fathers had, but a short time previously, burnt in a most cruel manner five little children for different reasons, principally for the crime of not learning their lessons. The inhabitants of Hoji Redonda, being somewhat fanatical, covered up this atrocious act, so as not to bring disgrace upon the Catholic Church.

"Recently however—in February last—the same Salesian Fathers, have reiterated this awful crime upon a boy of ten years of age, named Eusebio Zegarra, son of Eusebio Zegarra and Natividad Donayres, by inflicting severe burns upon his body for having neglected to learn his lessons at school.

"At 8 o'clock on a beautiful February morning, Father Guido, the superior, ordered the pupils to form a circle in the school yard. Upon their doing so, the said reverend father(?) commanded the child Zegarra to divest himself of all his clothing. Scarcely had he obeyed than Father Guido took the lad in his arms and carried him to a bonfire that was burning a short distance away.

"When the fire was at its highest, Father Guido took the boy by the hands and feet—although the latter struggled in vain to free himself from the hands of his executioner—and without the least scruple, the priest threw the lad upon the burning heap; from which he was taken out a short time afterwards in a most exanimate condition.

"Nearly all the fellow-scholars of the victim cried bitterly at the sight of their apparently dead companion, upon his being taken from the fire. The Catholic friars, without loss of time, had the boy conveyed to the hospital, where Dr. Monilla was called to give the first treatment; the greatest precaution being taken in the meantime by the clerical and medical authorities, to keep hidden this incident from the people.

"The boy Zegarra can to-day be found in Cieneguilla Street, No. 13, Hoji Redonda, in a very convalescent state, after having been confined to bed for nearly two months. We have visited him, and have seen with our eyes three great burns upon his person. One in the stomach, another in the shoulder, and the other in the knee. As the result of the latter, a tumor in the groin has appeared, which was operated on by Dr. Enrique Mestanza.

"The parents of Zegarra have already protested against this brutal act, to the authorities of the town, but so far without result."

The majority of our readers would imagine that such a savage act could not be committed in this enlightened generation of the nineteenth century; and yet we find that not only is such cruelty perpetrated, but even the perpetrators of such horrid crimes are sheltered and protected by the judicial authorities of a so-called Christian nation. And this, too, in the most faithful of all Catholic countries, viz.: Peru—a country which for the long period of four hundred years has received no other instruction than that taught by the priests of Rome. And yet the papal church boasts continually of the success of her foreign missions.

In truth, the spirit of the Madrid Quemadera still burns in the hearts of these inquisitional Catholic friars; and they only await the opportunity to put their theory into practise.

Has Rome become more liberal? Yes, but only in the countries where she has not the power to do otherwise; and where she is helpless to persecute. Would you see her in her true colors? Go to Spain, Portugal, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador; there you see her in all her hideousness, and cruelty, intolerant to the extreme; having in view only one object; viz.: the extirpation of the heretic.

Let us not be deceived by the false cry that Rome has changed, and has become more liberal than she was in the Dark Ages. Such a clamor is false, and but calculated to deceive the unwary. JOHN McCARTHY.
