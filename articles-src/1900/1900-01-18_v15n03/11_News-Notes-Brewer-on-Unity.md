Justice Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court, says he believe that the twentieth century will be marked by the development of a marvelous unity among religious denominations. One noteworthy feature indicative of this, is that "the ancient enemies, Catholicism and Protestantism, are drawing closer together. The prelates and members of the two churches do not hesitate to affiliate in a thousand forms of labor."
