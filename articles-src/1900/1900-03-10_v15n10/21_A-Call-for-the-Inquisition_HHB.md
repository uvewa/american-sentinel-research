IN a recent issue of a local paper printed in Greenwich, Ohio, appeared the following:—

"AN OPEN LETTER."

"I meant all I said as to minors, and am ready to circulate a petition to-morrow praying the State of Ohio to give us a law compelling minors to attend at the church of their choice the Lord's day school; giving the marshal of our municipality the responsible duty to see it executed, assigning to their nearest school those who have no choice, and making it a misdemeanor for any one to hinder or oppose the full execution of the same, with fines and imprisonment.

"Sickness or removal the only excuse for not being present at roll call every Sunday, making all parents guilty of a crime and misdemeanor who do not do all in their power to send their children to Sunday school; making the municipality furnish needful clothing to the needy ones.

"Am ready to discuss the same with any one who desires at any time or place.

"Respectfully submitted,

"H. T. MEAD."

The ordinary reader will discover at once that back of these words lies the inquisition in full. Without it how could it be determined when a child was too ill to attend Sunday school; or whether parents did all in their power to send their children to the same.

We are surely nearing the fulfillment of the prophetic words of the Patmos seer concerning the lamblike power which should speak as a dragon: "And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast [the papacy] before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast [or papacy], whose deadly wound [the loss of power to enforce its worship] was healed." —Rev. 13:12.

The spirit is already working in the hearts of men; and all that remains is a little more time in which to mold public sentiment. Then we shall see and feel all the force of the prophet's words.

H. H. BURKHOLDER.
