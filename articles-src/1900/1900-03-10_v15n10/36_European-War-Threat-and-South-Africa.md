THERE is a "vague alarm" in Great Britain, dispatches say, over the foundation which seems apparent for the belief that Europe intends to interfere to prevent England from conquering the South African republics. Added to this is the fact that Russia is distinctly threatening England on the latter's Asiatic frontier, and has already a "stronger grip on Persia" as the result of the war. England is not likely to brook any interference in Africa, and the prospect for a general European war has not for many years been more vivid than it is now.
