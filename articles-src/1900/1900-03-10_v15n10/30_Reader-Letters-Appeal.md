We publish on another page a few extracts from letters by friends of the SENTINEL, who appreciate the importance of the matters to which it is calling attention and the timeliness of its work. We are receiving such letters constantly, and we may know from them just how the SENTINEL would be appreciated by many others everywhere, if only some one would bring it to their attention. Reader, cannot you do something to this end in your locality?
