We publish this week an interesting report of proceedings in the Maryland legislature relating to the enactment of a new Sunday law. See page 146. A vast amount of interest and even excitement over the question of Sunday enforcement was manifested by the people at the Capital and by crowds who came up from Baltimore to attend the hearing on the bill, and the matter is not yet ended. So we shall present another report later on.
