So far as Rome is concerned, it is evident the Cubans are not to have home rule. They must accept as their spiritual ruler a foreign bishop, Mgr. Sbarretti, who is so odious in their eyes that a general movement of opposition has been started against him in the island. It is even asserted that if the protest of the people fails, they will organize their own church independently of the wishes of Rome. But independence of Rome means the rejection of the Catholic religion. This the Cubans do not see, and until they do see it they will remain bound without knowing where the chains are that hold them in bondage.
