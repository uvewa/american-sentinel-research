If anything were necessary to show the absurdity, to say nothing of the essential wickedness, of Sunday laws and their exemption clauses, it was furnished a little while ago by a Paterson, N. J., justice.

Within a short time of each other, two arrests were made for violating the Sunday law. One of the offenders was a barber, charged with shaving a customer on Sunday; the other was a butcher, charged with selling meat upon that holy (?) day. Both offenders sought to avail themselves of the exemption clauses, and maintained that their work was a work of necessity.

The learned justice decided that shaving on Sunday was a work of necessity, and therefore wholly justifiable; while he decided that selling meat on Sunday was not. The ground of his decision in the first case was the fact that he found it necessary to shave himself on Sunday, and that being so it was perfectly right for others to do the same; and as it is well known that all people cannot shave themselves, and some feeling that a shave on Sunday is a real necessity, they must, perforce, seek the aid of the tonsorial artist.

Just why the justice decided that selling meat was not a necessity did not appear in the reports. But it is fair to infer that the justice did not regard it as necessary on the ground that he did not eat on Sunday. How could it be otherwise, without showing himself to be unfair in his judicial renderings? As he justified shaving on Sunday because he regarded it as a necessity for himself; so to be fair he must have justified the butcher for selling meat on that day, if he had regarded eating on Sunday a necessity.

It is a law of nature that ordinarily hair will grow on a man's face on Sunday as well as on other days of the week. It is also true that many people, in spite of anything they might do to prevent it, cannot help getting hungry on Sunday, as well as on other days. As a rule people who are hungry will eat, even on Sunday; many must eat when hungry, or be made ill as a result. But no matter, however; the justice's decision makes it wrong for people to get hungry on Sunday, and if they do, the butcher must stand the consequences.

It was of course fortunate for the barber that this justice's beard did not suspend its growth on Sundays, for he would then have been made to feel the strong arm of the law; although in the butcher's case it was unfortunate for him.

But what shall be said of a law that makes it possible for a judge to capriciously decide that shaving, which really is more a luxury than a necessity, is right when done on Sunday, while the selling of food, which is an absolute necessity, is wrong when done on that day?

This incident shows clearly that Sunday laws, with their exemption clauses, are both wicked and absurd, and can result only in untold harm.
