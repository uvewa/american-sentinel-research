EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: We begin to see the need of religious liberty literature here. A short time ago the Methodist minister and the Methodist bishop of this district tried three times to have some of our brethren [S. D. Adventists] in Solomonville arrested for Sunday work and for holding meetings in a public building there; but the judge finally got tired of them and asked them if the Adventists had molested them in any way. They said, "No." Then he asked them if the Adventists had interrupted their services or religious meetings; and they said, "No." Then he said, "You go home and mind your business and let them alone."

Nevertheless, they came into our meetings and demanded to know who was responsible for holding them, as they were going to have him arrested. The reply, given by the congregation, was, "It is all of us; arrest us all." So you see that the enemy, who "was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus," has not forgotten us here in Arizona. C. D. M. WILLIAMS.

Tucson, Arizona, Feb. 23.
