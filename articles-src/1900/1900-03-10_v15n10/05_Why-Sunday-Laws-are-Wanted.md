In *The Detender*, a New England magazine which advocates the enforced observance of Sunday, the Rev. A. H. Plumb, D. D., states this as the purpose of Sabbath rest:—

"What is meant by 'not any work'—'In it thou shalt not do any work?' Is 'not any work' the end, or the means to the end? Rest is good, but it is a negative good. It is not good enough to be the sole, or the chief, or more than a subordinate end of such a Word of God as the fourth commandment."

Rest being then only a subordinate end, what is the primary end which is served by the securing of rest. He says:—

"A civil rest-day in itself is a great good, even for those who desire and get nothing more; but it is chiefly desirable because it gives better opportunity to keep the day holy unto the Lord."

Now *The Detender* advocates the securing of Sunday rest by law; it wants Sunday rest enforced upon all the people. But Sunday rest, it says, is only a subordinate means to the chief end to be secured. "It is chiefly desirable because it gives better opportunity to keep the day holy unto the Lord." What, then, is the chief purpose of the Sunday laws for which *The Defender* and its party are calling? Plainly, the law being to secure Sunday rest, and Sunday rest being "chiefly desirable" as a means to keeping Sunday holy, the chief end and aim of the Sunday law is the keeping holy of the day. They are trying to make men religious by law.

They always deny this, of course; but by their own words they make it perfectly plain that such is the real truth of the matter.

"We want the Sunday law to secure Sunday rest. We want Sunday rest chiefly in order that the day may be kept holy." Therefore, the Sunday law is chiefly to promote the "holy" keeping of the day. That is fair; it is logical; and it is the truth.
