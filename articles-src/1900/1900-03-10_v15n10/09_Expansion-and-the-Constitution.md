EXPANSION has taken hold of men's minds, said Congressman Bartholdt, of Missouri, in the House a day or two ago, "and if existing constitutions do not cover it they must give way." That is the spirit of the whole thing. If it is opposed to free government then perish free government.—Springfield Republican.
