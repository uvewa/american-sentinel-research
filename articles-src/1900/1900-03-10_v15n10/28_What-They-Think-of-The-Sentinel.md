### A FEW EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS OF PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL.

I consider the AMERICAN SENTINEL the one true exponent of popular government in this country. No republic can long exist where church and state are blended, or where religion interferes in politics. The Catholic Church is using the many so-called Christian political organizations with which to draw first blood. This is the expressed sentiment of one who belongs to no church, but will never endorse the encroachments of religious organizations upon religious liberty. May the SENTINEL long continue in the good cause. I am ever ready to lend a helping hand so far as my ability will permit.

J. D. HAMMONDS, M.D.

La Mesa, Cal., February 17, 1900.

I shall not stop giving support to the SENTINEL so long as I am able to pay for it. I feel a deep interest in its work for liberty and justice. In working for our fellow-men we are working for the Master. May right prevail.

WESLEY PULVER.

Stoddard, Wis., February 22, 1900.

I with pleasure renew my subscription for the AMERICAN SENTINEL. I think I never saw a paper that voices my sentiments in every particular like this wonderful little paper. May it always dare to speak the truth, and uphold the foundation of American principles in both church and state, is the sincere prayer of the writer.

A. E. FRANK.

Canton, N. Y., December 26, 1899.

I AM a missionary Baptist of the strictest sort, but am in hearty sympathy and accord with the SENTINEL in its advocacy of religious and civil liberty. I have, for many years, recognized the tendency toward imperialism, centralization and destruction of the liberties of the people and the downfall of the Republic. Friends, who then laughed at me as a pessimist are beginning now to see the breakers and realize the danger. Long may the SENTINEL guard the rights of the common people. I have no sympathy with the agitation nor respect for the judgment of Sunday fanatics. Yours truly,

C. M. SHERROUSE.

New Orleans, La., January 30, 1900.

For the enclosed dollar, send me some copies of the SENTINEL. I am not very particular about dates. It is always new if not entirely up to date. I keep a real estate office. Have a great many comers and goers. I want to give each one a SENTINEL. . . . I consider the SENTINEL a power in the earth.

Yours very truly,

H. FERRETT.

Logan, Kansas, January 15, 1900.

I THANK you for sending me the SENTINEL as you have. It is with great pleasure that I get the paper every week. I could not keep house without it.

C. B. BECKWITH.

Rochester, Vt., January 14, 1900.

EDITOR SENTINEL, New York City.

Dear Sir:—The SENTINEL is a welcome visitor to my study, and although I have only yet seen a few numbers, I have derived much benefit from its reading.

Yours very truly,

T. E. LEWIS.

Duenweg, Mo., February 2, 1900.
