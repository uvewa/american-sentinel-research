In the two great republics, ancient Rome and the United States, has been exemplified, before all the nations of the earth, the principle of self-government, as far, perhaps, as is possible in earthly governments. But self-government is a principle of Bible truth. Ancient Rome imbibed this principle in spite of paganism. And with her paganism and with the principle of self-government, was to be found perfect freedom of worship, with but one restriction,—there must be an acknowledgment that the gods of the Romans were the superiors of all other gods. Her apostasy from the principle of truth which she possessed was her ruin.

Certainly there can be no room for question but that this last republic is in advance of that ancient republic just to the extent that she is in possession of more Bible truth. And to the extent that this is so, it can be said as of other peoples and cities: "It will be more tolerable in the day of judgment for ancient pagan Rome than for thee." For with all the history of the career and downfall of Rome before us, written both upon the pages of prophesy and history, this nation is going over the same road of apostasy and disintegration. And what then can be before her but total ruin?

Having the principles of truth in greater perfection than Rome, in the very beginning of her history as a nation, she declared that "No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any position of trust under the United States." Thus an advance step was taken in not demanding a recognition of even the Christian's God as superior to all others, that there might be the most absolute freedom in all matters of conscience.

Having more light than her ancient sister republic, this nation adopted the principles of Protestantism and republicanism, absolute civil and religious liberty. This was done because the framers of the national Constitution recognized the rights of all men to govern themselves in all matters both civil and religious.

But now that the nation is repudiating the principles of Protestantism and republicanism, and thereby losing the power of self-government—the light of truth becoming darkness—the question arises, Will the art of self-government die out of the earth? Not at all, we reply. In the very midst of all this apostasy and general ruin that is so sure to follow, the principle of self-government will be exemplified as never before. And the people in whom this principle of truth will be manifested is the church of the living God. Not through sectarianism, but by the power of the "everlasting gospel," which is "the power of God unto salvation to all that believe."
