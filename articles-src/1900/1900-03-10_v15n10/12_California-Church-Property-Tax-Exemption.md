In California, where church property has for some time been subject like other property to taxation, a movement has been started by the clergy to secure exemption for such property as is granted in other States. We are informed that "at a recent meeting of ministers and church members in San Diego a 'plan of campaign' was laid out, and a resolution adopted to levy an assessment on the churches to pay the expenses. The San Diego Daily Union states that the amendment was passed by both houses of the last California legislature, and will be submitted to the votes of the people at the election next November."
