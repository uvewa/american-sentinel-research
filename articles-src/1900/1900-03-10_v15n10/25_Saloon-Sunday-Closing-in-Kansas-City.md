The question of Sunday closing of the saloons is being strongly agitated in Kansas City. The agitation is being pushed by the anti-saloon league of the city, who are calling upon the Police Board to enforce the law in the matter; which the Police Board seem rather indisposed to do. In the discussions that have resulted some rather curious arguments for Sunday closing have been advanced by the league.

The chairman of the league committee, for example, "said that a saloon keeper was required by law to be of good moral character, but those who keep open on Sunday are deliberate law-breakers, and no law-breaker can be said to be of good moral character."

That is to say, it is not the conducting of the saloon business that stamps a man as immoral, but the violation of the Sunday law. The saloon-keeper who closes on Sunday is moral, but the one who disregards the Sunday law is immoral. From which it necessarily follows that breaking the Sunday law is a worse thing than running a saloon!

Another argument of the Sunday closers was that an open saloon on Sunday constituted a "disorderly house," the keeping of which was contrary to the law. How this could be true on Sunday any more than on Monday or on other days, was not explained; and the implied distinction is altogether too fine to be discerned by an ordinary unbiased mind.

Certainly the cause of temperance and of law and order has nothing to gain from the use of such arguments. It has nothing to gain from Sunday-closing laws.

This is so because such laws are rarely and only spasmodically enforced, while they throw a legal wall of protection around these nefarious institutions during six days of the week. The saloon Sunday-closing law is a law for opening the saloons six-sevenths of all the time, when temperance and justice declare they ought not to be opened at all. The saloon is a law-breaker (being an inciter to every crime), yet it is protected by law (where there is a Sunday-closing law), which is not true of any other law-breaker. The saloon is a natural outlaw, and should be recognized as such in the criminal code. It should not be allowed the opportunity to hold up its head as a law-abiding institution.

While thus strengthening the saloon, the Sunday-closing law, as stated, does little towards securing even the fragmentary seventh part of temperance for which it is ostensibly passed. Commissioner Gregory, of Kansas City, says the report, "said that in the twenty odd years of the existence of the metropolitan police the saloons had been closed only about ten Sundays. Many had been arrested, but none convicted." And this is substantially the experience had in the matter of Sunday closing in other cities.

One thing, however, the Sunday-closing law does secure. It sets apart Sunday as a day different in character from other days of the week; for why should a Sunday-closing law be advocated more than a Monday-closing or a Saturday-closing law, if Sunday is like any ordinary day. And this recognition of Sunday as an extraordinary day is due to the religious belief that Sunday is the Christian Sabbath, and is therefore a sacred day. But civil enactments are not designed to affirm and fortify religious beliefs; and in so far as they do this, they promote a union of church and state.

The chairman of the Kansas City anti saloon league declared that public sentiment there was overwhelmingly in favor of "the respectful observance of the Sabbath"; and the indications are that the Sunday-closing movement will be quite vigorously pushed by the religious element which is behind it.
