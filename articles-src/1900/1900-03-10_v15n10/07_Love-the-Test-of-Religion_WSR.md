THE test of a religion is whether it "works by love and purifies the heart." A religion that works by force does not purify the heart but only changes through fear the outward actions. There is no love in these actions, and as there is no love there is no keeping of the law, for "love is the fulfilling of the law."

A person never loves to do what he is forced to do, for if he did he would do it before and without being forced to do it.

A thing good in itself if done in love amounts to nothing if done without love. Authority for this is Paul's statement that if he gave all his goods to feed the poor and his body to be burned and have not love, he is nothing. The same rule will apply to church attendance and many other such things.

False religions in all times have always discovered their true character by using force instead of winning by love after the manner of Jesus and of the apostles after they were converted.

So well do the propagators of false religions know that using force is a sure indicator of the falsity of their teachings, that they try in various ways to hide it and to appear to be working by love after the manner of Christ. But if the way of apparent love or charity does not cause people to submit to them they sooner or later lose all self-restraint and break out in anger and force against those who resist them. But "what would Jesus do" in such a case? He wept over Jerusalem when no hope remained that they would listen more to his teachings. He did no more. He did not use force to make them follow him or do right.

We have heard it said that "might makes right." We may say further by the same philosophy that "will makes right." "Where there is a will there's a way" to do wrong as well as right. It is wonderful how many good reasons can be thought of for doing a wrong thing when the mind and heart are set that way. Some boys once went down to look through the orchard fence at some apples that they were forbidden to touch. One thought of one reason and another mentioned another good reason why it would not be wrong to take those apples. One encouraged the other, and this was easy to do, for each one wanted an excuse to take the apples and was glad when an especially good reason for an excuse and quieter of conscience was advanced. In this way restraint was finally overcome, and the boys rushed pell mell into the orchard.
