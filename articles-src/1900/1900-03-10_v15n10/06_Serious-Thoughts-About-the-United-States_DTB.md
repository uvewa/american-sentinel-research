### HOW A CLOUD OF WITNESSES VIEW IT.

BY D. T. BOURDEAU.
(A Frenchman.)

A cloud of candid witnesses, both in the Old World and in America, have noticed and criticised the following recent departures of the United States from its profession, regarding them as sad omens for that nation:

(a.) Taking and possessing territory east of the Atlantic, and in the Old World, thereby going against its famous Monroe doctrine.

(b.) Acting toward the inhabitants of its newly-acquired possessions in the Orient in a manner more than savoring of imperialism, and antagonistic to these famous "self-evident" truths in the Declaration of Independence: "All men are created equal," and "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," among which "are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," and "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

Under this head remarks like the following are made by thoughtful persons of every land, who have admired the profession and fundamental principles of what they have regarded as the model Republic:

"Were the inhabitants of this acquired territory treated as if God had created all men equal? Were they treated as having the same right to liberty and independence that Americans originally had? Did the United States in this case derive its just powers from the consent of the governed? Did it not rather force those with whom it had to do to consent to be governed by itself? Again, were the precept, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself,' and the Golden Rule, 'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,' which are applicable to nations as well as to individuals composing them, and on which depends the republican doctrine of equal rights, strictly regarded by what had been hitherto considered as the model Republic? What a noble example this favored nation would have given to the world in favor of liberty, had she made the inhabitants of her Oriental possessions a free and independent nation, according to their urgent pleas, instead of sacrificing so many precious lives, and expending such large sums of money to be refunded by an increased taxation of Americans!

"Would not liberty and independence have been as precious to the inhabitants of those islands as they were originally to the United States? If the people of those islands had previously belonged to the United States and had been breaking away from that Government and endeavoring to overturn its republican principles, or if they had been one with Spain in declaring and waging war against the United States, and had not been struggling for independence and sweet liberty, the case would have been different. Were not that people as justly entitled to liberty and independence as were the thirteen original States of the great American Republic when they declared themselves independent? And would they not have been more disposed to bless the United States as their benefactor, receive her counsels, and, as it were, welcome the friendly touch of her fashioning hand, had she granted them what she originally claimed for herself, than they will be under present circumstances?"

(c.) Agreeing not to disturb slavery in the Sulu Islands, thereby militating with the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which declares that "neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

Here it is pertinently asked, "If this change of tactics on the part of the United States Government is justifiable, why might not slavery be restored and left undisturbed in any part of the United States?" And to the excuse, "It is only a temporary thing, a compromise for the present, until the thing is abolished;" and, after all, it is a "very mild form of slavery," the following response is returned: "What need is there of abolishing it at all, if it is so mild a thing? It is either right or wrong. If it is right, why talk of abolishing it later on? If it is wrong, is not a compromise out of place? Is it right to pursue a wrong course that good may come out of it?"

(d.) Granting the pasha of the Sulu Islands a yearly salary of $4,000. Is not this worse than catering to monarchism? Who is this pasha? In "Chambers' Encyclopedia" pasha is thus defined: "A title used in the Ottoman empire, and applied to governors of provinces or military and naval commanders of high rank. The name is said to be derived from two Persian words—pa, foot or support, and shah, ruler—and signifies the support of the ruler [the sultan]. . . . The pasha is in his own person the military leader and administrator of justice for the pleasure of the sultan!"

Whatever may be the present relations between the United States and Turkey, one thing is certain, which is that in case the sultan declares war against Christians and decides they shall be massacred (a thing which he has frequently done and is likely to do again in the near future), the pasha of the Sulu Islands, will most assuredly act "for the pleasure of the sultan," and of course the sultan will stand by him. And there is no end to such complications resulting from departures from both profession and principles on the part of the United States.

What striking changes are coming over the United States Government, hitherto regarded as the pearl of nations, because of its exalted profession which, in a great measure, it exemplified before the world! Before the high profession and heaven-born principles lying at the very foundation of this Government, tyrants and oppressors once quailed, and lovers of freedom once rejoiced, being favorably affected by the powerful logic of eternal truths practically carried out and by visible, unmistakable tokens of rich showers of heavenly blessings resting on a nation largely exceptional as to its doctrine and practise.

Under such circumstances, both tyrants and lovers of liberty united in calling the United States a happy and blessed nation. Other nations, as if drawn to the right by an invisible, supernatural magnet, aimed, as far as possible, to copy and utilize the noble principles of the American Republic. From the force of circumstances, they voiced the sentiment of these words with regard to the Israelites, uttered by an ancient seer: "The people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations." Num. 23:9. They said, "This nation has plenty of good territory on which to expand and prosper and on which to exemplify the principles of civil and religious liberty: and surely, true to their profession, she will not grasp after territory east of the Atlantic."

But how changed the course of the great Republic, and how changed the language of those who once lauded it and held it in admiration! Their language now is: "That nation is departing from its profession and principles; and what will be the end of such a course?" How applicable to this nation are becoming these words with regard to the Jewish nation, uttered in anguish by the weeping prophet: "How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed!" Lam. 4:1. Even now there comes from some religionists in the United States more than an intimation that Sunday legislation should assume such a phase that it can be possible legally to inflict the death penalty upon violators, even on those who cannot conscientiously keep Sunday. Thus we see in the United States a gradual but sure going back on the doctrine that all should be allowed to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, and on the Bible doctrine that, so far as religious duties are concerned, the power of choosing or refusing to obey, should be left free and untrammeled.

And doubtless some readers of the SENTINEL will here call to mind the following pertinent question asked by discerning Frenchmen at Chicago in 1893, upon seeing the gates of the Chicago Exposition closed on Sunday according to the Sunday bill then recently passed by the Congress of the United States: "Is this the American liberty for which Lafayette, Washington and others ventured their fortunes, their lives, their all?"
