"Expansion," says the New York Journal, "can survive open opposition, but it cannot survive treacherous conversion into imperial exploitation." It says this with reference to the tariff imposed upon Porto Rico. Yet the Journal has all along been an ardent champion of the principle of which the Porto Rican tariff but represents the putting into practise. The Journal has all along contended that the people of Porto Rico had no right to independence—no right against forcible annexation by the United States, yet now it contends just as vehemently for the right of the Porto Ricans to free trade, under the Constitution. This is about like saying that a man has no right to live, but has a right to a meal of victuals.
