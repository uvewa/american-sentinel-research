Admiral Dewey has declared that the American navy needs to be largely increased, and his views on the subject, as might be expected, are indorsed by other governmental authorities. In a statement before the House Committee on Naval Affairs, the admiral said:—

"We need a more powerful navy than we have at present for a number of important reasons. We need a navy large enough at all times to adequately protect our growing foreign commerce and our colonies and our coast lines from hostile nations.

"The greatest strength of every country to-day lies in its navy. Our present fleet of ships and the number of officers and men in the service are too small to meet the growing demand upon the country's sea power."

His recommendations, which are likely to be adopted by Congress, are: four first-class battle-ships; three armored cruisers of 13,000 tons each; six smaller cruisers; eight to twelve gunboats.
