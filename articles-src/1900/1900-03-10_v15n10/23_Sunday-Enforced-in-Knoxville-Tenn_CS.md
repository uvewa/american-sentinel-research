IN the Knoxville (Tenn.) Sentinel, February 26, an account is given of the enforced observance of Sunday in this city. Among other things it says, "For the first time in many years the Sabbath(?) was yesterday passed in Knoxville with nearly every business feature of the day closed."

Saloons, soda founts, cigar stores, fruit stands, and in fact, almost every place where a nickel could be spent presented a "cold shoulder"—a closed door—to the would-be purchaser.

This condition of affairs which rendered the observance of the holy(?) day quiet and peaceful, resulted from a special order, issued by Chief of Police J. J. Atkins, Saturday afternoon. The order provides that the State law, which closes places of business on Sunday, must be enforced.

The enforcement of this law means that not even a cigar nor a package of chewing gum can be purchased on Sunday, and drug stores are allowed to sell nothing but drugs.

The police made vigilant efforts to detect violations of the law. During the day two cases were made against Monroe Howard's Imperial Hotel stand by Lieut. W. P. Chandler. These were the only cases of any character recorded during the day, which shows that the law violators were apparently not in evidence.

Howard was fined $10. In the Journal and Tribune, February 27, this announcement is made: "The Ministers' Union warmly endorsed the strict administration of the Sunday-selling ordinance on last Sunday, and at the meeting of the union yesterday morning resolutions concerning the matter were passed. Remarks made were all complimentary to the officers for performing their duty."

The resolutions passed were as follows:—

"WHEREAS, The Sunday laws and ordinances of the city were strictly enforced yesterday; therefore

"Resolved, That the Ministers' Union most heartily commend this action on the part of our mayor, board of public works, chief of police and policemen; and that we earnestly request our city officials to persevere in the good work which they have so auspiciously begun.

"Be it further resolved, That we request all citizens to co-operate with the civil officials in their endeavor to enforce our Sunday laws, and to give them all due encouragement in the faithful performance of all their official duties."

Our Government, though lamb-like in appearance, is assuming every day more clearly the voice of the dragon. The states and the municipalities, encouraged by public sentiment, are becoming bolder to enforce coercive observance of Sunday laws. Popular education of religionists is trending that way.

CYRUS SIMMONS.
