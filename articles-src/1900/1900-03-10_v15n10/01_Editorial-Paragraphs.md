RELIGIOUS legislation brings both law and religion into disrepute.

The so-called "civil Sabbath" could not stand a day if deprived of its religious support.

The right of the people to be free is as much a right on Sunday as on any other day of the week.

The law can justify or condemn, but it has no power to reform. Hence moral reforms are not promoted by legislation.

The reason why some people do not have a "quiet Sabbath" is that they are too much concerned with what other people are doing on that day.

A RIGHT of conscience is not a right to interfere with the liberty of others, but one affecting only the conscience and conduct of the individual claiming it.

SINCE legislation represents the will of the majority, religious legislation depends for justification upon the utterly fallacious idea that the majority in religion must be in the right.

The province of religion is not to increase the population of the jails, but to add souls to the kingdom of God. At least this is the province of Christianity. Hence it has no need for a Sunday law.

The rights of all men are equal; and all men, as regards their rights, are equal. One man or class of men, cannot have a right which demands the subversion of the rights of others.

A WEEKLY day of rest is either the Sabbath of the Lord which he set apart at creation, or a counterfeit of it; and as such it must be a religious institution, and the resting upon it must be a religious act.
