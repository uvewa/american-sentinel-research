A BILL to abolish slavery in Hawaii has been introduced into Congress. The bill in general relates to the government of Hawaii, and the part providing for the abolition of slavery is in the form of an amendment secured by Senator Pettigrew, of South Dakota, who was recently denounced by a New Jersey senator as a traitor. We trust the bill with this amendment will be passed; for as has been noticed in these columns, there is actual slavery in Hawaii, in territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.

A Washington despatch relating to the matter says:—

"Slavery in Hawaii will be abolished if the bill now pending in the Senate for a government for the islands is made a law. Senator Pettigrew has secured the adoption of an amendment to the bill which provides that 'all contracts made since Aug. 12, 1898, by which persons are held for services for a definite term, etc.,' shall be declared void.

"Mr. Pettigrew, in support of his amendment, said that since the annexation of the islands more than 30,000 Asiatics had been brought into the islands as contract laborers. He showed by the report of the Hawaiian Board of Immigration that the importation of Japanese coolies had increased more than 100 per cent. since the annexation, and that they were now brought into Hawaii at the rate of 3,000 a month.

"These laborers, he said, are bound by contracts to serve from three to ten years. Their average monthly pay is $12.50, out of which they are compelled to board themselves. Each month $1.50 is deducted by the Immigration Commission of Hawaii to pay their passage home after completing their terms of service, and there is a system of fines by which their earnings are still further reduced, until they get only about $6 a month."
