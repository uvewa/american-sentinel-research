Trouble over the question of permitting Bible reading in a public school, is reported from New Antioch, Ohio. An exchange says:—

"The school board directed the teacher, one Miss Pulse, to suspend Bible reading, but she refused to obey. The board then applied for an injunction to restrain her, but the judge decided that the power lay not with the court, but with the board itself, to restrain Miss Pulse, and he dismissed the case. Upon this the board discharged the teacher and closed the school until another could be engaged who would obey orders and omit religious services from the program."
