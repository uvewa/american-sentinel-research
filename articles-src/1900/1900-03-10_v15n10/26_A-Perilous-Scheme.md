### ROMAN CATHOLIC PROPOSITION TO SECURE RELIGIOUS TEACHING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

New York "Sun."

A PROPOSITION comes from Roman Catholic sources to all Christians and Jews to unite to secure religious education in the public schools, by demanding time and opportunity for the religious guides of the children to supplement the secular education with religious instruction. That is, as we understand it, the religious teaching provided for under this plan would be strictly according to the prejudices and convictions of the parents and not for any proselyting purpose, the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish pupils each receiving the instruction under their own spiritual guides.

This seems on its face entirely fair and we do not doubt that the intention of those making the proposition is honest and sincere; but any division of the schools or of the pupils in the schools according to the religious belief of their parents is both undesirable and impracticable. If it was attempted, more especially in a great community like New York, it would result in breaking down the school system. The war of creeds would be sure to enter in and virulent religious controversy over the school instruction would be provoked. Moreover, a very considerable part of the parents at this time resent religious instruction of any kind whatsoever, as was indicated recently by a father's withdrawing his son from a public school simply because he was obliged to listen to the reading of the Bible.

The schools being public institutions supported by general taxation, and there being here no State religion, it is obvious that they must of necessity be practically secular in their instruction, for there is no system of religious teaching which would command general assent or which would not provoke widespread resentment. Proselyting might be debarred from it by regulations made in the strictest terms possible and it might be honestly disavowed by all the religious teachers as an animating purpose, but the suspicion of it would never be quieted; the impulse to it would be unrestrainable in teachers feeling that they had a commission from God.

Undoubtedly it may seem hard that Roman Catholics who esteem education without religion a veritable curse—making, as the Rev. Dr. McSweeny declares, "clever unbelievers"—should be compelled of themselves to support in the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx sixty schools, with more than forty thousand pupils, in order to secure religious instruction for their young; but there is no other way in this Republic. They must voluntarily bear the burden, if they feel that they cannot throw it off conscientiously, just as they bear the burden of supporting their churches. Parents and priests who want religious education for children must provide it in schools distinct from the public school system or as a supplement to the secular instruction which alone can be furnished by general taxation. Nor is this as great a hardship as it appears at first glance. It simply imposes on parents a religious duty which they ought willingly to bear if they feel that its performance is requisite to the salvation of the souls of their young. They do not expect the state to assist in the provision of such instruction in their churches, and why have they any more reason to ask for it in the case of schools for their children?

As the public schools are a prime necessity to our civilization, the maintenance of our popular government, nothing which will interfere with their essential service can be allowed to enter into them, and there is no conceivable plan for the restriction of religious education which would not constitute such a disturbance or which could counterbalance by any possible advantage the disastrous consequences of the controversies which would inevitably result from it.

One of the most beneficent offices performed by our public school system is in assimilating our great multitude of immigrants. It gives their children the English speech and rapidly transforms them into Americans in thought and feeling. That is a public duty, a necessity of popular government, and whatever interferes with it, even if it was the honest desire to impart religious instruction, would be no less than a great national calamity. The field for religious effort is outside of these schools and it is in no way restricted by them. If a church deems education without religion a terrible evil it must supply the omission in schools of its own, as the Roman Catholics are now doing on so large a scale, or by inculcating the obligation of parental religious training at home.
