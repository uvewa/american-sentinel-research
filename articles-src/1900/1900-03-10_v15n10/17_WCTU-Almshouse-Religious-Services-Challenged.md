An exchange mentions that "several taxpayers of the town of Greenfield, N. Y., have employed Judge J. L. Scott as attorney to apply to the Supreme Court for an injunction to restrain County Treasurer Grippen from paying to the Ballston Spa W. C. T. U. the $100 appropriation made by the board of supervisors in December for the purpose of paying expenses for holding religious service on Sunday in the almshouse. The taxpayers rightly hold that the supervisors cannot spend county money for religious services, and that if the women of the Christian Temperance Union desire to send a missionary to the almshouse they must do so at their own cost."
