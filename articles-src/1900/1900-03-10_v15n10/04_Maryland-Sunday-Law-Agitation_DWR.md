The State legislature of Maryland has, for the past two weeks, experienced some of the perplexities that invariably follow religious enactments.

Being stimulated by the existence of the old re-enacted provincial Sunday Blue Laws of 1696, ("An Act to Sanctify the Sabbath Day") and an apparent desire to coerce conformity to their conception of religious observances, the ministers of the city of Baltimore have successfully precipitated a biennial Sunday crusade for the last ten years.

The present Sunday law of Maryland prohibits all work excepting "works of necessity and charity" and these oft-repeated efforts to enforce the law has tended to antagonism to it, created contempt for religion, and brought forth the following proposed bill as a compromise measure between those who desire a liberal Sunday and those who wish to throw about the day every possible restriction:

### "A BILL

"Entitled an 'Act to repeal and en-enact, with amendments, Section 247 of Article XXVII of the Code of Public General Laws, title 'Crimes and punishments,' sub-title 'Sabbath Breaking,'" and to add a certain new section to said Article to be known as Section 247A, and to follow Section 247 of said Article.

"SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That Section 247 of Article XXVII of the Code of Public General Laws, title 'Crimes and Punishments,' sub-title 'Sabbath Breaking,' be and the same is hereby repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, and that a certain new section be and the same is hereby added to said Article to be known as Section 247A, to follow Section 247, of said Article, to read as to the sections, respectively, as follows:

"247. No person shall do, command or authorize, any work or bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly known as Sunday, unless it be a work of necessity or charity; and all shooting, hunting, and public sports and shows on said day are prohibited; violation of any provision of this section being a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of five dollars: provided that it shall be lawful to do any work or labor connected with or incidental to the publication, editing or preparing for publication or delivery of newspapers, the carriage of passengers in any car, vehicle, or elevator, the carriage of baggage to or from hotels or inns and railway stations, the baking of bread and preparing of meals, the polishing of boots or shoes, and the transmission of messages.

"247A. All manner of selling, exposing or offering for sale, bartering or disposing of any property or thing on Sunday is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding fifty dollars, or imprisonment in jail, not exceeding sixty days; but excepted from the provision of this section are the sale of meals, to be eaten on the premises or served elsewhere by caterers, and the sale of newspapers, cigars or tobacco prepared for use, milk, ice, fruit, flowers, confectionery, soda and mineral waters, drugs, medicines and surgical appliances.

"SEC. 2. And be it enacted, That this Act shall take effect from the date of its passage."

This bill was introduced in the House of Delegates by Mr. Sanford of Baltimore, and was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee February 16, 1900. Just before the third reading of the bill a hearing was granted, and the advocates of the bill and the antis went to the capital in force. The advocates of the repeal wore streamers having the word, "Constitution." The opponents wore large yellow placards in their hatbands inscribed, "No repeal of the Sunday Laws." The State House was thronged, the interest intense; and the sounds of excited discussions and contentions amid a dense cloud of tobacco smoke and the fumes of a brewery should have been sufficient to convince every minister and Christian participating that the discussing of the Sabbath under such circumstances was as much out of place as were they themselves. As an illustration of the nature of the contentions at this hearing we quote from a few speeches made in favor of the proposed bill:

"I come before you this morning to ask you to secure to us the rights which the Constitution of the United States gives us, and of the full enjoyments of which the Methodist ministers of Baltimore seek to deprive us. The Constitution guarantees us enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The ministers' definition of liberty, gentlemen, is: Freedom to every man to do as he likes so long as he does what Methodist ministers approve. Our definition is: Freedom to every man to do as he likes so long as he does not injure others. We say, if you test the arguments and statements of those gentlemen by our definition you will find that their arguments are illogical and their position is untenable.

"This is not the first time that a battle has been fought in Maryland between the forces of clerical intolerance on the one hand and the defenders of liberty on the other. It will be in the recollection of many gentlemen here that, some years ago, a rather severe conflict took place over the people's demand for Sunday cars. The matter was submitted to the vote of the people, and the friends of liberty scored an immense victory. During the course of the campaign that preceded the voting some terrible prophecies were uttered by the champions of the intolerants as to the doom that would befall Baltimore if Sunday cars should be run. It was pictured that Baltimore would become steeped in vice, dissipation and debauchery, and one of the extreme fanatics actually warned the people that if the ordinance passed, Baltimore would ultimately rival in wickedness the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

"The ordinance passed, and common sense triumphed, and even the intolerants now use the Sunday cars. But were any of their gloomy prophecies realized?"

For answer I reply: There stands dear old Baltimore to-day, in all her pristine beauty! The equal of any city in the world for orderliness and for the enjoyment by her citizens of knowledge, virtue, religion, civilization, advancement and prosperity. She has only one drawback; that is, in having more than her fair share of fanatics, who are a drag upon the wheels of progress.

"A few years passed on, and then about eight or nine years ago, a crusade was started similar to the present one. The fanatics induced the Police Board to put in operation the old Sunday Blue Laws. The battle waged fiercely for a few weeks, when it was found that the laws were out of harmony with the spirit of the age, and could not be enforced. Excitement subsided; the ministers ceased from troubling, and the people were at rest. But, as a result, a large number of poor people were ruined, many others were injured, law and religion were brought into contempt, and an antagonism was created to the Methodist religion which has not died out to this day.

"A similar crusade was commenced in Baltimore a few weeks ago. We have had some heavy fighting, and a large number of worthy citizens have been severely injured, but, fortunately, the battle was started while you gentlemen were sitting, and so we come to you for relief. The Sunday Blue Laws are like a bludgeon in the hands of the ministers, a bludgeon that is a menace to our just rights."

"Conrad Zeiger said the ministers were asking the enforcement of a law which had been on the statute books for over 160 years. It had been enforced only once or twice in the last 18 years—eight years ago and now. That it was objectionable was shown by the fact that it lasted only two weeks, and then was again laid on the shelf.

"You cannot legislate souls into heaven," said the speaker, "nor can you legislate people into the churches. Whether a man buys, sells, or smokes a cigar on Sunday, attends church or reads the Sunday paper, is a matter determined by individual conscience. For virtue's sake too much zeal may be had—the course of madness is a saint run mad. I admit some evil may be practised, using the cigar store for a screen, that is a form of hypocrisy not confined to the tobacco business, but exists from the amen corner to the penny shop in the alley, and therefore should not degrade Christianity nor interfere with a legitimate business. Let us disclaim that we all are dominated by that beautiful couplet which was quoted when here last:—

"The little copper penny
And the little silver dime
Make the mighty dollar
We are chasing all the time."

"I might with equal justice add:

"It's the precious greenback
And the fat old envelope
That give the preachers eloquence
And their ideas little scope."

"It is deplorable that so much enthusiasm should be aroused on the Sunday law, and so little concern manifested even by the ministers in the interest of measures of vital, moral, and religious importance which lie not only at the foundation of our city and State, but the entire nation. Why not preach and wax eloquent in the interest of a uniform divorce law, the protection of children who are sweating and retrograding in factories. Abolish your choir-singers and praise God freely, liberally, and with devotion."

"Edward Kines concluded the speech-making. He acknowledged he had been engaged as an attorney to represent the friends of modification. He held that the preachers had no more right to dictate as to what he should do on Sunday than they had to dictate the cloth he should wear. The city of Baltimore was orderly, because the present law had never been enforced. Enforce it, and the people would become scoffers at religion. The law prohibits the editing or sale of newspapers, and yet there was not a minister within the reach of his voice who had not invited a reporter to his church to take down his sermon. (Laughter.)"

The bill was made a special order for the hour following the hearing, but the lawmakers seemed to be confused and desirous of "washing their hands" of the whole matter. A thousand men about equally divided standing over them—in some instances on their desks and in their chairs—each faction demanding legislation favorable to their side of the question. Doubtless to avoid the rabble and probable trouble, the bill was made a special order for two days later. The perplexity seemed to increase with time, and the "washing" process was culminated in a vote "to table," and the Sunday law left as it was before.

Many of the delegates in explaining their votes favoring "tabling" the bill expressed a willingness to vote for a liberal Sunday law for the city of Baltimore, and Mr. Sanford gave notice that he would introduce a local Sunday bill for Baltimore in a few days.
