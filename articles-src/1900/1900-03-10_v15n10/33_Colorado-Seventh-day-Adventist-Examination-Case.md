THE State Board of Education of Colorado, in the case of L. J. Caldwell (Seventh-day Adventist) which came before it recently on the latter's refusal to take an examination on Saturday, decided that the State "nowhere compels the observance of Sunday as a religious, but only as a civil, institution." Also, "that there is no ground for the observance of two Sundays in the State, and that there can be only one."—(Denver News, Feb. 27.)

It is decidedly curious, in view of this, that if there is plain ground for the "civil Sabbath," as an institution separate from religion, there should be ground for it only on Sunday. "There is no ground for the observance of two Sundays in the State," hence the civil Sabbath must always coincide with the religious Sunday, yet it is not at all a religious institution! There is nothing like the Sunday Sabbath to illustrate a "distinction without a difference."
