SECRETARY-OF-WAR ROOT has gone to Cuba to investigate the situation, and, according to report, to feel the temper of the people on the subject of annexation. With the experience of Porto Rico before their eyes, the Cubans will not be likely to favor annexation without a guarantee of free trade with the United States; which, of course, would be just as objectionable to certain of the money powers in the United States as it is in the case of Porto Rico.
