We note this item in the London, Eng., Present Truth of February 15:—

"Quite recently a Wolverhampton barber was convicted under the Sunday Trading Act of Charles II., which prohibits tradesmen, artificers, workmen and laborers from pursuing their ordinary calling on Sunday. He appealed, his counsel contending that he did not belong to any one of these classes, and the Court of the Queen's Bench sustained his appeal, holding that the Act did not apply to barbers. What a strange condition, to have a law on the statute books, which puts all fair-minded judges at their wits' end to evade it!"
