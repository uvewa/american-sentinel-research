# Uncertainties — v15n10 (1900-03-10)

## Issue Header

- **Location:** Page 1, header
- **Issue:** The OCR reads "NUMBER A" for the issue number. Based on the date (March 10, 1900) and context, this is clearly issue Number 10 (volume 15). The "A" is an OCR misread of "10."
- **Transcribed as:** Volume 15, Number 10
- **Confidence:** HIGH — date and sequence confirm this reading.

## "The Detender" / "The Defender"

- **Location:** Article "Why Sunday Laws are Wanted," pages 4-5 (OCR pages 148-149)
- **Issue:** The magazine name appears as "The Detender" twice (first and second mentions) and then "The Defender" on the third mention. The OCR is inconsistent.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "The Detender" for first two occurrences (as in OCR), "The Defender" for the third occurrence — preserved exactly as found in the OCR source to flag the inconsistency.
- **Confidence:** LOW — The correct name is almost certainly "The Defender" throughout (a New England Sunday-law advocacy magazine). The initial appearances as "The Detender" are likely OCR errors from the original scan. However, without access to the original PDF, the OCR spelling has been preserved as found.
- **Note:** If the original PDF is checked, all instances should likely read "The Defender."

## D. T. Bourdeau Author Attribution

- **Location:** Article "Serious Thoughts About the United States"
- **Issue:** The byline reads "BY D. T. BOURDEAU. (A Frenchman.)" — D. T. Bourdeau is a known author in SDA historical literature (Daniel T. Bourdeau). The parenthetical "(A Frenchman.)" is part of the byline and has been preserved in the article text.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — attribution is explicit in the text.

## Springfield Republic / Springfield Republican

- **Location:** Article "The Only Word for It."
- **Issue:** The OCR source reads "Springfield Republic, n." — the trailing "n." is likely an OCR artifact or abbreviation, possibly "Springfield Republican." The publication is most likely the Springfield Republican (Massachusetts newspaper).
- **Transcribed as:** "Springfield Republic" in the article text (preserving the OCR), noted as "Springfield Republican" in the original_publication field.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — the trailing "n." is suspicious and may represent a cut-off word "Republican."
