The "United Christian Party," mentioned recently in these columns as having been developed from a religious conference or convention held in Willard Hall, Chicago, intend to put a political ticket in the field for the coming national campaign, and the following is reported as the idea of one of their leaders:—

### NATIONAL CHRISTIAN TICKET.

"RIGHTEOUSNESS."

For President,

A CHRISTIAN.

For Vice-President,

A CHRISTIAN.

For United States Senators,

CHRISTIANS.

For Representatives in Congress,

CHRISTIANS.

"Wouldn't you nominate any infidels or atheists?" was asked him. "Not one. I would appoint them to consulates in Turkey and darkest Africa, with instructions to argue the religious question out with Satan, the sultan, and the chimpanzees."

There is righteousness and "righteousness," and there are Christians and "Christians." And there are Christians who know very little about the business of running civil government, and non Christians who are well qualified in this respect. The only result of the success of this "United Christian" political scheme would be that politicians would have forced upon them a strong inducement to profess Christianity and stand well with the church. Hypocrisy would flourish and the church would be more and more leavened with the spirit of worldliness. The ideal state of the church is that described in the Book of Acts where the hypocritical class were all afraid to join the church, having the fate of Ananias before their eyes, and only the sincere believers were added to it, and these in great numbers.
