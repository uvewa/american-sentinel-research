# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 1, 1900 (v15n05)

## General Notes

The OCR source file was well-formed with clear text. No significant reading difficulties were encountered.

## Specific Uncertainties

### File 14 — "Militarism Menacing the American Government"
- **Issue:** The word "guiltles" (line from OCR: "ruin forever guiltles Dreyfus") appears to be an OCR error for "guiltless."
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR source reads "guiltles" which is almost certainly "guiltless" with a dropped final letter, possibly a scan artifact or original typo.
- **Transcribed as:** "guiltles Dreyfus" — preserved exactly as it appears in the OCR source, since we cannot confirm whether the error was in the original printing or introduced by OCR.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM — likely OCR artifact, but preserved as found pending verification against original PDF.

### File 14 — "Militarism Menacing the American Government"
- **Issue:** The word "franks" appears in "spent 30,000,000,000 franks in a quarter of a century." This should likely be "francs" (French currency).
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — the OCR reads "franks" but later in the same article "francs" is used correctly. The first instance may be an OCR misread or original misprint.
- **Transcribed as:** "franks" — preserved exactly as OCR source to reflect the original; later occurrence transcribed as "francs" as it appears.
- **Confidence:** LOW — likely OCR error for "francs"; recommend verification against original.

### File 09 — "A 'Christian Political Union' Called For"
- **Issue:** The article header on page 16 mentions "a national committee has been appointed, representing Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, California, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Alabama; and the Woman's Temple, in Chicago, has been selected as the national headquarters." This information appears only in the editorial notes section (page 16), not in the main article text on pages 1-2.
- **Resolution:** This detail was included in the editorial notes file (34_Editorial-Notes.md) rather than the main article, as it appears to be editorial commentary on the article rather than part of the article itself.
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Advertisements Skipped
- Pages 13-15 contain advertisements for: "The Peril of the Republic" (by Prof. P. T. Magan), "Pagan Counterfeits in the Christian Church" (by C. A. S. Temple), subscription information, Oxford Bible advertisement, Marked New Testament, Black Beauty, "A Friend in the Kitchen" cook book, "Health" by B. Franklin Richards. These were skipped as per instructions.
- Page 15: "A Unique Pen—The 'Post'" advertisement for fountain pen with Sentinel subscription offer — skipped as advertisement.

### "Don't Society" Item (File 26)
- The final sentence "—Another outgrowth of the Puritanical Sabbath idea, which is so prevalent in our days!—Lutheran Witness." appears to be an editorial comment appended to a quoted item from the Lutheran Witness. The attribution "Lutheran Witness" is somewhat ambiguous — it may be the source of the entire item or only the closing editorial comment. Transcribed as it appears.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
