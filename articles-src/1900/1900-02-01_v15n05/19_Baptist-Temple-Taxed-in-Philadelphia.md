THE Tax Board of Philadelphia has, it is said, placed on the tax list the Baptist Temple, of which Rev. Russell H. Conwell, the lecturer, is pastor. The ground of this action is the allegation that the church is used for promiscuous entertainments at which admission fees are charged. Upon which ground, as an exchange remarks, probably very few churches would be exempt from taxation.
