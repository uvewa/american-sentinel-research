The article which we reprint this week from the *Sabbath Recorder*, gives some recent history showing how Sunday laws which contain "the usual exemption" for observers of the seventh day, have worked in New Jersey. Read it.

As we note elsewhere in this issue, a great "Christian Political Union" is called for by representatives of the leading religious bodies in this country, and a meeting to inaugurate such an organization is to be held May 1, in Illinois. A national committee has been appointed, representing Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, California, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Alabama; and the Woman's Temple, in Chicago, has been selected as the national headquarters.

The "Blue-Law Sunday" has come to Baltimore, and in consequence, says a dispatch, "there is great excitement and worry among tradesmen." The announcement has been made that "the [Sunday] law will be carried out to the letter." Only motormen and trolley-car conductors will be allowed to work. "One newsdealer has prepared the following sign, which he will display on his store door Sunday: 'Closed on account of our great grandfathers' Blue Law and some fanatical hypocrites."

The Jewish nation rejected Christ because they were seeking a political saviour,—a saviour of the nation, from the Romans. Christ came as a personal Saviour and therefore they did not want him. And do we not see the same thing to-day, in the United States? Are not the religious bodies of the land calling for political salvation,—for salvation of the nation, through politics—more loudly than they are calling for personal salvation? And in this are they not rejecting Christ, as did the Jews? Verily they are. Jesus is not a political Saviour, but a Saviour of individuals "from their sins."

STATISTICS of Sunday labor in Minnesota furnished by Labor Commissioner McHale, show that only 9,889 persons habitually work on Sundays, and the amount of work done on Sundays is only about 25 per cent. of that done on week days, owing to shorter hours. In eating houses Sunday labor is 94 per cent. of week day labor, and in municipal work 96 per cent.; in drug stores, 75 per cent.; newspaper offices, 42 per cent.; railways, 33 per cent.

DR. PARKHURST, the foremost advocate of municipal "reform" in New York City, says he favors the opening of saloons during certain hours on Sundays for the sale of beer. But can Dr. Parkhurst, or any other reformer of similar views, give a logical reason why it is right to open a place of business a part of the day on Sunday, but wrong to keep it open throughout the day? And can anyone tell, also, why the line upon the sale of intoxicants should be drawn so as to allow the sale of beer, and prohibit the sale of other alcoholic drinks?

Do not skip the article published in this issue on the menace of militarism. The facts which it states ought to be in the minds of every American citizen. They are furnished by an intelligent Frenchman, who has had ample means of knowing the exact truth about the things of which he writes.

B. H. ROBERTS, polygamist, has been kept out of Congress, but at the cost, as many think, of "another hole in the Constitution." But another hole in the Constitution will hardly be noticed nowadays.

The question whether the Catholic friars are to be forced upon the people in the Philippines, says Archbishop Chapelle, will be settled by "the pope, General Otis, and myself." It is easy to forecast how the question will be settled under this arrangement.

RECENTLY a mass meeting under the auspices of several "patriotic orders" was held in Washington, D. C., for the purpose of considering the political encroachments of the papacy, at which resolutions were passed affirming the religious freedom of all citizens under the Constitution and their right under it to be exempt from taxation for the propagation of religious opinions; that this is a Protestant nation and that the Protestant religion is necessary to the preservation of the Constitution; and that no money ought to be paid out of the Treasury to Roman Catholic institutions, or Catholic chaplains appointed in the army and navy. And the Catholic Mirror points to these resolutions as being "so unique" that it gives them "for the amusement" of its readers. There was a time in American history when no intelligent journal would have referred to such resolutions as being "unique" in this country.

The resolutions do not go far enough. It is as bad to appropriate public funds for Protestant religious institutions as for those of the Catholics, and as bad to appoint Protestant chaplains for the army and navy, as to appoint Catholic chaplains. The principle of the proceeding is the same in both cases, and it is a papal principle.

"JUDGING from present results," remarks the Baltimore American, "another Peace Conference would about embroil the universe."
