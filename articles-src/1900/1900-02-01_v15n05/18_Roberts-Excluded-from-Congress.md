By a vote of 268 to 50, the House of Representatives at Washington voted to exclude Brigham H. Roberts, polygamist congressman-elect from Utah, from a seat in Congress. Mr. Roberts says that he will do nothing further in the matter, but that he believes the Utah district which elected him will make an appeal to the Supreme Court.
