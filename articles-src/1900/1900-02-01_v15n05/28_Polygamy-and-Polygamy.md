## Polygamy and Polygamy.

The Christian women of the United States are in arms against the admission of the member-elect from Utah, Mr. Roberts, to a seat in Congress. The objection urged is that he has a plurality of wives; that he is guilty of polygamy. Under the laws of the United States polygamy cannot exist in any State or Territory. Polygamy exists over the entire Sulu group. Sultan and slave practise it. Why are these horrible conditions permitted in possessions of the United States? Why get shocked at a single instance in this country when thousands and tens of thousands are practising it in Sulu under the approval and protection of the United States? —Cincinnati Enquirer.
