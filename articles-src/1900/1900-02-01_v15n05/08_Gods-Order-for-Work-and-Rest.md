GOD made the day for work, and the night for rest. He made the first six days of the week for the pursuance of secular affairs, and the seventh day for rest from secular labors, and the consideration of things spiritual. This is God's order and God's law. Men have been trying to improve upon it ever since it was instituted, but they have never succeeded, and never will.
