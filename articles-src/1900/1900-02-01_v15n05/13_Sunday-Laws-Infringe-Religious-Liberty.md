## Sunday Laws Infringe Religious Liberty, and Foster the Holidayism they Seek to Prevent.

From the "Sabbath Recorder," Plainfield, N. J. (Seventh-day Baptist).

Those who keep the Sabbath have reason to know the effects of Sunday legislation. Sunday laws, in America, have been oppressive toward Seventh-day Baptists for the last two hundred and twenty-five years. In the Colonial period there were but two places where Seventh-day Baptists could find any recognition of their rights as Sabbath-keepers: the Colony of Roger Williams and the Colony of William Penn. Hence, the first Seventh-day Baptist Church in America was organized at Newport, R. I., in 1671 A. D. The exemptions in favor of Sabbath-keepers, which have been embodied in some of the States since the Colonial period, are not a just recognition of religious freedom, and they have not been an efficient guard against wrongs done to Seventh-day Baptists at many times and in many ways. We know, also, that the Sunday laws intimidate people from following their conscientious convictions, and embracing the Sabbath.

These exemptions are not only insufficient to meet the demands of liberty of conscience, but they are illogical and inconsistent. They are based upon a false principle which compels the civil courts to condemn men, or acquit them, on directly religious issues. Thus an actual union of church and state takes place in every trial under these exemptions. Put into simple English these exemptions say: "If a man is conscientiously and consistently religious in his thoughts and actions on the Sabbath, he may disregard the Sunday law, within certain prescribed limits." This is "class legislation" of the most direct type, and founded on a religious test.

A test case of this kind was made in the city of Plainfield, N. J., about two years ago. A certain fruit-seller who closed his place on the Sabbath and opened it on Sunday was finally arrested for doing business in violation of the Sunday law. He was not charged with any illegal action except Sunday selling. The only question at issue was: Did he observe the Sabbath religiously enough, and conscientiously enough, to be granted the privilege of the exemption? The first jury disagreed. The second jury, made up of prominent Christian men, convicted, and he was fined twenty-five dollars. The decision of the jury was made upon the idea that since he did not belong to any Sabbath-keeping church, and did not attend church on that day, he was not entitled to the exemption. Other places of business kept open on Sunday by Sabbath-keepers were warned by the police during this "raid against Sabbath-breakers," and other arrests were made, but the prosecuting attorney decided that all, Jews or Christians, who kept the Sabbath sufficiently sacred, i. e., those who belonged to Sabbath-keeping churches, could not be prosecuted, if they did not "expose" their goods for sale, nor leave their own premises to conduct business. It was a clear case wherein the civil court decided what amount of religious conscience a man must express, in outward actions, on given days, in order to be entitled to exemption under the Sunday laws of New Jersey.

This is the logical and essential issue in every similar case. The exemption system is a clumsy compromise made to escape the charge of injustice and persecution in the case of those who have the conscientious bravery to regard God's law of the Sabbath, rather than man's law concerning Sunday. Those who favor Sunday laws, because of the exemption which is made in favor of Sabbath-keepers, in some States, foster an agency for persecution, and a system which compels an actual union of church and state in every civil court trial under those laws.

The conscientious friends of Sunday observance, who look carefully into the history and the effect of Sunday legislation, will find abundant reason to cast Sunday laws aside for the sake of genuine and permanent Sabbath reform. Sabbath observance is a religious and a Biblical question to be settled on conscientious convictions as to what God requires. Civil law has no right to interfere in such a question. There can be no "civil Sabbath." As well talk of a "civil baptism," or a "civil Lord's Supper." What is called a civil Sabbath, by some, can never be more than a civil holiday, and the history of Sunday shows that the holiday element is advanced and strengthened by the civil law. Reliance on Sunday laws has been a fruitful source of the growing and destructive holidayism which now abounds. Conscience grows only in the soil of divine authority, and of religious faith, based on the Word of God. The more the friends of Sunday appeal to civil law, the more will holidayism, and its evils, increase. It is a well known fact that the Sunday laws cannot be executed against people in general, and no efforts of value are made against large corporations and business interests.

Another important fact which temperance reformers ought to consider is that Sunday laws are a positive help to the saloons. All days of leisure are harvest days for the liquor traffic. Compulsory leisure without religious conscience, promotes dissipation, and thousands of people, who are compelled to be idle on Sunday, would be better off, by far, if they were at work. So long as the civil law classes the business of the saloon with other and legitimate businesses, the saloon will triumph when assailed for Sunday-selling by turning the law against other forms of business. Such legislation puts the whip in the hands of Rum.

The effect of reliance on Sunday laws destroys conscience on the part of religious people. When they give prominence to the civil law, and make strenuous efforts to secure its enforcement, unconsciously, perhaps, but certainly, they drift away from regard for the divine law. This has gone so far already that many Christian leaders now charge their fellow Christians with leading in the desecration of Sunday. This destructive state of things has been hastened by the popular falsehood that the Old Testament is only a "Jewish book," and that the Sabbath law is not binding on Christians. As Christians lose regard for Sunday, the irreligious and the non-religious masses go farther down into holidayism and dissipation. Hence it comes that Sunday laws hasten the holidayism which they have no power to restrain.

Such disastrous results have been made certain because of the origin of Sunday legislation. No such system ever escapes from the fundamental elements out of which it is born. Sunday legislation is the direct product of the pagan State Church of the Roman Empire. The first Sunday edict of Constantine, emperor of Rome, was pagan in form, in spirit and in fact. Here it is:

"Let all judges, and all city people, and all trades men, rest upon the venerable day of the Sun. But let those dwelling in the country freely and with full liberty attend to the culture of their fields; since it frequently happens that no other day is so fit for the sowing of grain or the planting of vines; hence the favorable time should not be allowed to pass, lest the provisions of heaven be lost."—Cod. Justin III. Tit. 12, L. 3.

Nearly two generations of men passed before this pagan law was re-enacted in a modified form, in which the first distinctively Christian elements appear.

In view of these and many similar facts, we plead with Christians to place the Sabbath question on a purely religious and Biblical basis. To refuse to do this is non-Protestant. It savors of disloyalty to Christ. If Christ's practise and teachings are not competent authority on the Sabbath question, there can be no such authority. He established the Christian Sabbath, and it was the seventh day of the week.

For the sake of religious liberty, of justice, and of true reform, the Sabbath question should be removed from the field of politics and civil law, and left where the law of God and the example of Christ left it: to the Bible and Christian conscience. A great and grave issue confronts the Protestants of the United States in the matter of Sabbath reform. That issue involves the permanency of public worship, of religious culture, and of conscience toward the Word of God. Final disaster may be delayed, but it cannot be evaded. Hence this plea.
