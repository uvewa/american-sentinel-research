Good government is among the highest of human aspirations. Politically speaking, it is the very highest. But no government other than self government can by any possibility be or ever become good. It may be stable—as stable as the government of the czar. It may be peaceful—as peaceful as the government of a prison. It may be good government in the estimation of the privileged classes. But it cannot be good in the only sense in which unselfish and truly religious and patriotic men have a right to call government good. New York in the worst days of Tweed was better governed than Warsaw in the best days of the order that reigned there.—Sel.
