## Militarism Menacing the American Government.

### AS SEEN BY A FRENCH REPUBLICAN AND AUTHOR, URBAIN GOHIER.

*From "The Independent."*

The emotions caused by the success of the war with Spain have kindled a certain warlike fever in the great American Republic; the fêtes which were a short while ago inaugurated in honor of a glorious Admiral raised this enthusiasm to a still higher point. It is thus all the more necessary that the free citizens of the United States should not lose sight of the reality which lies in the perils of a military crisis. Assuredly it is not the business of a foreigner to urge his advice at such a moment. And yet it may well be permitted to a Frenchman to recall that his forefathers sustained the first steps made by the other side of the Atlantic in its struggles for liberty; it may also well be granted that a Frenchman who sees liberty so compromised in his own country should hope that it will remain intact in the New World. The trials which France is undergoing today and the evils which threaten her, because she is sacrificing herself to the militarist idol, may serve the cause of political liberty in America as much as the material succor long ago rendered by the companions of Lafayette.

Imperialism is intoxicating at present a large part of the two great English-speaking nations. Imperialism cannot be conceived of without militarism, which is its instrument. Even the most liberal of the citizens of the United States know the terrible consequences of militarism only by an effort of intuition and reason, since their country so far has had the good fortune to be saved from it. Let them open their eyes and let them consider what is taking place in France: they will tremble. They will see what militarism has made of a nation formerly famous in the world for its spirit of justice, human and fraternity. The Anglo-Saxons, at this end of nineteenth century, seem to offer, in the midst of races, the true type of man in the highest degree of energy, activity and courage. I have often asked myself whether this were the case because they had escaped militarism, or whether they had always turned their backs on militarism because they were such men. Whatever be the answer, it is certain that the Anglo Saxon would lose all that makes his strength and originality if, like Continental Europeans, he allowed himself to be degraded and debased by the military scourge.

France was, in the world's opinion, the country of the declaration of the rights of the man and citizen; she had carried to their conclusion all the generous principles put forward by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Jefferson in the preamble of your own Declaration of Independence. She was to remain the apostle of human progress. Yet see her after a hundred years torn asunder by plots and seditions, borne down by prodigious burdens, dismembered of two fair provinces, threatened by civil war, powerless without, buried in fanaticism and barbarity—why? Because she is the prey of militarism.

The militarist idea was planted in France by the long wars of the First Empire. A brigand of genius, at the head of our armies, killed four million men, pillaged, burnt, sacked Europe from one end to the other, while at the same time he was reducing the French people to the basest servitude. To fool the world, and also to delude herself, France gave the name of Glory to the crimes of Napoleon. She was stunned with this sham glory, and with it she poisoned the soul of generations, giving a subordinate place to the studies and the arts which had formerly gained for her her finest prestige, valuing henceforth only the triumphs of arms. In seeking these triumphs she met the awful disasters of 1870. And by a funeral chance the very catastrophe which should have forever disgusted her with the military folly made her more blindly and puerilely the adorer of the soldier, of the uniform, of the barracks and of all of the farce and paraphernalia of war. France transformed herself into a vast camp, burdened herself with huge taxes, spent 30,000,000,000 franks in a quarter of a century, in order to parade a few hundred thousand men up and down the Continent of Europe, drove herself to economic ruin, to intellectual decay, to moral feebleness and to political anarchy.

Examine the facts still closer. What has happened in France shows you what would be fatally sure to happen in any other great republic deluded into the same errors.

To begin with the effects of militarism from the soldier's standpoint. Since the soldiers in a vast army make up a large part or even the whole of the youth of a country, the effects of militarism on them are reflected on the whole nation. Thus it is that militarism makes such ravages in the social, intellectual, economic and moral orders. Formerly the French soldiers served seven years: since the establishment of a universal obligatory service he has served five years, then three. The sons of the rich class, through different pretexts, more or less worthy, manage to leave the barracks at the end of a year; but the sons of the farmers, of the workmen and the whole laboring class of the nation remain three years in the army. The men who get off with the service of one year escape the necessity of serving in the colonial wars; the victims of three years' service furnish all the prey of the murderous expeditions into Africa and the Far East. This fact, alone, shows a revolting inequality in society which pretends to be democratic. But the barracks are a source of evil still more fearful. During three years, far from their parents, unable to engage in any intellectual occupation, with nothing to suggest a single elevated thought, the unhappy young men, from twenty to twenty-three years of age, stagnate in the midst of the greatest physical dirt and in the extremest of moral degradation. They forget there all they learned that would be practical in the exercise of a profession and everything that would develop them into healthy, honest men. They contract the habits of idleness, moral inertia and of low debauch. The barracks are the hearthstone of alcoholism and of the shameful diseases which are spread all through the country to the very heart of the rural districts, bastardizing the race and decimating the population.

Loose discipline, the fear of initiative and responsibilities, the attempt to avoid disciplinary punishments by all sorts of ruses, make the barracks, moreover, the very school of lying, hypocrisy and moral chaos. It is impossible for a human being to come out from such surroundings after a three years' sojourn without having lost all sense of shame and those moral qualities which should give him his value and dignity as a man and his significance as a citizen. The young industrial workman no longer knows his trade; the young farmer, after having loafed so long in the wine shops of garrison towns, no longer desires to return to the soil, and agriculture is abandoned. The sons of the better class, having hastily and slovenly acquired the diplomas which allow them to leave the army sooner, are really acquainted thoroughly with no branch of knowledge. The economic equilibrium of the nation is therefore destroyed, and at the same time its moral and intellectual strength is ruined. Do not for a moment think that in these forlorn conclusions there is any exaggeration; you will find them developed by every writer politician or novelist who has studied the matter: they are also found, if I may speak of it, in "The Army Against the Nation," my book, for which I was prosecuted by the French Government at the beginning of last year, and honorably acquitted by the jury, as having told only the truth.

The political consequences of militarism prove equally terrible, on the other hand, when we consider the character, the sentiments, of the military chiefs, officers, subaltern, superior officers and generals of different rank.

Forming, as they do, a compact and solid body, being the absolute chiefs of the one armed force existing in an unarmed nation, they make up a feudality arrogant, violent and ready for every sort of sedition. Rich personally, or through the families with which they are connected, they become the natural instrument and agents of all the forces of reaction and social oppression. They have made the national republican army a tool in the service of capitalistic oppression and papal reaction. In an army which has never been tried on the field professional merits are not and cannot be known; therefore advancement comes from powerful connections, through money, intrigue and guilty services rendered to powerful castes. The high grades are the entire monopoly of a few dynasties or coteries, of their kindred or of their fawning creatures. Carrying arms in the midst of a peaceful, unarmed people, they live as though in a conquered territory, drawing their swords on every occasion, encouraging the violence of intoxicated young soldiers, terrorizing the population in all the little towns, where the democratic element is not numerous enough or sufficiently strong to oppose them.

They are a State within a State. They have their peculiar code of justice, and they proclaim "that it does not resemble the other code." . . . They have their special laws, their private prisons, where tortures unknown even among the redskins are inflicted on unhappy youths guilty of the merest peccadillo. They represent savagery in the bosom of civilization. Their judges condemn by order of chiefs, absolve by order of their chiefs, declare innocent a rascal protégé like Esterhazy, and ruin forever guiltles Dreyfus; or rather, and above all, their activity is directed toward defying the civil power, strengthening their contempt for civil law, of the government of the nation.

They have a special honor among them, also, which they call "the honor of the army," or "military honor," and which they insolently parade before the eyes of the disgusted world. I do not pretend to rehearse here the history of the Dreyfus affair, as well known in the United States as in France. But I insist upon this point—namely, that it presents a résumé, a synthesis, of defects which, hitherto known only by a restricted public, are now thrown out in strong light for the edification of the whole world. There were forgeries and perjury, false testimony, lying, rascality, assassination and every variety of crime continually and openly furnished by the Major Staff, by twenty generals and a hundred officers of various grades. What is worse still, there was the sight of the whole army backing these rascals, knowing them to be rascals, in order to establish firmly the principle that a criminal clothed in a uniform is out of the reach of national justice, superior to the nation that pays him. The entire body of 22,000 officers, among whom there are very probably 20,000 honest individuals, took sides for the crime and the criminals against civil justice, against the nation.

Just as these officers have their peculiar justice, their special honor, so they have their peculiar kind of conscience, which allows them to be guilty of extortion, theft, violence and massacre in the four corners of our colonial empire, where rank and honors are acquired by plundering inoffensive population. . . . From colonies where prevails a system of military brigandage our officers and our soldiers come back to us with the feelings and manners of savages, drunk with luxury, with cupidity and alcohol, ready to put citizens to the sword at the first call of a seditious leader and gaining experience in this kind of activity by continual aggressions. Major Marchand, who caused France the humiliation of Fashoda, enjoys a powerful popularity in the army because he burned some villages and shot more women in the Sudan than any of his predecessors.

According to the terms of our republican constitution, the people's representatives appropriate money for the public expenses; they control the disbursements of sums furnished by the revenue. During twenty-five years they have voted 30,000,000,000 francs credit for military expenses; they have never obtained any accounts or auditor's reports of the manner of expenditure of this huge sum. For form's sake they send to the Ministers lists of expenses and the Ministers communicate them to Parliament; but it is known and loudly proclaimed that these lists are false, and that the Budget Committee repeats each year, with sadness and resignation, that it is impossible for France to know what the military administration does with its money. The powerless representatives of the people vote all the credits that the military power demands, in order that future catastrophes should not be attributed to their resistance. And the military power says to itself that these future catastrophes will relieve it of the necessity of turning in accounts. It uses the billions, meant for the national defense, first in filling the pockets of the great chiefs and powerful commissariats, then in preparing rebellions from which a dictatorship is bound to come.

Extortion, trickery and military theft—I have filled two thick volumes with accounts of all this, and yet have chosen only the characteristic features of army abuses in France, basing all that I have said on official documents. . . . The Government never punishes the guilty person or the guilty officer beyond inflicting a timid reprimand or some ridiculous little penalty.

At present twelve million French citizens live in terror of the twenty thousand petty military employees whom they support; the normal development of the French democracy is paralyzed, its very existence is compromised, by the threatening attitude of its army. And this army is an army which has never gotten over the humiliating defeats it has suffered, and which, on the contrary, is stained by the most wretched failures. What would it be on the morrow of the smallest military success?

I leave this situation for the meditation of the citizens of any country which is careful of the dignity of its men and its own greatness.

Paris, France.
