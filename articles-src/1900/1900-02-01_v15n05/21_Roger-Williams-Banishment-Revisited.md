THE Massachusetts legislature is again wrestling with the question of revoking the sentence of perpetual banishment against Roger Williams, passed by the General Court of Massachusetts in 1635. Last year a motion to this end was brought before the legislature, but the session closed before due time could be had for its consideration.

The principal "reason" for the banishment of Roger Williams was that he denied the right of the civil magistrate to interfere in matters of religious belief and observance. This fact has been duly set before the House Committee on Judiciary by the author of the present motion, and it is hoped the Massachusetts authorities will be satisfied with the two and a half centuries of his sentence which Roger Williams has now served, and see fit to remove the ban.
