## Following Rome.

A GREAT revival effort is in progress in Brooklyn, and with the effort to reach the unconverted masses, there is naturally much discussion of the question of the best means by which this can be done. And one of the clergymen having the effort in charge, a prominent revivalist from Atlanta, Ga., Rev. L. D. Broughton by name, is reported as having expressed himself on this question as follows:—

"Religion is going backward. The power it once had is diminishing. The people of less intelligent ages were guided by God in all their actions. Now the church has no power.

"It is the fault of the church, too. Ministers are at a standstill. They are slowly losing their power. As a drawing card the church ranks only sixth in the list of public attractions. It should be made to rank first.

"How do I rank public attractions? First, theaters; second, prize-fights; third, cake-walks; fourth, kissing parties; fifth, dances; sixth, churches; seventh, funerals.

"That list shows that the church must be made as attractive as the theater and the cake-walk. Something must be done to bring the people into the churches, not on Sundays, but every day of the week. To do this we must make the church both a business proposition and a place of attraction.

"Too little stress is placed on the word 'business.' The saving of souls for the Lord is just as much of a business as manipulating the markets of Wall Street.

"There are 10,000 people who will pay $20,000 for theaters before they will enter a church and give five cents to God. There are 50,000 men who would pay $1,000,000 to see a prize-fight and would insult any one who would ask them to give 25 cents apiece for religion.

"There are 20,000 women who would pay $10,000,000 for dresses for fashion who would not take the trouble to get up early enough on Sunday to attend church.

"I want to see the man who can doubt that statement.

"First of all, it behooves every minister to make his church as attractive as possible. It cannot be called sensationalism. It is merely putting God at the head of all things, where he belongs.

"If it is necessary to bring people to church, we ministers might even go so far as to have a service where the biograph could be introduced with Biblical pictures and with other pictures, too.

"For the men who put prize-fighting ahead of God, we might go so far as to have a few rounds of boxing before each service.

"Perhaps a one-act comedy might induce the theatrically inclined to stay until the sermon was over.

"Then, to attract many others, we might turn the church into a temporary café, where we might serve soft drinks between prayers.

"If this were done how quickly the sinners would see the difference between the paths that lead to God and the paths that lead to worldly delights.

"I used to like to dance. I liked to go to theaters, and I liked many other things—except church; but once there came a power into my heart and I saw that no man could indulge in the frivolities of life and be a power with God.

"And I never danced or went to the theater again.

"Theaters, cards, kissing parties, prize-fights, cakewalks, and fashion, all mingled into one unharmonious whole, engage the people. They engage the people so strongly that they do not feel the power of God—not until their dissipated lives are waning and they are dying.

"If God is good enough to save the dying man, what wouldn't he do for the man in the prime of life, if that man would only appeal to him?

"Just tell the people I am serious. My one object is to combine the church with business and pleasure, so that sinners may be saved!"

All this is, in principle, just what was done by the church in the early centuries, to make Christianity attractive to the unconverted heathen. There were those in the church then, just as there are now, who saw the "necessity" of doing something to make the house of God a place of attraction for the heathen world. And according, various doctrines and ceremonies were devised with this end in view, and the result was, in their view, highly successful. The heathen were attracted, and flocked into the churches in vast numbers. But instead of being converted to God by the church, the outcome was that the church herself became heathen. Having lowered herself to the plane of heathenism to save the heathen, she was unable to raise herself back to the plane of Christianity; she became as much lost as were the heathen.

And to day, the same principle is no less true. The church can lower herself to the world's level, but she cannot lift herself back to the level of godliness. Instead of saving the world, she can by such means only bring upon herself the necessity of repentance and humiliation before God for the sin of backsliding.

The church of Rome succeeded in making herself attractive to worldly-minded people; and she has retained this attracting power ever since. And while the Protestant churches are confessing that their hold on the people is departing, and seeking in every way to devise attractions for catching and holding the worldly classes, no such necessity is felt by the church of Rome. That church is not losing her hold upon the people. This is a fact which any person can observe for himself.

When Protestant pastors, therefore, begin to study to devise means for making the church a competitor with the theaters, and other worldly shows in attracting the pleasure-loving masses, they are only engaged upon a problem which the church of Rome has solved, and of which she holds the only solution. It would shorten the work and give the result they are seeking, if they would at once make the papal system their model.

But Christianity does not seek to please the worldly-minded. It offers the power of God to transform the mind, and when that is done, the further removed the church is from the level of worldly shows and amusements, the more attractive will it be to that individual. Christianity can make no compromise with the world.
