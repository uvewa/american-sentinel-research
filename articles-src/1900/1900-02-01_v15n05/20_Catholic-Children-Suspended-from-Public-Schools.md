FROM Harrisburg, Pa., it is reported that about fifty pupils of the public schools at McDonald, Washington County, have been suspended for refusing to join in the religious exercises with which the schools in that place are opened. They are children of Roman Catholic parents. The Catholics, of course, object on religious grounds, and their objection to religious exercises in the schools they are taxed to support, is a very proper one. An appeal has been made by them to the Department of Public Instruction.
