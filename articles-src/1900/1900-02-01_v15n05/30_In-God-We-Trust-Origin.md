"In God We Trust."

ORIGIN OF THIS INSCRIPTION ON UNITED STATES COIN.

MR. PRESTON, director of the mint, has run down the origin of the motto, "In God We Trust," to be found on our coins. It appears the first suggestion of such a motto came probably from W. R. Watkinson, of Ridleyville, Penn., who signed himself a "minister of the gospel." His letter to Secretary Chase on the subject was dated November 13, 1861. He said:—

"You are probably a Christian. What if our Republic were now shattered beyond reconstruction? Would not the antiquaries of succeeding centuries rightly reason from our past that we were a heathen nation? What I propose is that instead of the Goddess of Liberty we shall have next inside the thirteen stars a ring inscribed with the words 'perpetual union;' within this ring the all-seeing eye, crowned with a halo; beneath this eye the American flag, bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the States united; in the folds of the bars the words, 'God, liberty, law.' This would make a beautiful coin, to which no possible citizen could object. This would relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism. This would place us openly under the divine protection we have personally claimed. From my heart I have felt our national shame in disowning God as not the least of our present national disasters. To you first I address a subject that must be agitated."

Whether moved by this letter or not, Secretary Chase wrote as follows on November 20, a week later, to the director of the mint in Philadelphia: "No nation can be strong except in the strength of God or safe except in his defense. The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins. You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible this national recognition."

As it was found that the director of the mint had no authority over the mottoes to be placed on our coins, Congress having by a law passed in 1837 provided for them, he prepared his designs and submitted them to the secretary. The mottoes suggested were "Our Country;" "Our God," and "God Our Trust." In reply, the secretary wrote: "I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that the first should begin with 'Our God,' so as to read 'Our God and Our Country,' and that the motto on the shield should be changed so as to read instead of 'God Our Trust,' 'In God We Trust.'"

An act passed April 22, 1864, changing the composition of the 1-cent piece and authorizing the coinage of the 2-cent piece. It provided also that the devices of the coins should be fixed by the director of the mint with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. In accordance with this provision the motto "In God We Trust," was placed on the new bronze 2-cent piece. By other acts it was provided that it should be placed on certain silver and gold coins.—Sel.
