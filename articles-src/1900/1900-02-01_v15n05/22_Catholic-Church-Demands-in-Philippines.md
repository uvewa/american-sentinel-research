ACCORDING to press reports, the Catholic Church, through Archbishop Nozaleda, of Manila, makes these demands for the church in the Philippines:—

1. That the titles to all property held by the church and religious orders shall be conceded.
2. Indirect contributions for the maintenance of the church and clergy.
3. Revenues to be collected from births, marriages, funeral dispensations, and apostolic indulgences.
4. Church control of cemeteries, hospitals and pawn-shops.
5. Church control of the parishes free from all state interference, and the teaching of the Catholic catechism in all primary schools.

Modest demands, truly; and quite characteristic of the papacy in foreign lands.
