A "Don't Society" has been formed in Brooklyn, with branches in various places. Its motto is, "Down with Sunday newspapers, Sunday street cars, Sunday letters and other Sunday institutions." The members pledge themselves for one year or longer, to the following: "Don't ride simply for pleasure on Sunday, don't (save in an ocean voyage) ride in a public conveyance on Sunday, don't read a Sunday newspaper on Sunday, don't buy anything on Sunday, except in an emergency, and don't mail letters on Sunday."—Another outgrowth of the Puritanical Sabbath idea, which is so prevalent in our days!—Lutheran Witness.
