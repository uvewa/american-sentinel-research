A great anti-trust convention is called for by prominent men of all localities and all parties, to be held in Chicago, February 12. The call sets forth some of the well-known evils of the trusts, and declares that "unless they are overthrown there will be established in free America a moneyed oligarchy on the one hand and a serfdom of the masses of the people on the other. They must be destroyed or free government is lost."

"This herculean task," it affirms, "can be accomplished only by the organization of the lovers of freedom in every part of the Republic, and through the persistent and determined efforts of a united people." To which end it invites the attendance of "patriotic citizens from all States and Territories."

The wicked principle of the trust system is the placing of power in the hands of one man, or of a few men, to which they are not entitled. The most dangerous monster of which the human imagination could conceive would be a fallible, sinful man, endowed with unlimited power; and in proportion as the power of a few men (which wealth gives them) increases beyond the proportion of their importance as members of society, in that proportion do they become a menace to society, to be put under the ban of law if possible. No man can safely be entrusted with inordinate power.
