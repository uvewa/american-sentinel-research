# Liberty Necessary to Self-Government.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

One remarkable statement in that remarkable, imperialistic speech of Senator Beveridge, in the Senate, Jan. 9, 1900, is worthy of more than a passing notice. It is this: "Liberty does not always mean self-government;" and given in full, reads as follows:

"Let men beware how they employ the term 'self-government.' It is a sacred term. It is the watchword at the door of the inner temple of liberty; for liberty does not always mean self-government. Self-government is a method of liberty—the highest, simplest, best, —and it is acquired only after centuries of study and struggle and experiment and instruction, and all the elements of the progress of man. Self-government is no base and common thing, to be bestowed on the merely audacious. It is the degree which crowns the graduate of liberty, not the name of liberty's infant class, who have not yet mastered the alphabet of freedom."

Like much of his speech, this is not altogether true, nor altogether false. When dealing with principles it is best to be careful of our conclusions. It is true that "Self-government is no base and common thing." It is true that "it is a sacred term." But self-government is not "a method of liberty." Neither is it "the degree" to be bestowed upon "the graduate of liberty."

On the contrary, self-government is the result of liberty. This is most emphatically so. No man can govern himself while under the hand of oppression. He must first be made free—set at liberty. He must be absolutely free so far as any restraint that would call for self-government in the interest of, or at the dictates of another man. It must be self-government of one's self and for one's self. A man must be at liberty to govern himself in his own interests, and that without dictation.

This was why our fathers asked that King George should remove his oppressive hand and leave the interests of the struggling American people in their own hands,—leave the people so far removed from the mother country to work out their own destinies, in proving to the world that if men were left at liberty, they could govern themselves in their own interests far better than others could do this for them. England refused to allow the experiment. And she is now, true to her history and policy, refusing the same thing in South Africa.

It is a matter of history that England was humbled in the New World, and compelled to abandon her policy of oppression; and she may yet be humbled in the Southern world. And, judging the future alone in the light of the past, this nation will yet be humbled in the very dust because she is denying to other weak people the same rights which she once claimed for herself.
