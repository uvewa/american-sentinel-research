It is reported that "orthodox" kidnapping of the children of dissenters still continues in Russia. At Jurieff, two couples have been sentenced to two months' imprisonment "for not having brought up their children in the Greek Orthodox faith," and the children were handed over to relatives belonging to the Established Church, or, in default, to the government, for education. Thereby the "Greek Orthodox faith" of Russia declares itself non-Christian, to say the least; for Jesus said, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not." John 12:47.—Present Truth (London).
