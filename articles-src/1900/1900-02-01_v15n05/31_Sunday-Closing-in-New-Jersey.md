## Sunday Closing in New Jersey.

THE MAYOR OF ENGLEWOOD CHAMPIONS THE SUNDAY LAW.

New York "World," Jan. 22.

MAYOR E. A. Brinkerhoff, of Englewood, recently defeated in his endeavor to close candy stores and ice-cream parlors Sunday, is now prodding the butchers and barbers. He has sent out long circulars to these businessmen, the contents of which astonish the mayor's most intimate friends. He says there is a little excuse for butchers doing business Sunday mornings and adds:

"The barber question is not so easily disposed of, for while cleanliness is akin to godliness, a clean shave is more in the nature of a luxury than a necessity, but it is a requirement of the many and often deemed essential to needed comfort."

The circular then branches off thus:—

"The world is eager and active for gain, and evil connived at will soon take the reins in its own hands and bid defiance to all control; but when rightly and firmly opposed it fades away before reproof and opposition.

"There is a problem of Sabbath observance in every century, and the problem apparently grows more intricate and bewildering as with the advance of civilization it seemingly becomes a foe to Christianity. Yet the main structural principles of society are simple, and remain the same for every age.

"The great outstanding fact is that the Almighty claims one day in seven as his. The arguments for such a Sabbath are many. Those chiefly urged in public are considerations which relate to man's physical recuperation after the week-day toil, or to a periodic pleasuring. In the Bible view the Sabbath is not a holiday, but a holy day.

"The Sunday laws, if properly and judiciously enforced, would bring a blessing to any community, not necessarily interfering with individual rights or comfort, but giving to all the required example that the one day in seven has a divine guaranty of man's being set apart from a mere existence for toil or pleasure.

"If not by force of circumstances enabled to appropriate the whole of the Sabbath day as the Almighty intended, as much of it as possible should be freed from worldly labor."

Mayor Brinkerhoff is an officer of the Englewood Presbyterian Church.

The butchers and barbers did not change their rules yesterday.

It appears also that the mayor issued a call for a conference of certain business men regarding the Sunday-closing crusade, which was responded to, says the World, by "seven butchers and one fish dealer." "The session was a private one;" and "one indignant resident who was refused admission said: 'Why don't the mayor practise what he preaches about the old Blue Law. Let him stop riding in his carriage on Sunday and allow the servants to cook the Sunday dinner on Saturday. The people of Englewood are disgusted with his preaching.'"
