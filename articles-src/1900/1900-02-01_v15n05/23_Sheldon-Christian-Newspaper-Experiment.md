MUCH interest has been excited in religious circles throughout the country by the announcement that the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, who has achieved fame as the author of "In His Steps," is to have entire charge for one week of the Topeka Daily Capital, in March next, for the purpose of showing just what a Christian newspaper ought to be. It will be edited and managed solely with reference to the question, "What Would Jesus Do?" The work is to be done—so it is intended—just as Jesus Christ himself would do it. Mr. Sheldon is to assume charge of the paper March 13.

This unique innovation ought to afford an example of great practical value, from a religious point of view, and is no doubt anticipated with this thought in mind. But alas! already the effect is spoiled by the announcement that the paper will be printed on Sunday! A press dispatch dated at Topeka the 22d inst., says:—

"The Rev. Charles M. Sheldon will close his 'religious daily' experiment with a Sunday issue of the Capital.

"He will explain editorially that he cannot jeopardize the business of the paper by suspending publication on Sunday. The paper will be printed and circulated Sunday morning as usual."

If this announcement be true, we anticipate a storm of hostile criticism upon Mr. Sheldon's idea of a Christian daily newspaper.
