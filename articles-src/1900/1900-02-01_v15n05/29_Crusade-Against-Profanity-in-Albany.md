A crusade against profanity has been started in Albany, N. Y. The New York Journal gives this account of the undertaking:—

"ALBANY, N. Y., Jan. 14.—Bridled tongues will be the rule in Albany if a crusade against cursing and swearing, started by the Holy Name Society, is successful. Municipal aid is to be asked, and it is expected that the police will be directed to enforce the law against profanity in public places.

"Harmanus Bleecker Hall was crowded to-night with an audience enthusiastic in support of the crusade. Bishop Burke, Mayor Blessing, former Senator Amasa J. Parker, and others spoke. Mayor Blessing said the movement would have the co-operation of the city authorities.

"Resolutions were adopted declaring that profanation of God's holy name has become so prevalent and common among all classes of people that it is a disgrace to this enlightened age and reflects scandal upon a Christian community. The practise of cursing and swearing, the resolution set forth, has become so habitual that the most ordinary conversation is not indulged in without the profanation of God's name in almost every syllable, and the habit of indulgence in indecent conversation by grown people has spread to such an alarming extent among children that it disgusts people even on the public streets.

"It was resolved that the members of the several Catholic societies of the city of Albany and citizens present pledge themselves to further every effort in the future to check the spread of profanity and indecent speech and to aid the municipal authorities in any effort that shall be made toward preventing cursing and swearing on the public streets."

The question may be raised, What constitutes swearing? And it should be remembered, that different answers would be given to it by Protestants and Catholics. In Catholic countries it is a gross offense to speak disrespectfully of the Virgin Mary, or of the State religion. The question is a religious one, and therefore one which the civil authority cannot settle. In attempting to settle it the civil authority goes out of its proper sphere and establishes a precedent from which much evil is liable to result.
