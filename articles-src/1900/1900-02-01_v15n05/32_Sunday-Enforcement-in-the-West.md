## Sunday Enforcement in the West.

### COLVILLE, WASHINGTON, TRIES THE EFFECT OF SUNDAY CLOSING.

COLVILLE, WASH., Jan. 8.—Sunday closing was put into execution in Colville yesterday with a vengeance, and Colville is now known and designated as a closed town. Several weeks ago the religious element thrust the issue by circulating a petition, in the form of an agreement, whereby all who signed promised faithfully to abide by the Sunday-closing law and shut up shop after the first day of January. After reconsidering the matter, a number of the signers published a notice of withdrawal, but many of the business men still left their names undisturbed on the petition. The paper was this week placed in the hands of the sheriff of the county, with the request that he forthwith enforce the Sunday law. Pursuant to his duty as an officer, Sheriff E. M. Denny prepared a written notice to all business men to close on Sunday and served a copy upon each and every business man in town.

In order to render the picture ridiculous a number of the sportive element on Saturday night built a rail fence across each end of Main Street, the better to impress the inhabitants from the neighboring country that business was to be suspended on Sunday. Boards were also nailed across the doors of the several churches of the town. While this was considered a huge joke, the church people took it seriously to heart, and it remains to be seen what the result will be in case a violation of the law is detected.
