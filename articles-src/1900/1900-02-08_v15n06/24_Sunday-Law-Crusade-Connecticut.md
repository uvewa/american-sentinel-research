**Blue Law Invoked to Stop Recreation on Lake Whitney Near New Haven.**

NEW HAVEN, CONN., Jan. 28.—The town officials of Hamden, a suburb near this city, to-day resurrected a Blue Law to put a stop to Sunday skating on Lake Whitney, and there was a clash between the town constables and the several hundred skaters there, among whom were a number of Yale students. The sport has been permitted every Sunday up to to-day. The constables undertook to drive the skaters from the lake, but the officials found themselves in such a hopeless minority that they gave it up. Now the people who were interfered with intend, if possible, to invoke by way of retaliation another Blue Law that makes it illegal for the Hamden milkmen to deliver milk on Sunday in this city.
