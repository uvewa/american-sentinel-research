At this writing there is civil war in Kentucky, in the very center of the United States. The governor-elect, Goebel, lies dangerously wounded by the bullet of an assassin, fired from a window of the executive mansion. Governor Taylor, who claims to have been re-elected, has assembled the State militia about the capital to prevent the session of the legislature, and by proclamation has adjourned that body to meet in a town where only his partisans would be free to act. The legislature, which is in favor of Goebel, are trying to find a place of assembly, but are kept back by the State troops. Meanwhile, Governor elect Goebel has been sworn in, and has issued a proclamation directing the militia to disperse. Thus there are two rival governments in the State, one supported by the legislature, the courts, and the constitution, and the other by the bullets and bayonets of the troops. It is hoped the situation can be overcome without bloodshed; but all parties are armed in anticipation of an outbreak which will bring the full realities of civil war.

There is talk of the possible need of Government troops to deal with the situation; but the Washington authorities deprecate such an idea, and no Government troops will be sent until it becomes evident that the State cannot preserve order and republican government by the means at its command. And yet these same Washington authorities have deemed it necessary to send troops to the other side of the earth—to the far-off island of Luzon—on the plea that the people there do not know how to govern themselves, and are not entitled to have a chance to show whether they can govern themselves or not. If there must be a protectorate over the people of a foreign land to preserve order and keep them from fighting each other, why not a protectorate over the State of Kentucky for the same reason?

It makes no difference what white men may do—how much ignorance, barbarity, or general disregard of civilization they may display—so far as concerns their right to govern themselves. That right is not yet called in question, in America, where white men are concerned. Yet if the principles which defend human rights are set aside on account of another race of men, it cannot be long before the rights of white men are subverted by the same influences. For all human rights stand upon one and the same foundation.
