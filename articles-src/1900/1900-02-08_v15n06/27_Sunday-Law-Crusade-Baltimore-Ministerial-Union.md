### THE BALTIMORE MINISTERIAL UNION GIVE THANKS FOR THE CRUSADE.

BALTIMORE, Jan. 29.—The ridicule called forth by yesterday's enforcement of the antiquated Blue Laws was reflected in to-day's meeting of the Ministerial Union. The discussion was started by a resolution offered by the Rev. Dr. Julius E. Grammar, that "This association hails with gratitude to the Almighty the action which has been taken by the municipal authorities of this city for the more sacred observance of the Lord's day."

The Rev. C. E. Guthrie was not enthusiastic. He said the Sunday newspaper, the cab driver, and the soda fountain, to which the police had generally devoted their energies, were not the issues. He suggested that the old law might be modified.

Then there was a motion to include the mayor and police commissioners in the vote of thanks, but some did not think the police commissioners deserved to be included, while others thought they would be justified in feeling insulted if they were not. Dr. Grammer suggested that they settle it by just "thanking God." This was done amid laughter.

The foregoing are press statements taken from New York City dailies.
