THAT WAS FOR CONQUEST, that is, merely or chiefly to increase possessions, are nothing more than robbery is clear to everyone but those who are to reap the benefits. The course of Christian nations through the ages, which have fought to get land or make opportunities for trade, has been as indefensible as that of those who have done so to get slaves, and down to within the memory of men now living all three were united in almost every war for conquest.—N. Y. Christian Advocate.
