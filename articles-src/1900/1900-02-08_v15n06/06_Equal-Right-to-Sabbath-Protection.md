One man has the same right to "protection" in the observance of the Sabbath that another man has; the observer of the seventh day has a right to the same protection that is accorded the observer of the first day. And the first-day observer has no right to more "protection" in the observance of the Sabbath than can be justly claimed by the seventh-day observer.
