**Toledo Clergymen Waiting for More "Ammunition."**

TOLEDO, Jan. 29 —Worsted in their battle against the Sunday theaters, the Toledo clergymen do not propose to abandon the fight. At next Sunday's services the congregations in all Protestant churches represented in the Pastors' Union will be asked for contributions to the Sunday law enforcement fund. It is proposed not to strike a blow until the fund is ample to meet the expenses of a crusade against both the Sunday theater and the Sunday saloon.
