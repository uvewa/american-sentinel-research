There is, it is said, a strong feeling in many minds in Great Britain against the war, and many more who favor the continuance of the war believe that too great a cost has already been paid for all the advantages to be gained. It is probable that had this cost been anticipated at the outset, the war would not have been undertaken. But having been begun, it must go on now to the bitter end, even though the people pushing it regret that it was ever undertaken and realize that no possible gain can ever compensate for the terrible cost. And why?—The answer is, National pride! To stop the war now, would be humiliating to that pride, and that can never be allowed. Therefore the slaughter must go on! No matter how many people are killed—how much property wasted—no matter how many men are mutilated and maimed for life, how many women are made widows and little children orphans, no matter how much suffering is entailed,—the national pride must be maintained! And such is the attitude of a reputed "Christian" nation!

Imagine a Christian who would insist that whatever else might happen, his personal pride must not receive any hurt! That individual's Christianity would be of the same kind as is possessed by a "Christian nation."

Pride—national or individual—and Christianity, are strangers to each other. Pride and God are enemies. No man can be a Christian who is not willing to humble himself, to confess his error when he is in the wrong. The Almighty dwells with him that is of "a humble and contrite heart." But the proud heart, or the proud nation, God will not suffer. The popular idea of Christianity as belonging to a nation, or government, of this day, is a theory which is completely exploded and dissipated by the obtruding fact of national pride.
