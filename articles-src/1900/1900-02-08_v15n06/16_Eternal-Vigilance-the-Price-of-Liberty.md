## Eternal Vigilance the Price of Liberty.

By William Lloyd Garrison.

Men think because from bloody war and strife
Freedom emerges with triumphant feet,
Mounting the throne of Justice for her seat,
Her reign of glory holds a lasting life,
Never illusion with more danger rife!
Lulled to repose, for rest and sleep are sweet,
She dreams, while back, with stealthy foot steps fleet,
Oppression rushes with its murderous knife.

With Washington to guide, what need to guard?
Answer, thou civil war from slavery's womb!
With Lincoln in the firmament enstarred,
Has not the vanquished monster found its tomb?
Feigned its insensibility; unslain,
Behold it rising to its prey again!
