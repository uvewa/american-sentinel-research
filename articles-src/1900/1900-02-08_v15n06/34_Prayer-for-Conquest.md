## Prayer for Conquest.

No "Christian nation" ever acknowledges itself to be in the wrong. It sets apart days of fasting and prayer, for seeking the divine aid, not on the ground that its attitude in the crisis that has been reached may be a wrong one, nor as implying a willingness to take the opposite attitude should the divine guidance that is sought point that way; but only to ask for divine assistance in executing what it has set out to accomplish and is determined to do if possible. The "Christian nation" treats the deity as an ally, not as a sovereign. If the cause in which the divine aid is invoked does not succeed, it is accepted as a chastisement for past sins, never as an indication that the cause itself did not deserve to succeed. The "humiliation" of the nation never reaches the point of an admission of fallibility in judgment and a desire to turn from and make reparation for a wrong course of action which it may be pursuing at the time.

Just now, as an illustration, we have before us the spectacle of two "Christian nations" fighting each other in South Africa, and each at the same time earnestly invoking the divine assistance to crown the efforts of its armies with victory. They did not ask God to determine for them, before the war begun, whether they should fight or not, nor do they now cease fighting to seek for divine enlightenment as to whether the war shall be continued. One of them at least—Great Britain—is praying for a speedy termination of hostilities, when it is in her own power to terminate the war at once, by being willing to give up the idea of dominating a foreign people. But it would be almost "treason" to assert that such a concession is in harmony with the divine mind.

We find in the N. Y. *Sun*, of January 23, the following pertinent observations upon this subject, under the heading "Fighting and Praying":—

"The Metropolitan, or presiding prelate, of the Canadian branch of the Church of England has appointed the second Sunday in February, or February 11, 'as a day of special supplications for the happy ending of the South African War.' Meantime General Buller is fighting to bring it to a conclusion favorable to the British, or the ending for which, of course, the Canadian Anglicans will pray, since upon the success or failure of his present movement the issue of the whole contest depends. That question, too, is likely to be settled one way or the other before the Canadians begin to send up their supplications two weeks from next Sunday.

"Whether, then, that day of prayer is to be for them a day of thanksgiving or of humiliation depends on the soldiers, the guns, and the strategy of General Buller, and the event will be no more influenced by the divine overruling than are any other human happenings. This we do not say in any spirit depreciative of the office and importance of prayer, but simply because it is a fact.

"While the Canadians are praying in thanksgiving or in penitential sorrow and distress, the Boers will be praying to the same overruling Providence, but the event which would bring rejoicing to the Canadians and for which they would render praise to God as the Author of their good fortune or the outcome which would fill their hearts with grief as chastisement administered by God in the inscrutable ways of his providence, would be interpreted in exactly the other way by the Boers. They are people with a faith in divine Providence and in the actual interference of God in human affairs which exceeds in its completeness the faith of most Christians of this day whether in Canada or elsewhere in Christendom. As they rest in the intervals of battle they sing hymns of praise to God and offer prayers to him in a spirit of subjection to the Divine will. . . .

"In South Africa each side is fighting to the death to attain the blessing or ward off the punishment, yet that this war can come to a happy ending at any time the contestants may choose is as certain as that it need never have occurred. The British can end it any day by following the example and precedent of Gladstone in the Boer War of 1881. President Kruger can close it by appealing for terms to England. Is it not therefore presumptuous for either side to make supplication to God to bring to an end a conflict whose conclusion is wholly within the ability and option of contestants each fighting for his own advantage, when both are straining every nerve to settle it for themselves and when neither will settle it except under the compulsion of earthly circumstances which each is doing his best to control by purely human means and instruments?

"Victory over the Boers would bring to Great Britain no glory and would leave for the empire an almost endless problem of extreme difficulty in South Africa, requiring for its treatment the maintenance of a large and costly army of occupation for many years to come. Thus, it may be that there would be more danger and sorrow for Great Britain in victory than in defeat.

"If, then, our Canadian neighbors would recognize and bow before an overruling Providence let them pray to God for peace, simply leaving it for Omniscience to determine where the happiness in peace lies, according to the judgment of the wisdom to which a thousand years are but as yesterday and as a watch in the night."
