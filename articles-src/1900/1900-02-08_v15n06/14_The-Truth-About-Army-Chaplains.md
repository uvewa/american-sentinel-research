# The Truth About Army Chaplains.

## From "The Lutheran Witness."

The agitation for more army chaplains is too fore again. Here is what one of our exchanges has say about the matter:—

"That the chaplaincy is not what it ought to be, been evident for years to those who are conversant with the subject. What has been done by Congress in instituting it was merely a small concession to the religious sentiment of the nation. It is not the result of a careful and studied effort to provide for the moral and religious improvement of the army. It is the result of a half-half policy; a regard on the one hand for an extreme interpretation of the doctrine of the divorcement of church and state, and, on the other, an acknowledgment of the fact that the American people are Christian; that, as such, there should be some recognition of it government institutions. The idea of an army without a chaplain would be an anomaly among Christian and civilized nations. But the policy has been 'the less, the better;' and, consequently, while there have been some one hundred posts within the United States occupied by the troops, there have been only from thirty to thirty-four chaplains. As chaplains do not travel from post to post, but are confined in their ministrations to the garrison to which they are assigned, two-thirds of the occupied posts have been, and are, to day, without chaplains."

The truth about the whole matter is this: Congress has no business supplying the army with chaplains. It must be evident that it could not at all do without discriminating against the religious belief of the one or the other. The churches, however, are free to place chaplains at these posts, at their own expense, and it is their business to do so. The church and not the state, is bound to provide for the spiritual welfare of our soldiers.
