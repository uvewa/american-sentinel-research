# Glimpses from Afar.

## BY JOHN MCCARTHY.

One has only to read Catholic literature to be convinced of the truth of the extreme vanity and presumption of the papal church. Their eternal boast is, that Catholic civilization excels the Protestant civilization, in the same measure as the light of the sun supersedes that of the stars.

Right here in the Argentine Republic one has plenty of opportunities to study the veracity of this claim; and one or two proofs which we shall quote will be sufficient to show how void of truth is this Catholic boast. According to carefully-gleaned statistics, there are in the Argentine Republic, Paraguay, Bolivia, and the Chilian Republic, more than 3,500,000 Indians. Should one come in contact with these Indians—as I myself have done—he will find that 95 per cent. of them carry the scapulary—which all good Catholics carry upon their bosoms. The majority of them have been "baptized" by Catholic priests.

Eleven years ago a certain Indian tribe—very ferocious—who wandered about in the national territory of the Gran Chaco, were invited one day to a conference by an Argentine military commander. Upon the arrival of the Indians near to the military encampment, the soldiers—by order of the mayor in command—took hold of the "heathen" Indians with iron grasp, and held them thus, much against their will, while a benevolent Roman Catholic clergyman made "Christians" of them by means of the drops of "holy water" which he sprinkled upon their heads. Thus was a savage tribe "converted" to the Catholic religion in one and a half hours.

The Catholic Church for the last three hundred years has boasted of her wonderful missionary enterprises in South America. In the whole of this vast continent she has held full sway in matters of religion for three centuries and a half, since no Protestant missionary was permitted to preach in any of the South American republics, until thirty or forty years ago. Can the papal hierarchy show us an exemplary republic as the result of their absolute religious domination for the last three hundred years? Unfortunately for them they cannot. The more one penetrates into the interior provinces of this tremendous continent, where the Catholic power even now holds sway, the more ignorance, immorality, treachery, fanaticism, and bloodthirstiness will he see exhibited among the people. Sure signs are these of papal rule.

Yet the papal church desires to do for the United States what she has done for other Catholic nations. Would that Protestants would open their eyes to the falsity of the Catholic pretensions, and not be blinded by claims which cannot bear the slightest investigation.

What is more cruel, more ferocious, more abominable, than the well-known bull fight! The human man can scarcely imagine a more barbarous exhibition that of a bull placed in a circus, to be the victim of fiends in human form, calling themselves "torero 'picadores,'" "banderilleros," whose highest pleasure is found in slaughtering the poor animal by such slow savage means, as to show that they are more bruy than the brute they have determined to kill. Yet a never hears of a bull fight in Germany, England, or other Protestant nations; no, for such is one of fruits of the Catholic religion. Wherever the papes reigns supreme, there you will be sure to find such finish exhibitions as the above.

For many years the bull fight has been prohibited in the Argentine Republic. Recently diplomatic relations were re-established between the Vatican and the Argentine government, and scarcely had the papanuncio arrived upon our Platine shores, than a certain Spanish company began to give "exhibitions" of its fights, in the city of Rosario, killing from two to four bulls every evening. Nearly all the secular journeys clamored against such cruel exhibitions, appealing to the government to put a stop to them; but it is worthy of remark, that not a single protest was raised against them by any one of the official Catholic organs of the country.

The education and civilization developed by gospel is of a different character; it exalts the citizenry of a nation by uprooting from their hearts all debased and sanguinary inclinations. They who learn in school of Jesus can have no pleasure in exhibition, cruelty such as I have mentioned. Hence we see the reference between the Protestant civilization and edition, and that of the Catholic Church. We leave you judge, dear reader, which of the two disputants presents the best results.

Buenos Ayres, Argentina.
