Colossal crosses are to be erected, in this last year of the 19th century, on nineteen mountain peaks of Italy, to commemorate each century. The Rome branch of a Catholic international committee has undertaken the work, the idea being that this will be a way of showing "homage to Jesus the Redeemer."
