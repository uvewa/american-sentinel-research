### "Outside the Constitution."

*New York "World."*

The decision of the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee to devise a plan for governing Porto Rico and later the Philippines "outside the Constitution," is not surprising. It is a perfectly logical if not indeed a necessary next step in the policy of imperialism.

Having permitted the President to wage a war "outside the Constitution," and to recognize slavery and involuntary servitude in our new possessions, also "outside the Constitution," why should there be any hesitation in imposing a tariff upon imports from and exports into those possessions in disregard of the Constitution?

To be sure, it may seem hard to our people that after expending $150,000,000 in a war with Spain, and as much more in Mr. McKinley's war in the China Sea, with Porto Rican and the Philippine commerce held up as a compensation, they should now be called upon to pay a tariff duty on the products of our "spoils of victory." It may seem rather inconsistent likewise to the negroes, mongrels and "yellow bellies" whom we are annexing to find themselves taxed without representation.

But when the Government goes "outside the Constitution" and the Declaration of Independence is treated as obsolete sentimentality, there is no telling what may happen.
