## The Sword and the Bible.

QUITE recently a newspaper reporter interviewed the author of "In His Steps," or "What would Jesus Do?" and secured from him an expression of opinion upon the retention of the Philippine Islands by this Government. The gentleman referred to is reported to have said:—

"I am sorry that the sword and the Bible must go hand in hand, so to speak, to Christianize a barbarous people. I wish the Bible could go alone, but it seems impossible. The humanizing influence of Christian teachings make me an advocate of American rule in the Philippines."

This is too bad, but the world had a right to expect better things of Mr. Sheldon; but he is not alone in holding and expressing such opinions. Probably a majority of the clergy of this country share, to some extent at least, this view. So important does it seem to them that the Bible shall go to all nations, that go it must even if has to be shot into their homes and hearts by Gatling guns and cannon.

But the great trouble is that no nation ever yet received the Bible in any such way. Such methods give an entirely erroneous idea of the Bible and what it teaches. Semi-civilized peoples may possibly accept it perforce; or as being superior in some way to that which they have previously held; but with it they receive the war spirit by which it was forced upon them, and never get the real spirit of the Bible at all.

Christianity is a stench in the nostrils of millions of people to-day, simply because they associate it with unjust wars of conquest. The Bible might better never go at all than to go as the companion or even as the camp follower of the sword. The only sword the Christian is authorized to use is the sword of the Spirit. And where that has been the only weapon bloodless victories have been won for the Prince of Peace. Better, a thousand times that the soldier of the cross fall at his post of duty, bearing only the Word of God, panopled only with the armor of heaven, than that the heathen should fall before carnal weapons in the hands of men bearing the Christian name, but knowing nothing by a living experience of the Spirit of Christ. War is utterly incompatible with genuine Christianity, for to every one of his followers Christ says: "Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Not by the sword, as is sometimes quoted. "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink," is the gospel rule. Christ did not abrogate the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill;" and the wholesale killing of men in war is simply wholesale violation of the divine law. Let not murderers nor companions of murderers carry the Bible either to the Philippines, or any where else. "Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord." C. P. BOLLMAN.
