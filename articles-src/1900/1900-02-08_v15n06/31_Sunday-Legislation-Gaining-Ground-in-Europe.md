### Sunday Legislation Gaining Ground in Europe.

*From "The Ram's Horn."*

It is evident that the movement in behalf of Sabbath observance [Sunday legislation] is progressing far more rapidly in European countries than it is in North America. According to a recent address on this subject, on the part of Dr. Cunningham, of Edinburgh, it appears that while the sanctity of the Sabbath in the countries in which it has been most strictly observed for generations, has declined in the public regard, continental countries, where the continental Sunday has been the synonym of license, are giving more heed to the observance of the sacred day than hitherto. In 1890 the International Conference on Labor, at Berlin, discussed the subject, and legislation was enacted two years later, prohibiting the opening of shops on Sunday, and in 1895 the employment of operatives in enterprises on the first day of the week was forbidden.

Those who recall what a strife over this question was made in Chicago at the building and opening of the World's Fair, may be surprised to learn that the workmen employed on the Paris Exposition buildings are guaranteed exemption from Sunday labor, and this has been done by special legislation. It is quite significant to observe, by the way, that a large movement on behalf of Sabbath observance which is now going on in Chicago, is not being fostered by the churches, as might naturally be supposed, but by the labor unions who, on behalf of retail clerks, are strenuously suing for a day of rest on Sunday. Already, in consequence of this effort, nearly all of the retail shops have been closed, and so successful has been the effort that an attack has been made against the Sunday drug store. It is possible that Chicago, which has been known far and wide for its open Sunday, may vie with Toronto as the model city of Sabbath observance.
