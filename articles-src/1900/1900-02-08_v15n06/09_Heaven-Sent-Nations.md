UNDER the heading, "Heaven-Sent Nations," The Advocate, the leading Congregational organ of the West, observes that—

"Nothing has been more common or easy, than for nations to think that they held a commission from above. No conquest was too cruel, no crime against humanity too great, no destruction too sweeping, no obition too selfish, to be covered, excused or justified the claim of a divine commission."

And as regards affairs of the present day, it continues:—

"Commerce is called civilization, conquest Christian, stock gamblers assume the tone of piety, Wall street anks God, politicians pretend to missionary zeal, and mators talk of dividend-paying trade in one breath and a strategic providence in the next."

And the foundation of all this hypocrisy and delusion the idea that "this is a Christian nation."
