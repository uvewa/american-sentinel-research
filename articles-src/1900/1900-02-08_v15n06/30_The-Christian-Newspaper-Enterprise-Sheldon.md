The "Christian newspaper" enterprise entered into by the Topeka Daily Capital and the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, is already the subject of considerable adverse criticism. The following, for example, is offered by the Springfield Republican:—

"Rev. Mr. Sheldon is to be given opportunity to show how a Christian newspaper should be made. The first move in the new departure is to raise the price of the Capital from 10 cents to 25 cents for the week. That is business, as is the whole proceeding on the part of the ownership of the Capital. The free advertisement which it has already secured can scarcely be estimated in dollars. On the minister's part we assume that his undertaking is a conscientious effort to instruct newspaperdom and the world.

"It is decidedly worth noting that Rev. Mr. Sheldon, in his elucidation of the proposition, 'What would Jesus do?' is to continue the Capital's Sunday edition. 'He confesses that he has found by examination that the Sunday newspaper is so powerful an instrument for instruction and enlightenment that it would be wrong and foolish to discontinue it.' This concession comes from one who 'has always denounced Sunday newspapers as evils which should not be tolerated.' . . .

"Now we are to see how really Christian Editor Pro Tem Sheldon is going to be. We find him quoted to this effect:—

"'I am sorry to say that the sword and the Bible must go hand in hand, so to speak, to Christianize a barbarous people. I wish the Bible could do it alone, but this seems impossible. The humanizing influence of Christian teachings makes me an advocate of American rule in the Philippines.'

"That does not appear to us to be what Jesus, the Prince of Peace, would have said in the present national emergency: but perhaps Rev. Mr. Sheldon will not say that from the editorial chair."
