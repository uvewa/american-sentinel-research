## The Bible Trust.

A New York daily says:—

"The announcement that the Bible publishers of the country had followed the fashion and formed a trust still left it an open question how the Bible readers would be affected by the change. Mr. Archbold, of the Standard Oil Trust, kindly explained to the public at the Alumni Association dinner of Syracuse University on Friday that trusts are 'a necessary evolution of the times,' that they reduce cost, improve quality, increase wages, please both the producer and consumer and minister to the happiness and prosperity of the country.

"Accordingly we had reason to expect, and there were those who hoped against hope, that the Bible Trust would furnish a practical illustration of the benevolent side of this much-mooted question. Alas for the vanity of human expectations! The report that the trust is complete and in good working order is promptly followed by the official announcement of an advance in the price of Bibles of the old quality. The way to a knowledge of revealed truth is made harder by 15 to 20 per cent. This is disappointing, but it might be worse. Let us be duly thankful that the trust merely publishes the Bible and does not edit and expurgate it to give us a revised trust version of the good book. The commandments 'Thou shalt not steal,' 'Thou shalt not covet,' still hold their places in the table of the Law, and the Golden Rule irradiates the New Testament."
