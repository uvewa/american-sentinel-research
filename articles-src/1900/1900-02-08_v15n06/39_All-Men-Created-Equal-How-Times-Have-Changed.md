In Washington's and Jefferson's day, it was asserted that "all men are created equal," and "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;" and these statements were put forth as self-evident truths. But now such journals as the North American Review come forward and declare that these same statements are among the "most obvious fallacies." How times have changed!
