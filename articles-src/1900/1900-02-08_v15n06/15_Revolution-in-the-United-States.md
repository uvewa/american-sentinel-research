## Revolution in the United States.

New York "World," Feb. 2.

When members of the Kentucky Legislature sought to enter the State Capitol yesterday they found their entrance barred by bayonets. The State militia, under orders of Governor Taylor, not only prevented their entrance to the legislative halls, but threatened them with arrest if they sought to assemble elsewhere in the city.

This is in the simplest terms executive usurpation supported by military power. It is the act of a dictator, not of a governor. It is what happened in France under Louis Napoleon. It is a repetition of frequent history in the revolutionary Central and South American states. But it is a startling innovation in one of the United States. The dispersion of a sovereign legislative body by executive proclamation, and the substitution of the militia for the legislature or the courts in settling a disputed election, is a strange sight in our and since the close of the war.

Government by bayonets rather than ballots—the rule of force instead of the rule of law—is revolution, by whatever official practised, by whatever party sustained.

If assassination and usurpation shall be permitted to achieve their objects in this case, not much imagination is required to see what a few regiments of Federal soldiers might do in Washington under the orders of a president who announced his determination, as Governor Taylor did yesterday, to "stick even if he precipitated a bloody war."

The whole deplorable affair illustrates the dangerous tendencies and natural results of the new policy of militarism—of "bending" the organic law—of government "outside the Constitution."
