### MARYLAND.

**Blue Sunday in Baltimore.**

**All "Unnecessary" Business Suspended and Antiquated Laws Enforced.**

BALTIMORE, MD., Jan. 28 —To-day was blue Sunday in Baltimore. For the first time in many years the Sunday Blue Laws of Maryland, which in various forms have been upon the statute books for two centuries, were rigorously and relentlessly enforced. The police force of Baltimore patrolled the town from Canton to Carroll and from Locust Point to Waverly in search of violators. Newsdealers, newsboys, milkmen, icemen, druggists for prescriptions only and proprietors of lunch rooms alone were exempt. All other varieties of merchants who were found selling their wares between midnight and midnight will be called upon within a few days to appear before the Grand Jury.

Cigar dealers, grocers, bootblacks, fruit dealers, soda water dealers, ice cream men, confectioners and stationers, who for years have made no distinction between Sunday and any other day, were compelled to close their establishments all day. A number of storekeepers placed amusing signs in their windows. One cigar store had a large decorated sign reading: "This is hypocrite day; you must buy Bibles, and not cigars." In another store yesterday was a sign, "Proclamation—Renewal of the Blue Laws. We close on Sunday. Buy your supplies to-day." In one of the large drug stores there was a sign on the cigar case saying: "Nothing doing." It is thought that the law will be made so ridiculous that it will be repealed.
