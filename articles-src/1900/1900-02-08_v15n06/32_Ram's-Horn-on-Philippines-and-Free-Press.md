The *Ram's Horn*, (Chicago), from which we quote elsewhere in this issue, says:—

"It will certainly be unwelcome truth to many, as it should be to all, if it can be proved that our country has become the unconscious or the conscious agent for perpetuating ecclesiastical tyranny in the Orient. Those who would be quick to deny this inference, should reflect that the charge is supported by many of our military commanders who have fought there during the past year."

And in support of these words it adds:—

"Do we take counsel of our fears in writing the above? Let our readers take up once more their daily papers of recent date and they will read an uncensored dispatch from the Philippines to the effect that in the city of Manila a paper established at the instance of President Schurman, of Cornell University, to cause a sentiment for American annexation, had been suspended for this reason: It seems that a fund of money has been raised for charity purposes, and sent over to the priests for distribution. This paper, called *The American*, criticised the manner in which it had been distributed. The editor was informed that it must retract that article, as no criticism of the church would be permitted. We do not know whether the criticism was just or unjust, but the editor refused to retract, and suspended publication, declaring in good conscience, he could not retract. From which we infer that the old Spanish regulations concerning free speech and a free press, have been re-established and enforced under our own Government."
