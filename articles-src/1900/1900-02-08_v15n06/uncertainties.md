# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 8, 1900 (v15n06)

## Issue Number

- **Location:** Page 1 masthead
- **Transcribed as:** NUMBER 7 (corrected from OCR which shows "NUMBER .7.")
- **Confidence:** HIGH — The OCR shows "NUMBER .7." which is clearly a scan artifact; this is issue 6 per the folder name and sequence, but the masthead text reads "NUMBER .7." The period before the 7 is an OCR artifact. Transcribed as "NUMBER 7" in masthead. Note: the folder is named v15n06 but the masthead says Number 7 — this discrepancy is preserved as-is in the masthead text.

## Page 3, Paragraph Beginning "obition too selfish"

- **Location:** Page 3, article "Heaven-Sent Nations"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "obition too selfish" — this appears to be OCR corruption of "ambition too selfish"
- **Confidence:** LOW — The word "obition" does not exist; original likely reads "ambition." However, per transcription rules, the OCR text is preserved as printed; actual original scan not available for verification.

## Page 3, "anks God" and "mators"

- **Location:** Page 3, article "Heaven-Sent Nations"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "Wall street anks God, politicians pretend to missionary zeal, and mators talk of"
- **Confidence:** LOW — "anks" is likely "thanks" and "mators" is likely "senators" — these appear to be OCR errors from the original scan. Preserved as OCR output.

## Page 3, "led—as all Spanish provinces were—by"

- **Location:** Page 3, opening of "The Philippine Question in the Light of Mexican History"
- **Transcribed as:** "luzon" (lowercase) — OCR artifact; original likely "Luzon"
- **Confidence:** HIGH — Corrected to standard capitalization "Luzon" when referenced elsewhere; preserved lowercase in OCR text.

## Page 6, Several Corrupt Passages in "Glimpses from Afar"

- **Second pass completed:** Yes

- **Issue 7:** "the reference between" — likely "the difference between"
- **Issue 8:** "Protestant civilization and edition" — likely "Protestant civilization and education"
- **Confidence:** LOW for all — These are clearly OCR artifacts from a degraded or difficult scan. All have been transcribed as they appear in the OCR source, not corrected.

## Attribution Note: "Glimpses from Afar" — John McCarthy

- The article is bylined "BY JOHN MCCARTHY" and signed with dateline "Buenos Ayres, Argentina." This is treated as an explicit attribution. The author is not in the known authors list; added as byline author.

## Issue Number Discrepancy

- The folder is named `1900-02-08_v15n06` (issue 6) but the OCR masthead reads "NUMBER .7." — this is noted as either an OCR artifact (period before 7) or a potential mis-numbering in the original. The issue number "6" in the folder name should be verified against the original scan.
