THE Catholic Standard and Times says: "There were no embitterments between Catholics and non-Catholics until they were begun by Luther in the period which followed the Middle Ages—the Renaissance."

Very true, and that for the reason that, as the same paper says, "there were no non-Catholics." Until the Reformation all Christendom was Catholic. Rome had for centuries kept it so by making it exceedingly unsafe to be anything else. True, there arose in the twelfth century the Waldenses and the Albigenses. Early in the fifteenth century Huss and Jerome dared to dissent from the doctrines of Rome, and just before the close of that century Savonarola gave his life for his faith; but until the "little monk of Wittenberg" led Germany out of the church of Rome almost bodily there were, in a sense, within the bounds of Christendom, no non-Catholics. However much individuals or communities may have desired to be non-Catholic in religion, Rome never recognized them as outside her fold. They were at most "erring children," to be disciplined and subdued by any means necessary. It is in view of this that the Catholic Standard and Times says:

"If there were any non-Catholics in those ages capable of doing anything inimical to the established Christian religion, after the downfall of Arianism, then surely we are behind in that grand march of progress to which he so strikingly refers, since we know not of these things.

"The rights of non-Catholics in the Middle Ages are entitled to some respect, if the rights of real Catholics in this one be deserving of little consideration. If the former did not exist, for the plain reason that there were no non-Catholics perceptible to the naked eye, then surely they might be allowed to repose in the quiet of inconceivability."

And why does the Standard and Times talk in this vein? Simply because a Catholic priest has been reminding his coreligionists of some of the history of the Middle Ages, and contrasting that period with the present era of equal rights for Catholic and Protestant. It is to make the contrast less sharp that resort is had to the subterfuge that "there were no non-Catholics." There were none only because Rome suffered them not to continue.
