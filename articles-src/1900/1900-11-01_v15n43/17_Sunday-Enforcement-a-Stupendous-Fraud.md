### A Scene in Court.

JUDGE BAILEY (addressing the prisoner): You have been summoned here, Mr. Jones, to answer to the charge of violating the Sunday law. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

MR. JONES: I confess, your honor, to having labored on Sunday, the first day of the week, as charged in the indictment, but I deny having labored on the Lord's day, or of having committed any crime against any of my fellow-citizens.

JUDGE: This is no place, Mr. Jones, to discuss fine-spun theological distinctions, but we are here to see that the laws enacted by our legislature are obeyed and to punish the transgressor.

MR. JONES: Do you claim, your honor, that it is your duty to enforce a law that punishes an innocent man?

JUDGE: I am not here to decide as to the justice or injustice of the law. The lawmakers are responsible for the character of the law. If the enforcement of the law imposes pains and penalties upon innocent persons it is the duty of the people to petition the legislature to change or abolish the law. So long as the law remains upon the statute books it is my duty as judge of this court to see that it is obeyed.

MR. JONES: Then I understand, your honor, that if you knew that a person who had broken the Sunday law was innocent before God, and that he had not trespassed in the least degree upon the rights of his fellow-citizens, you would punish that man by fine and imprisonment.

JUDGE: I am not convinced, Mr. Jones, if it is proven that you have violated the Sunday law that you are innocent before God and that you have not trespassed upon the rights of others. Perhaps if I were convinced that the law was wrong, and to enforce it would impose unjust punishment upon an innocent man I might act differently. I certainly would feel loth to punish an innocent man.

MR. JONES: Would you be willing, your honor, to listen to the reasons why I believe that I am innocent of the charge brought against me; not so much that I may escape the punishment you might inflict on me, but that justice and right may prevail and the people of this community may see the injustice of Sunday laws.

JUDGE: Of course, Mr. Jones, that is what we are here for; to try your case and see whether you are guilty or not; and as you prefer to plead your own case you are at liberty to do so. However, we would like you to state your reasons as briefly as possible, as our time is limited.

MR. JONES: Thank you. I will endeavor to be as brief as I can.

When the officer arrested me I was digging some potatoes in my garden. Does your honor believe that the act of digging potatoes is in itself a crime against the state? Would you consider it such if done on any other day of the week?

JUDGE: Of course, no one thinks that domestic labor is in itself a crime against the state.

MR. JONES: Then, your honor, if there is any crime in Sunday work it is not in the work itself, but because of the character of the day on which the work is done, and you will agree with me that there is nothing in which the Sunday differs from other days of the week except in its religious character. If the day differs from the rest of the days of the week in its religious character, and that only, then for the state to compel the observance of that day is forcing the religion that is in the day upon the people and nothing else. And this is positively contrary to the spirit of our free institutions. The national Constitution provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and in harmony with this provision nearly every State constitution contains, seemingly, ample guarantees of liberty of conscience.

JUDGE: But, Mr. Jones, there is a civil phase to this question, and that is what the legislature had in mind and not the religious phase. I can hardly think that our legislators would intentionally make laws enforcing religion upon the people in direct opposition to the Constitution of the Government.

MR. JONES: As to the motives the legislators had in passing the Sunday law I can not say. But this I do know, that if the religious element of the country had not urged it upon the legislature they never would have thought of making such laws. But that it was at the solicitation of the clergy and the church leaders that they passed the Sunday law can be proven beyond a doubt. However, you must see, your honor, that there can be no such thing as a civil Sunday law. You understand, of course, the meaning of civility and incivility. To be uncivil is to disregard or trample upon the rights of another. But you admit that to do common labor on any day of the week is not trampling upon the rights of another, and therefore can not be uncivil; and if the mere act of labor on Sunday is not uncivil, then how could a law punishing a man for doing a civil act be a civil law?

JUDGE: Go on, Mr. Jones; we will consider that point later on.

MR. JONES: In regard to my being innocent before God, your honor will agree with me, that the Sabbath commandment says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt do no work." Now, if God commands me to keep the seventh day under pain of the second death, has any legislative body any right to step in and say that I shall not keep that day?

JUDGE: Oh, no, Mr. Jones, the legislature does not claim the right to say that you shall not keep the seventh day. No such thing is contemplated in the law. Far from it. And, further, Mr. Jones, if you are conscientiously convicted in your own mind that you ought to keep the seventh day as the Sabbath, I honor you for doing so. I hold that it is every man's duty to act out his conscientious convictions, so long as his convictions do not prompt him to interfere with the rights of another.

MR. JONES: I am glad to hear your honor so decide. It is an evidence to me that you desire to be just in your rulings. But please bear with me. You admit that because the commandment says "the seventh day in the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work," no legislative body has any right to override the authority of the great God and say that I shall keep it.

JUDGE: Indeed I do, Mr. Jones, and I should be the last man to decide otherwise.

MR. JONES: Very well, your honor. Does not the same God in the same command say, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work"?

JUDGE: I believe He does.

MR. JONES: Then, when God says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath; in it thou shalt do no work," no legislative body has any right to say I shall not keep the seventh day, and if my conscience tells me it is my duty to keep the seventh day I should do so regardless of any human intervention to the contrary. Then when the same God says in the same command "Six days shalt thou labor," what right has any legislative body to say I must rest the first day and thus deprive me of one day's income contrary to the command of God?

JUDGE: I do not understand, Mr. Jones, that that clause of the divine law is imperative, and that every one is compelled to work six days. We all know that many good people are unable to work. Therefore we understand that the clause to work six days is only a permission to labor if we are able and desire to do so.

MR. JONES: Very well, your honor, we will accept your understanding of that clause in the commandment. But is it not true that the law gives me a divine right to work six days; and, if so, has any legislative body the authority to prevent me from exercising a divine right? Would not that be putting human authority in place of the divine, and thus exalting man above God?

JUDGE: We must confess, Mr. Jones that your reasoning is logical throughout. Do you wish to make any further defense in your case?

MR. JONES: There are many more reasons I might lay before your honor, but I will not occupy any more of your valuable time, but, thanking you for granting me permission to state my reasons, and hoping you will consider them in the light of truth and justice to all men, I close.

JUDGE: As it is about time to adjourn this court for to-day, and as I wish some time to consider your case, you can go, Mr. Jones, and await our decision.

## A Private Conversation Next Morning.

STATE'S ATTORNEY: Good morning, Judge.

JUDGE: Good morning, Mr. Marsh.

ATTORNEY: Well, Judge, what do you think of Jones's defense yesterday?

JUDGE: Think of it! The man doesn't live that can pick a flaw in a single point he made. The principles of civil and religious liberty as presented by Jones in his defense are the principles advocated by all the noted jurists and statesmen since this Government was founded, and for years before.

ATTORNEY: That is my opinion exactly, Judge, and I have about made up my mind that Sunday legislation and Sunday enforcement are, on the whole, a stupendous fraud, and if continued will work evil and result in persecution to some of our best citizens. But what will you do, Judge, with this case?

JUDGE: You may depend upon it, Mr. Marsh, I will never play the role of a Pontius Pilate and condemn an innocent man, for I am fully convinced that Jones is no more guilty of a crime against the state in lifting out some potatoes in his garden on Sunday than I was in examining some legal papers in my office on the same day. If the church leaders want to impeach me for refusing to sentence an innocent man, I am willing to step down and out. I realize that I am to be summoned before a higher court than I have presided over, and I do not want the blood of innocent men found on my garments.

ATTORNEY: Good; I honor you, Judge, for the noble stand you take and will stand by you.

JUDGE: Thanks; good day.

J. F. BALLINGER.
