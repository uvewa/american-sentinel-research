An English journal, Reynolds' Newspaper, prints the following anent the "glorious victory" gained by England over the late Boer republics, now crown colonies:

"Mr. John Haggert has received letters from his son, Trooper Qs. Haggert, of Bethune's Horse, dated Platrand Station, July 18 and 22, in which he states that a post-office official at Durban has been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for opening letters from the men at the front. He continues: 'Probably you saw in the papers that in one case we ordered the women and children out of their houses and set the buildings on fire. It was a terrible sight to see the women and children looking at their homes being burned down and crying. We read the orders out to the Boer women stating that if they gave food or shelter to the rebel Boers we should commandeer all their stock and burn their houses down. The women are sent down to Natal. I do not care about this job of burning down houses and witnessing the grief of the women and children. It almost makes one shed a tear.'"

Comment is unnecessary. The simple facts cry to Heaven.
