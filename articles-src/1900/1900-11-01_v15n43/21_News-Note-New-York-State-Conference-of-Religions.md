**THE "New York State Conference of Religions"**

will it is announced, hold a session in New York City November 28-29. In giving the reason for holding such a conference the 2-year-to-says that the said front presented by Religious forces required 2 million years of operation, a small round and that for this it was necessary to give prominence to our agreements which than our day was in use.

Since prominence is to be given to our agreements, we may look for prominence to be given to Sunday and to Sunday laws since this is one of the very few points upon which there is anything like agreement among the various sects. This agreement refers, however, to the question of the enforced observance of the day rather than its authority. As soon as that point is finished there is great diversity of opinion for since the Bible furnishes no authority for the institution every one must fix as a theory of his own. But notwithstanding this fact there is great unanimity in the opinion that Sunday keeping ought to be enforced by civil justice.
