Mr. Edward W. Winer, one in a letter to the Judge of the United States, published by the National Christian Citizenship League at Gull Lake, Mich., the purpose is not to build a city, nor establish a colony, nor to found a college. It is simply to conduct a summer school on the definite lines of present-day social problems in the light of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. In its physical features it will resemble some of the Chautauquas which are already established.

"The purpose is not to provide a place where a few theorists call with raw themselves from a wicked world, but rather where earnest men and women of all shouts of opinion may spend two months of the year in conference, so that they may be the better able to place the imprint of the Nazarene upon public affairs during the other ten months. The teachers in this summer school will include the leading thinkers of this and other countries, the general arrangements in this department being in charge of the progress of the school."

This is the same school referred to in these columns in our issue of the 11th ult., as being located at Yorkville, Mich. It means simply a National Reform Chautauqua. We shall doubtless hear more of this enterprise in the future.
