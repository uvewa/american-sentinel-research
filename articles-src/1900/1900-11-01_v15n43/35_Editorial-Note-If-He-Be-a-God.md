"If he be a god, let him plead for himself," was the noble answer of Joash to those who were demanding the death of the young man who had overthrown the altar of Baal. This is the answer of the friends of religious freedom to-day to every demand for the enforcement of law in behalf of religion. If a religious institution be not of God it should fall; if it be of God it can not fall. God is able to plead for his own.
