We hear much said at the present time about the "civic duties of Christians." The phrase is misleading. It conveys the idea that there are certain civil duties which pertain to Christians as such. This is not the case. The individual is the unit of civil society, and civil duties pertain not to Christians, but to men. A Christian sustains exactly the same relation to civil society as does one who is not a Christian. In other words, the profession or non-profession of Christianity does not affect one's relations to the civil powers at all. All persons, whether Christians, atheists, Jews, or pagans are equally bound to contribute to the support of the civil power, and to abide by the laws of justice. These are their civic duties, and the "civic duties" of the atheist are exactly the same as the "civic duties" of the Christian.
