A private soldier, writing from the island of Panay, one of the Philippine group, to a friend in Portland, Maine, says:

"I enlisted so that I could stop drinking and I have succeeded, but do not think that it is because I can not get it, for the canteen follows the company wherever it goes, and a soldier can get both beer and whisky. Drinking is killing lots of good men. Taking everything into consideration, I wonder that every man here is not crazy. Last Sunday one hundred barrels of beer came. I had to work all the afternoon helping unload it, and at night I was on patrol. Well, the whole company has been drunk ever since. I'll bet there has been fifty fights. Monday night about 11.30 the captain came over with his pistol drawn to stop one. It's a sight and a shame that they should send beer and whisky into such a country as this. We left camp Meade with 128 men and two months ago we got eleven more recruits, but at present we have only seventy-eight for duty."

These facts are not calculated to make converts to the army canteen.
