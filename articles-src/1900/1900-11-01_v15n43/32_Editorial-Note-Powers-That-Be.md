In considering our relations to "the powers that be," it ought never to be forgotten that we must distinguish between the "powers" and the men who are in power. The "powers" are ordained of God, and are always good and to be respected, but rulers are often bad, and demand that which is unjust and unrighteous. The Christian is ever to be subject to the right, but never to evil.
