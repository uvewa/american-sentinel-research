In "Faith of Our Fathers," pp. 264, 265, Cardinal Gibbons defines religious liberty thus:

"A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right of worshiping God according to the dictates of a right conscience, and of practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God."

Of course "a right conscience" is a Catholic conscience. That this is what the cardinal means is evident from the fact that on page 269 of the same book he quotes from that eminent Catholic theologian, Becanus, the statement that "religious liberty may be tolerated by a ruler when it would do more harm to the State or to the community to repress it." "This," the cardinal says, "is the true Catholic teaching on this point."

The cardinal uses the present tense advisedly, for such is still the attitude of the Catholic Church—religious liberty not from principle, but from policy.
