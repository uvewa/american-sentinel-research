The progress of the agitation for Sunday closing in this city is indicated by the following, printed in the *Record* of October 22:—

"The fight for a state Sunday closing law was formally opened yesterday in various parts of the city. In front of many churches pamphlets and circulars were distributed urging people to uphold the efforts to secure the passage of the law. Counter pamphlets and circulars were handed out at the same places, some containing the statement: 'We sell goods on Sunday.'"

At Kaly and Division Streets, some clerks held a man meeting in the afternoon. 'Dougriats joined the ranks of the advocates of the Sunday closing law yesterday.'"
