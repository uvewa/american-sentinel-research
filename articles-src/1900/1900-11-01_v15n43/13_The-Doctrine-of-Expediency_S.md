"And one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." John 11: 49, 50.

In these words the doctrine of expediency was proclaimed upon a certain notable occasion in the past. The argument seemed very conclusive to those who heard it then, but to us its heinous character is made manifest by the fact that it was spoken by an enemy of Jesus Christ for the purpose of justifying his crucifixion.

Yet the same wicked sophistry, in different words, is repeated over and over to-day. "It is expedient that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." What is this but one way of stating the doctrine of "the greatest good to the greatest number"?

To be sure, it was not for the good of the Jewish nation that they crucified Jesus Christ; and it is not actually for "the greatest good of the greatest number" that one person should be deprived of his God-given rights. But this is not the point. The Jews believed that the welfare of their nation demanded Christ's death, and they acted on their belief, and people to-day will act on their belief, just as did the Jews in the time of Christ. They will be led to believe that in some cases, comparatively few, the individual must surrender what has been considered his natural rights in order that anarchy may not break in upon society and that the whole nation perish not.

The doctrine of expediency has its place, but it is wholly out of its place when it is used to deprive a person of his natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The law of God knows nothing of expediency, and as surely as every man is amenable to that law so surely has he the inalienable right to that freedom necessary to the development of righteous character. In the sacred domain of conscience the individual stands alone with his God; the rest of mankind are necessarily and rightfully excluded. This sacred domain must be preserved inviolate, and if through any theory of government it is not so preserved, then the greatest harm to the greatest number will be the inevitable result. S.
