"The Baptists of Germany are stalwarts," says the Canadian Baptist. "They have had to suffer persecution, and have in the past had to endure social ostracism. The editor of the English Baptist attended their Triennial Conference. He writes: 'There are no "open" Baptists in Germany. We explained the distinctions in England, and were always met at the end of our statements thus: "We, then, are close Baptists." They have made grand progress in the face of what might appear insuperable obstacles. Baptists who think their principles worth suffering for, ever do make rapid advance."

And it is equally true of any people "who think they have principles worth suffering for" that they will prosper; but, sad to relate, there are many in these days, and some of them Baptists, who, whatever they may think of the value of their principles, are not willing to suffer for them. Thousands and tens of thousands of religionists everywhere must even be protected against a little financial loss or they can't keep the day they profess to believe they ought to keep holy unto the Lord!
