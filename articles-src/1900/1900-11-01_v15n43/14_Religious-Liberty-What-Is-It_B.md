According to Webster's International Dictionary, "religious liberty is the free right of adopting and enjoying opinions on religious subjects, and of worshiping the Supreme Being according to the dictates of conscience, without external control." The Standard's definition is "freedom of religious opinions and worship as one's conscience may dictate."

Mr. Madison's memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia in 1785, protesting against "A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion," sets forth this: "We remonstrate against the said bill: 1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, 'That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.' The religion, then, of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate."

The "Act Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia" passed after the defeat of the act against which Mr. Madison and hundreds of Presbyterians and Baptists protested, provided, "That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested or burthened, in his body or goods, nor shall he otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or beliefs; but all men shall be free to profess and by argument maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and the same shall in no way detract, diminish, or affect their civil capacities."

Again, in the memorial already referred to, it is said: "Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess, and to observe the religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we can not deny an equal freedom to them whose minds have not yielded to the evidence which has convinced us."

These quotations show clearly that religious liberty means not only the right to hold, and to observe one's own religion, free from all restraint and compulsion, but likewise freedom from all compulsion touching the religious views, institutions and usages of others. B.
