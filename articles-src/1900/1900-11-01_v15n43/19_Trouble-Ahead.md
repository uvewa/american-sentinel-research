From the Flaming Sword.

The signs of the times, when accurately read and scientifically interpreted, indicate that the great culmination of the age is at hand. The world entered a vortex of war when war was declared between America and Spain, when the United States stepped into recognition as a world power and began action upon the Oriental stage close to the mouth of the dragon. We have passed through an age of war; and the age must culminate in war and revolution—the curse must ultimate in woes. The whirlpool widens in its sweep and must ultimately involve every element of the old order—every church and state, every organization, every great power, every civilized nation, and every department of industry, commerce, and political economy. We see millions of soldiers drilling for war, and hundreds of warships ready for action; we see the massing of capital for the purpose of protecting its interests against organized labor, and we hear the threats of the labor leaders that ere they surrender their cause they will command upon the field of action the millions of working-men. The affairs of the world are reaching the critical stage; the storm is approaching and its force is irresistible. There is no hope of escape from the destruction of the present order of the world; it is inevitable, for the way must be cleared for the new world!
