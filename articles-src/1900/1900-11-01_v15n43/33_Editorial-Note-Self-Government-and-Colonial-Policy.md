When a colonial policy was inaugurated under this Government, and it was officially proclaimed that self-government is not a natural right of certain people dwelling outside the United States, we said it would not be long until the right of self-government would be questioned as applying to people within the United States. In other words, that this nation could not long deny the principles of the Declaration of Independence abroad and maintain them at home. And now, in confirmation of this, hear this editorial utterance of the New York Independent:

"This absolute generalization regarding consent [government by consent of the governed], disregarded by its formulators and practically disavowed by every state that has ever existed, is likely to gasp out its last breath in the pending campaign. The progressive, democratic philosophy of to-day is building the coming state in the light of considerations of social ends. It postulates nothing; it analyzes and decomposes old principles and theories; IT CONCERNS IT-

SELF NOT WITH 'RIGHTS,' but with duties, with social adaptations, with an ideal of 'the greatest good to the greatest number,' as that greatest good may be determined by experiences of fact." (Italics and small caps ours.)

Where will you stand, reader—what security will you have for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, when the Government under which you live no longer concerns itself with rights—your rights—but tries to be guided by the hazy principle of "the greatest good to the greatest number"? What will become of your right to worship God according to the dictates of your own conscience when the Government shall have dropped the theory of natural rights altogether, and the claim is set up that it is for the greatest good to the greatest number that your worship should be directed by the "national conscience" or the conscience of an ecumenical Christian council, or some other conscience not your own? And the Independent said this not to present something new and strange, but to sum up the prevailing teaching of the last two years on this vital subject.
