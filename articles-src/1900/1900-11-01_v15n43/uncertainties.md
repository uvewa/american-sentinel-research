## Page 10, News Note - New York State Conference

**Issue:** The OCR text contains garbled/corrupted passages:
- "the 2-year-to-says that the said front presented by Religious forces required 2 million years of operation, a small round and that for this it was necessary to give prominence to our agreements which than our day was in use."

**Transcribed as:** Retained as-is in the transcription as the source OCR text is unclear.

**Confidence:** LOW - This section appears to be a significant OCR corruption and may need verification against the original page image.

**Reason:** The sentence structure is nonsensical and suggests OCR misreading of multiple words.
