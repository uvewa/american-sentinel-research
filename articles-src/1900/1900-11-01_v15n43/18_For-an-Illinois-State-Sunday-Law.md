In line with what was said in these columns last week touching the prospect for a Sunday-closing law in Illinois is the following from the Chicago News of October 16:

"A wide interest in Sunday closing was awakened last year in different parts of the city, and the good effects of the movement are still in evidence, as shown by the agitation of the grocers, butchers, milkmen, and other tradesmen in favor of a State law enforcing Sunday rest. Several meetings for this purpose were held at various places in the city last Sunday afternoon, and the various clerks' and retailers' associations propose to appeal to the pulpit in aid of their plans, and also to distribute handbills and notices calling upon people to patronize only stores that observe Sunday closing.

"Logically this movement for a State law is the only hope for anything like a permanent and satisfactory solution of the Sunday question. It is extremely difficult at times to procure the assent of all retailers in a given neighborhood to an agreement for Sunday closing, and as long as there are exceptions their numbers are likely to be increased by recruits from Sunday closers who fear rivals will gain their trade. * * *

"Laboring men and clerks and small retailers are especially interested in this Sunday question, aside even from any religious scruples or beliefs they may have. The rich man can rest when he pleases. The poor man, under conditions that are in danger of hardening into custom in many great cities, is often compelled to work seven days in the week or 'lose his job.' As wages now are generally adjusted to the labor week of six days, labor would simply add to its toil without increasing the remuneration, should the seven-day week become the custom. It would also by this act cut off all opportunity for social converse, moral and religious instruction and development, and, in general, make life a monotonous vista of working days, broken only by a rare holiday. * * *

"Whether, therefore, the enforcement of Sunday rest be regarded from either the Christian or the pagan point of view there is the authority and custom of practically all the past history of the world in its favor. Man is not a machine. He needs periodical rest to recuperate and to store up vigor for work. As a matter of fact, in the long run, any man will do far more and far better work working only six days in the week and resting the seventh than he will working all the time. Illinois should follow the example of many other States and enact a Sunday-closing law, and having enacted it should see that it is enforced."
