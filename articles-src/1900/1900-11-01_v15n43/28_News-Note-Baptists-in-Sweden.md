The archbishop of the state church in Sweden having made charges of immorality against dissenters in that kingdom, especially the Baptists, Peter Waldenstrom, one of the most influential members of the Swedish diet and a prominent Lutheran, has come to the defense of the Baptists against the charges of the archbishop. Among other things, Mr. Waldenstrom states that he visited all the disreputable places in Stockholm, such as saloons, rum holes, the registry for lewd women, and prisons. On asking how many Baptists there were among the frequenters and denizens of those places, with laughter and surprise, the answer always was: "Baptists here, dear sir? There are no Baptists here! This is no place for them." In the crowds frequenting the low dives they told him if he thought them Baptists they could show him their certificates entitling them to the Lord's supper in the state church.

"Mr. Waldenstrom's letter," remarks the Canadian Baptist, "has pulverized the archbishop's charges, and has revealed the corrupt condition of the state church."
