**WAL TACQUE STATE ZIORILLII NA ROV**

Sacramento, Ind., is credited with the statement recently made, that as a plain matter of fact the only safety which the Catholic Church at the present time has in the Philippines for the possession of her properties and for the loss of her rights is the protection afforded by the American flag, and all affairs fully understood and fully recognized in Rome.

"It is not a good expression to the question rendered in the church," by the Government of the United States that the archbishop was authorized to thank the President to the name of the Pope to support the minimum structures of vote that should do to provide a means of support the archbishop's abatement, the Michigan Christian Advocacy, etc. In view of the fact that the Philippine reicht has as much against the abuses of the Rommel Catholic Church as against Spanish application, all this links can be is more of a point than the Christian Church as against Spanish application, all this links can be is more of a point than the Michigan Christian Advocacy, etc.

"This article will be read something about how Roman Catholics established religious liberty in New York," and how the church was accorded as the champion of liberty, etc. But we know that when a Roman Catholic speaks of religious liberty he does not mean thereby what is generally understood by the term, he makes simply like the Catholic.
