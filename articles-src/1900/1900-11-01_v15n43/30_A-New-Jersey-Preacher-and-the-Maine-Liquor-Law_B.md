The story is told by the daily press of the country, of a New Jersey preacher who, desiring to know the real truth concerning the practical workings of the Maine liquor law, recently visited that State disguised as "an up-to-date man of the world." The story is as follows:

The Rev. J. Ward Gamble, pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Vineland, N. J., has just returned home and resumed the charge of his large congregation, after having successfully accomplished one of the most remarkable undertakings ever devised and executed by a clergyman.

Disguised as an up-to-date man of the world, with swell outing suit, white duck trousers, radiant shirt waist of varied hues, and light russet shoes, he left Vineland about ten days ago, with the purpose of going to Maine to gather data concerning the celebrated law of the Pine Tree State which forbids the sale of intoxicants within its borders. Dr. Gamble adopted this disguise to more easily and effectually collect the information which he desired concerning the law in question.

"I am really glad I made the journey, as I fully satisfied myself that the celebrated Maine prohibition law is a farce," said Dr. Gamble on his return.

"For years conflicting reports have come from Maine as to the enforcement of the liquor law, some stating that the law was fully enforced, others denying it.

## Bribes Less than Licenses.

"Finally I became interested in the subject and I made up my mind that I wanted to see how the law was working. There was but one way to accomplish this purpose—by a personal visit to Maine. Of course, I realized the fact that if I went as a minister of the gospel I would return without the desired data. Consequently I determined upon my disguise, which worked like a charm, as I was enabled to see for myself the full operation of the law.

"Without fear of molestation I took pains to cover a pretty good range of country, and I believe I got a reliable insight. I did the detective work myself. Some took me for a dude, some for a dunce, and others for a card sharp. I was offered drink by all. I went into hotels, restaurants and saloons, and now I am back home well informed on the subject.

"The result of my discoveries is interesting. I soon discovered that to intimate to the Maine people that the law is enforced draws a smile or a sigh, simply because every one in the State who has taken the trouble to look into the matter knows that it is not enforced and that little or no attempt is made to do so.

"The politicians and officeholders favor the law as it is, because they can say to the good people who want prohibition: 'We are for the law,' while the liquor interests do not object, as the fees and fines they pay to police and sheriff are considerably less than low license.

"Only occasional raids are attempted, and then only for the sake of appearance and to extort money from the saloonists."

**Easy to Obtain Liquor.**

"Without the slightest show of secrecy I visited a saloon, that is, a saloon in all but the sign above the door, located in a prominent position on State Street, Portland. Upon my arrival from Boston I innocently passed this place at the first glance, never suspecting anything out of the way until my eyes were opened a day or two later, when I finally discovered the true nature of the place and entered it. I asked for a lunch, whereupon the bartender sized me up for a dunce and replied: 'We have none, but I can serve you with anything you want to drink, old man.' 'But you have no right to sell here,' I said. 'O, yes, I have,' he replied. 'How do you work it?' I questioned; 'tip politicians?' 'No, I pay my fines.'

"He spoke as confidently as if a thousand-dollar license hung on the wall. When I left the place two policemen were standing near by and I asked them how often they fined the saloonkeeper in question, but they could give me no satisfactory answer. The place was free and open to all corners. Even women were constantly running in and out, carrying pails containing beer and ale.

"This is the state of things in all the large towns of Maine. Of course, if one wants to be blind to the facts and simply walks up and down the streets of the town looking for signs, he can easily go out of the State and still believe that prohibition prohibits in Maine.

**Bar in a Drug Store.**

"The day after my arrival in the State I began my investigations unaided and unaccompanied, depending upon my disguise to carry me through. Not a soul was in my confidence except those in my boarding place. My object was to see if a stranger could get liquor.

"As I was anxious to begin my investigations as soon as possible I entered the first restaurant I encountered and asked for beer. The waiter replied, 'We have none, but you can get all you want at the hotel across the street.' I went over there and was accommodated.

"Next I entered a drugstore, so called, and found a bar, with all the usual fixtures of the modern saloon. The bartender, in a nonchalant manner, drew me off a glass of beer, for which I paid five cents.

"Later I entered several restaurants. All had bars, which were conducted quite as openly as if the place had been licensed.

"The Republican party is for retaining the law as a venerable institution and honorable name. The Democrats are for enforcement—at least, that is their platform. They accuse the dominant party of treachery and dishonesty. The Prohibitionists are discouraged and weak, while the church appears to be either indifferent or discouraged and waits to act until there is a better state of things in Maine.

"In conclusion, I might say that I believe that no more flagrant violation of liquor laws can be found in the United States than in Maine. The good old State is dishonoring the illustrious name of her great prohibition reformer, Dow, whose home was in the very town where the laws are most frequently set at naught—Portland."

Mr. Gamble's experience and the facts which he states bear witness that in morals as in other things "a stream can not rise above its source." It is impossible for the people of Maine, or any other State, to make themselves any better by law.

It is likewise true that statutes in advance of the moral sense of the people, cannot be enforced—that is, such laws will not be enforced except spasmodically. There can be no uniform operation of such a law. It is more than likely to be used for purposes of blackmail. It places temptation in the way of officers of the law and so corrupts the administration of justice.

That the liquor traffic ought to be abolished admits of no question, but it is more than doubtful if prohibition can be made effective unless supported by such an overwhelming public sentiment as to make it unnecessary; for a people who are at heart opposed to liquor drinking will not drink. Saloons would starve to death among them. The failure of the Maine law only emphasizes the truth that "there is no help in man." B.
