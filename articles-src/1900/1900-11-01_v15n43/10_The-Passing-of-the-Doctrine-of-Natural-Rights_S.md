Last week we called attention to the ground taken by a leading American journal, the *Outlook*, edited by Lyman Abbott, in declaring the straight National Reform doctrine that the proper basis of civil government is not the consent of the governed but the law of God. And now comes another leading American journal, the *Independent*, and declares that the doctrine of natural rights must be set aside as an outgrown tradition; that, in fact, it is "likely to gasp out its last breath in the pending campaign," and that the only rule that can be followed in government is that of "the greatest good to the greatest number."

Such avowals from leading American journals are startling, and would be so to Americans everywhere but for the teaching assiduously put forth by influential Americans the past two years, leading away from the ideals of republican government.

"One of the theories which has suffered most in these critical days," says the *Independent*, "is that of 'natural rights.' It is true that it has been reiterated in very recent times and by a man conspicuously learned and able, the philosopher Spencer. And yet," affirms the Independent, "though buttressed by so eminent a name, it has failed to make any distinct impress on the age, and the revolt against it grows apace." The Independent seems not to recollect that this doctrine of natural rights has all through the century been standing in the Declaration of Independence, than which there has been no higher political authority for Americans, and is strangely oblivious to the fact that the Declaration of Independence has during this whole century most profoundly affected the political ideals and ambitions of men throughout the civilized world.

## No Such Thing as a Real Right.

"The fundamental principle in social conduct, according to Spencer," continues the Independent, "is this: 'Every man has the right to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.' So stated," says the Independent, "it meets with well nigh universal approval. But," it says, "the moment it is sought to determine what constitutes infringement, there arises a world of interpretations so diverse and numerous that if order is to be maintained on the planet, organized society, the state, must step in and compromise. As for particular 'rights,' to be fundamental, to be real rights, they must be of universal applicability." Then the Independent inquires, "Can any one point to a postulate of a 'right' which for any considerable time, by any considerable number of men, has been held to be absolute, unqualified by time, place or circumstance?" The conclusion is that there is no such thing as a "real right." "What one man declares to be a 'right'," it says, "another declares a wrong; that which one generation holds to be natural and inalienable, the next generation considers unnatural and promptly alienates." "No society finds it possible to acknowledge an 'inalienable right' to life. * * * In every part of the world society finds it necessary to determine the conditions under which its members shall live, not on the basis of universal moral law, but on that of social justice, which is but another name for social expediency. 'Rights' thus resolve themselves into postulates born of particular times, places, and conditions." Such is the Independent's conclusion, which amounts to saying that there is no such thing as a natural right; that is, a right which a person has by virtue of his creation.

The doctrine of government by consent of the governed, the Independent finds, very naturally, to be equally far from being a "self-evident truth." "Examined judicially," it declares, this principle "is seen to be impossible, since it violates the fundamental assumption of every state—the assumption of power to determine what is best for the continuance of its own life. Examined historically, it is seen that no people has ever acknowledged it in practise." The Independent does not believe that "the fathers who promulgated it" could have "entirely meant it." If they had been of "an exacter turn of mind," they would have specified many exceptions to the rule, as in the case of females, minors, slaves, inhabitants of the territory not yet admitted into the union of states, etc.

## A New Basis of Government.

From all this the Independent arrives at the conclusion before stated, which it puts as follows: "This absolute generalization regarding consent, disregarded by its formulators, and practically disavowed by every state that has ever existed, is likely to gasp out its last breath in the pending campaign. The progressive democratic philosophy of to-day is building the coming state in the light of considerations of social ends. It postulates nothing, it analyzes and decomposes old principles and theories, it concerns itself not with 'rights' but with duties, with social adaptations, with an ideal of 'the greatest good to the greatest number,' as that greatest good may be determined by experiences of fact."

This sweeps aside at once the whole system of American republican government set up a century ago upon the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and which has continued unquestioned by Americans down to the time of the capture of Manila. No more natural rights, no more consent of the governed, neither in the Philippines nor in America, but only the principle of "the greatest good to the greatest number," to be operated according to the dictates of expediency,—such is the basis to which American free government is being rapidly shifted before our eyes.

How will this affect the American people? This is simply to ask how it will affect an individual to deny that he has any natural rights, that his consent is necessary to his government, and to hold every interest that he may have subject to what men may consider "the greatest good to the greatest number." Let us consider a case for illustration.

## An Illustration.

Here is an individual who observes the seventh day as the Sabbath, according to the specifications of the fourth commandment. A committee of his neighbors, headed by a clergyman, visits him and informs him that he must keep Sunday.

"But," he says, "my conscience tells me that the seventh day is the Sabbath, and I can not keep two days in the week. I can not sanctify the seventh day without regarding the other days of the week as working days."

"The Christian Sabbath is not the seventh day of the week but the first day," is the reply; "and you must observe it. This is a Christian nation and you must observe the rest day fixed upon by the majority of the people. That is the law of the land."

"But it is my right," says the seventh-day Christian, "to be guided by my own conscience in the matter of Sabbath observance. The constitution of the State declares that 'every man has a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience.'"

These words only provoke a mocking laugh. "Ho, ho, here is a man who clings to that old theory of natural rights! Why, my friend, that theory is all out of date. The progressive democratic philosophy of to-day has exploded those old notions of our fathers about natural rights and the consent of the governed. They were well enough in theory but they weren't capable of application to existing conditions in this government. If men were allowed to claim that they have natural, inalienable rights which the government must respect, some men would claim one thing and some another, and society and the government would be thrown into hopeless confusion. We have got to be guided now by what is expedient."

"And," adds the clergyman, "the constitution of the state is wrong in allowing that men may do as they please in matters of religion. That was the work of political atheists and it must be changed. Civil government, it is now recognized, rests not upon what men may will, but upon the law of God."

"But," persists the observer of the seventh day, "I am bound by the law of God, which says that the seventh day is the day to be observed as the Sabbath."

"The seventh day is not the Sabbath," rejoins the clergyman, sharply. "In this country it is settled that the first day is the Sabbath; public opinion and practise are overwhelming upon this point. The courts have declared it, Congress has declared it, and you can not be permitted to set up your opinion against the authority of the nation. You can not be permitted to teach anarchy."

"But my conscience—have I no right to that?" exclaims the one thus addressed.

"You have no right to set up your individual conscience against the national conscience," is the reply. "As we have said, it is not a question of your rights. That doctrine can not justify you, for it has had its day and been set aside. What must be secured in this nation is the greatest good to the greatest number. All are now agreed upon this, and the greatest good to the greatest number requires that all observe the first day of the week. We must have uniformity in this matter. So I repeat, you must hereafter observe the first day of the week. The public good demands it, and the state must see that this rule is firmly enforced."

So, instead of being able to claim the individual right of conscience in the matter of Sabbath observance, the dissenter from popular religious custom has nothing left to stand on but "the greatest good to the greatest number," and when he can prove that his freedom in religion is for the greatest good of the greatest number he will be allowed to worship differently from the majority and not before. But how long will it take an individual to prove that it is for the greatest good to the greatest number that he be allowed to observe the seventh day of the week instead of the first, in the face of popular teaching and custom touching this point?

As the result of such teaching as that we have quoted from the Outlook and the Independent, the fundamental American doctrine of natural, individual rights is being swept from under the feet of the American people; it is passing rapidly away before our eyes, and who is amazed or alarmed at the spectacle? It is high time indeed that the people everywhere should see and know what these things mean.
