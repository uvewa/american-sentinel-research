THE Canadian Baptist reports that no person can obtain the position of conductor on the Toronto Street Railway unless he is willing to work on Sunday, and says that this and the operating of other lines of business on Sunday "not only robs many of the Sabbath rest, but it robs those who will not give up their day of worship, of employment." But the Baptist seems to forget that no person can be deprived of the Sabbath except with his own consent, for Sabbath desecration is a sin, and no person is obliged to commit sin. Any person who prizes the Sabbath as he ought will hold on to it, and he who gives it up does so for the same reason that caused Esau of old to part with his birthright. And as for robbing people of employment, it is to be observed that either the Sabbath-keeping people or some others must be "robbed" of employment; for all cannot be employed, and where one is taken on another must be dismissed or some other applicant for the same position must be turned away.

When we look closely at the facts that are alleged to make out a case for enforcing Sunday observance, we always find that there is no good reason for summoning the power of the state to help an individual to be a Christian.
