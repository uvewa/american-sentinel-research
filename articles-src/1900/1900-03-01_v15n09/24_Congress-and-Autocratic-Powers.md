The Constitution aside, ought there to be possible in this country such a thing as a Congress possessing autocratic powers, subject to no review by the supreme court? Hitherto in the history of the Republic the United States supreme court has always stood above the legislative power, checking and restraining its excesses in so far as they violated the fundamental law. But now it is proposed to throw aside the supreme court and leave Congress with full power over at least 10,000,000 of human beings, very many of whom are advanced in civilization. The principle of absolutism, against which our Revolutionary fathers rebelled, and against which this Republic has stood, until now, as a living protest, is thus introduced as an active force for the first time in our republican system. No smooth words can explain away this advance of despotic principles at the expense of constitutional government in the United States of America.
