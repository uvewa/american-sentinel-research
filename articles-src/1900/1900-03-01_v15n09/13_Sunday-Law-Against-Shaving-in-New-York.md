An obstacle in the way of the enforcement of the New York City Sunday law against shaving, has been discovered by a Brooklyn lawyer who was counsel for a barber recently arrested for the crime of shaving a customer after 1 o'clock P. M. The law provides that first "offenders" upon conviction, "shall be fined not more than $5; and upon a second conviction for a like offense shall be fined not less than $10 and not more than $25, or be imprisoned," etc. Jacob Strubel, having been convicted and fined $5, said he had not the money to pay, and when his counsel called the attention of Justice Fitzgerald to the wording of the law, which says nothing about the alternative of imprisonment for first offenses, the prisoner was discharged.
