This then is the doctrine of the new imperialism:

Congress has "plenary powers" over our new possessions.

The inhabitants of the annexed islands have no rights except such as Congress may grant them.

They are not entitled to any of the guarantees of the Constitution as to jury trial, free speech, a free press, the right of petition and of peaceable assemblage, freedom from search and unwarrantable arrest.

And whatever injury this peaceable Republic may and surely will receive from the dangerous graft of militarism upon our system and the injected poison of subject races of savages, hybrids and aliens, "our protected interests"—the great campaign contributors—are "not to be injured." The Republic may perish, but the monopolies must be preserved.
