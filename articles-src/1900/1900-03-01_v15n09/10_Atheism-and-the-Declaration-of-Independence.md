THE Torch of Reason, a western paper, which is an exponent of atheistic "liberality," said in a recent issue that "no man or woman should have the right to do wrong, and that the majority interested should have the say as to what is right and what is wrong; and that it is, generally speaking, the duty of every citizen to yield a ready obedience to the voice of the people the same as a child should readily obey its parents."

***

This is the natural logic of atheism, since it ignores the Creator altogether. The doctrine of freedom in government is that "all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," and that it is the proper business of civil government to preserve these rights of the individual. But if there is no Creator, as atheism asserts, then of course men are not "created equal," and the highest authority upon any question of right and justice is the people themselves. And this simply gives to the majority the authority to decide what is right in every matter, both civil and religious, and to oblige the individual to conform his life altogether as it may dictate, just as a child must submit to the dictates of its parents. It sweeps away individual rights altogether; for such a right is one which no majority can set aside. If the majority can rule in all things, then there can be no such thing as an individual right.

Thus atheism repudiates the Declaration of Independence, and betrays its essential oneness with the governmental theory of the papacy and of National Reform.

***

The American theory of government enunciated in the Declaration of Independence is the Christian theory, as stated by Christ himself in the language, "Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's." If there is no God, then we must necessarily render all things to Cæsar, and be answerable to him in religious things as well as in things civil. We would be amenable in all things to human authority. The papal theory of government demands submission in all things to the authority of the pope—a human being—and the National Reform theory demands submission in all things to the "law of Christ," as interpreted by human authority. Thus all three demand the same thing; all three ignore the Creator, differing on this point only in their methods. All three stand opposed to the Christian and American theory which exalts the individual by recognizing in him that which is too sacred to be subject to merely human authority and of which no human power can rightfully dispossess him.
