A union of the state with religion produces the same results that follow from a union of the state with the church; namely, the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters from the state's, or the state church's, religion. And as the tree is known by its fruit, it must be concluded that union of religion and the state, and the union of church and state, are things which differ only in name.
