In introducing the following quotation we think of two things that are quite strange.

One is that the members of the United States Senate—the highest deliberative body in this country—have a better opportunity for free speech and an untrammeled expression of their opinions, than have the members of possibly any other assembly in the country from the national House of Representatives down to the most unpretentious town meeting. This freedom is naturally expected to be greatest in primary assemblies, and its curtailment is naturally expected to be most pronounced in those assemblies farthest removed from the people. This strange thing, however, is not likely to remain long, as it is now proposed by a member of that body that "all resolutions shall be referred without debate, . . . unless the Senate by unanimous consent orders otherwise." The express object of this resolution is to shut off completely such timely and truthful utterances as we quote below.

The other strange thing is that there are a large number of people who see nothing inconsistent between the present attitude of the American Government toward liberty and human rights and its attitude throughout its whole history up to within less than two years ago. They admit that the succession of events has been rapid, but they insist that the "Republic" is simply making swifter and greater progress in the direction that it has always pursued; that it is simply hastening to its legitimate destiny and accomplishing the great purpose for which it exists. We are told that "For ages has Asia waited for America to be born, and to grow to her present strength," and that the time has come for her to assume her "responsibilities" and to discharge her "obligations."

To such people and to all others who have any doubts as to whether or not the American Government is repudiating the principles of republican government of which it has been the grand exponent for over a century, we commend the following earnest and able words spoken by Hon. A. O. Bacon, of Georgia, in the United States Senate, January 30:—

"Revolution means a turning over. In political matters it is used to signify a complete or radical change. There could scarcely be a more complete or radical change in the institutions of a country than a change from a condition where all were free citizens and none were subject vassals, to a condition where in a particular locality all are subject vassals and none are free citizens; a change from a condition where all are allowed through their votes to participate in determining the legislation of the General Government, to a condition in a particular locality where all are made subject to laws in the making of which they are forever denied the privilege of having a voice; a change from a condition in which the people have all the rights, powers and privileges of sovereign statehood, to a condition where for all time they are to be allowed no governmental organization of their own excepting only such dependent organization as they are permitted to maintain at the will and pleasure of the General Government.

"The proposition is not to be successfully controverted that such radical changes in the principles and practises of our Government will constitute a revolution of the most pronounced type.

"If, therefore, the acquired territory is to be permanently held without statehood and without the privilege or right of their people to participate directly or indirectly in the enactment of the laws of the General Government by which they are to be governed, and if it is impossible that they can ever be given such privileges and rights, the permanent retention of these islands is an expansion of territory without the extension of our system of government; it is an expansion which destroys to that extent our political principles and our governmental ideals; it is an expansion which is neither the natural growth nor the legitimate development of our system of government, but it is an expansion which is a revolution in that system.

"The conditions which now exist, and which will undoubtedly exist hereafter if we permanently retain the Philippines, make it impossible that they can ever become a State; and to hold them as a subject colony makes necessary a revolution in our system of government which should not be aided by anyone who is loyal to the principles upon which that system was founded. It is a revolution which requires those who support it to deny the most venerated principles contained in the Declaration of Independence, and compels them to openly challenge and dispute their truth. It is a revolution which tramples under foot the warnings and precepts of Washington's Farewell Address, which we have heretofore reverently read in this chamber upon each recurring anniversary, and the teachings of which the American people have held as sacred for more than a hundred years. It is a revolution which utterly scouts and derides the principles which have inspired in us the contemplation of a Republican government as a sacred thing, and which has heretofore caused us to make haste to recognize every Republican government which has been set up by those who have overthrown any form of monarchical government. It is a revolution which palsies our tongue when we would give voice to our sympathy for any people struggling for liberty anywhere on the earth, and makes us with accusing conscience sit in dumb silence for fear the accusing finger may be pointed at us. Nay, more, Mr. President, it is a revolution which, while it denies liberty to other people, endangers the liberty of our own people.

"Senators cannot fail to recognize that a people to preserve their own liberties must be true to the principles upon which their liberties rest. They must not only be true to the principles of liberty as applied to themselves and as enjoyed by themselves, but they must be loyal to those principles in according the enjoyment of them to others. The man who teaches his children that they can with propriety violate the Decalogue in dealing with the property of his neighbor and the persons of his neighbor's family, cannot promote or maintain personal honesty or personal virtue within the precincts of his own household.

"The advocates of the permanent retention of the Philippines do not like to hear the term 'vassal.' Nevertheless, one who is the subject of a government in which he has no voice, who only has such liberty as the government may grant him, and which itself may be taken from him at the will of the government, is a vassal. And that is the only political relation the Filipino can ever bear to the United States. The advocates of permanent retention do not like the term 'imperialism.' Nevertheless, whenever a republic owns outlying provinces, to be held permanently as dependent colonies, never to be admitted as a part of the republic in the control and administration of the government, that republic is to that extent imperial. And, if held permanently, that is the only relation which the Philippine Islands can ever bear to the United States.

"Ah, sir, it is true that the terms 'vassal' and 'imperial' grate on American ears. They are terms expressive of conditions violative of every principle of the free institutions of America. They are terms expressive of conditions utterly at war with the principles which Americans during three generations have drank in with their mothers' milk.

"To bring about such conditions and make them permanent which necessarily result in imperialism and vassalage, is, I repeat, to revolutionize the Government, because heretofore we have had no imperial colonies and no vassals, and we have vaunted political principles which have made it impossible that we should have either the one or the other.

"Now, sir, I use the term 'revolution' because it is the one which properly expresses the fact. The proposition is this: That to permanently retain territory which it is known can never become a State and the people of which it is also known can never be admitted to participation in the legislation and administration either of a State or of the General Government, people who must be ruled by a standing army in their midst, is to work a revolution in the system of government as it has heretofore existed in the United States—a revolution of the most radical and far-reaching character.

"There can be no such thing as an imperial republic. It will either be an empire or a republic. Under the name imperial republic, the form of a republic may be preserved; but the soul-and spirit of republican institutions will surely die. To speak of an imperial republic, true to republican principles and institutions, is to speak of a free autocracy or a Christian infidel, or a law-abiding lawbreaker.

"I desire to say that the man who compares the proposed expansion, and the effects which must necessarily follow it, to the expansion of the past which has come from the acquisition of the territory acquired from France or from Mexico or from Spain before the late war; the man who says they are alike; the man who says that the one may be taken as the authority and the defense of the other, is either woefully lacking in candor or still more woefully lacking in information, because they are as wide apart as the poles and as different as night is from day. The one is the expansion and extension of free government and free institutions; the other is the destruction of free institutions and the birth and growth of imperial rule."
