While the National Reformers and their religious allies are shouting about the necessity of so reforming the Government that it will become Christian, to some disinterested observers it is apparent that it is in the church itself, and not in the Government, that a Christian reformation is needed. Here, for example, is what the New York Sun says on the point in a recent issue, under the heading, "Devices to Stimulate Church-going":—

"That there is actually a decrease in churchgoing at the present time, as alleged by so many of our correspondents, seems to be indicated by the extraordinary devices now in vogue in many places to induce people to go to the churches. The managers of traveling shows are not more fertile in artful advertising schemes, and their trickery to excite the popular curiosity is not more sensational, more vulgar and more catchpenny.

"Of late we have printed extracts, largely from religious papers, giving descriptions of these devices. They have included 'chicken suppers,' the introduction of 'lady ushers,' 'kissing games,' 'mock marriages,' and no end of other diversions in a similar scale of vulgarity. One of the heaviest tasks imposed on the ingenuity of many pastors and church and Sunday school officials seems to be to rack their brains to get up fresh novelties of this sort in competition with other churches engaged in concocting original and startling advertising devices for a like purpose.

"The latest rivalry in this business has taken place at New Brunswick, according to newspaper reports, and it has resulted in an absolutely novel entertainment by the Epworth League of the Methodist Church of that town. This was called 'A Single-hearted Confession Sociable,' and was an open confessional where unmarried young men and women were called on to tell publicly 'why we have never married.' It is said to have been extraordinarily successful as a mirth-provoking entertainment, the confessions being greeted with 'great cheers and laughter' by a crowded audience. . . .

"If that is the price which must be paid for filling a church most people will be of the opinion that it had better go empty."
