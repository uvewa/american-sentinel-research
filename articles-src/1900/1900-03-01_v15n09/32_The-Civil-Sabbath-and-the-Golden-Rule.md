THE "civil Sabbath" is an alleged necessity of these times; yet if the men who are calling for it and expect to make so much use of it, would be perfectly civil in their own conduct, the "civil Sabbath" would amount to nothing. If they would admit the necessity of the Golden Rule, and practise it, they would never interfere with the religion of their neighbors in the way that the "civil Sabbath" is designed to justify them in doing.
