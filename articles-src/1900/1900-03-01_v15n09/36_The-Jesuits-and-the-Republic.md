WE have received from the "Truth Seeker Company," of this city, a booklet giving the "Secret Instructions of the Jesuits;" being a reprint of a publication which appeared in 1723, in Amsterdam. We have no reason to doubt the genuineness of these "Secret Instructions." They were designed by the Society of Loyola to be kept very secret, and if by mischance they should fall into the hands of the public, the members were instructed to deny that they were the rules of the Society. Their publication however probably does little harm to the Jesuits and accomplishes little good for the cause to which that Society stands opposed. For the Jesuits have by no means a monopoly of the evil principles which their "Secret Instructions" embody; if they had such a monopoly, they could accomplish little harm in the world. But the trouble is that they exist to a greater or less extent in every heart where principle is subverted to policy, in every life that is devoted to the service of self. It is the general prevalence of this decadent spirit, rather than the machinations of the Jesuits, that is menacing the perpetuity of liberty and just government in the earth.
