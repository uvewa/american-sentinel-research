[In an exchange we note the following with reference to the situation in Baltimore, Md., growing out of the recent crusade for the enforcement of Sunday observance in that place:—]

The ancient Sunday law of Maryland, passed in 1723 A. D., reads as follows:—

"No person shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and no person having children or servants shall command or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity or charity always excepted), nor shall any one suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastime or recreation."

Urged forward by the Sunday reformers, the authorities of Baltimore ordered the rigid enforcement of the law. An order was issued to the entire police force for Sunday, Jan. 28, 1900, to note all violations of this law. It was announced that this order included cigar dealers, grocers, meat dealers, messenger boys, hackmen, coachmen, saloon-keepers, drivers, bootblacks, fruit dealers, soda-water dealers, ice-cream dealers, newsboys, lunch-room dealers, clerks, typewriters, confectioners, stationers, etc., etc.

Such was the program for January 28. As a result hundreds of violators and of witnesses who were registered by the police, gave fictitious names, and the plans of the Grand Jury were thwarted. The movement which the friends of Sunday had urged was turned into a movement against the ancient law by inducing steps for a new statute. Hence we have the following report, through the New York Tribune, of the situation one week later. Under date, Feb. 3, 1900, its Baltimore correspondent says:—

"The Blue Laws will not be enforced so rigidly tomorrow, for the reason that the Grand Jury has about six thousand witnesses of violations of the law already on its hands, and it is not anxious to have that number doubled by the police to-morrow. At a conference of the police authorities to-day it was decided to make exceptions to-morrow in the cases of newsboys, bootblacks, baggage-wagon drivers, elevator boys and cabmen. It is apparent that it is impossible to enforce the laws, made 172 years ago, without stopping street-cars, newspapers, and even cooks and servants from performing duties. The bill for the modification of the laws now in the legislature will probably be passed next week and permit those members of the Grand Jury who insisted on a rigid enforcement of the old laws to get out of an embarrassing position."—Sabbath Recorder.
