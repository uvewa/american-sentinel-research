In the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress, agreed to at Philadelphia, October 14, 1774, four acts of the British Parliament, one of them being "An act for making more effectual provision for the government of the Province of Quebec, etc.," were solemnly declared to be "impolitic, unjust, and cruel, as well as unconstitutional, and most dangerous and destructive of American rights."

And again, in the same document, in the enumeration of "such acts and measures as have been adopted since the late war, which demonstrate a system formed to enslave America," the Quebec Act is included; and it is there spoken of as an act "for establishing the Roman Catholic religion in the Province of Quebec, abolishing the equitable system of English laws, and erecting a tyranny there, to the great danger (from so total a dissimilarity of religion, law, and government) of the neighboring British colonies, by the assistance of whose blood and treasure the said country was conquered from France."

In the famous address to the people of Great Britain approved October 21, 1774, Congress said:—

> "Know then that we think the legislature of Great Britain is not authorized by the Constitution to establish a religion fraught with sanguinary and impious tenets, or to erect an arbitrary form of government, in any quarter of the globe. . . .

> "At the conclusion of the late war—a war rendered glorious by the abilities and integrity of a minister to whose efforts the British empire owes its safety and its fame—at the conclusion of this war, which was succeeded by an inglorious peace, formed under the auspices of a minister of principles and a family unfriendly to the Protestant cause, and inimical to liberty. We say at this period, and under the influence of that man, a plan for enslaving your fellow subjects in America was concerted. . . .

> "To promote these designs, another measure has been pursued. In the session of Parliament last mentioned, an act was passed for changing the government of Quebec, by which the Roman Catholic religion, instead of being tolerated, as stipulated in the treaty of peace, is established; and the people there are deprived of a right to an assembly. Trials by jury, and the English laws in civil cases are abolished. And instead thereof, the French laws are established, in direct violation of his majesty's promise in his royal proclamation, under the faith of which many English subjects settled in that province. And the limits of that province are extended so as to comprehend those vast regions that lie adjoining to the northerly and westerly boundaries of these colonies.

> "The authors of this arbitrary measure flatter themselves that the inhabitants [of Canada], deprived of liberty, and artfully provoked against those of another religion, will be proper instruments for assisting in the oppression of such as differ from them in modes of government and faith.—Journals of Congress, Vol. 1, p. 54.

> "This was evidently the object of the act. And in this view, being extremely dangerous to our liberty and quiet, we cannot forbear complaining of it, as hostile to British America. Superadded to these considerations, we cannot help deploring the unhappy condition to which it has reduced the many English settlers, who, encouraged by the royal proclamation promising enjoyment of all their rights, have purchased estates in that country. They are now the subjects of an arbitrary government, are deprived of trial by jury, and when imprisoned, cannot claim the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus. Nor can we suppress our astonishment that a British Parliament should ever consent to establish in that country, a religion that has deluged your island in blood, and dispersed impiety, bigotry, persecution, murder, and rebellion through every part of the world."—Journals of Congress, Vol. 1, pp. 44, 45.

In the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms, adopted July 6, 1775, the Quebec Act is referred to as a statute passed "for erecting in a neighboring province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Britain and America, a despotism dangerous to our very existence."

In the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, the same view of the Quebec Act is expressed by pronouncing it to be an act "for abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies."

The Quebec Act had its inception in the Vatican, and is a shocking instance of the insidious methods and perpetual intermeddling of the Roman pontiff in the political affairs even of Protestant nations. It is a well-established historical fact that Mgr. Guarandoti, who was secretary of the Propaganda under Pope Pius VII, wrote a letter to the British Cabinet ministers in which he enlarged upon the advantages of "the Canadian check," and in the most seductive terms explained what an excellent thing it would be to have a proper understanding between King George III and Pope Pius VII. In this letter he also declared that the church would always in the future, as in the past, inculcate loyalty, obedience, and respect for sovereigns, and that her influence would be entirely against any revolutionary movements; calling attention especially to the fact that the spirit of independence in America at that time was confined exclusively to the Protestant colonies south of the St. Lawrence; that it was the Protestant colonies which resisted tyranny, while the Catholic colonies of Canada remained faithful to his majesty!

The Quebec Act was designed to create two factions in British America, divided on religious, racial, and territorial lines, either of which might, when occasion arose, be used as an engine to keep the other in perpetual subjection to the central authority at London. It was not doubted that the animosities engendered by a long series of wars in the past could be kept alive as a convenient leverage for oppression by allowing Quebec to retain its Bourbon constitution.

**THE TEXAS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.**

In the "unanimous Declaration of Independence, made by the delegates of the people of Texas at the town of Washington on the 2nd day of March, 1836," I find the following expressions:—

"The Mexican nation has acquiesced in the changes made in the government by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who, having overturned the constitution of his country, now offers us the cruel alternative, either to abandon our homes, acquired by so many privations, or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny, the combined despotism of the sword and the priesthood."

The Mexican government now "denies us the right of worshiping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own consciences, by the support of a national religion calculated to promote the interests of its human functionary rather than the glory of the true and ever-living God. . . .

"It has failed to establish any public system of education, although possessed of almost boundless resources in the public domain. . . .

"It has failed and refused to secure on a firm basis the right of trial by jury.

"It has suffered the military commandants stationed among us to exercise arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny. . . .

"The Mexican government is a consolidated, central, military despotism, in which every interest is disregarded but that of the army and priesthood, both the eternal enemies of civil liberty, the ever-ready minions of power, and the usual instruments of tyrants."

"Lord God of Hosts! be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget!"

Washington, D. C.
