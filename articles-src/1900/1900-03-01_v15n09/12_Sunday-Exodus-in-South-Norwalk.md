An exchange notes that "by enforcing a puritanic Sunday law in South Norwalk, Conn., the mayor has inaugurated a Sunday exodus to Norwalk, a mile distant, where trade is permitted the first day of the week. Hence, if Sunday trade is a sin, the bigots have not lessened the evil by closing the South Norwalk stores, but they have caused to be added to the felony of Sunday traffic the offence of walking otherwise than 'reverently to and from church.'"
