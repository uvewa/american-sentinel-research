**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:** The anti-saloon league in Denver, Col., headed by Rev. R. A. Chase, is working hard to have the midnight and Sunday-closing ordinance enforced. Rev. Chase and his secretary are visiting saloons and gambling houses as spies, and have already brought before the district attorney about fifty indictments, and they purpose to keep at it until they succeed in stopping all of this bad work going on after midnight or on Sunday.

How much better if these brethren would work in a fair and open manner for the conversion and salvation of these men who are running these saloons and gambling places, and if they should succeed, then they would shut up their places of destruction every day in the week and all the time, and would do it voluntarily because of love for the right. A Christian cannot be a spy or an inquisitor and work for souls.

G. W. ANGLEBARGER.
