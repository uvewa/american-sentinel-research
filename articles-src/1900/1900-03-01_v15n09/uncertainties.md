## Specific Uncertainties

### Article 08 — "A Revolution of the Most Radical and Far-Reaching Character" (by John D. Bradley)
- **Attribution:** The article is signed "JOHN D. BRADLEY" at the end but this name does not appear in the known authors list. Transcribed as `attribution: "explicit"` with `author_short: "JDB"`. This may be a reader contributor rather than a regular author.

### Article 19 — "How Trusts Work" (by J. O. Beard)
- **Attribution:** "J. O. BEARD" does not appear in the known authors list. Transcribed as explicit with `author_short: "JOB"`. Likely a reader contributor.

### Article 16 — "An Open Letter to the Governor of New Hampshire" (by G. E. Judd)
- **Attribution:** "G. E. JUDD" of Lisbon, N.H., not in known authors list. Reader contributor. Transcribed as explicit with `author_short: "GEJ"`.

### Article 17 — "Popular Blindness" (by Clifford G. Howell)
- **Attribution:** "CLIFFORD G. HOWELL" of Brighton, Mich., not in known authors list. Reader contributor. Transcribed as explicit with `author_short: "CGH"`.

### Article 18 — "A Mistaken Calling for Christians" (by G. W. Anglebarger)
- **Attribution:** "G. W. ANGLEBARGER" of Alamosa, Col., not in known authors list. Reader contributor. Transcribed as explicit with `author_short: "GWA"`.

### Articles 01–04 (p. 1 editorial paragraphs)
- **Structure:** The four short editorial paragraphs on page 1 before the main "National Reform" article have no titles. Titles have been supplied descriptively for file naming. The paragraphs are clearly distinct items.

### Page 8 Section Structure
- The `***` separators on page 8 group what appear to be separate editorial notes. Items were split into individual files (articles 10–13) based on clear thematic breaks, though the `***` pattern could also indicate paragraphs within a single extended note. The thematic distinctness of each item supports treating them separately.

### Article 09 — "The Liberality of the Papal Church under Leo XIII"
- **Attribution:** The OCR shows `*William Burt, D. D. (Methodist), in N. Y. "Christian Advocate."*` as the byline. This is clearly a reprint from the N. Y. Christian Advocate authored by William Burt. Treated as `attribution: "reprint"` with `original_publication: "N. Y. Christian Advocate"`.

### Page 13 Short Items
- Items following "Juggling With the Constitution" on pages 12-13 include three distinct items. The N. Y. World excerpt has no explicit attribution marker at the start (unlike the Springfield Republican items which are labeled). Context confirms it is from the N. Y. World per the closing attribution `—N. Y. World.` The Boston Post excerpt closes with `—Boston Post.` Both treated as reprints accordingly.

### Article 27 — Russia Military vs. Education
- **Attribution:** Closes with `—Canadian Baptist.` Treated as a reprint from the Canadian Baptist.
