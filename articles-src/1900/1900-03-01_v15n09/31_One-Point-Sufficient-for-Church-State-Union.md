It is not necessary to a union of church and state, that the two should be united to enforce religious beliefs and observances in general. A single point, as for example, the observance of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, is sufficient basis for as real a union of church and state as ever existed. The results to all dissenters from this church dogma will be precisely the same—fines, imprisonment, etc.—that would follow to dissenters under the most obvious union of church and state that was ever known.
