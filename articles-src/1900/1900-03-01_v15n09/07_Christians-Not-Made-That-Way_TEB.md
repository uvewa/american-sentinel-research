The Sunday-closing measures so strictly enforced at the instigation of the church people recently in Baltimore gave many practical illustrations as to the real working of these obsolete laws.

No hearts were made better. No tender feelings drawn forth toward God for his great love manifested to the children of men in so many ways. Instead of making men better, they were driven into the hypocrite's seat, or made to hate a little more intensely all that passes for religion. These feelings found vent in many slurring placards displayed in store windows. Here are a few:—

"For it is decreed that man was made for the Sabbath."

"Gone to church; go thou and do likewise."

A drug store had this:—

"We sell nothing but medicines, although we protest that it is a grave mistake for law-abiding citizens to fall sick on the Sabbath; as it necessitates the employment of physicians and diverts the minds of patients and their families from devotional exercise. As, however, we must keep open our store to supply such physical wants on this day, we shall, as far as it lies within our power, enter into the spirit of the new order of things, brought about by the truly good people of this community. To this end we will on this day offer spiritual advice and treatment gratis to all who may apply."

Here is some clerical advice given free, although you notice pardon is asked for giving it on Sunday, the clergys' busy day:—

"Not that we wish to enter into unseemly competition with the clergy during their business hours, but that between whiles the hardened sinner and impious Sabbath-breaker may be thus warned away from evil thoughts and removed from the temptations of idleness to the betterment of his spiritual welfare and to the edification of the truly good, whose tender, unselfish hearts throb with an altruistic ecstasy born of humility and charity. Therefore, we beseech you be not cast down, but with contrite heart, curb your desires."

But the following notice is especially noteworthy as showing how the religious people are regarded by the worldly people, and how futile is the effort to make people better by law:—

"And that it may direct you to a spirit of emulation, observe well the moral attitude and seraphic countenance of the elect and truly good, [italics ours] for they walk abroad and are plainly visible to the common herd, and may be known by the gentleness of their demeanor and the length of their faces."

Who can imagine they are doing Jesus Christ service in enforcing such laws? Surely they know not what spirit they are of, any more than did the disciples of old when they asked Jesus to permit them to call down fire from heaven and destroy the Samaritans for not receiving their Lord. If we have not the spirit of Christ, we are none of his.
