It is surprising to see how many good people are led to smother their natural feelings of kindness and sympathy for the oppressed, and seek to justify this Government and England in fighting weaker peoples, while clinging to the delusive idea that the gospel may be advanced by such means.

Many are weighing the situation; and were the higher sensibilities of their own hearts to prevail, they would decide in favor of those who are fighting for their rights, and against those who are fighting only for gain and glory. But glowing and misleading presentations hide the true issues, and right is lost sight of.

To hope that the cause of righteousness may be served by the same means which minister to pride, avarice, and oppression, is to build upon the sand.

Your readers are much indebted to the SENTINEL for standing guard over the dearest rights of mankind, and for portraying the inwardness and the outcome of the evil theory that "might makes right.."
