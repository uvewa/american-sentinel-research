A story, almost incredible, comes from Manila, to the effect that a Filipino soldier, captured in a recent skirmish, is to be tried before a military commission on the charge of assault with intent to kill, or of murder in case actual killing can be established.

This would be simply intolerable. It was on a similar plea that Weyler and other military governors in Cuba justified their butcheries. The men who were fighting for liberty were styled brigands and outlaws, and they were treated as criminals when they fell into the hands of the Spaniards. It was this practise which, as much as anything else, outraged the sense of the civilized world and especially aroused the resentment of the American people. It was to put a stop to the killing of soldiers on the pretext that they were committing crime and not in fair combat, that the United States drove Spain out of this hemisphere.

We do not want to play in the Philippines the shameful game that Spain played in Cuba. The American people will not endure it. We may confidently hope that this tale of the treatment of captured Filipino soldiers other than as prisoners of war will be found imaginary.
