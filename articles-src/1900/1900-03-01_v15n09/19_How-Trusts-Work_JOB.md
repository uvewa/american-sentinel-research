There are no trusts now, for all trusts have changed their form of organization so that they are business corporations. So in looking for the results of trusts we must study the operations of the great corporations of the country.

On Dec. 1, 1899, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company reduced the wages of its "steel gang" and "bridge men" from $1.25 to $1.15 per day and "section men" from $1.15 to $1.00 per day. The two former are away from home for nearly all their work, and have to pay an average of $3.50 per week for board. If they could work full time, six days, they could only earn $6.90, and after they had paid their board they would have but $3.40 for their week's work. But they seldom put in full time and often do not work more than three or four days per week, in which case they have little or nothing left for themselves. The section men are at home all the time, but they have to pay rent, for many of them are married men with families, besides paying for fuel, provisions and clothing at present prices. Formerly they were allowed to use the half rotted ties which were taken out and replaced with new ones. Though not the best of fuel, they could be used, and saved the expense of buying. But last fall an order was issued that all the old ties must be piled up "by the side of the track and burned." This was no advantage to the company while it was a loss to the section men.

This cut in wages was not made because the road was not making good returns for the money invested, for it has been for many years one of the best-paying roads, and the published statement of earnings show that last year was an average year. But the reduction is a serious one to the men, for most of the commodities of life have materially advanced in price.

The injustice of this reduction of wages was emphasized by the fact that one month later an advance was made in freight rates on between 400 and 500 different classes of articles, the increase being about twenty-five to thirty per cent. above the old rates. Thus while oppressing those who labor for them they, at the same time, by extortionate charges oppress the public which they serve.

We have been told many times that while trusts reduce the cost to the consumer they increase the wages paid to the workmen, that in this way they please both consumer and producer, and so are a benefit to all. But when we look at the facts we find that they have stated the case backwards, that they increase the cost to the consumer while in this as in many other cases they reduce the power to purchase. Instead of being "a necessary evolution of the times" and a benefit to the world, they are the result of that greed for gain, (and this instance is only one more evidence of it), that has taken possession of the heart of men—that greed that has no regard for the needs of a fellow-creature, that thinks only of self, and only cares that its ill-gotten gains may be heaped the higher, not knowing that they are piled up against the day of God's wrath. Jas. 5: 1-6.
