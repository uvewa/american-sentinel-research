HORACE GREELY'S idea of the doctrine which now rests upon a Supreme Court decision, that "this is a Christian nation," is expressed in the following from the N. Y. Daily Tribune, of March 7, 1865:—

"We deny that this is a Christian nation. France, Spain, Russia, Austria, Mexico, Portugal, Brazil, etc., are Christian nations, no matter how many of their people may be non-Christians; this country is not Christian, though a majority of its inhabitants probably are. 'Almighty God' is not the 'source of all authority and power' in our government; the people of the United States are such source. . . . The Federal Constitution is based on the idea that religious faith is a purely personal matter, with which civil governments have properly nothing to do, and with which they cannot meddle without doing far more harm than good."

***

It is plain from this that in Mr. Greely's view it was not any great credit to a country to be a "Christian nation." A nation might be "Christian" without being any better than Spain, Austria, or Russia, while the best government on the earth was non-Christian. Of course, to call such nations Christian is a slur upon Christianity; and it is impossible that a nation should be truly Christian irrespective of the Christianity of its people.
