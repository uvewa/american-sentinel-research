The Sunday laws can never be harmonized with the Golden Rule.

The solution of this problem of unnecessary Sabbath labor rests with Christians themselves. It is a fact that at least one-half of the people of this country are Christian enough to at least profess the Golden Rule, which is all the rule that is necessary to solve this Sunday problem. . . . Let us do unto others what we would like them to do unto us, and not require them to work on the Sabbath.—The Ram's Horn.
