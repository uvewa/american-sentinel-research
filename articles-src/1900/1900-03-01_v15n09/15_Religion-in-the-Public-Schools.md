The controversy over religious teaching in the public schools has appeared in the public schools of Harlem, N. Y. City. An atheist, named Bitner, whose boy attends one of the schools, does not want the latter instructed about God or given other religious teaching, and on this ground takes exception to the reading of the Bible at the opening services which the boy is obliged to attend. Mr. Bitner intends to carry the case into the courts if necessary.

The following statement of the case is made by the Herald, of this city:—

"John Jasper, Superintendent of Schools for Manhattan, said yesterday that the Bitner case had not been brought to his official knowledge. 'The laws governing the schools of this county,' he said, 'provide that no religious instruction shall be given or any teachings of a sectarian nature permitted. It is provided, however, that on opening school every day a chapter of Scripture shall be read, without note or comment. We have never had a complaint, so far as I know, that these provisions were being violated.'

"It was pointed out to Mr. Jasper that young Bitner's troubles had arisen through his refusal to copy from dictation the word 'God,' which was in the lines read. He was asked if there was anything in the instructions to teachers that prevents them from giving as dictation exercise lines that contain religious teachings.

"'No instructions on this subject, so far as I know, have ever been given,' was the reply. 'Teachers are allowed to use their discretion in the selection of exercises, and they are supposed to know that the law forbids them to impart religious or sectarian teachings.' Mr. Jasper declined to comment on the propriety of using the verse that had led to young Bitner's recalcitrancy."

Religious instruction is the highest and most necessary instruction that can be imparted, and for this very reason it does not belong within the domain of public school education. And as religious truth is so much in controversy, to attempt to teach religion in the public schools would only precipitate controversies in the schools, bitter as all religious controversies are, which would work only harm to the schools and to the cause of Christianity as well.

But it is a queer provision of the State law on this matter that "no religious instruction shall be given;" and yet that every day "a chapter of Scripture shall be read, without note or comment." Where does religious instruction come from, if not from the Bible? This part of the law would not be likely to stand a test in court.

In the recent case of the Catholic children in Piermont, N. Y., also, it will be remembered, the State authorities to whom appeal was made, decided that the reading of the Bible in the opening exercises, to which the Catholic parents objected, was a violation of the school law.
