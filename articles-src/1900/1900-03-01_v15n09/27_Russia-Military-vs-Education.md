Last year Russia expended $150,000,000 for her army, in a time of peace. For the same year she spent $5,000,000 for the enlargement and reorganization of her prisons, and only $3,000,000 for the education of her people, 95 per cent. of whom are peasants. Ignorance is the bane of the country, the people cannot farm without robbing their land, and last year 30,000,000 of them felt the stress of famine.
