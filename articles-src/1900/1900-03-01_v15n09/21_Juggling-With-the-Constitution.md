*"Springfield Republican."*

It is becoming difficult to follow the Administration in its interpretation of the Constitution regarding the status of the new insular possessions. The theory advanced for the emergency has been that the Constitution does not apply to them by its own force at all, Congress having unlimited power to govern them and regulate their affairs as is pleases. It is under this doctrine that a tariff between the United States and Porto Rico is to be maintained, and the Filipinos are to be given no rights of American citizenship. The administration's dispatch to Gen. Otis, through Secretary Root, regarding slavery in the Sulus, is, therefore, bewildering. On October 27, 1899, Secretary Root informed the general that the Bates treaty with the sultan was confirmed and approved by the President, subject to the action of Congress; but he added:

"With the understanding and reservation, which should be distinctly communicated to the sultan of Sulu, that this agreement is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give consent of the United States to the existence of slavery in the Sulu archipelago, which is made impossible by the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States."

From this it appears that the administration holds that the Constitution of the United States does not apply to the insular possessions of the United States, so far as one paragraph of it is concerned. Slavery cannot exist in the Sulu islands, says the government to Gen. Otis, because the Constitution of the United States forbids it. In all humility let us ask: Under what rule of constitutional interpretation does one section of the Constitution apply, by its inherent force, to the insular possessions, while all the other sections do not apply to them? The imperialist lawyers have a fine job before them. To reconcile the administration's position regarding slavery in the Sulus with the imperialist theory of the limited scope of the Constitution, they must demonstrate that one small section of that instrument has a scope and an expansive force greater than all the rest of the Constitution put together.
