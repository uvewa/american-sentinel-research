IN a recent letter from the capital to the Chicago Record of this city, William E. Curtis says:

"Washington is rapidly becoming the center of Catholicism in America. The apostolic legation is located here. In addition to the ancient Jesuit university, which was established at Georgetown during colonial days, we have now what is known as the Catholic University of Washington, a more extensive and wealthy institution, whose faculty represents the liberal element in the church. A year ago an enormous monastery of the Order of St. Francis was occupied by several hundred monks, and is now the headquarters of the greatest foreign missionary agency of the Catholic Church, the Franciscan Brotherhood. All their missionary work for the continents of America, Asia, and Africa is directed from here. The monastery, one of the most imposing ecclesiastical edifices in this nation, and which cost over $100,000, is situated a mile or two beyond the Catholic University, near the Soldiers' Home. There is a good deal of mystery about the institution which gives it additional interest. The monks are seldom seen, except when they come or go through the little village of Brookland, which is their railway station."

Of a magnificent new convent just dedicated in Washington, Mr. Curtis says: "It was built by Mrs. Thomas F. Ryan, wife of a New York contractor and an associate of Whitney, Elkins, and Widener in the control of the street railways of New York. This is an entirely new institution, and has been established for headquarters of the mothers superior of the Order of Perpetual Adoration, which heretofore have been in Brussels, but have been induced to come to this country by the prospect of extending their usefulness. The order is cloistered and contemplative; the sisters wear white robes and cloaks of velvet. They are mostly women of wealth and aristocratic connections, and in Europe their convents are the retreats for rich society women who wish to seek temporary seclusion from the world. A novitiate is to be opened in this city, and several daughters of rich families, religiously inclined, have already applied for admission. Thus far Mrs. Ryan has paid all the expenses of erecting the convent and bringing the sisterhood to the United States, and as a reward for her generosity her tomb is to be placed under the altar in the chapel."

Mr. Curtis further says that Cardinal Gibbons will soon "dedicate Trinity College, the first Catholic institution to provide a higher education for women. Its curriculum will include all the classics, the sciences, and the humanities which the Catholic Church has sanctioned for culture or scholarship, and its standard will be as high as Bryn Mawr or any other university for women in the world.

"The establishment of Trinity College is the direct consequence of the refusal of the Catholic University to admit women to its lectures, and it required a great deal of persuasion and a persistent effort to secure a sanction of the holy father for the new institution. This was secured, however, by Mother Julia, superior of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, with the aid of Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Ireland and Archbishop Keane. Having obtained the permission of Rome, Mother Julia purchased a beautiful tract of twenty-seven acres of land adjoining the campus of the Catholic University and near the Soldiers' Home, where a handsome building has been erected and will be ready for occupation on the 1st of November. Mgr. Martinelli will represent the Pope and Cardinal Gibbons will preside at the ceremonies."
