MARQUIS ITO, premier of Japan and a statesman of acknowledged ability, says Peking should be evacuated, the empress and court permitted to return, and negotiations should come afterward. Otherwise, he says, further aggressive measures will plunge the whole empire into war and chaos will reign for years. It is thought that this view of the situation will prevail.
