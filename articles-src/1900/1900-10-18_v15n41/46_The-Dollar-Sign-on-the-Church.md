In a recent editorial note the *Michigan Christian Advocate* says:

"I. H. S., the initials of 'Jesus hominum Salvator,' Jesus saviour of men, are often written in a monogram. Seeing it on the corner-stone of a church the other day, we were for an instant startled. The monogram looked so like another thing that for a moment we thought the United States dollar sign ($) was carved on that stone."

Well, the dollar sign ($) would not be greatly out of place on many churches, at least it might with great propriety be placed on the corner of the building in which is located the kitchen in which oyster suppers and other refreshments are prepared.
