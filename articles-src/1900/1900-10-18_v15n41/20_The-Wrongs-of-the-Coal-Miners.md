According to the *Citizen*, of Archibald, Pa., the coal miners certainly have serious grievances. The *Citizen* claims to give the facts just as they are. The conditions which it describes exist in collieries employing 75,000 workers of all grades.

There is, according to the *Citizen*, no uniformity. At some mines the men are paid by the ton, at others by the car, and there is no uniform ton or standard car. The ton, it says, ranges from 2,800 pounds to 3,600, while the car varies in its capacity from one and a half to four tons. There are, also, differences in the pay for rock work, for the opening of chambers, etc. At some mines the men are well paid for certain kinds of work, while at others they receive no pay at all. Again there are other inequalities and injustices. The coal before it leaves the mine for the breaker is weighed and credit given to the miner for tonnage, the latter, however, to be revised at the breaker. If the standard at the breaker is different from that at the mine, which is sometimes the case (and generally it is greater), the figures have to be rectified. Again the "docking boss" inspects the coal and he is at liberty to dock the men according to his own whim from five hundred to one thousand pounds per car for dirty coal, and this dockage is said to amount at certain breakers to forty tons daily. Even then the process is not complete. Says the *Citizen*:

"The coal is then ground into various marketable sizes. At some breakers, when there is a demand for sizes smaller than chestnut, the sizes larger than chestnut are diverted into special chutes and these sizes are again conveyed to the top of the breaker. Then they are run through again and ground into smaller sizes. For all the sizes smaller than chestnut, and there are five, the men do not get one cent of pay. About one-fifth of the coal run through the breaker is ground into those sizes.

"The coal is then loaded into the big cars and is ready to be shipped to market. Before it leaves the breaker it is weighed again. This time the standard ton is 2,240 pounds and the operators are paid according to that standard. The weight of all the sizes smaller than chestnut is deducted from the net tonnage as shown by the small scales at the top of the breaker. It generally happens that even after deducting the smaller sizes the tonnage is greater on the large scale than it is on the small scale. This is due to the fact that the coal on the large scale is weighed according to the to the 2,240-pound ton, while on the small scale it varies, as we have said, from 2,800 to 3,600 pounds. Do the men get credit for the additional tonnage? Oh, no. There is nothing said about it. A few years ago the men got credit for an overplus, but they have not lately. It is estimated that in this so-called 'balancing the scales' the men lose about four per cent of the coal they mine.

"At some of the mines where coal is paid for by the car there must be a certain amount of 'topping' on it. If the car should be an inch below the standard height the miner is docked a quarter of a car. It may readily be seen that this is an item of considerable consequence. Another innovation at mines where coal is so loaded is the 'bony boss.' It is the duty of this man to examine the coal before it is taken out of the mine. If the car contains dirty coal or the 'topping' is not of the required height he has the privilege of docking the car or else sending it back to the miner from whom it comes, to be filled again."
