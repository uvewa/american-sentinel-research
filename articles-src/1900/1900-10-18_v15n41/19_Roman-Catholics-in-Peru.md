"The Roman Catholic priests of Lima, Peru," says the *Lutheran Witness*, "are stirring up their adherents against evangelical missions. Protestants were accused of being responsible for the burning of the famous cloister of Ocapa, and although the enmity of the people is directed primarily against certain sectarians, the small Lutheran congregations in Lima and Callao are also made to suffer."
