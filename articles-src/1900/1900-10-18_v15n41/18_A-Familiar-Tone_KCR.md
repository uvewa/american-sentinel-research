In the Morning Star, a Massachusetts journal, under date of May 24 last, there appeared an article entitled, "Our National Constitution Should Acknowledge Christ the King," by Rev. J. M. Foster, of Boston, Mass., from which I quote the following:

"The history of this country points to the establishment of a true Christian state that shall embody the principles of the mediatorial government.

"This country was settled by Christian men with Christian ends in view. One of the regulations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was that if a man was absent from church one Sabbath without a cause he was find five shillings. If absent a month he should pay twenty pounds. If he worked unnecessarily on the Sabbath he was fined. For a second offense he was imprisoned. If he flagrantly and blasphemously defied the Sabbath he was executed. These regulations obtained in Connecticut, Virginia, and among other colonies. They gave tone to our national life. We can not have a Christian nation without a Christian Sabbath."

The real end that the author of the foregoing and those of his class are working to attain by getting Christ acknowledged as king in our national Constitution, is made so plain in the statements which we have quoted that no one can misunderstand it. Again, it is also evident from the favor with which such awful ideas are being received, as shown when a person dare without any disguise advocate such things. It will be noted that he says that the fines which were imposed as the result of the regulations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for being absent from church on Sundays, and, further, the penalties which were inflicted upon those who did not observe Sunday, reached their climax in the infliction of the death penalty; and then he adds that these things "gave TONE to our national life."

Let us note the familiarity of this tone, and what did really give tone to our national life.

## This "Tone" Familiar to All the Worthies of the Ages.

This "tone" that has been so clearly defined, was one with which the three Hebrews were familiar, when they heard the mighty roar of the fiery furnace which was heated seven times hotter than usual, and into which they were cast because of their loyalty to their Maker.

Daniel recognized this familiar tone in the roar of the lions as he was thrust into their den because he dared to obey "the law of his God" in opposition to a government whose laws were never reversed.

Jesus Christ heard this tone as the angry mob exclaimed, "Crucify him!" "Crucify him!"; and again, as the nails were driven through his tender flesh into the cross upon which he gave his life. The apostles heard it in the clanking of the chains with which they were bound in dolesome prison cells.

From fifty to seventy-five millions of martyrs have heard this awful tone in the crackling of the fire that burned the fagots that were placed about the stakes on which they were bound and burned, because they refused to renounce their faith in the gospel of Christ.

The same tone was also heard in the drop of the executioner's knife on the guillotine block, that severed the heads of those saints who chose rather to forfeit their lives than to yield the truth that had made them free. Roger Williams heard it in the cold and lonely blasts of winter, during which he was banished for his faith.

This same familiar tone has been heard in the click of the prison door and the rattling of the chains and balls on the hardened criminals in the chain-gang, by those who, in this land of so-called freedom, dared observe the seventh day Sabbath, and work on Sunday according to the law of God.

## The "Tone" of "Our National Life" Determined by Immortal Principles.

The principles which have really "given tone to our national life" are diametrically opposed to those which are advocated in the foregoing, as will be seen from the following quotations:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."—*First Amendment to the United States Constitution.*

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."—*Declaration of Independence.*

That which inspired the founders of our Government to embody these immortal principles in its very foundation was that at that time they were just emerging from the religious bigotry and oppression of papal and colonial times that had stained the history of the past.

It should be evident to every American citizen that our nation's prosperity in the past has been due to the principles of religious liberty and freedom, permitting every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience; but now there is a revival of the same old spirit of religious intolerance, and it is sweeping over the country like a tidal wave. There seems to be no question as to its ultimate success when one realizes that the movement has, as its supporters, the great religious organizations which are working with all the enthusiasm and power they have "to place all Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our Government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." May every liberty-loving citizen arouse himself and labor to rescue some one from the sinking "ship of state."

K. C. RUSSELL.
