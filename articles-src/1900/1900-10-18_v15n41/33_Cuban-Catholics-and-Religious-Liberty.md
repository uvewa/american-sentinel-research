As showing the loyalty of the Cubans to the Roman Catholic Church and religion, a correspondent of the Catholic Mirror says:

> "The most ignorant negro that ever drew his machete for Cuban liberty will order a foreigner to remove his hat when a statue of our mother of God is borne by a religious procession. Are not these the acts of loyal Catholics?"

Certainly, but not of men who know and respect religious liberty. To compel a Protestant to remove his hat to "a statue of our mother of God" is to require of him an act of idolatry scarcely second to that for refusing which the three Hebrews were consigned to the fiery furnace in the days of king Nebuchadnezzar.
