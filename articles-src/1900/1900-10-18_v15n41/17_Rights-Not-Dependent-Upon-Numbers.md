The idea prevails to quite an extent that numbers have something to do with rights; that a large number of people have more rights or greater rights than a smaller number of people. But this is an error.

Rights are God-given and attach not to numbers, but to individuals. One man has just as many rights and just as much of each right as it is possible for any number of men to have. We speak of rights, not of privileges.

It is true that a large number of men are more likely to secure recognition of their rights than a smaller number of men; but this is not because the larger number have more rights, but because they have more influence. When they combine to enforce their rights they have more power, hence their rights are more likely to be respected.

But rights do not belong to men because they are associated together in communities, in states, or in nations, but because they are men. "All men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights."

God has given rights to individuals for a purpose. Indeed it could not be otherwise. Individual rights are necessary to individual responsibility. The man who is to be held responsible for his choice must be free to make that choice.

Communities, states, and nations have rights only because the individuals that compose those communities states and nations have rights. The individual is first. He existed first, his rights are first, and to him alone does moral responsibility attach.
