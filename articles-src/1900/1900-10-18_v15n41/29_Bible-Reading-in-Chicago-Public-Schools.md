It has been arranged to introduce the reading of the Bible into the public schools of this city. For this purpose a book of Bible extracts has been compiled by a committee, one member of which is a Catholic. Of course the purpose is to supply "unsectarian" religious instruction from original sources, and incidentally to give the pupils the benefit of familiarity with Bible literature; and this last object is the only one that will be at all met, and that only very imperfectly, because no really intelligent idea can be formed of the Bible by simply reading excerpts from it.

The principal object, namely, that of giving religious instruction, will also fail. Religion can not be taught in that way. Upon this subject the testimony of Doctor Conrad, editor of the Lutheran Observer, is of value. After spending three years in Germany the doctor said: "There is no real religion. Religion is turned over to the schoolmaster. The parents say: 'The schoolmaster teaches religion; I am not responsible for that.'"

The experience of Germany in attempting to teach religion should be a warning to all the world. In no country, probably, are all the walks of life so permeated with infidelity as in Germany, and yet in no country in the world, is so much attention paid to the teaching of religion. Religion ought to be taught to every child, and the Bible ought to be read by everybody. Every individual, man, woman, and child, ought to be familiar with the language of the sacred Scriptures, but the necessary instruction can not be given in the state schools. The miserable makeshift of reading selections from the Scripture will not only fail of its purpose, but it will deceive unthinking parents with the thought that their children are receiving religious instruction when they are not.
