THE utter inability of many people to think of our civil institutions as purely civil is well illustrated by the following from a Protestant journal:

> "A Catholic lady complained bitterly against a teachers' employment agency because she could get no position in a public school on account of her religion. But why should she complain? Does any one suppose for a moment that Catholic directors would employ a Protestant to teach Catholic children? Not a bit of it. Catholics are too selfish for that, and yet they would love to have the privilege of teaching the children of other people who have as little use for Catholicism as the Catholics can possibly have for other religions."

Referring to this a Jewish paper suggests that it "is inspired by a wide-spread presumption that the public schools are Protestants institutions." And this is the simple truth as to the presumption, but legally the public schools are purely secular, having no religious character whatever, and, of course, no sectarian bias. Doubtless, in many cases, color is given to the instruction in such schools by the religious views of both teachers and text-book writers; but this is unavoidable as long as human beings are human. The only remedy is for those who object to this to have their children educated in their own denominational schools. But certainly no effort should be made by anybody to make state-supported schools in any-wise sectarian. They should be kept as purely secular as possible.
