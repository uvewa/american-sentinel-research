In quoting and commenting upon an editorial note from these columns the *Lutheran Witness* says:

"Of course, we have no sympathy with the false teaching that Sunday has taken the place of the Sabbath. We would point out only this, how foolish it is for the state to try to enforce the obligations which man owes his God."

The Witness has hit it exactly. Not only is that teaching false which seeks to instil into the mind the thought "that Sunday has taken the place of the Sabbath," but it would make no difference if the doctrine were true. The state has no right to enforce any religious institution, either true or false.
