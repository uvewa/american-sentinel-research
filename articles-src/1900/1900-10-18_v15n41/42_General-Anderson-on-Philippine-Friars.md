GENERAL ANDERSON, who commanded the first military expedition sent to the Philippine Islands, in discussing the standing of the mendicant orders in those islands, says: "I think our Catholic fellow-citizens make a mistake in giving their sympathies to the friars and not to their simple-minded yet sincere coreligionists who have been badly treated by them. There are some good men among them, but many, I fear very many, have not led edifying lives." General Anderson makes an exception, however, of the Jesuits, whose conduct, he says, commands respect.
