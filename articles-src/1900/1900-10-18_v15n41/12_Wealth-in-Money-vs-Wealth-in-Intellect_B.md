In a recent lecture before his class, Dr. Oscar L. Triggs, professor of literature at the University of Chicago, said:

"I am tired of hearing America criticised for its lack of artistic sense and creative power. Hereafter when people ask me who among Americans have shown a really wonderful creative genius and stand out head and shoulders above other men as Shakespeare does, I shall point to John D. Rockefeller and George M. Pullman.

"With their own individual intellects they have performed herculean tasks, and to-day their power is felt throughout the world. Shakespeare pictured to himself a scene and put it into words; these men conceived great industries, where thousands of men might find employment in producing what millions of people need. Who shall say that their genius was less than the genius of Shakespeare? It has a far-reaching, practical influence, and in my opinion it will be just as lasting."

Concerning trusts the professor said:

"The trust; what is it? It is the product of evolution, and as such is a part of the order of things. It has been coming for more than a hundred years, and seems to have reached its culmination in men like Rockefeller. Everythings tends toward organization, and as soon as people have adjusted themselves to the new conditions they will be better than before. In my opinion the time is only a few years off when a few nations will rule the world."

Doctor Triggs is quite right when he cites the gentlemen named as men of genius, but that they are entitled to rank with Shakespeare, Homer, and Dante is not clear.

Ability to accumulate property, to get and to keep, to lay under tribute thousands and tens of thousands of one's fellowmen, is not of a high order, nor does such an example benefit the race. Life is not all lived in this world. The few brief years allotted to each man here are only probationary—the germinating time as it were of the mind which may go on expanding to all eternity. Creature comforts are needful, but they are only for a day compared with the eternal treasures of a well-stored mind. Material things are only transient, they endure but for a moment, but truth is eternal, and a high ideal caught by the mind and crystalized into language, is as enduring as eternity.

The great literary lights of the world have been in advance of the ages in which they lived, and their work has been an incentive and an inspiration to generation after generation. But what lasting service did Croesus render the world? Who of all succeeding generations was better for Croesus' having lived? Then, too, the mighty fortunes of to-day are as much, yea even more, the creation of circumstances than of the men who control them. They are the product of modern civilization, and the very civilization that makes the trust possible makes, if not impossible at least improbable, the development of such literary geniuses as Shakespeare, Homer, and Dante.

Trusts can never make anybody better, and they can make only a few richer. Under the trust system no one can hope to become more than a cog in a great machine. When the people shall "have adjusted themselves to the new conditions," instead of being better than they were before, they will find themselves the helpless, hopeless slaves of organized greed.
