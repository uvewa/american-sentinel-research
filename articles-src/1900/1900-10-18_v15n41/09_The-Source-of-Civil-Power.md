THE Declaration of Independence sets forth as a self-evident truth the proposition that governments derive "their just powers from the consent of the governed"—that is, from the people.

But to this some seek to oppose the Biblical declaration that "there is no power but of God; the powers that he are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."

There is not, however, the slightest conflict between the Declaration of Independence and the Word of God. There is, and there can be, "no power but of God." He is the source alike of life and power, and he has ordained both—that is, it is by his will that they exist.

Nor is this the only sense in which God has ordained both life and power; he has endowed man with both, and has ordained how power shall be exercised and how life shall be used and transmitted; for with life God gave to men and women the power to transmit life to offspring. For this purpose God ordained the marriage relation. But though ordained of God this relation is nevertheless dependent upon the consent of the parties to it. But the power to transmit life, to bring into existence morally accountable beings made in the image of God, exists independently of the God-ordained limitations put upon its exercise by the Divine Being himself; and everybody knows something at least of how shamefully that power is misused, and that by this misuse God-given life is transmitted to beings that, but for the violation of the divine law, would never have an existence.

The powers of government like the power to transmit life were ordained of God in the very constitution of the human family. These powers God ordained when he made man. They were written in every fiber of the race, and though so shamefully misused, God suffers them to remain and to be exercised by men at will, subject only to the laws of human existence and to the overruling providence of the Creator.

It has been truly said that he alone is fit to govern others who knows how to govern himself. This faculty of self-government, self-control, was given to man in the beginning, and it is the foundation of all just government, for no man has a shadow of right to impose upon another any restriction to which he himself is unwilling to submit.

The faculty of self-government or self-control implanted in man by the Creator leads men to set bounds for themselves which they may not pass to trespass upon the rights of others. Persistent disregard of these rights by those who will not govern themselves leads naturally to coercion, so far as is necessary for the protection of the common rights of all. And to this even the lawless ones consent by asserting for themselves the rights which by their lawlessness they deny to others.

Such is the government ordained of God, for it is the government which naturally grows out of the very nature of man. Arbitrary, despotic government stands in exactly the same relation to this God-ordained exercise of governmental powers that the wanton, lustful use of the God-ordained power of reproduction does to the God-ordained exercise of that God-ordained power.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed or from the people, not because governmental power is not of God, but because, first of all, God vested this power not in the man-made thing which we call "the government," but in the people—that is, in the individual. The people then delegate to their own creature—to the government of their own making—such power as they see fit. The government has no just powers and can have no just powers that the people did not have as individuals before they made the government.

The text relied upon to prove the divine right of governments apart from the people, and consequently the divine right of kings, does not speak of men in power, but of power vested in men. It speaks not of fearing men, but of fearing power, and warns against resisting that power because it (the power) is ordained of God. For this reason, because it is ordained of God, "whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God." And this one can do just as well where no organized government exists as under the best civil system ever devised by men. The Bedouin, who in the heart of the Sahara strikes down and robs the traveler, as truly resists the God-ordained power of government as does the thug who plies his nefarious vocation in the most populous city.

Only tyranny fears to leave the power of government with the people, where God placed it in the beginning, and only tyrants care to deny that the only divine right civil government has comes to it through the people, and that it is held subject to the will of the people and the demands of justice, and not independently of the people or of justice.

As the individual has no divine warrant for doing injustice so the government can have no such warrant; therefore our fathers were right in claiming for the colonies only "full power" to do all "acts and things which independent states may of right do." For since the individual has no right to do a wrong the creature of the individual certainly can have no such right, for the people can confer only such powers as they possess.
