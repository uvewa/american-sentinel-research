AN editorial correspondent of the Catholic Mirror comforts himself with the thought that while "the tendency of the Cuban politician of this generation will be to put as wide a separation between church and state as possible, and the church will have to rely upon its own resources," yet "with all this the outlook for religion is infinitely brighter than it was under the Spanish regime. Less is to feared from open antagonists than from false friends."
