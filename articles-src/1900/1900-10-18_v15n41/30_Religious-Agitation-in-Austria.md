RELIGIOUS agitation in Austria has reached a point where the discussion has been taken up by the press of the Roman Catholic Church. Most of these papers assert that the agitation will result beneficially to the Catholic Church. The Reichspost says:

> "It has shaken hundreds of thousands of Catholics out of their lethargy, while the 'Away from Rome' agitators can report only 'ten thousand' apostates to their cause. The whole movement is beginning to awaken a wide and deep excitement in favor of the church throughout Catholic Austria. In many places where it has hitherto been impossible to secure the funds for the Catholic Church, money has been given in abundance. Missions have been started where none before existed. Thousands of men now come to the communion who had not attended for years. In short, the Catholic Church of Austria is being shaken from center to circumference, and will only gain by the agitation."

This may all be true, but Rome never welcomes this sort of a "shaking up."
