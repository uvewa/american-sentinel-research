THE Canadian parliamentary campaign is now officially declared, the election day being fixed for November 7, the day after our own. The Lord's Day Alliance will doubtless make a strong effort to secure from the next parliament a Sunday law for the Dominion, as the provincial laws have been found inadequate to accomplish what is desired by the friends of the legal Sunday. The Sunday question is not, however, an issue of the campaign. It is said that the Liberals under Premier Laurier seem to have excellent prospects of being again intrusted with power.
