A complete list of Protestant missionaries known to have been killed from the beginning of the Boxer movement in China to September 5, has been received by the American Bible Society from its agent in Shanghai. The list numbers 178 names, 66 men, 73 women, and 39 children. Among them are 69 Americans, 25 men, 24 women and 20 children. "Singularly enough," says the Michigan Christian Advocate, "not a single missionary of our own Methodist Episcopal Church, according to Doctor Leonard, was killed."
