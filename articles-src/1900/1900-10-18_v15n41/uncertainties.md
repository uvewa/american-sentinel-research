# Uncertainties Log for American Sentinel v15n41 (1900-10-18)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally very good, with clear text throughout.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 2, Article "The Source of Civil Power"
- **Text:** "the powers that he are ordained of God"
- **Issue:** This appears to be an OCR error. Should likely be "the powers that be are ordained of God" (from Romans 13:1)
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed as it appears in the OCR output ("powers that he")
- **Confidence:** LOW - This is likely an OCR error, but preserved as found
- **Reason:** Preserving the OCR output exactly while noting the likely error

### Page 4, Article "Wealth in Money vs. Wealth in Intellect"
- **Text:** "Everythings tends toward organization"
- **Issue:** "Everythings" is likely "Everything" (no 's')
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed as "Everythings"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Preserved as found in OCR
- **Reason:** Could be original typographical error or OCR error

### Page 12, Article on Methodist Conference
- **Text:** "empressement" (in description of Real Presence doctrine)
- **Issue:** French word meaning "eagerness" or "demonstrativeness" - unusual in English text
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed as appears (italicized in original)
- **Confidence:** HIGH - This is likely correct as the Literary Digest often used such terms
- **Reason:** Context supports this as an intentional use of French terminology

### Page 1, Article "The Source of Civil Power"
- **Text:** "the to the 2,240-pound ton" (in coal miners article)
- **Issue:** Repeated "the" appears to be OCR or typographical error
- **Action Taken:** Transcribed as "the to the 2,240-pound ton"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - Preserved as found
- **Reason:** Maintaining fidelity to source while noting apparent duplication
