A CORRESPONDENT writing from Oil Springs, Ontario, gives a very interesting account of the recent organization at that place of a branch of the Lord's Day Alliance. Our correspondent says:

"It was really amusing to note the contradictory statements made in the meeting. The question was asked, 'What form of Sabbath-breaking is most prevalent in this place?' The answer given by one of the ministers was in substance that many of the people were in the habit of going to the River St. Clair to spend the day, while others went visiting and allowed the hour of worship to go by unheeded, and the churches were well nigh deserted.

"Mr. Shearer, the organizer, said that it was not their place to say how the people should spend the 'Lord's day' so long as they did not work on that day. But in almost the next sentence he denounced Sunday cars, Sunday plays, Sunday parks, and Sunday excursions because they take so many people away from the churches.

"Mr. Shearer also said the Lord's Day Alliance would not persecute for conscience sake, but added that its members would not be idle, but would go about like a man he met out West who always carried a loaded gun. He asked this man why he always carried his gun, and was told that it was to use in case anything happened. The speaker advised all members of the Lord's Day Alliance to follow this example and to always carry a gun loaded with the Sunday law ready to use it whenever they saw an infraction of the law.

"The speaker further said that this was a civil question. This seems strange since the prayer meeting of the church was given up that the Alliance meeting might be held. The church people were all urged to attend, and the ministers of the place and the church deacons all took an active part in the meeting.

"Another statement made by this organizer was that the members were not to be spies, and then proceeded to relate approvingly how one of its members, a minister, near the St. Lawrence, went out one Sunday morning to see if any men were working on the canal. He found about twenty-five men at work and gave them five minutes to quit or be arrested.

"After the meeting one man was heard to remark that hereafter if he saw any one doing anything on Sunday he would 'put him through.' He was asked what he would do in case he saw one working on Sunday who observed the seventh day —Saturday. His answer was: 'Then he had better leave the country. We have a law, and if he does not obey the law of the land he must suffer for it.' Whether civil or religious this is the spirit that the Lord's Day Alliance has aroused in this place."

And such is the spirit that is always aroused in every place by all efforts to enforce religious observances or institutions by civil law. It can never be otherwise.
