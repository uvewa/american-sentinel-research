Speaking of the case referred to in these columns last week the New York Christian Advocate defends the right of any one to leave his property to be used in combating the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, if he chooses so to do. After stating the ground of the contest, with which our readers are already familiar, the Advocate says: "This is no ground for breaking a will. This wing of Adventists simply believe this: that immortality is a gift to the true believer; that without this gift people are extinguished by the dissolution of the physical body, but Christ gives the principle of immortal life to those who believe in him."
