The impossibility of making a community better by law or of even compelling a lawless community to be law-abiding has been illustrated in South Carolina by the failure of the law giving damages to the heirs of any person lynched in that State.

Suit was brought by the son of a negro who was lynched. The charge of the judge was as nearly as possible in the nature of instruction to the jury to find for the plaintiff. A verdict was, nevertheless, returned in favor of the county.

So determined, however, was the judge that justice should be done and the law carried out to the letter, that he set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial, but again a verdict has been returned for the county. To the credit of the press of the State, be it said, that prominent papers are demanding that the law be enforced. The News and Courier of Charleston says: "It is to be hoped that the case will be pressed to a third trial, and a fourth, and as many more as may be necessary to vindicate the law involved in it, according to the evidence and the judgment of the court."
