THE advocates of compulsory Sunday observance are now pointing to the Paris Exposition as a "sad financial failure," which they allege is due to Sunday opening, and are inquiring whether the great fairs projected for Buffalo and St. Louis are to be kept open on Sundays. "Pastors, churches, and Christian Endeavor societies," we are informed, are giving their attention to this matter, and the question of Sunday enforcement is not likely very soon to become quiescent in this country.
