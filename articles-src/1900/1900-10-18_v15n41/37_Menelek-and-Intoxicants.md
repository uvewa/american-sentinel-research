IT is stated that Menelek, Emperor of Abyssinia, has issued an order forbidding the importation of intoxicating liquors into his dominions, and forbidding also the use of tobacco by his subjects under heavy penalties. He has also informed foreign Powers that he expects the support of friendly nations in saving his people from the influence of intoxicants and narcotics. We fear he will be disappointed.
