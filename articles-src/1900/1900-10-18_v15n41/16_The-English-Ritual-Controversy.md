From the Literary Digest.

The fires of the ever-threatening ritual controversy in the English Church, after a short period of comparative quiescence, show signs of renewed activity. After the successive pronouncements of the archbishops against the use of ceremonial incense, moving lights, and, latest of all, the reservation of the Sacrament, a proposal was made that a "Round Table Conference" on ritual be convened, representing all parties in the church, in the hope of an amicable agreement. Now, however, such hopes of compromise seem to have become slighter than ever. At a recent meeting of the English Church Union—which represents the High-Church element—official declarations were passed which condemn the opinion of the archbishops on reservation, and once more make evident the width and depth of the chasm which divides "Catholic" from Evangelical in the Church of England. The declaration states that it is the teaching of "the whole Catholic faith" that "in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper the bread and wine, through the operation of the Holy Ghost, become, in and by consecration, according to our Lord's institution, verily and indeed the Body and Blood of Christ, and that Christ our Lord, present in the same most Holy Sacrament of the Altar under the form of bread and wine, is to be worshiped and adored."

A great cry has arisen from the Protestant party in the church over these words, which, however, only announce a doctrine of the Real Presence held by many in the Anglican Church for a long time, although probably never asserted with such publicity and *empressement* before. Roman Catholic papers say that this statement is by no means the doctrine of transubstantiation, since it is not asserted that the whole elements of the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. But for the ordinary English Protestant the doctrine of the Real Presence in any form is abhorrent, and the columns of the *Times* and of the leading religious papers contain many protestations, interrogations, and explanations. The extreme press of either side is urging the introduction of the question into the coming general elections. The Guardian (High Church), however, thinks this would be a mistake, and that churchmen should deprecate the choice of violent partizans as candidates. The Church Review (High Church) says that its party would not meet with any success in proposing a campaign of religious propagandism, yet it deplores the divorce of religion and good citizenship. Passive resistance is no longer the true policy of the church, and some organization should exist that can present the High-Church side with weight to the political parties as an offset to the deputations of Evangelicals who from time to time wait upon the politicians with proposals of persecuting policies. The Pilot (High Church), too, advocates a moderate alliance of the church with politics for the present emergency. In the meantime the Earl of Portsmouth, a leader of the Protestant party, has given notice that at a given date he will call attention in the House of Lords to the "increasing lawlessness" in the church, and demand that immediate effect be given to a like recent resolution of the Commons that "if the efforts now being made by the archbishops and bishops to secure due obedience of the clergy are not effectual, further legislation will be required to maintain the existing laws of church and realm." At this declaration, according to the words of Dean Hole, in a recent letter, "Rome sneers, Geneva growls, the High Churchman distrusts, the Broad Churchman smiles." The earl tried hard to engage the services of the premier for his purposes, and begged him to bring in a bill "with the sole object of making the clergy obey the law," but the marquis declined the invitation.
