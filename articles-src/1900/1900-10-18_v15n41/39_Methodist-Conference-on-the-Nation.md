RECENTLY three hundred ministers of the Methodist Central Conference, in session at Fostoria, Ohio, adopted, with cheers, according to the Columbian, a long report on the state of the nation, which report exulted in the political achievements of the administration and stated in part:

"We are the custodians of the Philippines whether we desire it or not. Not for empire, but for humanity's sake. We must be faithful to our trust to civilize and Christianize these new possessions. We are not to be turned aside by the cry of 'imperialism,' but, standing with the sword in one hand and the olive branch of peace in the other, we say to all concerned: 'We are doing a great work and can not be downed.' * * * God means that the American Government shall shine out as a lighthouse among the nations. He is turning and overturning that he, whose right it is, may reign King of nations as he is King of saints. No nation lives to itself; we are our brother's keeper. America has been in training long enough. The clock strikes the hour and we must marshal our host for the great battle. * * * We deprecate the saloon curse which is blighting our new possessions, but under the conquering reign of our Emmanuel, rum, Romanism, and idolatry are doomed and the final victory assured."

The closing words of this paragraph have given great offense to Catholics. The *Standard and Times* of Philadelphia says:

"'Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion' was the slogan at a time when a crisis like the present was at hand, and the cry had a boomerang effect upon the fools who resorted to it. Those who paraphrase it now ought to be left to the tender mercy of the Prohibitionists and the Women's Christian Temperance Union. But here we see the most barefaced merging of religion and politics and no Babbits standing up in their pulpits to denounce the howling dervishes who seek to place Christianity on the same plane as the hideous doctrines of the impostor of Arabia."

It is probably true that the Catholics, if united, would hold the balance of power as between the two great parties in this country, and that they have the power to defeat any man or party particularly obnoxious to them. It remains to be seen whether "rum, Romanism, and idolatry" will have as great an influence on the present campaign as did Mr. Burchard's "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion" sixteen years ago.
