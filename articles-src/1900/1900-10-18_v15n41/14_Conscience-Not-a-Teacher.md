From the Sunday School Times.

Conscience tells us that we ought to do right, but conscience does not tell us what is right. Conscience is a monitor in the spiritual school; conscience is not a teacher in that school. If we were shut up to the instructions of conscience we should be ever in doubt as to duty and often going astray. Therefore it is that God has given to us a specific revelation of his will and law, so that we may know our duty when conscience tells us that we ought to do our duty. If, indeed, conscience were a teacher to tell us our duty we should have little need of the Bible to give us instruction; then every person, the world over, would have the same standard of right doing and holy living. But, as it is, we need the Bible and conscience, neither alone is sufficient. Conscience is given to all. A revelation is known to all, either by its record or by its transmission from parent to child, as from the beginning. Let us prize aright the God-given promptings of conscience and the God-given teachings of revelation. All of us need both.
