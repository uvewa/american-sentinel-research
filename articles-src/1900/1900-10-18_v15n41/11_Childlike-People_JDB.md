It is becoming quite common now to hear the inhabitants of the colonies of the United States referred to with those terms which are applicable to the state of childhood. The *Outlook*, of New York, in its issue of October 4, speaks of the people of the Philippines as "childlike people." The writer recently heard an address by a well-known public man, who is himself sometimes spoken of as "a beardless youth," which was liberally interspersed with such terms as "our wards," "these children," etc. A few days afterwards my eyes fell upon these words of Thomas De Quincey, written in 1821:

"Those nations whose upper classes speak paternally and caressingly to the working classes, and to servants in particular, do so because they speak from the lofty stations of persons having civil rights to those who have none. Two centuries back, when a military chieftain addressed his soldiers as 'my children,' he did so because he was an irresponsible despot exercising uncontrolled powers of life and death. From the moment when legal rights have been won for the poorer classes, inevitable respect on the part of the higher classes extinguishes forever the affectionate style which belongs naturally to the state of pupilage or infantine bondage."

The conclusion is obvious: The use of such terms marks a condition of affairs approaching that which existed two centuries ago when irresponsible despots exercised uncontrolled powers of life and death. It is the natural language of men toward those whom they regard as far below them in rights and privileges.

Now, it may not have occurred to those who are fond of using these paternal expressions, but nevertheless it is true, that children are by no means the most lawless and unmanageable beings in the world. The qualities and attributes of childhood are not the dangers against which society must protect itself by the maintenance of government. It is not for children that courts are instituted and prisons erected. I venture to say that if so-called full-grown nations were less "civilized" and more childlike there would be far more self-control and self-government manifested within their borders and in their actions. There would be no assumption of arbitrary power with the excuse that it is to be exercised only over "childlike people." Self-government and the inalienable rights of men have little to fear from "childlike people." They have much to fear, however, from those "grown-up" people who insist that other people are children to be ruled by them at their pleasure.
