As regards the Roman Catholic claim that the United States Government ought to give money to Catholic Indian schools, it is pointed out by "excellent Catholic authorities," says The Independent, that "more Italians come to the United States in one year than the total number of Catholic Indians, and they are sadly neglected religiously."

Why show more interest in the spiritual welfare of the Indians than in that of the Italians? Is it not because the Papacy is anxious to maintain relations with the United States Government?
