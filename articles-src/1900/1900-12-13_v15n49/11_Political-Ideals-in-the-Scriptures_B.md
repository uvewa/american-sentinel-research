Among the subjects considered at the New York State Conference of Religion was "Political Ideals of the Bible." A paper was read on this subject by Prof. Nathaniel Schmidt, of Cornell University, and an extemporaneous address delivered by Professor Batten, of New York. In his paper Professor Schmidt set forth quite clearly the political ideals of the Jews, dealing principally with the Messianic thought prominent in the minds of the Jewish people who expected in the person of the Messiah a political deliverer.

Professor Batten said, after introducing his subject: "It may be disappointing to some, but the fact is, there is no political ideal in the New Testament. It is utterly impossible under the circumstances that there should be any such ideal."

Professor Batten then sketched briefly the conditions that existed not only at the time that Christ was upon earth, but for five hundred years prior to that time, and said: "Now it was impossible under such circumstances that there should be any political ideal." He spoke of the attitude of the political power toward religious systems, and of the change which was brought about with the introduction of Christianity, and of the struggle which took place in the Roman Empire when it became "Christian." "There seemed to be," he said, "an opportunity of taking on the old form of Jewish theocracy, of uniting church and state. There was a great struggle going on. There was an attempt on the part of the great men to build up a political actuality founded upon the New Testament, but they found in the New Testament scriptures no political ideal.

## Jesus Did Not Appeal to "the Powers that Be."

"You remember when John the Baptist was apprehended and put in prison, our Lord did not appeal to 'the powers that be.' Then when the news was taken to him some time later that John had been beheaded, Jesus retired into the desert. He shows the same feeling again toward the state when telling the apostles that in carrying on the work committed to them they would suffer persecution, not only at the hands of their brethren, at the hands of their 'friends,' at the hands of the Jewish church, but above all at the hands of the Roman state. And he shows from beginning to end the recognition of this condition of things, that the state was a power that was hostile to him, and we find him finally simply surrendering himself to that hostile force, and this was done without any great protest."

## Jesus' Silence Under Bad Government.

Continuing, the speaker said: "We must not forget that Jesus lived under a government that was probably just as bad as any government in any American city or State. It was a mass of corruption. Now what was Jesus' attitude toward all that? It was that of humble submission. His silence was something extraordinary. You remember when they brought a message to him from Herod; and we understand what was back of it all. The messengers were those very willing people, the Pharisees. They said, You ought to get out of this country because Herod is going to destroy you. Jesus answered with a word that is generally interpreted as being essentially contemptuous, 'Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.'"

The speaker explained that while the Saviour's words were generally understood as being an expression of contempt, they were not necessarily so, as the original gave rather the idea of cunning: Go, tell that cunning ruler. But however this may be, our Lord would not turn aside from his work because of the opposition of the political power. He had a mission, and it was his duty, a duty from which he would not swerve, to fulfil that mission, and he did not recognize the right of any earthly power to interfere with his work. But neither did he claim the right to use any force or compulsion whatever in carrying forward his own work. This he carried so far as to teach the doctrine of non-resistance. Upon this point Professor Batten said: "On the negative side toward the state there are some striking instances, for example,

### The Doctrine of Non-Resistance

that our Lord preached. Some of us do not like it, but it takes a good deal of interpretation to destroy the force of it. There was a time when Jesus seemed to show that he might for a moment depend upon a strong human arm in the time of danger. But whatever may have been his meaning, Jesus had no intention whatever to influence any man to trade his coat for a sword. It was evident he was not counting on any such thing, for when one of his disciples misunderstood his meaning and started to use the sword, he was promptly rebuked and told that such was not his mission. 'For all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.'

## "My Kingdom Is Not of This World."

"There was another occasion when Jesus showed most unmistakably his attitude toward the state; it was when he said, 'My kingdom is not of this world, if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now is my kingdom not from hence.'

"Now the reason for this position that Jesus takes has been incidentally alluded to. It is stated in the words already quoted, 'My kingdom is not of this world.' Jesus came here to establish the kingdom of heaven, and his teaching shows from beginning to end that the kingdom of heaven is not the kingdom of this world. The Roman state had absolutely nothing to do with it whatever. After his death and after his resurrection you remember how the people came and asked him if at last his kingdom should be restored. His answer showed that he had no intention whatever to restore the temporal kingdom of Israel. The kingdom he came to establish is entirely distinct from the state. Something that may have indirectly a great influence upon the state, but something that is not of the state.

## The Christian's Duty to the State.

"Jesus showed, however, that every citizen owes a duty to the state, when he said, 'Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's.' Jesus recognized the worst government that ever was, a bad government that was soon to take his own life, as holding its position by virtue of the power of God. You remember also that Paul and Peter exhorted the Christians to obey the civil power, that power that was hostile to them. Those to whom they wrote acknowledged allegiance to Jesus of Nazareth, but the apostles nevertheless counseled them to be obedient to the state. This does not mean that we can sweep the whole thing out of existence. Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven."

## Dr. Whiton's Opinion.

It was evident that the thoughts expressed by Professor Batten were not such as the projectors of the Conference hoped to call out when they determined upon the program. J. M. Whiton, Ph. D., chairman of the executive committee, was upon the platform, and hastened to break as far as possible the force of Professor's Batten's remarks. He said:

"I think that there were very clear conceptions of responsibility for the realization of political ideals among the prophets of Old Testament history; and that Jesus in his ministry quietly set his seal upon these prophets. * * * It has been said that we have no Christian sources at all. But the Christian ideals in that respect are to be found in the Old Testament, not in the New. It is to Israel that we must go for political ideals, and the books of the Old Testament are just as truly Christian Scriptures as the New Testament."

## What Are the Political Ideals of the Old Testament?

The answer to this question must depend upon what is meant by "Old Testament ideals." Does the question refer to the ideals of the people, recorded and preserved in the historical portion of the Old Testament? or does it refer to what "holy men of God" taught upon the subject of ideal government? Judging from Professor Schmidt's paper the former was intended, for he dealt almost entirely with the historical phase of the question, telling what the people aspired to, what they asked of Samuel, and what the Lord in response to that demand instructed the prophet to give to them.

From this, the historical standpoint, one of the political ideals of the Old Testament, that is of the people whose history is there recorded, was monarchy, that they might "be like all the nations."

Still later, after the kingdom had been rent in twain and had become subject in turn to Syria, to Babylon, to Medo-Persia, to Grecia, and to Rome, the political ideal of the people was the restoration of the temporal monarchy that Israel might again "be like all the nations." It was the prevalence of this ideal, wide-spread and delusive as it was, that led the Jews to reject the Messiah when he came as the babe of Bethlehem, the carpenter of Nazareth, the teacher of Galilee, instead of coming to set up again the throne of David in the city of Jerusalem.

But such was not the political ideal of the Old Testament. The political ideal of the Old Testament was Theocracy—government of a willing people by God himself. And had sin never entered there never would have been any other kind of government, for Adam as the head of the race would have administered only the will of God.

But man rebelled against God's government and would have none of it. Israel demanded a king, And the Lord said to Samuel: "They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."

But notwithstanding Israel's rebellion, the Lord did not forsake them utterly nor give them over entirely to their enemies. The promise was: "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come." Gen. 49:10, R. V.

Jewish independence ceased more than six centuries before the beginning of the Christian era, but not until A.D. 70 did they lose their national existence, and Jerusalem permanently cease to be their capital. There was the complete end of the Theocracy as foretold by the Prophet Ezekiel:

"And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Ezek. 21:25-27.

This was spoken in the days of Zedekiah. The kingdom was then tributary to Babylon, but it was overturned and given to Medo-Persia, then to Grecia, and then to Rome, under which power Jerusalem was utterly destroyed, the site of the temple plowed as a field, and the last vestige of Jewish political power was destroyed—taken away to be no more "until he come whose right it is," when it will be given to him.

## The Bible Ideal.

The realization of this promise to Christ is the only "political ideal" known to either Testament. The Jewish Theocracy only dimly foreshadowed the everlasting kingdom of God to be established upon the ruins of all earthly, temporal kingdoms. Our Lord has gone "into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return." Luke 19:12-27.

## What the Scriptures Teach.

As THE SENTINEL has many times shown in the past, the misdirected efforts of many well-meaning people are due to a misapprehension of the teaching of the Scriptures of truth concerning the kingdom of Christ. But there should be no confusion or misapprehension upon this point, for the Scriptures are very plain upon the subject.

The Scriptures speak of two thrones, and consequently of two kingdoms (for a throne necessarily implies a kingdom), namely, the throne of grace and the throne of glory. Says the apostle: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need." Heb. 4:16.

This throne of grace is the throne from which grace or favor is dispensed. Says the Scriptures: "Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." Heb. 8:1.

Christ is now a priest-king, not upon his own, but upon his Father's throne. He himself makes a clear distinction between the throne he now occupies and that which he will one day take. He says: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with my Father in his throne." Rev. 3:21.

## When Christ Will Take His Throne.

Christ also tells when he will take this throne; it is "when the son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." Matt. 25:31.

The kingdom of grace, over which Christ now reigns, and the kingdom of glory, which according to the word of God is still future, are of course very closely related. The purpose of the kingdom of grace is to prepare subjects for the kingdom of glory. There is, however, this important difference, that while the kingdom of grace is temporary, spanning only time from the fall of man to the close of human probation, the kingdom of glory is coincident with the future eternity. The promise to Christ is, "The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Luke 1:32, 33.

But it will not be so of the throne of mercy; the time will come when Christ will leave that throne, and then will go forth the decree: "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still." Rev. 22:11.

## How Christ Takes His Kingdom.

Then follow the events so graphically foretold in the word of God. Christ will then appear having "on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." Rev. 19: 16. "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thess. 4: 16. "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24: 31. "Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 8: 11. "And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom." Dan. 7: 27.

But what then will become of the nations of this earth, and of their wicked rulers and people? Let the word of God answer. To the Son the Father says: "Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron: thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Ps. 2: 8, 9.

## The Destruction of Wicked Powers.

The Revelator thus describes this destruction:

"And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshiped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." Rev. 19: 19, 20.

Describing the scenes that come in connection with the destruction of all things earthly and temporal, the Apostle Peter says:

"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burned up. * * * Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3: 10-13.

The promise to which the apostle refers is recorded in Isaiah 65: 17:

"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth."

The glory of this new earth, this everlasting kingdom prepared for the people of God "from the foundation of the world," is thus described by the prophet:

"The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. * * * And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away." Isa. 35.

Again, in Revelation 21: 1-8, we read:

"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."

## Could Folly Be Greater?

Such is the description which the Bible gives of Christ's everlasting kingdom, and of the time and manner of the setting up of that kingdom; and yet mortal men propose to usher in that kingdom by political action; they would bring Christ to his throne by acts of parliaments and of congresses; they would take him by force and make him king! Could folly be greater, or presumption more pronounced? In the very presence of eternal realities, and in view of the plain testimony of the Scriptures of truth, should not men the rather "stand still and see the salvation of the Lord"?
