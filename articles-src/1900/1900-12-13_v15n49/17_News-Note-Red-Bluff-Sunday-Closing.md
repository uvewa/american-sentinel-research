The clergymen of Red Bluff, California, are seeking by means of a petition to secure the closing of business places in that town on Sunday. The petition is signed by business men who agree to close upon Sunday and by citizens who endorse the movement. There is no Sunday law in California; otherwise it is likely an appeal would be made to the law.

The clergy have, of course, a perfect right to work for Sunday closing by this or any other form of moral suasion.
