THE "Christian Citizenship" movement has spread to Australia. A Melbourne journal, lately received, mentions that "a meeting of the National Christian Citizen's League" was held in that city October 11, at which the League spoke its mind on the question of Sunday enforcement by this declaration:

"Inasmuch as God has given the seventh day as one of rest from labor, and that day is being violated by unnecessary Sunday toil in many trades, it is determined to rigorously enforce existing Sunday laws, and, if necessary, seek for additional legislation."

This moves the Melbourne paper to inquire how the seventh day can be violated by "Sunday toil," since "every school boy knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while the seventh day comes at the other end of the week." "The two days," it observes, "are just as far apart as the week will allow them to be, yet we are gravely told by these religio-politicians that the seventh day is being violated by Sunday labor."

A good cause has no occasion to deviate from the language of truth.
