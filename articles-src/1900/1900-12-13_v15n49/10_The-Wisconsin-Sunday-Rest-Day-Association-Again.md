Among a number of interesting facts gleaned at the recent convention of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association were these: 1. The Association is "in touch with fifteen hundred churches." 2. The Evangelical Association, composed of eighty churches, supports the work of the Rest Day Association by regular annual donations, running from fifty cents to $5.50 per church. 3. "Men who never go inside a church are deeply interested in the work of the Association."

Just what is meant by being "in touch with fifteen hundred churches" is not clear, since not nearly all of these churches contribute to the Association. Last year the secretary of the Association received only $480 salary, which sum was practically all the donations received by the Association. Quite a quantity of literature is printed and circulated, but this is made to pay for itself largely; while the special printing, such as programs, etc., for conventions, is paid for by special collections. Evidently the organization is not in a very flourishing financial condition, but the prospects are that its receipts will be considerably larger the coming year than during the past year. Many churches failed to contribute only because the matter was not thought of at the proper time.

The Evangelical Association, a branch of the Lutherans, seems to be really the backbone of the Sunday Rest Day Association, since most of its support must have come from the eighty churches composing that body. It is significant that while one branch of the Lutherans is opposed to drastic Sunday legislation, many have so far forgotten the principles of the Reformation as to look to the state to support a religious institution.

As the statement that men who never go inside of a church are deeply interested in the work of the Sunday Rest Day Association is wholly unsupported by any definite statement of facts, it can be treated only in general terms. We suspect that the wish to have this so is father to the thought that it is so. Certainly substantial evidence is lacking that such men are at all numerous.

However, there doubtless are irreligious men who are interested in the success of Sunday legislation. We have in mind now such a man in a Southern State, a confectioner, who, desiring to close his own shop on Sunday but not willing to make any financial sacrifice, prosecuted a poor, crippled Sabbatarian, who was doing his best to support his family by keeping a small candy and fruit stand, closing of course on the seventh day of the week, and keeping open on Sunday. Of course his more prosperous neighbor's motive was wholly selfish; yet he was "deeply interested" in maintaining the Sunday law.

The test of every movement and of every institution ought to be not the number interested in its success but the real merits of the movement itself. The question to which ministers of the gospel ought to apply themselves is: "Ought the church of Christ to turn to worldly men and to the state for support, or should she rely wholly upon the power of the Holy Spirit promised by her divine Lord?" The Scriptures call the former course spiritual adultery, while the church which depends wholly on her Lord is depicted as a pure woman faithful to her marriage yaws.
