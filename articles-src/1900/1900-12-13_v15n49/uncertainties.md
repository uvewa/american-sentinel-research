## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 3, Column 2, "Political Ideals in the Scriptures"
- **Text:** "marriage yaws" (near bottom of page 2)
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** "marriage yaws"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be a typographical error in the original. The context (discussing the church as a pure woman faithful to marriage) strongly suggests "marriage vows" would be the intended phrase. However, following transcription rules, the text as printed has been preserved exactly. The OCR clearly shows "yaws" not "vows."

### Page 14, Subscription Notice
- **Text:** Publisher contact information
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple address lines for Review and Herald Pub. Co.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Standard masthead information, clearly printed

## Summary
One probable typographical error preserved as printed per transcription guidelines. All other text transcribed with high confidence.
