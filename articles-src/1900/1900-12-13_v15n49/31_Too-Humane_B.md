Captain-General Campos was "too humane" to bring the war against the Cubans to a successful conclusion, and so he was recalled and General Weyler was placed in command. Our own war department it is said found fault with General Otis because he was "too humane," and he was succeeded by General McArthur, who is being urged to adopt more drastic measures against the Filipinos. Lord Roberts was also "too humane," and has been succeeded by Lord Kitchener. But as long ago as last September Lord Roberts took the position that the Boers were no longer waging a legitimate war and had no right, moral, natural or other, to persevere in their struggle for their nationality against British authority. So he served notice:

"First, That 'the farm nearest the scene of any attempt to injure the railroad line or wreck a train' (that is, break British communications) 'is to be burnt, and that all farms within a radius of ten miles are to be completely cleared of their stock, supplies, etc.'

"Second, That all women and children of Boers in arms against Britain, who may be living in towns occupied by the British army, will be expelled from those towns and compelled to seek protection where they may."

Lord Roberts defended this latter measure as necessary in order to prevent the transmission of intelligence to "our enemies." He notified General Botha to warn his burghers who had wives and children in towns occupied by the British, to prepare to receive them, and he continued:

"As nearly all the passengers' vehicles belonging to the Netherlands railway company have been removed eastward * * * the families must * * * travel in trucks. I will endeavor to provide Mrs. Kruger, Mrs. Botha, and as many other ladies as possible, with closed carriages, but I am not sure that I shall succeed in finding any."

Against this General Botha protested, saying:

"I sincerely regret to see that the determination of myself and burghers to persevere in the struggle for our independence will be avenged by you on our wives and children. Since it is the first instance of this kind known * * * in civilized warfare, nothing else remains for me to do but to protest against your proposed intentions, it being against the principles of civilized warfare and extremely cruel to women and children. It is especially cruel * * * to the wife of his honor, the State president, who, as you are aware, can not travel without fear of losing her life."

And this mode of warfare, wherein the women and children were driven from their homes because the men would not cease fighting, was inaugurated under a general who was "too humane," and who has been succeeded by one who is at least expected to be less humane; and yet the world prides itself upon its Christian civilization which has done so much to mitigate the horrors of war.
