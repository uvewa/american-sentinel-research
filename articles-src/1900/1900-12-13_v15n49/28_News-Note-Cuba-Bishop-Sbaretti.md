THE Cubans have from the first opposed the appointment of a foreign prelate to be head over them in religion, and the latest word from Havana is that "the fight now being waged against Bishop Sbaretti, the head of the Catholic Church in Cuba, and special representative of the Pope, continues to grow in bitterness." The Cubans want a religious leader chosen from one of their own number. Such a request, of course, savors too much of independence.
