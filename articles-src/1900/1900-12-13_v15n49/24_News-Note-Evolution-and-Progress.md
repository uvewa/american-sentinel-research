The idea that the world is growing better finds one of its strongest supports in the Darwinian theory of evolution. The evolutionist derives his hopes for the future from his ideas of the past. While it is evident to him that the condition of society to-day is any thing but promising, so that, as one evolutionist says, "men fear to face the future," and "no one has the heart to probe the next decade," still he believes that somehow mankind is bound to rise higher and higher in the plane of existence; for did he not rise to his present height from the plane of the lowest animal life? If it be true that man did ascend from the lower animal species in this way, then the belief in his further evolution to greater heights follows of necessity; and this evolutionary theory is now held almost universally in both the church and the world. Guided by what he does not know—by that which pertains only to an infinite, impenetrable past—the evolutionist goes contrary to every conclusion that is to be drawn from the things that he does know—that he learns from history and sees around him in the world to-day. Yet he fancies himself led by the highest wisdom.
