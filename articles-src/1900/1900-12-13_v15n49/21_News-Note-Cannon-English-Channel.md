A CANNON has lately been planted on the French side of the English channel at a point where the English coast is only eighteen miles distant. The cannon is one that can throw a projectile twenty miles, which would be two miles inland on English territory. A London paper has expressed some concern over the situation.

It is apparent that at the rate the throwing power of cannon is being increased it will not be very long before France can bombard England, and vice-versa, without the use of any fleet at all.
