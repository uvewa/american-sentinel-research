The Catholic Mirror of December 1 gives prominence to a letter from a Roman Catholic in Manila, descriptive of a "grand civic and religious parade" conducted there by the Dominican friars in honor of "our Lady of the Rosary." The writer lauds the friars in the highest terms, and does not see why such a magnificent procession, which carried six statues on which were over 200,000 worth of jewels and vestments, should not "forever silence the critics of the Dominicans."

The writer says that "everybody that is anybody in Manila turned out" to see the procession, but he regrets that it did not make the impression that was desired on the American commissioners, and on the officers of the army and navy. He believes, however, that "these object-lessons to those who have eyes to see will no doubt do away with much prejudice against the friars."

"The stars and stripes," he says further, "mean liberty of worship at home and abroad; so those who are its champions will see that it is not defiled and that the friars may continue to work in these islands." "What the friars did in Manila last Sunday they can do in any town in these islands. Let the stars and stripes float in every town and * * * give protection to the friars, and all will be peace and prosperity."

From which it is evident that the friars in the Philippines are supported by the Catholic authorities in America, and that from all indications the rule of the friars is not likely to be curtailed under the sovereignty of the United States.

Incidentally the Mirror's correspondent touches on the system of justice that is in vogue in the islands, by mentioning that "the native pastor of Malolos is now serving a six year's sentence for being an accomplice in the murder of a United States soldier. He was bound with ropes and led through the streets and country places to prison in some island, where he and others are being starved by headquarters' orders, until some information is obtained in reference to the crime for which he and they have been sentenced." (Italics ours.) In America they do not as yet starve criminals, and the finding of some information about the crime precedes the sentencing and deportation of the prisoner to the jail.
