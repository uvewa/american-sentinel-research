The coming Catholic federation "is not," says the Catholic Mirror, "to be sectarian in a narrow, bigoted sense, which would exclude in a principle all cooperation with non-Catholic organizations or individuals." There is to be cooperation, says the Mirror, "wherever our field is the same as theirs, and wherever we can join our efforts with theirs on the basis of a common Christian principle of morality." "There is no reason why a Catholic federation should not exercise its powerful influence where non-Catholic organizations have been trying to do good long before an organized effort had been made by Catholics."

This drawing together of Catholic and Protestant organizations is for a purpose that will be more clearly seen later on.
