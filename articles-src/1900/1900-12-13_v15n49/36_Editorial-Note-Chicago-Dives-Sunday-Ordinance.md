RECENTLY a movement against the "dives," constituting the resorts of the criminal and vicious classes, has been in progress in this city, and some of these places have been compelled to close up. One of the worse of these, smarting under the penalty inflicted on it by the friends of decency, sought for a weapon of retaliation, and now comes out with a threat to secure the enforcement of the Sunday-closing ordinance. In this case the execution of the threat may prove impossible owing to the fact that Chicago, unlike most cities, has no clear Sunday-closing ordinance, and the law of the State merely provides that no one shall on Sunday, by labor or amusement, "disturb the peace and good order of society."

We call attention to the incident, however, as affording a comment upon the nature of such ordinances. What must one think of the character of an ordinance which amounts to a dead letter so far as good citizens are concerned, and is invoked only by vicious people bent on using it as a weapon of retaliation, or by one class of religionists to make trouble for members of a rival sect? Christian clergymen who labor to uphold such ordinances should remember that the Christian's weapons of warfare for the reformation of society "are not carnal"—not such as the vicious element of society ever feel inclined to use.
