Krupp, the German iron manufacturer who turns out the big guns for Emperor William, the Sultan of Turkey, and whoever else has the cash to pay for them, is said to be the largest employer of labor in the world, having on his pay roll, Jan. 1, last, 41,750 men. It is significant, also, that this flourishing firm is engaged rather in supplying the implements of war than those of peace. Wars have always been more or less popular, and, notwithstanding our progress in civilization, there is no indication of any waning of this popularity.—Chicago News.
