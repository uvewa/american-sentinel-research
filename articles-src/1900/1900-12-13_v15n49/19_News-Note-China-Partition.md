A RECENT press dispatch, dated at Washington, states that the European Powers are now inclined to the policy of partitioning China, and that, if this is done, the United States "can consistently pursue one of two courses. She can withdraw absolutely from China, or she can join the 'concert' and be one of the beneficiaries when the territorial leases are secured as security for the payment of the indemnity." The dispatch adds that "to withdraw from China would, in the administration's opinion, be inglorious," and that to join in the partition act "with as great a degree of consistency as possible is the problem to be solved by this Government."
