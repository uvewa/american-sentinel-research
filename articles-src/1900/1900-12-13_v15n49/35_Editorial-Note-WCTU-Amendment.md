A PRESS report of the national convention of the W. C. T. U., held in Washington, D. C., December 3-6, states that an amendment to the constitution of the organization providing that nothing should be incorporated into any plan of W. C. T. U. work which might become the occasion of sectarian controversy, "was rejected by a vote of 312 to 15."

The author of this proposed amendment was Mrs. S. M. I. Henry, one of the founders of the W. C. T. U., and for some years its national evangelist. The object of the amendment was to prevent any sanction being given by the W. C. T. U. to the prosecution of seventh-day observers under the Sunday laws. Notice that such an amendment would be offered at this meeting was given by Mrs. Henry one year ago.

We believe that many members of this organization will yet see that a "Christian Temperance Union" has nothing to gain for its cause from joining with those who invoke the aid of the civil power to decide the religious controversy over the day of the week to be recognized as the Sabbath.
