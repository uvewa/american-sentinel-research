DISCOURSING upon the "sadness of science," in The Independent, David Starr Jordan, president of Leland Stanford University, makes some noteworthy statements.

Looking at "things as they really are," he says, "there is much to discourage in human history, in the facts of human life. The common man, after all the ages, is still very common. He is ignorant, reckless, unjust, selfish, easily misled. All public affairs bear the stamp of his weakness. Especially is this shown in the prevalence of war. The boasted progress of civilization is dissolved in the barbarism of war. Whether glory or conquest or commercial greed be war's purpose, the ultimate result of war is death. Its essential feature is the slaughter of the young, the brave, the ambitious, the hopeful; leaving the weak, the sickly, the discouraged, to perpetuate the race. Thus all militant nations become decadent ones."

"That there seems no way out of this," he continues, "is the cause of the boundless despair of the thinking men of Continental Europe." He then quotes from one of these, Dr. Ross:

"Progress seems to have ended in aimless discontent. The forces of darkness are still strong, and it seems sometimes as if the Middle Ages would swallow up everything won by modern struggles. Many alarms prove false, but it is the steady strain that tells on the mood. It is pathetic to see how men fear to face the future. No one has the heart to probe the next decade. The outlook is bounded by next Sunday in the park or theater. The people throw themselves into the pleasures of the moment with the desperation of doomed men who hear the ring of the hammer on the scaffold."

One can not help being reminded of those words uttered in Judea by the chief Prophet in the presence of His disciples, as His eye rested upon an age of the world then future:

"Distress of nations, with perplexity; * * * men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." Luke 21: 25, 26.

Can it be that we have reached the period of human history to which these prophetic words relate?
