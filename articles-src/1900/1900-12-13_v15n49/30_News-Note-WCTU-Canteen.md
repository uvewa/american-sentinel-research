The women of the W. C. T. U. are determined to destroy the army canteen, or military saloon. During the recent session of the National W. C. T. U. at Washington, the House passed an act abolishing the canteen, and an earnest effort is being made to secure favorable action in the Senate. Something of the nature of the contest and of the feeling that is being engendered by it may be gleaned from the following from the Washington correspondent of the Record of this city:

"The ladies of the W. C. T. U. have invaded the Senate and made earnest pleas for the abolition of the canteen before the committee on military affairs last Saturday. None of them had ever seen a canteen, but they had plenty of statements from others. A man of the name of Crafts, the same who says that he witnessed an orgy of the President and his cabinet over four bottles of appolinaris water in the President's room at the capitol on the closing night of the last session of Congress, testified that he had visited a canteen at Newport during the Spanish war and witnessed horrible scenes there. He said the soldiers were all drunk and that half of them deserted that night. The records of the war department show that Crafts must have been mistaken. There was no canteen at Newport during the Spanish war; there was no camp of soldiers there; there was no such desertion as he describes from any company or regiment at any camp during the war; but it is not a matter of any consequence, because Crafts has been before congressional committees repeatedly, and no attention is now paid to his statements."

It is doubtless true, as charged by Mr. Curtis, that Dr. Crafts was unfortunate, or he may have been even reckless in some of his statements, but certainly in this fight against the army canteen he is on the right side. The Government has no right to be in the saloon business. It is to be hoped that a good cause will not be injured by unwise methods.
