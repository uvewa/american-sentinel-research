A SAN FRANCISCO paper says that "the late Dr. Stallard left a fund to provide an annual prize for the best essay on the principles of the Declaration of Independence. The competition is limited to the students of Stanford and Berkeley Universities. The amount is one hundred and fifty dollars. This year's competition drew out exactly five essays from the two thousand Berkeley students and none from Stanford's eleven hundred. History is a specialty of Stanford, in fact it has more students there than in any other course except plain 'English.' It seems odd that none of the hundred and twenty-four who are devoted to historical lore should be found to venture on an opinion regarding the Declaration of our national independence."
