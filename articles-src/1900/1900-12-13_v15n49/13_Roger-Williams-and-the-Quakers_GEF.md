The biography of Roger Williams is an essential part of the early history of Rhode Island. Then, too, to all who believe in the total separation of church and state, and in the sovereignty of the individual conscience in matters relating to religion, all facts concerning Mr. Williams and his struggles and conflicts concerning this doctrine must ever be of absorbing interest.

It is well known how he was banished by the theocratic magistrates of Massachusetts from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to become, in the providence of God, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island. He first made himself unpopular with the authorities in Massachusetts by declaring that the charter of the colony was invalid. He contended that, as the land belonged to the Indians, it should be purchased from them, and that the king of England had no right to give it away and to authorize his subjects to take forcible possession, and to murder the Indians if they refused to vacate. Thus it was his high principles of honesty and integrity that brought him into disrepute. He discovered that the world, which is ever run on conventional standards, has no place in its galaxy of glory for a life of unswerving principle. Such lives are frequently glorified or canonized in after generations, but never while they are a standing rebuke to the shallowness and hypocrisy of their contemporaries.

The final cause of his banishment, however, was his views on the question of soul liberty. He taught that neither bishop nor king has a right to proscribe religious faith, holding that man is responsible for his religious opinions and practices to God alone. He denounced the law which compelled every man to contribute to the support of the church, and he denied the right of the magistrates to enforce any of the precepts of the first table of the decalogue which, he asserted, related to man's duty to God alone. The magistrates would not brook such limitations to their powers, and Williams was driven out in the dead of winter into the wilderness inhabited only by beasts and savages. To use his own words, he was "sorely tossed for one fourteen weeks in a bitter winter season, not knowing what bread or bed did mean." Having previously, while in Plymouth, made the acquaintance of the chiefs of the Wampanoags and the Narragansetts and learned their language, on reaching their country on the shores of the Narragansett Bay he was kindly received by them. From them he purchased territory, and he became the founder of the State of Rhode Island and of the city of Providence, which city he named in commemoration of God's merciful kindness to him in his distress.

Williams designed that the colony of Rhode Island should be a haven of rest for all those who were oppressed for conscience sake. There were some five or six men who came with Williams from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and settled with him on the Narragansett. In the original agreement between these men it was stipulated that there should always be in the territory they possessed perfect freedom of conscience.

Later, to protect the purchase he had made from the Indians from others who might seek to have the same territory granted to them by the king, Williams visited England and secured a charter from the king for the colony of Rhode Island. At this time, without regard to the will of the king, Massachusetts was independently oppressing, on account of their religion, even those who in the mother country might have lived peaceably and quietly. Mr. Williams made this one of the reasons for seeking of the king a charter for Rhode Island, and, at his request, the principles and guarantees of religious liberty were so clearly stated in the charter itself that Williams seems to have understood that, should these rights ever be violated in the colony, the charter itself would thereby become invalid.

That the effort to carry out these high principles at that early day was not without its difficulties is evident. We get a glimpse of this in the records, thus: "The 21st day of May, 1637, it was agreed that Joshua Verin, upon breach of covenant for restraining liberty of conscience, shall be withheld from the liberty of voting till he shall declare the contrary."—Rhode Island Colony Records, Vol. I, page 16.

It seems that Verin had refused to let his wife go to meeting to hear Mr. Williams preach as often as she wished to go. Of this occurrence, Governor Winthrop of Massachusetts writes as follows: "At Providence, also, the devil was not idle. For, whereas, at their first coming together, Mr. Williams and the rest did make an order that no man should be molested for his conscience, now men's wives and children and servants claim liberty hereby to go to all religious meetings, though never so often, or though private, or upon week days; and because one Verin refused to let his wife go to Mr. Williams so oft as she was called for, they required him to be censured. But there stood up one Arnold, a witty man of their own company, and withstood it, telling them that when he consented to that order, he never intended it should extend to the breach of the ordinance of God, such as the subjection of wives to their husbands. Then one Green replied that if they should restrain their wives, all the women in the country would cry out against them, etc. Arnold answered him thus: 'Did you pretend to leave Massachusetts because you would not offend God to please man, and now would you break an ordinance and commandment of God to please women?' In conclusion, when they would censure Verin, Arnold told them it was against their own order, for Verin did what he did out of conscience, and their order was that no man should be condemned for his conscience." Still Verin was censured and temporarily disfranchised, and he left Providence and went back to Salem. While there may be displayed some sense of humor in these words of Governor Winthrop, they can hardly have been written in bitterness or sarcasm, for long after this Williams wrote of Winthrop that "he loved me as a son to the end of his life."

This was doubtless only one of many incidents in the early history of religious liberty in Rhode Island, but these were only incidents.

The real test that came to Roger Williams and to his principles of soul liberty was over the question of the Quakers, as they were then called. It was natural that the Quakers, proscribed in all the other colonies and persecuted to the death in Massachusetts, should rendezvous in Rhode Island. This the records show that they did in large numbers. It was natural, too, that Roger Williams and the Quakers should mutually misunderstand each other. This is almost always true to some degree of both parties to a present controversy. It requires the perspective of after years to make some things perfectly plain.

Roger Williams abhorred the teachings of the Quakers, and considered them not only pervasive of the gospel, but also subversive of all order and of all authority both ecclesiastical and civil. While restricting civil authority strictly to civil things, Mr. Williams believed in civil authority and in the privilege and duty of every Christian to take part in civil government and thus to restrain the ungodly from their incivilities. Right or wrong, this was his belief, and it was never his nature to believe things by halves.

He also believed in the authority and discipline of the church over its members. One of the reasons why, in his estimation, the union of church and state was so evil, was that it inevitably resulted in the lowering of the standard of the church to the level of the state. When the church consisted of only those who voluntarily associated themselves for religious purposes, the authority of the church could maintain the discipline at a high standard without wronging any one, since he who dissented was free to withdraw. The Quaker doctrine of the "inner light" seemed to Mr. Williams to be subversive of all such authority and discipline of the church. It was undeniable, as the Quakers taught, that church authority as well as the authority of the state, had often been used to hinder and persecute the truth. So there was truth in their teaching that one man with the inner light—one man under the immediate guidance and inspiration of the Spirit—was higher in authority than a whole united church without this Spirit. On the other hand, it was doubtless true that there were those among the Quakers who professed this inner light who did not possess it, and who, by their actions in taking unwarranted liberties, gave pith and point to the argument against them.

The Quakers were also non-combatants, and believing that a Christian could not bear arms and fight, many of them believed and taught that the citizenship of the Christian was in heaven only, and that he could therefore take no part in earthly governments. They believed also that these conclusions of theirs were the only logical conclusions from Mr. Williams' own premises, and that Mr. Williams was denying himself in not receiving them. All this Mr. Williams rejected with indignation, and considered as nothing short of sheer anarchy. So, as we have already said, he considered their teachings as subversive of all authority, both ecclesiastical and civil. When all this is remembered, together with the fact that the Quakers were becoming numerous in Rhode Island, and that the other colonies were beseeching almost threateningly that Rhode Island unite with them in their banishment lest they bring law and order into disrepute, it will be seen that in this matter Williams' principles of religious liberty were put to the utmost test.

It is the accusation of the Quakers, first made by George Fox himself, that in this matter Mr. Williams was untrue to his principles, and that he, to some extent, sanctioned their persecution. In another paper we shall consider this accusation.
