CHRISTIANITY is an individual matter. "Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God," says the Scripture; and also, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth." And again: "So then, every one of us shall give account of himself to God."

Man, the individual, was created to love, believe, and obey his Maker. Civil governments were created not to love anybody nor to experience emotions of any kind. The gospel message to man is, "He that believeth and is baptized, the same shall be saved," but no civil government can believe, be baptized, and be "saved." Civil governments are temporal; the salvation of the gospel is for eternity.

The sphere of the individual human being is thus altogether different from that of the political entity created by individuals acting collectively, known as the government. Civil governments exist to preserve rights; to give order and peace to society in the place of anarchy. That is their sphere, and so far as Christianity can apply to it, civil governments can be Christian. But manifestly, the government to be Christian must at least do what it is created to do; it must preserve the rights of the individuals who live under it. And if it does this, it will preserve the right of religious freedom—the right to be guided in religion by the dictates of one's own conscience; it will frown upon any measure that would compel the conscience.

The very way, therefore, for a government to manifest its Christianity is to compel no one in religious matters, to have no laws that would force the consciences of any, but to leave every one free to follow the dictates of his own mind. In other words, the civil government must be neutral; it must have nothing to do with religion one way or the other. This may at first glance appear like an anti-Christian attitude; but it is not so. It is the attitude which expresses as nearly as any civil government can express it, a Christian character. The government can not be religious without also being anti-religious, and interfering with the liberty of religious dissenters; to espouse one religion is necessarily to oppose some other religion. Jesus Christ said: "Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's." All religious service belongs to God, and therefore Cæsar can claim nothing in religion without exceeding his right; and while Cæsar acts in harmony with these words of Christ he comes nearer to being Christian than when he violates them, and demands religious obedience unto himself.
