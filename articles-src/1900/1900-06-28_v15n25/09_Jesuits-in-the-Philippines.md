Commenting upon our note of two weeks since, in which we remarked that "three causes are operating to prevent the restoration of peace" in the Philippines, an exchange says: "The three 'causes' might be summed up in one word, 'Jesuits.' Then we have the root of the matter. The sooner Americans learn the methods of these slick underhand workers the better. The white ants of Popery, as they have been properly named."
