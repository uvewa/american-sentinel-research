B. A. Abbott well says in an article in the Christian Century:

"The right of liberty is inalienable. No man has a right to sell any part of his body. Any philosophy that proceeds on such a principle will sooner or later bring its professors to grief. Labor has no rights; capital has no rights. Rights belong to men. Laws should be made for the sake of manhood and not for the sake of business."

This is the keynote of the whole question of human rights.

"Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey
Where wealth accumulates and men decay;
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade;
A breath can make them as a breath has made,
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride,
When once destroyed, can never be supplied."

The question of rights is not one to be settled by majorities. No majority, however large, has any legitimate power to deprive the minority of any natural right.

No man can answer for another at the bar of God; therefore no man ought to assume to be conscience for another.

Civil government has done its whole duty when it has secured the ends of civil justice. It has nothing to do with preparing anybody for a future life.
