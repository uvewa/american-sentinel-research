Just in proportion as churches have lost the power of God they have sought the power of the state.

No civil government has any rightful jurisdiction over anything pertaining to a future state of existence.

Self-control and love of justice are essential to "government of the people by the people." To lose these is to lose liberty.

No live, spiritual church of Christ ever used or desired to use the civil law to enforce religious dogmas or promote morality.

The state is not competent to decide what is morally right or morally wrong. It cannot do this without infringing the rights of conscience. The teachings of Luther were held by the chief civil authorities of his day to be highly immoral. His books were burned and he narrowly escaped the same fate. In some countries even to-day it is held to be highly immoral and even blasphemous to speak against the Virgin Mary. There is no certain standard by which the state can decide such questions. To undertake such a decision on the basis of the divine law is only to decide by some human interpretation of that law.

Popular government can be long maintained only by a people devoted to the principles of liberty.

All men are equally God's servants, hence no man has any right to dictate to his fellow man in any matter pertaining to God, for of each one it is said by the Lord himself: "To his own Master he standeth or falleth."
