The Primative Catholic, of Brooklyn, N. Y., notes that the Catholic Truth Society has prefixed the word "International" to its name. Among the items of work reported is "supplying regularly and gratuitously about nine hundred families with papers and magazines in sparsely settled localities in the South and West; the names being supplied by priests."

"Another item in the report," remarks the Primative Catholic, "is the placing on the shelves of public libraries over eight hundred volumes of the ablest Catholic works. All this has been accomplished in one year."

The secretary in making his report also notes "with satisfaction" "the work accomplished by the society in having expunged from text-books calumnies against the Catholic Church."

"The calumnies against the Catholic Church," says the Primative Catholic, "are the true facts of history regarding Rome, and her past doings. It is to the everlasting disgrace of Americans that these histories have been mutilated. And even in this garbled condition, it is expounded, in numerous instances, in our public schools by Romish teachers."
