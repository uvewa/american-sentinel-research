As noted in these columns last week, the Hamburg, Iowa, ministers are making a strong effort to secure from the city council an ordinance closing places of business on Sunday. A Hamburg paper says: "Rev. Enders made an eloquent and able plea before the council in favor of closing." It is strange, indeed, what an interest the preachers take in "civil" matters when it comes to using civil law to enforce a religious institution.
