The statue of Liberty Enlightening the World, on Bedloe's Island, in New York harbor, is said to be in a rather woe-begone condition. The Herald of that city says of the statue:

"Standing as she does mantled in a heavy coating of green rust, she presents a much bedraggled appearance, and her condition is the occasion for much adverse comment among the many thousands whose business or pleasure takes them down the bay."

Commenting upon this, the Springfield Republican says: "It is small wonder that a statue of liberty should grow rusty nowadays. Pull it down and put up a statue of Dr. Gatling."
