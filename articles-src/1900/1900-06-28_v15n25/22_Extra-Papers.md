We have a limited number of papers left over each week, which we would be glad to supply in lots of twenty-five or more to one address, at one cent per copy. Since our previous announcement concerning these back numbers, we have received a good many orders. The issues of May 10 and June 7 are nearly exhausted. Orders for these will be filled, however, as long as the papers on hand last. We have a larger supply of other numbers. There are thousands of people everywhere who need these papers, and yet the supply is limited to hundreds.
