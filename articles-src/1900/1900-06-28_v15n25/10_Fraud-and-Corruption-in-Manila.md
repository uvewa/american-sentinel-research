"Wholesale fraud and corruption," says the Catholic Standard and Times, "honeycomb our public service in Manila. The Taft Commission just arrived there are said to be 'staggered' by the universality of waste and peculation under our 'carpet-bag' government. And General Otis goes on coolly referring to the Tagalo insurgents as 'robbers.'"
