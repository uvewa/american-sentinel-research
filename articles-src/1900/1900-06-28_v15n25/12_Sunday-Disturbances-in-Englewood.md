"The proverbial quietude and peacefulness of Englewood on Sunday mornings is being fearfully shattered these days," says the Chronicle of this city. Every Sunday morning "there is a lively state of affairs in the neighborhood of Sixty-third and Halsted streets which occurs with such regularity that now crowds are beginning to assemble to see the fun."

The occasion of the disturbance is an effort to induce a dealer in clothing and shoes to close his store on Sunday.

This merchant keeps open a few hours Sunday forenoon, but gives each of his clerks a whole day's vacation each week. These clerks have signed a written statement that they are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement; but though they are satisfied others are not, and demand that the store be closed all day Sunday.
