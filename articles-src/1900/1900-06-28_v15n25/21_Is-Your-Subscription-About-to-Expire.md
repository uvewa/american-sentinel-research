A good many subscriptions to The Sentinel of Liberty expire this month. You can tell by looking at the little yellow label on the paper if yours is among the number. If so, please to send in your renewal at once. By so doing you will avoid missing any number of the paper and will save us the trouble of cutting off your name and then restoring it again a week or two later. We need your help, and you need the Sentinel.
