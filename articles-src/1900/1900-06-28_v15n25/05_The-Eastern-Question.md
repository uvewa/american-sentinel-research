Hon. James A. Brice, M. P., author of The American Commonwealth, has contributed to the Saturday Evening Post of June 2 a most interesting article on the Eastern Question, in which he gives a plain, unvarnished statement of the relations which the several great Powers sustain to the Porte, and their several interests in Turkish territory.

The Eastern Question has long been one of absorbing interest to all the civilized world, and especially to those who view its settlement in the light of divine prophecy. Both inspiration and the logic of events point unmistakably to the utter extinction of the Turkish empire. And if prophetic expositors read aright the divine predictions, momentous issues are at stake in the settlement of this question. The crowned heads of Europe see in it only an opportunity to enlarge the trade of their people or to extend their frontiers; but to the student of prophecy it means the ushering in of the everlasting Kingdom of God.

Of course Mr. Brice deals with the question only from the standpoint of the statesman. The "dim foreshadowings of the future," which he says "we seem at last to see," are seen only in the trend of events. But in this case human foresight and divine foreknowledge are in practical agreement so far as the former goes. They part company only because when the finite fails the Infinite goes on telling what shall be after the settlement of the Eastern Question by the Powers of earth.

"The passionate eagerness," says Mr. Brice, "with which all Europe has been watching the struggle in South Africa during the last six months tends to throw into the background other questions of not less real and permanent importance, questions which have before now formed the central point of European politics, and which may do so again. "Among these," he continues, "is the condition of the always moribund but never expiring Turkish Sultanate."

The loss of Crete two years ago is referred to as "another stage" in the decadence of the Turkish power. But since this "the Sultan and his crimes have receded from view, though those who know something about the maladministration and race hatreds in Macedonia, know how critical the situation continues to be there, and how easy it would be for either the Servians or the Bulgarians to light up an insurrection in those regions which would involve all Eastern Europe in the flames of war."

To Austria and Russia, Mr. Brice gives the credit of preserving peace for the time being. The former controls Servia, the latter Bulgaria. "So things remain tolerably quiet, and the only change likely to occur in the near future is the erection of Bulgaria into a kingdom, an access of dignity which Prince Ferdinand is believed to desire and to be steadily working for."

## THE GERMAN EMPEROR AND HIS PROGRESSIVE POLICY.

But while the status quo is being preserved in European Turkey by Austrian and Russian influence, "some very interesting developments have been going forward in Asia Minor. It is now at least twenty years," says Mr. Brice, "since the idea of possible German action in that region presented itself to forecasting minds, though under the regime of Bismarck, who was severely practical and averse to new or speculative enterprises, little or nothing was done to push forward such action. By degrees, however, German officers began to be engaged to reform the army system of the Turks, and German capitalists were found at Constantinople pressing for, and before long obtaining, concessions for railways, for mines, and for other large industrial enterprises."

All this has been pleasing to Emperor William, who "has encouraged his subjects to embark their capital in Turkey, seeing in this another market for German industry and another field for German enterprise."

While his people have been investing their capital in Turkey, the German Emperor has not been an idle spectator. "His courtesies to Abdul Hamid," remarks Mr. Brice, "which caused some surprise in 1895 and 1896, and which culminated in his visit to that monarch in November, 1898, have usually been attributed to this motive."

But whatever the motives of the Germans, their success in a business way has been well-nigh phenomenal. "They have quite superseded the English, who used to play the leading part in the commercial and industrial affairs of the Turkish Empire."

The reason assigned for the great change is that "ever since the taking of Cyprus by the English government in the days of Lord Beaconsfield, and the vehement condemnation of Turkish cruelties by Mr. Gladstone, England has been the Power most odious to the Sultan, while since the Armenian massacres of 1895-6 it has been recognized that there can be no more of such protection given to the Sultan by the English as was given in the old days when England thought it essential to her interests to check the approach of Russia toward Constantinople."

Occupying this vantage ground, and receiving "from their Ambassador that diplomatic support which is essential in an Eastern court, they have shown great energy, especially in projecting railways. Recently a concession has been granted to them for extending the railway from Constantinople to Angora, already built by German capital, farther out southeastward from across the center of Asia Minor and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf."

## RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN ASIA MINOR.

And now comes if possible a still more interesting chapter in this story of European diplomacy, "Russia could not be indifferent to the sanction thus given to an enterprise of such magnitude," says the writer whom we quote. "Some think that she resisted it. Others, with more apparent reason, hold that she had been previously 'squared' by Germany, as it is pretty certain that England was squared by the secret agreement concluded between her and Germany in 1898."

"It is a first principle of German imperial policy," continues Mr. Brice, "not to quarrel with Russia. Be this as it may, Russia used the event as a basis for the demand to have her right to similar railway concessions in another area recognized; and the Sultan, with much reluctance, has found himself obliged to yield to this demand. He had nowhere to turn to for support, for while France, of course, always supports Russia, Germany, having had her own share, could not in this instance interfere against her, and England no longer comes into question."

## VIRTUAL PARTITIONMENT OF ASIA MINOR.

The significance of what has been thus accomplished, not by war but by diplomacy, will be seen in the light of this statement: "Thus there has been effected by these railway arrangements a virtual partitionment of Asia Minor into two 'spheres of influence,' to adopt the expression which has been used in Africa and in China to mark the acquisition of European claims to territories not yet actually annexed by European claimants. Germany takes the south and southeast of the country; Russia the north and northeast."

It is not thought probable that Russia, with so much undeveloped territory elsewhere, will actually build the railways authorized by the concessions she has obtained, but she can keep out rivals and competitors. "The Germans, however, will doubtless make their railway. They have promised to offer part of the capital to be subscribed in France, with the view to propitiating French opinion, and it is believed that the enterprise may turn out a pecuniary success."

## RUSSIA CAN WAIT.

"Russia," says Mr. Brice, "can afford to wait. She has scored a great success. She has made another of those onward steps by which, more frequently without war than through war, her territory is constantly growing, and her influence extending beyond the limits of her territorial authority. *She is now predominant in Persia*, a hopelessly feeble state with a vast area and a scanty population. She is also predominant in Manchuria, and will, when her Trans-Siberian Railway has been completed, be able to terrorize China. Across the whole length of Asia, from the Black Sea on the west to the Yellow Sea on the east, she can, when she pleases, add without difficulty many thousands of square miles to her dominions. Having time on her side, she is prudently anxious to perfect her railway system and have some money in hand before she absorbs fresh districts on which much money would have to be spent.

Still more recent events—events still future when Mr. Brice was writing his article for the Saturday Evening Post—further strengthen Russia's position, especially in eastern Asia. The Czar was the only European ruler having a really effective land force within easy striking distance of Peking at the time of the "Boxer" outbreak there, which, it seems possible, may end in the speedy partitioning of the Chinese Empire.

## WHY ENGLAND HESITATES.

"The times have been when such an advantage as Russia has gained by the virtual admission of her influence over the whole northern part of the Turkish Empire," says Mr. Brice, to say nothing of the advantage she is now gaining in China, "would have filled the English with alarm and aroused them to opposition. Even so late as 1878, Lord Salisbury's Anglo-Turkish convention bound England to defend by arms the Turkish frontiers against the Czar. But England is now so absorbed in her South African troubles as to have no thought of those interests in the Orient which were lately held so precious."

From Mr. Brice's viewpoint at the time he wrote, "sudden and startling as this change in English policy is, it" did not seem to him then a thing to be regretted. "It had become impossible," he says, "for England to support the Turks, and it was impossible for her to replace their bad government by a better one of her own. She was too far off—she has her hands already too full in other places. She may see without disquiet the partitionment of Asia Minor between Germany and Russia, for she was not in a position to claim a share, even would it have been to her interest to do so. Egypt, which she has got already, which she has done much to improve, and which she seems now likely to keep, is really a burden rather than a source of strength. The influence of Germany cannot fail to better the lot of the unfortunate Christian subjects of the Turk, nor will she show herself unfriendly to American missions and to Western education, as the Russians sometimes do. And if England wishes to keep Russia from coming down to the coasts of the Levant, the interposition of Germany is, from the English point of view, to be regarded as an absolute gain."

"These, however," he concludes, "may be deemed minor matters. The great fact which stands out is the admission which Russia has at last secured of her exclusive influence over the whole northeast of the Turkish dominions, and the acquiescence of her three old antagonists of Crimean war days. France is silent, because she must have the alliance of Russia at all costs. England is silent for the reasons already set forth. Austria and Italy follow Germany, and Germany has got her own share. We seem at last to see, in dim foreshadowings of the future, the outlines of a settlement of that 'Eastern Question' which has so grievously perplexed English and Continental statesmen for more than a century."
