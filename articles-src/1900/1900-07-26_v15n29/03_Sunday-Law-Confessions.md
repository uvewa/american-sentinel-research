Every clause in every Sunday law in all the world, that exempts those "who conscientiously believe in and who actually observe as a Sabbath a day other than Sunday," is a confession that such legislation is an invasion of the rights of conscience.

Every such exemption is a confession that the keeping of a Sabbath is a religious act; which to be of any value must be done conscientiously, and should not therefore be enforced by the state.

No statute against murder, or theft, or assault, or arson, or slander ever contains a clause exempting from its penalty those who may do any one or all of those things "conscientiously."

And why do not laws against murder, theft, etc., contain clauses exempting from their penalties those who violate them "conscientiously?" Simply because they are purely civil, entirely outside the domain of conscience, and are designed for the protection, not of creeds, cults, or dogmas, but of men.

You have a right to observe the Sabbath, but not at the expense of some one else.
