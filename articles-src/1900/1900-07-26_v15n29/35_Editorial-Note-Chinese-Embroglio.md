So grave a situation as the Chinese embroglio has not confronted civilization since the fall of Constantinople and the Turkish invasion of Europe. The population of the Chinese empire is not definitely known, but is variously estimated at from 380,000,000 to 400,000,000, with a territorial area of 4,200,000 square miles.

The leading nations of the earth, the United States, Great Britain (not including India), Austria, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia, exceed the highest estimate of the population of China by only 15,000,000. This excess of population would be overcome many-fold, other things being equal, by the fact that in case any or all of the great powers declare war against China, the Chinese would fight in their own territory and close to their base of supplies, while the allied powers would be compelled to transport both men and supplies thousands of miles, mostly by water. But other things are not equal, so that the result of a war wherein the world would be arrayed against China cannot be considered doubtful.

But, the Chronicle of this city remarks, "the time of peril [to civilization] is not now, nor is the danger from the Mongolians. The menace to the peace of the world will be felt when China shall have been conquered—when the division of the spoils begins. There are already signs of a 'flocking together' among the powers. The line of cleavage is partly visible."

Then follows the statement that from present indications it seems likely that Russia, France, and Germany would stand together; while common interest would naturally place England, the United States, and Japan on the other side. "If these contending forces should come to blows," says the Chronicle, "there would indeed be a Titanic struggle."
