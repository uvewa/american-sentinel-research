Officially, Germany is one of the most religious of countries. It has Sunday laws which are strictly enforced. Christianity is recognized by the government, and its institutions are supported out of the public treasury. Religion is taught in the public schools, which all the children are required to attend, so that none is without religious instruction.

But notwithstanding the governmental support given to religion in Germany, the larger towns of that country "have a smaller number of churches," says Dr. Stocker, "in proportion to the population than those of any other country in Christendom." This is a fact that everybody, especially those who find themselves inclined to trust in legislative acts to reform society, save the nation, or revive religion, would do well to consider carefully.
