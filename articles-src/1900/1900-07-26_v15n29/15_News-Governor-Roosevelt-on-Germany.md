Republican vice-presidential candidate, Governor Roosevelt, is credited in the newspaper reports of his St. Paul speech, with these words:

"Read the notes issued by Von Bulow, speaking for Germany, and John Hay, speaking for ourselves, and see how absolutely alike are the policies therein outlined. We are taking the only course consistent with our national self-interest and our national self-respect, and, above all, with the good of mankind at large."

This was said concerning the Chinese embroglio, but is not likely to be generally accepted as reassuring by the American people. Mr. Hay is probably acting wisely in insisting that the United States are not at war with China; and possibly so in insisting that the President has ample power to deal with the present situation without consulting Congress; but the fact that his utterances upon any subject are so very similar to those of the German chancellor will not commend them to a self-governing people. The fact that without any very critical examination any one can "see how absolutely alike are the policies" of the American and European governments is one of the most alarming features of the times. The United States are becoming too much "like all the nations" in many respects.
