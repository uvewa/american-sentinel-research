At the dedication of the site of Dr. Dowie's "Zion City," six miles north of Waukegan on the shore of Lake Michigan, July 14, the Doctor is reported to have said: "God made the world, and he made it for his people. They only have a right to it. The rule of a country 'by the people, for the people,' is not a good thing. The right form of government is the rule of all things by God and for God."

Such sentiments are not original with Dr. Dowie. From time to time men have arisen who have first claimed the earth for the Lord, and then for themselves as the Lord's representatives. The trouble begins when they attempt to take possession. However, there are no indications that Dr. Dowie and his followers contemplate any illegal acts.

But the sentiment expressed by the Doctor is no less mischievous because it is not likely to lead to overt acts of lawlessness. The assumption of a right to rule in God's name and for him, is much more to be feared than would be any overt act. The self-appointed trustee of God is always an embezzler of the rights of men, and there are entirely too many such trustees doing business for the Lord (?) now.

It is true that "the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof," but for the time being he has "given it to the children of men." Therefore "government of the people, by the people and for the people" is a good thing. It is just the way the world ought to be governed, and such government has always been immeasurably better, when it was such indeed, than any government ever established and administered by self-appointed trustees of God.
