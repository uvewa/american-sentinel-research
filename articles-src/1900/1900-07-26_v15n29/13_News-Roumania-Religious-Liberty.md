The American Israelite complains that "in Roumania, where religious liberty and political equality were pledged by its government as a condition of the guarantee of Roumanian independence by the treaty of the Powers, the Jew is deprived of citizenship; he is excluded from all occupations but the most menial, his children are not admitted to the public schools, and his life, limbs and property are at all times at the mercy of Christian mobs, who frequently avail themselves of their power, which their priests teach them is part of the reward from heaven for fidelity to the church." After so citing the facts, the "Israelite" asks, "Is there anything worse than this among the Confucians?"

Certainly not; but it makes a great difference whose ox is gored. Besides written guarantees of rights either civil or religious are worthless if not supported by enlightened, liberal public sentiment. In no country in the world can more ample guarantees of religious liberty be found than in the United States and yet there is scarcely a State in the Union that does not have upon its statute books and in its court reports laws and decisions trenching upon liberty of conscience. The ideal has not yet been attained and just now the forces of bigotry not only in this country but everywhere seem not only to have effectually scotched the wheels of progress, but to have turned them backward.
