At a recent convention in Philadelphia of the Knights of St. John the appointment of committees was advocated "whose most important function should be to see that all books of an anti-Catholic character are kept out of the public libraries and public schools."

The writer is not in favor of virulent attacks upon Catholics or any other class of people, but the wisdom or effectiveness of this policy toward even such attacks, is open to very serious question. Books which are unjust and which misrepresent and distort the truth, are their own best negatives, and the man who cares only for the truth can afford to let them defeat themselves. It is to be feared that the move here contemplated would not end simply with the exclusion of books of this kind. This proposed "index expurgatorius" for public libraries and public schools would no doubt, in its exclusion of "all books of an anti-Catholic character," place the ban upon many books in which are faithfully recorded the facts of history. Any reference to those acts of bigotry and intolerance which have stained with the blood of martyrs the fairest portions of the Old World, would, of course, be sufficient to secure the condemnation of the book in which it was found.

By no means the least of the tyrannies and oppressions of which many books tell us, was the suppression and burning of books which were deemed dangerous by those who placed the interests of the church above the interests of truth and human liberty.

Will such books be allowed to remain? Clearly not; it follows, therefore, that the greater part of the history of Europe—from the fourth to almost the nineteenth century—would be excluded, or at least so colored and falsified as to be utterly misleading. Even the writings of the apostle John himself, after whom this society is named, could scarcely escape. Here are quotations from books that he wrote: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world but to save the world." "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword." These and many other great truths equally plain contained in the books of which John was the writer, would be sufficient, we fear, to place them among "books of an anti-Catholic character."

It is chiefly to books that we must go to learn of the direful and woful results in all ages of the efforts of civil and ecclesiastical powers to crush all opinion declared "anti" by them. With such books our libraries abound, and they will be left incomplete indeed if this policy is carried out. If Catholics may exclude from the libraries and schools what they deem inimical to the interests of the church, why may not other religionists and classes of people do the same with reference to books that they consider against their interests? It is plainly evident that if this policy were to begin libraries would no longer be entitled to the name and would soon become a thing of the past. Books would again become as scarce and as difficult of access for the people as they were when the Waldensian and Vandois was obliged to carry his precious manuscripts to the people concealed in the peddler's pack, and when Luther during the hours of the night pored over the Bible chained to the convent walls of Erfurt.

The public libraries and public schools are for the whole people, not for one class of people. They exist not to antagonize any class or any religion, and they must not be made to favor any class or any religion. Were it not that special religious interests have and are being given in this country almost anything they demand, we could not take seriously, this proposed action of the Knights of St. John; for we are utterly unable to understand how anyone who has intelligence enough to advocate anything and who has the slightest conception of what public schools and libraries are for, should expect them to be conducted with especial and exclusive consideration for him and his religion; for that is what this demand amounts to.

He who cares but for the truth and hopes that right alone shall prevail, will not resort to such weak and questionable measures. He will rest assured that books that are unjust will prove to every candid mind their unfairness; and he will not fear those books in which are faithfully recorded the facts of history.

Some of those facts may be against him or the body to which he belongs. He will prize them the more highly for that very reason, because they will be his greatest aids and surest guides in making it impossible for any such facts ever again to be registered against him.

Let there be no return to the methods of the Dark Ages in dealing with opponents in the field of discussion. Let us not maintain ourselves and our opinions by shutting from men the facts and information to which they are entitled and must have in forming correct opinions, nor by crushing opinions which have not been formed in accordance with our own. Let us be more anxious to see and know that we ourselves are right, than to suppress those whom we deem to be wrong.

JOHN D. BRADLEY.
