A Cuban correspondent of the Catholic Standard and Times, writing from Havana under date of July 9, says of the operations of Protestants in the island:

"Inasmuch as Cubans are, almost without exception, baptized Catholics, those missionaries, in so far as their work is among the Cubans, cannot be looked upon other than as proselytizers, and, therefore, with disfavor; but I have been following their work since the first days of the American occupation, and do not think there is really cause on the part of the Catholics for any particular anxiety on the subject."

The public schools, this correspondent thinks, will entirely supplant the denominational schools now maintained by several different Protestant churches. He says:

"I am happy to think, however, that many of those children will enter the public school next fall which has been organized since the missionaries began their labors; and while no religious instruction will be allowed in those schools, they will be taught by Catholics who will not poison the minds of their pupils with error, and, eventually, when the Cubans regain their mental equilibrium, which has been considerably perturbed by passing revolutions, I hope to see religious instruction made a part of the public school curriculum."

The conclusion of the Times' correspondent is that "considerable money will be spent by our proselytizing friends at the expense of their home supporters, with little result save that of furnishing employment to hungry ministers. The harm they will do will be trifling compared to the genuine progress which their tactics will produce in the Catholic Church of the island."
