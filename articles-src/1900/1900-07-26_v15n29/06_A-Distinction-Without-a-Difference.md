In endeavoring to show a necessity for Sunday laws, it is admitted that the state has no right to require Sunday rest on religious grounds; but it is held that the state can rightfully require the same thing on civil grounds. If the state made an individual stop work on Sunday because Sunday is a religious day, that would plainly be doing him a wrong; but if it required him to desist from Sunday work because rest one day in seven is a physical necessity to man's well being, or something of that kind, that would be all right.

Precisely the same thing is required of the individual in both cases; precisely the same effect is felt by the individual. Yet we are asked to believe that in the one case he would be suffering a wrong, while in the other case there would be no wrong done to him whatever. Whether he suffered an injustice or not would be not a question of the nature of the act or its result upon him at all, but only of the motive by which the act was prompted! Such distinctions we confess are altogether too fine for our comprehension.

If the thing prohibited were something wrong in its very nature, as murder or theft, the case would be different. The state cannot deal with murder from a religious standpoint, that is, as a sin, but can deal with it as a crime, and as such prohibits it under the severest penalties. But honest labor cannot be classed with murder, theft, or any other act wrong in itself. Honest labor is not a thing to be prohibited as an enemy of social peace and order. It would be far more reasonable to prohibit idleness on such grounds, since idleness is known to breed disturbance and crime.

In the one case the act is wrong in itself, and is prohibited for that reason. By its prohibition no injustice can be done to anyone. In the other case—where labor on Sunday is prohibited—it is admitted that injustice is done the person who is thus restrained, if the reason for the prohibition be a religious one; and this is an acknowledgment that the act is all right in its character and may be for the benefit of the person performing it, which could not be true of anything wrong in itself. The individual suffers a hardship in being compelled to lose one-seventh of his time, which is an injustice to him on religious grounds, yet the very same hardship is no injustice at all if the reason for it is alleged upon civil grounds. Injustice becomes justice simply by alleging a civil reason for it in the place of a religious one. Verily there is something in a name, after all!

If it is wrong to interfere with personal freedom on Sunday on religious grounds—if such interference would in any case be an invasion of one's rights—it must be an invasion of rights and an injustice no matter how many changes may be rung upon the name under which the action is sought to be justified. The act of compelling a man to stop his work and remain idle on Sunday could not be an invasion of his rights under one name, if it were not an invasion under every name; since the act itself, and its effects upon him, remain precisely the same in every case.

The admission that it would be unjust to prohibit work on Sunday save for the alleged civil necessity for such restraint, is fatal to the attempt to justify the Sunday laws. It is a confession of their injustice.
