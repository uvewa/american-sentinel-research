Christ came to his own and his own received him not. He came as a prince, king, monarch. He came preaching the gospel of his kingdom.

Impatiently all his people watched him, expecting every moment that he would issue a proclamation declaring himself king, and calling upon the Jews to flock to his standard. Breathlessly they awaited the gladsome hour when he would demand their allegiance and rally their carnal weapons to the support of his claims to the headship of a universal monarchy.

But how vastly, how infinitely different, was the monarchy of the Master. To that pure and holy One the power of earthly governments was a thing to be rejected and despised. Beautifully have the feelings of the Lord upon this great theme been depicted by the late Thomas Hewlings Stockton:

"There was one sacrifice too great for Christ to make: He was willing to leave the throne of the universe for the manger of Bethlehem; willing to grow up as the son of a poor carpenter; willing to be called the friend of publicans and sinners; willing to be watched by jealous eyes, and slandered by lying tongues, and hated by murderous hearts, and betrayed by friendly hands, and denied by pledged lips, and rejected by apostate priests and deluded populace and cowardly princes; willing to be sentenced to the cross and bleed and groan. But he was not willing to wear an earthly crown or robe, or wield an earthly sceptre, or exercise earthly rule. That would have been too great a sacrifice! He did, indeed, endure the crown of thorns, and the cast-off purple and the reed, and the cry, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' but this was merely because he preferred the mockery to the reality; so pouring infinite contempt on the one, not only by rejecting it in the beginning of his ministry, but also by accepting the other at its close."

He came as king; he came to a race of rebels in insurrection against his rule, but he came not to be ministered unto but to minister. Strange monarch! strange monarchy! In answer to a question from a government official named Pilate, he said, "My kingdom is not of this world: for if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight." In this one sweeping statement he renounces for himself forever the support of human power, the strength of human arms; his was to be a new kingdom, a new kind of monarchy, of a nature so different from all that had ever preceded it, so infinitely more spiritual in its distinguishing characteristics and traits, that the announcement of its policy shocked, amazed and confounded the nation of the Jews.

Had the Lord been willing to institute a government after the pattern of those of earth with Himself at its head, the Jews would everywhere have crowded to his banners. Many would have been willing to recognize him as king had he only been willing to satisfy the desires of the natural heart by offering them place and position in his kingdom. Even his disciples were not altogether free from the idea that his kingdom was an earthly one; they were not without a taint of selfishness, desiring the chief offices of state.

"Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him." "What would ye that I should do for you?" the Master asked. "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in thy kingdom." Tenderly the Lord made answer, not even rebuking their selfishness in seeking preference above their brethren. He read their hearts; he alone knew the great depths of their attachment to him. Their love was not a mere human affection. True, it was love defiled by the earthiness of the human vessel, but it was nevertheless an overflowing from the fountain of redeeming love. "To sit on my right hand, and on my left," said the Master, "is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by my Father."

In the kingdom of God position is not given through favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through an arbitrary bestowal. It is the result of character. The crown and the throne are the tokens of a condition attained through self-conquest by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. The monarchy of Christ was a monarchy gained by conquest, but it was the conquest of self and the monarchy over self. His was a monarchy over self sufficiently strong to cause him to relinquish the pomp, the splendor and the glory of heaven. His was a kingship over his own soul sufficiently potent to cause him to leave the regal palaces of the better land and to come to earth as a homeless pilgrim, without place to lay his weary head. His was a monarchy so mighty and powerful over body, soul and spirit as to cause him humbly to serve, and cheerfully to minister unto those who of right were his own subjects but who stood in wanton uncalled-for rebellion against his government. He came to serve those who hated him, to bind up the wounds of his own sinful subjects. Tenderly to minister to those who despised and who rejected him was the supreme office of royalty in the kingdom and the monarchy of the greatest prince that the earth or heaven has ever known. Strange monarchy forsooth to men of earth, wondrous exhibition of true monarchical power to angels and beings of unfallen worlds.

So great, so mighty, so marvelous was the influence of this kind of monarchy that every angel in heaven followed the wake, and of them the pencil of the Holy Ghost has written "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of heaven?" The angels of heaven come not to the earth to rule, or to exact homage, but as messengers of mercy, nor arbitrarily to force but gently to woo the hearts of fallen men and women,—rebels against the government of God,—and to seek to lead them into a closer fellowship with Christ than they themselves may ever hope to know.

P. T. MAGAN.
