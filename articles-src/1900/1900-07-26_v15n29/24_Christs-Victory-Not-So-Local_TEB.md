At the conclusion of an excellent illustrated temperance lecture in this city recently, a clergyman was invited to offer prayer. After praying earnestly against the liquor curse, and seeking the blessing of heaven to rest upon the earnest man so nobly defending the righteous cause of temperance, purity and happiness, he brought in the following sentiment: "Descend, O Christ, and bear aloft to the skies the star spangled banner of victory, the devil and all his host notwithstanding."

Such careless expressions may seem harmless, but in them are lurking fatal seeds. Jesus Christ never will descend to bear away from this sin-polluted earth any emblem of any nation. When he comes, he comes as "King of kings, and Lord of lords." Every earthly power in that awful day shall crumble to dust. In the day of his setting up his kingdom "which shall never be destroyed," "the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it [Christ's kingdom] shall break in pieces and consume ALL these [earthly] kingdoms, and it [his heavenly] shall stand forever." Dan. 2:44.

While our flag may stand for principles of liberty and righteousness in advance of some other nations, it does not stand for all that is righteousness and truth.

All must acknowledge this. It does not follow that because our flag represents some advance principles that Christ will seize its staff and finish purifying the earth under its folds and then hoist it over his throne to float forever. Such sentiments are both unscriptural and absurd.

This expression about the flag, remember, was made at the close of a temperance lecture in the United States. The connection at once is wonderfully broken by the reported piece of news from the Philippine Islands stating that when the Filipino children play American, they "stagger as though drunk."

Jesus Christ will have a pure and clean kingdom in righteousness, in which nothing shall enter that defiles or offends, and upon his banner will be emblazoned the words for which on earth he fought the spiritual battle unto the death, "God's everlasting LAW is the TRUTH."
