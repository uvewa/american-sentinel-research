This question is discussed by Rev. Herbert S. Bigelow in the Social Forum for July. After stating the question Mr. Bigelow says:

"That depends upon our standard. What is the meaning of the term Christian? Can a church be Christian and sanction war? Can a Christian church remain indifferent to the menace of monopoly? Is a church Christian that seeks to cultivate the private virtues to the exclusion of civic righteousness and social justice? Is that church Christian which is reconciled to poverty, which, by practice if not by precept, preaches, 'Masters, be kind to your slaves. Slaves, obey your masters and keep sober?' * * *

"It is the business of the church to save the world, not to rescue souls from the world. It is the business of the church to redeem, not men, but man."

In the next to the last sentence in this quotation is contained THE error of National Reform under whatever guise it may be found. It is just exactly the business of the church to rescue souls from the world. That is just what Christ did when here upon earth, and it is just what he commissioned his followers to do after he returned to heaven; and he promised that in the doing of this he would be with them "even unto the end of the world."

Said the Saviour to his disciples, "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." John 15:19. And again, in his prayer to the Father, Jesus said of his disciples: "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." John 17:16.

Inspiration very clearly differentiates between the world and the individuals that by the gospel are taken out of the world. Says the apostle John, "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever." 1 John 2:17.

In Acts 15:14 we are plainly told that God's purpose in visiting the Gentiles is "to take out of them a people for his name." This is exactly in harmony with Paul's testimony in the eleventh chapter of his letter to the Romans, wherein he likens Israel to an olive tree, and the individuals to branches. The tree survives, but branches—individuals—are separated from it; and branches—individuals—are taken from the wild olive tree—from among the Gentiles—and become a part of the tame olive tree, partaking of its "root and fatness," contrary to nature; since in natural grafting the fruit produced is not that of the root, but that of the scion.

In his zeal to arraign the church for its shortcomings Mr. Bigelow inveighs even against the New Testament itself. The New Testament is certainly Christian. If it is not we have no standard by which to determine what Christianity is.

The Apostle Paul taught masters to be kind to their slaves, and slaves to obey their masters. He even sent Onesimus, an escaped slave, back to his master, Philemon. Thus Paul wrote and thus he did, not because he was in sympathy with slavery—for we know from his letter to Philemon that he was not, since he wrote him to receive Onesimus "no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved—but because he was preaching a very different gospel from that which teaches that "it is the business of the church to save the world, not to rescue souls from the world."

There was probably as great political corruption in the Roman Empire in Paul's day as there is in the United States to-day, yet we find the apostles saying not one word about "civic righteousness and social justice." They did not pose as political reformers in any sense. Their commission did not authorize them to do any such work. They simply preached the gospel. They besought men to be "reconciled to God." They taught obedience to his law and loyalty to him even in the face of death; and every one of them, excepting John, sealed his testimony with his blood; and John was banished to Patmos for his devotion to his Lord. But not one of them ever undertook to change the civic or social customs of Rome, nor of any part of it, except by teaching individuals to live righteous lives, to obey the Golden Rule, to deal justly and to do justice. Of course this had a great influence upon civic and social customs. For example, from being intolerant of Christiahity Rome became tolerant, and proclaimed liberty of conscience for all. Then it was that there arose advocates of national salvation, and in their endeavors to "save the nation" by making it "Christian," ruined it entirely by making it papal.

The world with its institutions is a sinking ship. The church should man the life-boat, not the pumps. Inspiration likens it to a burning building: "Some save, snatching them out of the fire," says the apostle. Jude, verse 23, R. V.

The church needs not more political "reformers," but more "fishers of men."
