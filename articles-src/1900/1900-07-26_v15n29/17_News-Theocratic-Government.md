Dr. Dowie and his "Zion" movement are not to be feared, but every advocate of the dangerous doctrine espoused by the Doctor and his disciples, namely, that the "right form of government is the rule of all things by God and for God," adds to the forces that are slowly, it may be true, but none the less surely undermining popular liberty in this land. For in practice such pretended government is only some man or some set of men exercising usurped authority, not indeed for God but for themselves, in His name. We are plainly told in the Scriptures (Ezek. 21:25-27) that with the passing away of the Jewish theocracy such rule was to cease from the earth to "be no more until He come whose right it is," when it will be given to Him, not by any man nor by any set of men, but by the Father himself, as declared in the second psalm.

This particular feature of Dowism is only one manifestation of theocratical theory of civil government whose advocates under myriad names are steadily drawing together, and who will ere long make mischief in this country, and in the world.
