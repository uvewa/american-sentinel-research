*(The Chicago Daily News, July 17.*

While the fall of Tientsin and the report that the legations at Peking are still alive have lightened the gloom of the Chinese situation temporarily, there are other considerations in the background that are weighty and fraught possibly with grave peril. The spectacle of Europe, America and Japan arrayed together in the orient on the side of advanced civilization is in itself inspiring. Nothing like it has been seen in all the history of the world. The nearest approach to the present situation is to be found in the crusades, when the knights and paladins of Europe led western nations against the infidels of the east in an attempt to gain possession of the holy sepulchre.

But granting that the allies, as they are somewhat loosely called, capture Peking, what then? It is probable that this would be only the beginning of a greater struggle whose storm area may involve the entire world. It has been no secret for several years that the European powers have planned the partition of China. By one of the uncalculated chances that partition is no longer possible on the old basis. At that time America had not yet been drawn into even the outer edge of the slowly revolving forces which have now caught up practically all the nations of the world in their mighty grasp. America even yet stands for a different principle and policy in China from that of the powers. While Russia, England, Germany and France and possibly other European nations, together with Japan, have accustomed themselves to view as a matter of business and as inevitable the partition of China, America, already with all the territory it wants, stands for Chinese integrity and the fulfillment of present treaty rights as being of greatest advantage and benefit to her. It requires little knowledge of diplomacy to see that even were a new congress of nations called to consider the question of Chinese partition there would be little prospect of reaching a harmonious conclusion. In that case war would result and it might readily involve not only the so-called allies but the Chinese themselves in a struggle whose consequences no one can foresee.
