"Christian Citizenship" must meet with some difficulties in France, since the elections there are all held on Sunday. But inasmuch as it is held by some at least of the advocates of the movement, that it is the duty of the brethren to "leave the prayer-meeting with the sisters, and attend the primaries" and "pull wires for the kingdom of God," it might easily appear that participation in an election is the highest type of Sunday observance.
