Among the restrictions placed upon the legislature of the Territory of Hawaii is this: "Nor shall any public money be appropriated for the support or benefit of any sectarian, denominational, or private school, or any school not under the exclusive control of the government." It remains to be seen how this will be evaded. It seems plain, but it is no more so than are constitutional provisions that many people demand shall be overridden in the interests of governmental religion.
