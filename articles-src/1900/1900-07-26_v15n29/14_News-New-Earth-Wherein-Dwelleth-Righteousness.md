"A Christian church," says the Social Forum, "must have for its paramount aim 'a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,' the reign of brotherhood."

The church has nothing whatever to do, in this sense, with "a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness." It is true the Scriptures promise such an earth, but the church has no more to do with preparing it than Noah had to do with bringing forth from the waters of the flood the earth that now is. The work of the church is to so represent God to men that they will become candidates for the new earth; but that earth instead of being, as the Social Forum implies, merely a more perfect social state of existence, will be just as real, just as physical as the earth that now is. No one who will read and believe the second chapter of second Peter will have the least trouble over this subject.
