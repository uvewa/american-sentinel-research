It is as true in the life of a nation as in that of an individual, that one wrong step leads to another. The nation, no more than the individual, can count upon or foresee the influences by which it will be led along the inviting pathway of error into which it has been tempted; it cannot foresee the unexpected circumstances which will arise and compel the setting aside of its original intentions one after the other. The downward pathway is "paved with good intentions," which are abandoned continually under the influence of a power that leads the individual on and on, to an end he did not foresee or dream of at the start. And thus of a nation: A republic never professes an intention of changing into an empire, or even holds such an intention at the start; but while its professions and intentions may be perfectly sincere, it finds itself moved by "destiny" in a course altogether at variance with them. We must judge from the nature of the step itself, rather than from the professions made in taking it, what the results will be that will follow.
