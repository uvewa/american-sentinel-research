Civil government does not derive its authority from any people's opinions respecting the will of God, however conscientiously held.

The Chinese are very patriotic; but the true patriotism is that which is not narrowed down to the interests of self, or of country, but seeks the highest welfare of mankind.

The "Christian" nations cry for vengeance upon China; but Christianity seeks no vengeance save to heap "coals of fire" on the heads of evil men by acts of kindness; it lifts no sword save the "sword of the Spirit."

To prove that Sunday laws are right, it is usually necessary for clergymen to pose as statesmen and physicians, prescribing for the welfare of the state and the health of the human body. This would better be left to the real statesmen and the doctors.

If any act ought to be prohibited by civil law, it ought to be prohibited to all alike. To permit such an act by a portion of the community, because "conscientiously" done, is a confession that it belongs to the domain of morals, and is not a proper subject of civil legislation.

You are not doing the work of Jesus Christ unless you are setting men at liberty (Isa. 61:1), and you cannot do this by seeking their arrest under Sunday laws.

If any act does not infringe the equal rights of others, the state has no right to prohibit it, however morally wrong it may be.
