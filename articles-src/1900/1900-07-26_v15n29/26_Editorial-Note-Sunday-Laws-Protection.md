Quoting from a Supreme Court decision, an advocate of Sunday laws says that "laws setting aside Sunday as a day of rest are upheld, not from any right of the government to legislate for the promotion of religious observances, but from its right to protect all persons from the physical and moral debasement that comes from uninterrupted labor." If this is so, why are such laws turned against those who regularly rest on the seventh day of the week? They are not the victims of "uninterrupted labor," hence whatever physical and moral debasement there may be from such a source cannot exist in their cases; nor does the law aim, in any case, to protect people who work on Sunday from becoming physically and morally debased. It aims to protect the first day of the week against desecration, and for this reason it prohibits all persons from working on that day or from conducting themselves in any other way not in harmony with the idea that Sunday is a sacred day. The Sunday laws are designed to protect an institution rather than to protect the people. The whole history of the working of such laws shows that the debasement alleged to result from uninterrupted work cuts no figure at all in connection with their enforcement, save as a theory by which to seek their justification.
