There is no longer any ground for fault finding with the charge that the United States has through its expansion policy become an empire; the Government itself acknowledges the fact, or at least it is acknowledged by those who speak for the Government, according to the following circular which has been issued in the Philippines:—

"U. S. Military Government in the Philippines,
"Department Public Instruction.

"A Department of Public Instruction for the Philippines has just been established, and I write to ask if you can aid us in the civilization of this new part of our Empire by sending such reports, bulletins, school laws, etc., now or to be issued as you may have for distribution."

A Catholic journal calls attention to this circular as containing "the first official use of the word 'empire' in connection with the United States," this being "a fact which historians might find it useful to note." Certainly it is time that the term "empire," referring to this nation, should make its appearance under official sanction.
