The most wonderful thing of our day is that we do not seem to be able to learn anything from church history as to the real conditions of spiritual conquest. The government is one thing, the gospel is another. We are to obey government, but not to expect it to do the work of the gospel. We only confuse the mind by mixing things.

I do not hesitate to say that Christianity to-day is weak in the Orient because it is so inextricably mixed in the minds of the heathen with so many flags. This is not the fault of individual missionaries, but is a result of the prevailing thought that calls nations "Christian." When Christianity owned no flag it conquered. * * Do not mix Christianity with your nationalism in your expectation for spiritual religion. The whole church is weak just here to-day.

I am aware this position is not understood. It is thought to lack in patriotism and to lack in hope. But circumstances are now fast shaping themselves to confirm the non-resistant position of the early church, and to show that we may have a Christianity in name which is after all only a part of this world and wielding only this world's power.—Rev. Addison Blanchard (Denver, Col.).
