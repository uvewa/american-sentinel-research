Sunday Reform Leaflets for April advocates a "civil Sabbath" because "distinguished economists say that men who have only six days' work do better work and more of it than those who work seven days;" and a religious Sabbath because "popular merrymaking on the Lord's day is usually a very accurate gauge of popular vice. The distinguished French infidel, Proudhon, speaking of France, says: 'Sunday in the towns is a day of rest without motive or end; an occasion of display for the women and children, of consumption in the restaurants and wine shops, of degrading idleness, of surfeit and debauchery."

This is simply logical despotism. First, the government compels the people to rest for their health and material prosperity. But as in this their morals suffer, they must be compelled also to be religious to prevent their becoming debased. Thus we have in two easy steps, complete justification (?) of despotism for the good of the dear people.

Again, it is said that every government has the inherent right to perpetuate itself. Stable government, especially in a republic, is dependent in large measure upon a vigorous and virtuous people. But vigor can be maintained only by proper physical conditions, and virtue only by religion; therefore, for its own preservation the government must see to it that the people do not become enervated by unremitting toil, nor debased by atheism or by false religion. Thus again we have in two easy and perfectly logical steps, complete justification (?) of despotism in the interests of stable government.
