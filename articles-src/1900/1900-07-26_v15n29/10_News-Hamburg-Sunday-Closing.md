The Sunday-closing ordinance demanded by the churches of Hamburg, Ia., has been tabled by the city council by a vote of five to four. The contest will be fought to a finish in the municipal election to be held next spring. One of the ministers of the place says that the present mayor will be defeated because of his vote to table the proposed ordinance. Pending the spring election an effort will probably be made to enforce the state law.
