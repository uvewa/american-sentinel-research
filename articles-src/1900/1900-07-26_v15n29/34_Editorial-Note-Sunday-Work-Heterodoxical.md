In commenting upon the fact that observers of the seventh day are not infrequently singled out for prosecution for Sunday work, while others are not molested, a Cincinnati paper says:

"Macaulay says that bear-baiting was interdicted by the Puritans, not because it was cruel to the bear, but because it gave pleasure to the people. In the same way Sunday labor is prohibited, not so much because it is wrong, but because the law against it is violated in a heterodoxical way. It is only those who acknowledge the binding character of the orthodox Sunday who are permitted to infringe upon it with impunity. It is by having absolute faith in the sanctity of the first day Sabbath that true believers can secure immunity when guilty of its infraction."

There is altogether too much truth in this statement. It is not so much the fact that work is done on Sunday that hurts, as it is the fact that when done by observers of the seventh day, it is in the nature of a denial of the sacredness of the day. Not that it is so intended, for Sabbatarians work on Sunday just as naturally as Sunday-keepers work on Monday, but it is necessarily so in the very nature of the case. It cannot be otherwise.
