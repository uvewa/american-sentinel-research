The chimera of saving men "by nations" is due in large measure to the unscriptural idea that the gospel, instead of gathering out of the world a people for the everlasting kingdom of God, is finally to convert the whole world. Nowhere in all the Word of God is any such doctrine taught. On the contrary, we are plainly told (Matt. 24:37-39) that the last days will be like the days of Noah. Gen. 6:5 tells us what the moral condition of the earth was in "the days that before the flood." Moreover the Apostle Paul says definitely and explicitly (2 Tim. 3:1-5, qv.) that the last days of this world's history will be perilous, and this for the reason that the church—those "having a form of godliness"—will be practicing all manner of sins, seventeen of which he enumerates.
