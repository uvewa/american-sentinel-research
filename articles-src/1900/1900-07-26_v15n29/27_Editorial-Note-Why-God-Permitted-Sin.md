In answering, in the Sabbath Recorder, the question, "Why did God permit sin?" W. D. Tickner says: "He knew that voluntary service was the only service that could accomplish the purposes of man's being. Inanimate nature obeys his commands by virtue of the laws inherent within it. Fire and water, cold and heat, light and darkness, were subservient to him, but without volition. They reflected simply his power and majesty. He desired more, a service of love, a service willingly rendered, even amid surroundings that made such service difficult.

"To have excluded the devil from the world, would have been to allow man a knowledge of only one side of the great controversy between good and evil, between God and Satan. Obedience to the commands of God would, under such conditions, be of little value. Man was therefore allowed to see for himself both good and evil, and for himself to decide whom he would serve. Such service was what God desired. Such service alone could accomplish the object sought in the creation and development of man."
