In an interview with a representative of the Daily News (Denver, Col.), Rev. Thomas Marshall, an ex-missionary to China, and now connected with the Board of Foreign Missions, spoke as follows in defense of the Chinese Boxers from a political standpoint:

"To intelligently study the situation in China one must understand that there are two factors—the religious or missionary and the political. These two factors must not be confused, for to my mind the Chinese are politically right but religiously wrong. Every question, on account of prejudice, must be discussed politically first.

"The aggressions made by the European powers amount to little less than piracy. Russia, as all know, has taken Port Arthur, the greatest navy yard that the Chinese possess. England has seized the land opposite. France has appropriated Yun Nan and Germany has gobbled up Kiao Chou. There is much talk of 'the sphere of influence,' but the fair mind cannot help but see that the European powers are working on the principle that might makes right. When the Chinese saw that their land was being parceled out little by little to these foreigners, they rebelled and strove to drive the invaders from their country. Suppose that the French should seize New Orleans, the English Fortress Monroe, the Russians New York and the Germans Boston, what would the American be called who tried to push back the aggressing foreigners? He would be called a patriot, and win honor and distinction. The Boxers, who are striving to do the same thing are the Chinese patriots, who say, the Germans, French and the rest are robbing us, and cannot remain in our land.

"There is much misunderstanding concerning the Boxers. The Boxers are mostly common people, and in their simplicity they have just awakened to the fact that their land has been taken from them. It is true that they have been called the 'Long Knife Society,' and make it their law to demand that the foreigner leave China or die; but what would we Americans do under similar circumstances? It must also be remembered that the Chinese are very superstitious. They have had no rain for some time, and their religion teaches them to think that it is because the gods are displeased at the foreigners' presence.

"It is in this connection that they associate the missionaries and the Chinese Christians. In disturbing them they disturb their best friends, but their irrational action has been brought to a focus by foreign disputes as to whether China should be divided. * * *

"The only way to settle this serious question will be a very difficult one. No matter what complications it would cause, the different powers should give back the land they have taken, and I believe that the entire trouble would cease."
