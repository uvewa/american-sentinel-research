A mass meeting was held recently at Hillsgrove, Mass., to protest against Sunday bicycle races on the race track at that place. There was a "large attendance from the village and surrounding country." Addresses were made in which Sunday racing was severely condemned as being "demoralizing to the young people of the community and the surrounding villages." It was further declared to be a "public nuisance." By a nearly unanimous vote of the assembly it was resolved that further Sunday racing should not be permitted, and it was further provided that a committee should be appointed to secure signatures to a petition to the owner of the track and to the town council, requesting that Sunday racing be prohibited.

Why then is racing on Sunday demoralizing and racing on Monday or Saturday or the Fourth of July or Labor Day not demoralizing? What is the basis of the discrimination between Sunday and these other days? What can that basis be other than the difference in the nature of Sunday and these other days, Sunday being a religious day and the others secular days? What other difference is there between Sunday and other days of the week?

Sunday races are therefore held to be demoralizing and a public nuisance because Sunday is a religious day. They are to be prohibited because Sunday is a religious day. Legislation prohibiting them is to be based upon the religious character of the day. The legislative power is to be exercised in favor of that religion which holds that Sunday is a sacred day. Some religions hold the seventh day to be sacred, and not the first; the civil authority is to discriminate between religions.

Why should the civil authority discriminate between religions? If that is proper now, why was it not always proper? and if it is proper in America, why is it not proper in China? A principle is the same in all lands, and the principle that will justify legislative action on religious grounds in the United States, will justify it in every other country in the world. And the principle which condemns connivance between civil government and religion in China or Turkey, condemns it in the United States.

The racing complained of may or may not be demoralizing; but there can be no more reason for prohibiting racing on one day of the week than on another. Legislative discrimination between religions is, however, demoralizing in the extreme. There is nothing that weakens morals quicker or more surely than state support of religion. In escaping a fancied evil, the people of this New England town are in danger of running into a real evil than which no greater can threaten their religious and political prosperity.
