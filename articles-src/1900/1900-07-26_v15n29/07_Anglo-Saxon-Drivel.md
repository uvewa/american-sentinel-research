This is the heading under which the Baltimore News of July 6 prints with brief comment the following from Bishop Charles H. Fowler, of the Methodist Episcopal Church:

"The three greatest missionary events of the Christian era since the crucifixion of Jesus are: First, the conversion of St. Paul. This opened the door to the Gentiles. This was our chance. Second, the firing on Fort Sumter. This made the great Anglo-Saxon race fit for evangelical uses. Third, the blowing up of the Maine. This unified the great Anglo-Saxon race, and sent us out about our work. It melted the American elements in the furnace of war and made all Americans one. The grandson of General Grant and the nephew of General Lee marched side by side under one flag and against a common enemy. It fused the American and English branches of this race. The errand of the united Anglo-Saxon race is to keep the world's peace. Together they police the seas and prevent the other nations from fighting. It soon will be true that not a soldier will lift his foot unless the command is given in the English language."

The News does not vouch for the correctness of this report, but says if the Bishop "is correctly reported, he has been beating the record in that preaching of 'pernicious nonsense' on Anglo-Saxonism which has been so conspicuous a feature in English and American quarters since the outbreak of our war with Spain."

"Between the conversion of St. Paul, then," says the News, "and the firing on Fort Sumter, the world's history was, from the 'missionary' point of view, comparatively a blank. The incursion of the barbarians and the conquest of Rome, the creation of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire, Charlemagne, the Crusades, the Norman Conquest, the Protestant Reformation—all these were of no consequence in comparison with the firing on Fort Sumter and the sinking of the Maine."

It may be that the Bishop was not correctly reported, or that the connection would greatly modify that which standing alone is certainly not inaptly styled "drivel." But be this as it may, there is altogether too much of a looking away from spiritual to material things to-day on the part of the church.

Doubtless events such as those mentioned by Bishop Fowler are overruled by the Lord for the advancement of his cause; but the Bishop has certainly read history to very little purpose if he considers the firing upon Sumter and the blowing up of the Maine as worthy to be compared, in importance and in far-reaching influence, with even such a minor event in the era of the Reformation as the secession from Rome of the English Church under the leadership of Henry VIII. The discovery of America, the coming of the Pilgrims to these shores, the giving of the Declaration of Independence to the world, the adoption of the First Amendment to the Constitution were each of more importance in far-reaching influence upon the religious history of this world than either of the two events cited by Bishop Fowler since the conversion of the Apostle Paul.
