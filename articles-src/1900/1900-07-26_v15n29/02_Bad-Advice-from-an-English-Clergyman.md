The following press item of news from the Christian Endeavor convention now in session in London, is brief but pithy:

"Dr. Parker of the City Temple urged American Christian Endeavorers to nominate the Rev. Francis E. Clark and the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon for the highest offices in the United States, as Christian men should be at the head of things."

It is true enough that "Christian men should be at the head of things," but to do this they do not need to get out of the work to which God has appointed them. Indeed, they cannot be "at the head of things" in the nation unless they stay in the place to which Christianity has led them and let the affairs of the world alone.

God is "at the head of things," and God is in his church; therefore the Christian church is at the head of things, so long as she maintains her union with the Lord. The Christian church points the way of true progress in all that makes for the betterment of mankind. So all sincere professors of Christianity must believe. In every respect the Christian church should be far in advance of the un-Christian world. She should be "at the head of things" in the highest and truest sense.

Therefore let "Father" Clark and the Rev. Mr. Sheldon stay where they are. As preachers of the gospel they do well; and it would be a degradation to set them in the seat of the politician. And besides, what do they know about the administration of political office? What does Christianity teach about politics? How does it qualify anyone for political excellence? The Christian in political office would have sincerity and good motives; but he might make the greatest failure in running the affairs of state, for all that. And as a matter of fact, and a matter of history, no person of deep religious fervor was ever an eminent statesman. Oliver Cromwell may be instanced as an exception; but who desires to have the statesmanship of Cromwell exemplified in the United States? Consider for example such men as Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Jackson, and others eminent in the political history of this country; none of them were conspicuous as church men, while some of the most eminent, as Jefferson and Lincoln, seem not to have belonged to any church. On the other hand history shows with equal plainness that whenever the affairs of state were run by the church leaders, in any country, civil government became destructive of the very things it was meant to preserve. Civil and religious freedom were invaded and a barrier was erected across the pathway of mental and moral progress. The worst persecutions that have darkened history were waged by church leaders in command of the civil power. They were sincere men, and their motive was to do God service; but the results of their efforts at statecraft were such as it may well be hoped will not be repeated at this day.

Let Christians stick to their calling as ambassadors of Christ, and let politics be run by the politicians. Dr. Parker has said many good things about church and state, but his business, and that of every clergyman, is to call men up from the world to the higher plane of Christianity, and not down from the plane of Christianity to the level of the world.
