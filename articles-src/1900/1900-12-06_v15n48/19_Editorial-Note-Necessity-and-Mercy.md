It is allowed by the Sunday laws that a person may on Sunday perform such work as is of "necessity" or "mercy." Is it allowable, then, for a man to work six days in the week when he must do so to support his family? Here, for example, is a man who conscientiously observes the seventh day. Will he be allowed to work the other six days in order to provide adequate food and clothing and a comfortable home for his family? Is it necessary for little children to have these things? Does mercy require that they have them? Most workingmen are too poor to support their families and lose two days out of every week.

"Oh," says some one, "the law does not require any man to lose two days in the week; let him rest on Sunday and work the other six days." This is asking that a man give up his conscience in order to comply with the law and support his family. The same law which recognizes the "necessity" of certain things compels a man to surrender his conscience. Is conscience, then, a necessity? or is it something that can just as well be dispensed with?

We believe religious liberty—freedom of choice in all religious observances—is a necessity. We believe all persons ought to have it, and that no human law ought to interfere with it. Don't you?
