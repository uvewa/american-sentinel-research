## WHAT DO WE MEAN BY MORALITY?

This question was asked at the New York State Conference of Religion by a Hindu. It is little wonder that this representative of paganism asked the question, for conflicting theories had been presented touching this subject, and one of the papers read had attempted to treat morality as something quite apart from religion. But this Hindu said of morality: "It has a much deeper meaning. It lies within the spiritual, and the true basis of ethics is not utility; it lies deep in the soul of our souls, just as Jesus the Christ expressed the idea in the sentence, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.' It is the unity of the soul. There lies the solution, the true basis of ethics."

No man ever said a truer thing, whether pagan or Christian. Morals must have a sanction, and that sanction can be nothing else than the will of God, the divine law. Therefore he who advocates governmental supervision of morals advocates governmental supervision of religion, because it is impossible to separate the two.

Utilitarianism may furnish a sufficient basis for mere civics. It may be sufficient to regulate to a certain extent the daily intercourse of man with man, in business and in political life, upon the basis of utilitarianism; but there is that in every soul which demands something better, something higher; and that higher thing is that which was defined so aptly by this Hindu. It would be well if Christians could discern as clearly that ethics can not be dissevered from religion nor religion separated from ethics.
