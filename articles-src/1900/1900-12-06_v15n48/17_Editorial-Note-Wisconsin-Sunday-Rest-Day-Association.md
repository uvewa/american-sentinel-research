At the recent meeting of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association, at Sheboygan, the president said: "If a man must work on Sunday, he ought to have some other day to rest." Then, instead of demanding Sunday laws, why does not the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association become simply a Rest Day Association, and direct its energies toward securing regular weekly rest for each man instead of demanding Sunday rest primarily?—Simply because the prime object is not to protect the man but the day.
