## A DOUBTFUL REASON FOR SUNDAY CLOSING.

As reported in the Buffalo Courier of November 20, the Ministers' Association of the Methodist Episcopal church in Buffalo met the previous evening and discussed the question of Sunday closing of the Exposition. Rev. W. F. Crafts, with whom the Sunday closing idea has long been a hobby, was present and addressed the meeting. "After considerable discussion," says the Courier, "the following memorial was unanimously adopted:

"To the Directors of the Pan-American Exposition:

"The following resolution has been unanimously adopted by the Methodist ministers of Buffalo and vicinity:

"Whereas, It has always been the American policy to observe the American Sabbath at national and international fairs by entire Sunday closing when a fair has been held in this country, and by the closing of the American exhibit in foreign fairs; and

Whereas, In granting aid to the Columbian World's Fair, the American people by act of Congress secured through petitions, estimated by Senator Hawley and Congressman Dingley to represent an overwhelming majority of our people, an act of Congress conditioning the appropriation on Sunday closing, which should be regarded as morally binding on similar use of the people's money in aid of the Pan-American; and

"Whereas, The disregard of that condition by the Chicago directors in the supposed interest of increased revenues, they confessed, by reversing their action, caused loss instead, because of the great number who refused to attend by way of protest against that trampling on an American Christian institution; therefore, be it

"Resolved, In the name of conscience and commerce, that we petition and ask all good citizens to join us in petitioning the directors not to open the Pan-American Exposition for any part of Sunday on any pretext, lest there should result, in spite of all attempted restraints, increased violations of the letter and spirit of the Sabbath law through the incoming of Sunday excursions, bringing vast throngs of people, and so making the day one of toil, traffic, and turmoil."

To us this appears to be very doubtful reasoning. "Whereas," it says, the opening of the Chicago World's Fair gates on Sunday resulted in a loss to the exposition because the people would not attend, therefore, "Resolved," that the Pan-American Exposition should be closed on Sunday for fear that "vast throngs of people" will come to it on that day, making the day one of "traffic and turmoil."

Such inconsistency in speech is always associated with insincerity in the thing professed. Is there not, back of this statement by the clergy, another and more real reason for their opposition to Sunday opening? Is it not because Sunday is a religious day, and its exaltation a part of their religious calling? Candidly, is not this the true secret of their attitude in the matter?

An act can not be demoralizing merely because it is done on the first day of the week. Whether or not such an act is contrary to Christianity is a question depending for its answer upon the question, Which day of the week is the Christian Sabbath? But what has a legislature or other political body to do with the consideration of such questions? One person can not decide Christian duty for another person. Each individual must decide Christian duty for himself.
