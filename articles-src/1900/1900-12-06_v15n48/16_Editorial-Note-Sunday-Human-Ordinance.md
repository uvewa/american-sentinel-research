"THERE is no doubt," says *The Defender*, organ of the New England Sabbath Protective League, "that Thanksgiving day sprang from the same ancestry as the Lord's day." This is but putting in other phrase the words of the historian Neander: "The festival of Sunday was always only a human ordinance." Now that *The Defender* has confessed the truth, it ought to cease quoting the fourth commandment in support of Sunday.
