The spirit of religious intolerance is not dead in Iowa. The postmaster of the town of Hillsdale, Mr. J. C. Haney, was recently arrested and fined because he sold some stationery from the post-office newstand on Sunday. The prosecution was conducted by a town councilman, and seems to have been warmly supported by the mayor. What the particular animus of this prosecution is we are not informed, but it is stated that Mr. Haney has of late become inclined to the belief that the seventh day of the week, and not the first day, is the true Sabbath.

Why should any person be molested for such an act as the selling of stationery? The act is a good one six days in the week; how does it become bad, and to be prohibited, on the first day alone? It is held to be bad on Sunday because Sunday is a religious day. That is the difference, and the only difference, between Sunday and Monday or Tuesday. Then is not this prosecution based directly on religion? And is not religious prosecution only another name for persecution?
