## THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION.

With ten thousand flags waving a welcome to all, and with fitting display and stately ceremony, the first great Exposition of the twentieth century will be opened at Buffalo, N. Y., on May 1, 1901. The initial events will be of stirring interest, and the rising curtain will reveal a scene of unexampled beauty.

Architectural works, mammoth in proportion and graceful in outline, brilliant with color and finished with intricate and infinite detail, will have a setting of rare foliage and vivid bloom, amid pleasing fountains, placid pools and rippling lakelets, making a fairyland of undreamed loveliness and unimagined possibility. The work of preparing this splendid Exposition is moving forward at all points with such speed as to insure the completion of all plans before the opening day.

The enterprise received official endorsement by the Federal Government when Congress in July, 1898, by resolution declared that "A Pan-American Exposition will undoubtedly be of vast benefit to the commercial interests of the countries of North, South, and Central America, and it merits the approval of Congress and of the people of the United States."

March 3, 1899, Congress appropriated $500,000, and declared that "it is desirable to encourage the holding of a Pan-American Exposition on the Niagara frontier in the city of Buffalo, in the year 1901, fittingly to illustrate the marvelous development of the Western Hemisphere during the nineteenth century, by a display of the arts, industries, manufactures and the products of the soil, mine, and sea," and also declared that "the proposed Pan-American Exposition being confined to the Western Hemisphere, and being held in the near vicinity of the great Niagara cataract, within a day's journey of which reside forty million people, would unquestionably be of vast benefit to the commercial interests, not only of this country, but of the entire hemisphere, and should therefore have the sanction of the Congress of the United States."

Invitations were issued by the national Government through the Department of State, in June, 1899, to all the nations of the Western Hemisphere to participate in the Exposition. Official acceptances have been received from Canada, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Salvador, Guatemala, Guadaloupe, Dutch Guiana, Bolivia, Argentine Republic, Chili, Costa Rica, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and Haiti. There are some twenty independent governments and as many more dependencies in the Western Hemisphere. It is expected that nearly all of these countries and island groups will be represented at the Exposition.

## Site of the Exposition.

The site chosen for the Exposition consists of a plot of 350 acres, including 133 acres of improved park lands and lakelets, in the northern part of the city. The site is about one mile long from north to south by half a mile wide, of somewhat irregular shape. The main approach from the city will be through one of the most beautiful parks in the world. The site has not alone the merit of extraordinary beauty but is the most accessible of all those available. Its northern boundary is the New York Central Railway's double-track belt line which encircles the city. The entire twenty-six steam railways which enter Buffalo will have access to these tracks and to the great Exposition station. On three sides of the Exposition grounds are electric trolley lines connecting with 300 miles of city and suburban tracks, and a five-cent fare will carry the passenger to the most remote points within the city limits.

## Classification of Exhibits.

The scope of the Exposition is very broad, intending to show to the world in a most interesting way the progress of all the nations of the three Americas during a century of marvelous development. The exhibits will have groupings as follows:

- Electricity and Electrical Appliances.
- Fine Arts: Painting, Sculpture, and Decoration.
- Graphic Arts: Typography, Lithography, Steel and Copper-plate Printing, Photo-Mechanical Processes, Drawing, Engraving, and Bookbinding.
- Liberal Arts: Education, Engineering, Public Works, Constructive Architecture, Music, and the Drama.
- Ethnology, Archaeology, Progress of Labor and Invention, Isolated and Collective Exhibits.
- Agriculture, Food and its Accessories, Agricultural Machinery and Appliances.

Forestry and Forest Products.
Fish, Fisheries, Fish Products and Apparatus for Fishing.

Transportation Exhibits, Railways, Vessels, Vehicles.
Exhibits from the Hawaiian Islands, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands.

To this classification will be added numerous special exhibits in buildings of their own, and the many State and foreign exhibits in separate buildings. About fifteen acres of space have been set apart for the State and foreign buildings.

## Landscape Features.

The landscape architects have been commissioned to prepare the most artistic setting for the Exposition that a liberal expenditure can secure. They have the advantage, as a beginning, of one of the finest parks in the world, upon which hundreds of thousands of dollars have been expended, and which time has helped to beautify by adding size and symmetry to the many rare trees that give shade and richness to this noble pleasure ground. Upon the 133 acres of Delaware Park the landscape artists are grafting with perfect skill the broad grounds that will contain the main group of Exposition buildings.

The main Exposition buildings are ranged around a broad court over 2,000 feet long, the same having a transverse court, the Esplanade, about 1,700 feet from east to west. From the Approach the visitor comes to the Fore-Court (E), thence crossing the Triumphal Bridge (G) to the Esplanade (K). The Court of the Fountains (Q) is 500 feet wide by 1,000 feet long, and the Plaza (Y) is 500 by 350 feet. This great court is richly embellished with aquatic pools, fountains, statuary, balustrades, shrubs, trees, lawns, and formal floral displays. The Mall (W-W) is partly shaded with tall poplars. A grand canal, with Mirror Lakes (I-I) supplies a means of circumnavigating the main group of buildings in electric launches, gondolas and other small craft. Beyond the canal in all directions the grounds are laid out with lawns, trees, shrubs and flowers. The large number of buildings for isolated exhibits, public comfort, etc., are in these parts of the grounds. The Music Gardens (F), west of the Fore-Court, constitute a feature of much importance and interest. East of the Fore-Court about fifteen acres are devoted to the State and foreign buildings, ranged about a court that is made gay with fountains, flowers and other suitable exterior embellishments.

## Exposition Buildings.

The largest buildings of the Exposition are those devoted to manufactures and liberal arts, and machinery and transportation. They are marked Nos. 10 and 11 respectively on the diagram. Each of these covers over four acres of land, the dimensions being 500 by 350 feet. In the center of each is a broad court, in which is a long pool of water with a central fountain. Winding paths are bordered with shrubs and flowers, and sodded banks reach down to the water's crystal edge. Settees for the comfort of visitors will be liberally supplied. The central fountain will be visible from any of the four main entrances through broad aisles that lead to the court.

The Agricultural Building (12) and the Electricity Building (13) are companion structures in size, each being 500 by 150 feet. They front on the Mall, which passes on the south side. Between them is the tall electric tower.

The Government group (2-2-2) consists of three buildings, forming the eastern boundary of the transverse court or esplanade. The main building is 600 by 130 feet, with a central dome 250 feet above the floor. Two curved colonnades will extend from near the middle of the west side of the main building 162 feet to the two lesser buildings, forming a semi-circular court. The two smaller buildings will be 150 feet square. They will contain the aquariums and exhibits of the United States Weather Bureau and the new collections from Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippine Islands. The large number of other exhibits belonging to the Federal Government will find a place in the main building.

At the opposite or western end of the Esplanade are the Horticultural (7), Forestry and Mines (5) and Graphic Arts (6) buildings, connected by curved colonnades, forming a semi-circular court similar to that enclosed by the Government group. The Horticultural Building is 220 feet square with a central lantern 236 feet high. The others of the group are each 150 feet square with pavilions ninety-eight feet above ground. Large conservatories are entered through the colonnades.

The Stadium (O) will be the grandest sporting arena ever erected on the Western Continent. Its circumference, covering about ten acres, will be larger than the colosseum of Rome. The top row of seats will be sixty-two feet from the ground and the seating capacity is estimated for 25,000 spectators. It will contain a quarter-mile racing track and abundant space within for all sorts of athletic games and contests. The space beneath the seats will be used for exhibition purposes, being the equivalent of a very large building. The main entrance to the Stadium (2) will be from the Plaza, at the west end, through an ornamental building 241 feet long and fifty-two feet wide.

The Live Stock buildings (18) will cover about ten acres, and are east of the Agricultural and Manufactures buildings.

The Albright Art Gallery, the gift of J. J. Albright, costing $350,000, will occupy a site in the park, and will be a permanent edifice. It will serve the purpose of an art building for the Exposition, and the fine collection of paintings and sculptures belonging to the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy will be transferred to it, there to remain. A maintenance fund of $100,000 is being raised by private subscription and is nearly all subscribed.

## A Famous Carillon.

The largest and finest chime of bells in the Western world, belonging to St. Joseph's Cathedral, Buffalo, will contribute their music to the grandeur of the Exposition. This splendid carillon consists of forty-three bells and cost $25,000. The bells weigh from twenty-five pounds up to 5,068 pounds. A special campanile will be built for them at the Exposition, and a new arrangement will permit their proper ringing by means of an electro-mechanical device. They will add a very interesting and important feature to the great Exposition.

Buffalo is one of the greatest commercial cities of North America, ranking as the fourth in importance of all the cities of the world in its marine business. Within one night's ride of Buffalo are the homes of 44,000,000 people, or more than half the population of the United States. The city is preparing for the entertainment of a vast number of visitors throughout the Exposition season.
