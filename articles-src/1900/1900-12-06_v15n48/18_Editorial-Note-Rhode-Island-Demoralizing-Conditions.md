The question of prime importance in Rhode Island, says *The Defender*, is: "Shall an honest effort be made to remedy the demoralizing conditions which prevail in some of our public resorts on the Lord's day?"

This illustrates the difference between the position taken by *THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY* and that of papers which are laboring for Sunday enforcement. The latter say, These demoralizing things must be stopped on the Lord's day. *THE SENTINEL* says, Let demoralizing practices be stopped on every day, if they are such as come within the scope of legal prohibitions. No doubt many of the "demoralizing conditions" here spoken of are such as ought to be prohibited by law; but when we call for laws to prohibit them on the "Lord's day" only, we virtually sanction them on other days of the week. The saloon, for example, by obeying a law for Sunday closing, would by that very law be made a law-abiding institution. We do not want a law which upholds such an institution as the saloon six days out of every seven.

*THE SENTINEL* would have lawlessness suppressed because it is lawlessness, not because it is done on a day some people regard as sacred.
