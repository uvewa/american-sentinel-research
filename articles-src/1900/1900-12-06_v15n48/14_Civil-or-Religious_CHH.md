## CIVIL OR RELIGIOUS?

SUNDAY is the first day of the week. This is proven by the Sunday laws, and is admitted by those who are engaged in a warfare upon those who see fit to enjoy themselves in their own way upon that day.

The Sunday laws are not called religious laws, but "civil laws."

Then Sunday must be a "civil," not a religious day.

If Sunday is a "civil" day, then those things which are lawful and right on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday can not by any possible stretch of the imagination be wrong on Sunday, for a thing that is wrong at all on one day, must in the nature of things be wrong at all times and in all places by all people.

Now is Sunday, the first day of the week, a civil day or a religious one? There are seven days in the week, and in Genesis 1, where the weekly cycle of time is first brought to view, the days were numbered first, second, third, etc., down or up to the sixth; on each of these days work was performed; but on the following day, the seventh, God rested and sanctified it or set it apart for the use of mankind. Now God did not rest on the first day nor the third, but on the seventh. If he had rested on the third day it would have been a seventh part of time just as truly as the seventh day was. But he was not through working on the third day; he finished his work on the seventh day.

By this we see that God used the first day as a civil day; but, let us see if it is a civil day for man.

"Six days shalt thou [man] labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou [man] shalt do no work." Labor is permissible for six days, beginning to count with the first, but labor is prohibited on the seventh day; so we see that God says Sunday (as man calls the first day), is a civil, not a religious day.

C. H. HARRIS.
