"Beasts, birds, and fishes," says The Defender, "come under the generic title 'man,' for whom Jesus said the Sabbath 'was made,' and they should not be hunted and slaughtered on that day."

It is a pity that innocent creatures, enjoying the life the Creator gave them, should be hunted and slaughtered on any day. But would *The Defender*, which desires laws to prohibit "man" from taking recreation on the Sabbath, also restrain the beasts, birds, and fishes from unnecessary roaming, flying, and swimming on that day? Sometimes we seriously wonder to what lengths these zealous people would not go if they had the power.
