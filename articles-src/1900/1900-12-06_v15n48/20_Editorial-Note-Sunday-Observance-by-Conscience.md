GRANTED that the Buffalo Exposition ought not to be open on Sunday, it by no means follows that it should be closed by act of the State. It is one thing to observe Sunday by act of conscience, which affects only the individual possessor, and quite another thing to secure Sunday observance by act of the legislature, which affects all persons irrespective of personal belief. Leave every person free, we say, to follow the dictates of conscience in the matter; and let the result decide the question of Sunday opening or closing of the Exposition.
