## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Masthead
- **Issue:** The quote "In my man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not."
- **Transcribed as:** "In my man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "If any man hear my words" (John 12:47). However, transcribed exactly as it appears in the OCR source per project rules.

### Article "How the 'Sentiment of the People' Is Obtained"
- **Issue:** Attribution marked as "s." (lowercase) at end
- **Transcribed as:** Author "S." (uppercase in frontmatter)
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Consistent with other usage in the publication where lowercase initials are normalized to uppercase

### Author "Allen Moon"
- **Issue:** Not in the known authors list
- **Transcribed as:** "Allen Moon" with initials "AM"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Name and initials appear clearly at end of article

### Author "C. H. Harris"
- **Issue:** Not in the known authors list
- **Transcribed as:** "C. H. Harris" with initials "CHH"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Name and initials appear clearly at end of article

### Author "B."
- **Issue:** Multiple articles signed only "B." with no full name
- **Transcribed as:** Author short "B" (no full name in frontmatter)
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Could be C. P. Bollman (one of the editors), but not explicitly stated. Attribution marked as "explicit" because the initial is explicitly present.
