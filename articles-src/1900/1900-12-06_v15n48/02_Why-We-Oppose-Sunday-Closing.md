## WHY WE OPPOSE SUNDAY CLOSING.

In all seriousness THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY would respectfully enter a strong protest against any State enactment to close the gates of the Pan-American Exposition on the first day of the week.

Why? Not because we are opposed to Christianity, for we do not believe Sunday closing by the State would represent Christianity at all, but rather the opposite.

Nor is it because we are opposed to any church or organization which demands Sunday closing, for we are opposed to no church, and maintain the right of every man to hold and advocate whatever religious opinions he may choose, restrained only by a proper respect for the rights of others.

Nor do we oppose Sunday closing because we do not want the working-men, whom the decision of the question may affect, to enjoy the privilege of resting one day in the week. We have nothing to say against the right of any man to observe the first day of the week as a sabbath. Nor is it that we oppose Sunday, for legislation favoring any other weekly day of rest would be quite as bad as that enjoining Sunday observance.

We oppose Sunday closing by the State because the State can not show favors to religion without injuring both its own interests and those of the Christian church.

We oppose Sunday closing by the State because the Christian church can not make any alliance with Caesar without practically denying her alliance with the Omnipotent.

We oppose Sunday closing by the State because, as nobody is forced to work on Sunday against his consent, such action by the State will preserve no person's rights, while it necessarily will invade the rights of those who would visit the Exposition were the gates not closed.

We oppose Sunday closing by the State because such a proceeding would involve the whole principle of church-and-state union, and would establish a precedent upon the strength of which further legislation for Sunday or for any other religious observance might be demanded.

We oppose Sunday closing by the State because Sunday observance is a matter to be decided by the individual conscience and not by decree of the civil power. If the directors of the Exposition feel that they can not sanction an open Exposition on Sunday, if exhibitors feel that they can not conscientiously display their exhibits on that day, if the people feel in conscience bound to stay away from the Exposition on the first day of the week, that is their right, and we have nothing to say against it. But for the good of the Exposition, for the good of the State, and for the good of religion and the church, let the question of Sunday observance be settled by the people individually, each one for himself, and not settled by seeking to force the decision of one person upon the conscience of another.

S.
