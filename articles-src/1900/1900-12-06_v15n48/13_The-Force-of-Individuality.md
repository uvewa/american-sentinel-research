## THE FORCE OF INDIVIDUALITY.

One of the best thoughts suggested at the New York State Conference of Religion was by Prof. Walter Rauschenbusch, of Rochester, N. Y. Much emphasis had been laid upon the thought of unity in worship. Professor Rauschenbusch said: "There is something that we must bear in mind. We must not deceive ourselves by ignoring the fact that the whole man and every part of his soul life does not find full and satisfactory expression in any service wherein all distinctive and characteristic elements of worship are reduced to a common ritual uniformity. The Creator himself has distinguished human beings in races, in tribes, in families, in individuals. To attempt to destroy these differences is to attempt the impossible. More, it would be a decided loss to level down all distinctions to the humdrum mediocrity of uniformity. The most vital force of the world is the force of individuality."

Another speaker emphasized the same thought by saying, "Remember that all persecutors in religion have been communists. The logic of the persecutor has been communism in religion."

God has not cast all men in the same mold. In the works of the divine Being we find uniformity in diversity. There are myriad forms of life, beauty, and individuality, and yet perfect harmony. The same should be true and will eventually be true in the great domain of morals. Indeed, in the great hereafter, when the redeemed of all nations shall be gathered home, God's great spiritual temple, which he is now rearing, will reflect perfectly all the perfections of the divine character, and yet no two living stones in that great temple will be exactly alike. There will be perfect unity in diversity. All will be different, each having his own individuality, and yet all will be like God.

This truth and the importance of individuality are lost sight of by the persecutor and by the communist in religion, who would cast in a single mold all human souls; who would bind to his own conception of the divine law his fellow-men, and force them into reluctant conformity to his own moral and religious ideals.
