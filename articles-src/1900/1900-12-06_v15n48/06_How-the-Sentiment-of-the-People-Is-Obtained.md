## HOW THE "SENTIMENT OF THE PEOPLE" IS OBTAINED.

It is represented that public sentiment is strongly in favor of closing the Pan-American Exposition on the first day of the week. This impression is sought to be given by means of "petitions" and memorials forwarded to those in charge of the Exposition, from churches, Sunday-schools, various religious organizations, "mass-meetings," etc., praying that Sunday be observed at the Exposition by closed gates. There is something peculiar and interesting about these petitions for Sunday closing, as they are now gotten up, and it will be worth while to repeat a short chapter of modern history touching on the question of the extent to which such memorials are really indicative of public sentiment.

We have but to go back eight years, to the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago, to obtain the desired information. At that time Congress was deluged with petitions from all sorts of religious and some secular bodies, calling for closed gates on Sunday, and purporting to express the sentiment of an overwhelming majority of the people. Upon analysis, this claim of the Sunday petitioners was found to be of a very hyperbolic nature. As showing how this fact appeared, we quote the following which was written on this point at the time these petitioners were claiming the attention of Congress:

### "Champion Repeaters."

"The Congressional Record of May 5, under petitions and memorials presented in the Senate the day previous, contains a record of memorials praying that Congress take some action to close the World's Fair on Sunday, and that no further appropriations be made for the World's Fair except upon guarantee of Sunday closing, from one church of Missouri; four churches of Virginia and West Virginia; thirteen churches of Michigan; thirteen churches of Nebraska; twenty-seven churches of Indiana; thirty churches of Illinois; two hundred and fifty-one churches of Ohio, an Evangelical Alliance representing all the churches in Cincinnati; a District Epworth League; and a County Sabbath School Association; and petitions from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, containing 223 individual signatures—all these last also of Ohio.

"This style of memorializing Congress, by wholesale, is what the Christian Statesman boasts of as 'the new method of petitioning,' and says:

'The old method of petitioning by miscellaneous signatures, obtained hastily at the door and on the street, is not only slower, but more likely to result in mistakes than the new method, by deliberate vote, after explanation and discussion, in citizens' meetings, labor lodges, and church assemblies. These indorsements of organizations also show, by the name of the organization, just what sort of people are favoring the movement.'

"It certainly is a much easier way, to count up supposititious petitioners—for the presiding officer in a public meeting to have the resolution adopting the memorial read, and say, 'You hear the resolution. Is there any objection? I hear no objection. The resolution is adopted,' and then sign himself as representing a hundred, or a thousand, or ten thousand, or more, according to the size of the organization, and his official position in it.

"This looks like a very easy way of rolling up immense petitions, does it not? And so it is, for it involves the most stupendous system of repeating ever invented. Take, for instance, to exemplify this, the results obtained from the deliberate (?) vote of the gatherings named in the description of the 'new method.' A citizens' meeting will be representative, and composed of men from all the different churches, all the different labor lodges and organizations, young men from all the different Sunday schools, Christian Endeavor Societies, Epworth Leagues; women from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Christian Endeavor, Epworth Leagues, King's Daughters, Sunday schools, etc. Here in this citizens' meeting they have all petitioned once. That is one vote. But the matter is presented before a labor lodge, and if a vote is taken, those who were present at the citizens' meeting are counted again. The repeating has begun. Different meetings and councils of this organization are called, and each one of these votes is counted as represented by the authority of the officers or delegates present at their different councils, grand councils, etc., up to the highest representative body of the organization. But the repeating continues. Many of those who are members of labor lodges are also members of churches. Their church sends in a petition; they vote again. The ministers' meeting of their town sends in a petition; they are represented again. The repeating goes on. Their Sunday school petitions; they vote again. The county Sabbath school association memorializes Congress; again they are counted. Their churches convene their different presbyteries, synods, conferences, ecumenical councils, etc.; in them all they are represented again and again, over and over. The multiplicity of the repeating becomes bewildering. But the Evangelical Alliance may vote them again, and scattering congregations of repeaters may be gathered at almost any extra religious service, revival or union meeting. Through the organizations of the Christian Endeavor Society and Epworth League the same process is followed."

Some very astonishing things were disclosed in these "representative petitions" which came before Congress at that time. It was found that more petitions for Sunday closing came in from some States than could be made from the signatures of every man, woman, and child the State contained. This was brought to public attention by the Washington Post of May 5, 1892, which in the same connection asked some very pertinent questions. This is what the Post said:

"In their efforts to close the World's Fair on Sundays, the good people who are so careful of other people's morals seem to have temporarily forgotten their own. They have been working the various States with petitions, and getting signatures with a zeal that is literally appalling. The Michigan petition has just reached the Chicago managers, and upon examination is found to represent 800,000 more people than the last census discovered in the State. The inference is that the propaganda, so far as Michigan is concerned, at least, includes not only the grown folks, but the babies, the yellow dogs, the wolves, and the catfish. There is no other way to account for the size of that petition.

"A similar growth is indicated in Ohio, and perhaps in other States. But the feature of real interest is the astonishing disclosure of ardor on the part of persons who constitute themselves guardians of their neighbors' consciences. It suggests a great many ideas which we cannot fully catalogue in the limited space at the disposal of a daily newspaper. It occurs to us to inquire, however, whether it be worse in morals to look at an industrial exhibit on Sunday than to concoct and utter falsehoods during the week?"

Such is the way in which these petitions for Sunday closing are made to represent the "prevailing sentiment" of the people. Such representations are certainly not entitled to much respect. s.
