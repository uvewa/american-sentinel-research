## SUNDAY LAWS AND THE WORKING-MAN.

Though primarily religious in their nature, origin, and purpose, Sunday laws are often urged in the interests of the working-man. It is argued that such laws are necessary to secure to labor the blessing of periodical rest. But it is open to serious question whether the working-man is really benefited by such legislation.

The demand for Sunday legislation comes primarily from the religious forces of the nation. Were it not for the influence of the churches, there would be no Sunday legislation such as we now have.

The working-man asks only freedom from toil on Sunday. The churches demand protection primarily, not for the man but for the day. Hence, the ordinary Sunday law not only closes factories, etc., but it closes also places of amusement, including public libraries, museums, and in some places stops street-cars and public excursions. Therefore, the man who asks for a Sunday law in order that he may rest, indirectly asks for a law that will greatly restrain his own liberties on that day.

The rich man can use his carriage on Sunday and go where he will, but stop street-cars and excursion trains and boats, and the poor man is confined to his own home or at most within walking distance of his home.

The rich man has a well-stocked library and all the latest magazines and papers, but the poor man must obtain these in a public library or content himself with the Sunday paper, and the friends of Sunday legislation declare that the Sunday paper must go.

The rich man can take his family to visit the art galleries and museums at any time, but the working-man must see these things on Sunday or not at all.

The rich man can take his family into the country or to the seashore when he will, but the poor man and his family must take such outings on Sunday or not at all.

The tendency of Sunday legislation is to become more and more restrictive. Those who are urging it proceed upon the theory that Sunday can not be preserved as a day of rest unless it is preserved also as a day of worship. Their real purpose is to fill the churches on Sunday, and, that this may be done, they seek to close everything else. They would suppress not only the Sunday paper, the Sunday excursion, and the Sunday street-cars, but they would abolish the Sunday concert and close the Sunday library and the Sunday museum—everything in fact that comes in competition with the churches.

Personally, we do not believe in attending fairs, etc., on the day we regard as the Sabbath. We believe that every man ought to have conscientious convictions upon this subject, and that he ought to be true to those convictions, but if any man has not such convictions it is vain to compel him to act as though he had such convictions. The man who does not go on an excursion on Sunday, but remains at home simply because he must, might just as well go so far as moral considerations are concerned, and if that is practically his only opportunity, he certainly would be physically better off were he to go. Nothing but dissipation is any more destructive to either physical or moral power than chafing under enforced idleness and restraint. Only voluntary Sabbath-keeping can be of any value physically or morally.

A great fair affords an opportunity of a lifetime to thousands of working-men and women. They can ill afford both the time and the money to visit it, but if it is open on Sunday with, perhaps, reduced admittance fee, they can afford to attend. They feel that they ought to have the opportunity. Nobody needs to go who does not wish to. It becomes a very serious question, therefore, whether those who do not believe in Sunday fairs have any right to insist that the gates shall be closed simply because their consciences are tender on the subject.

In the case of the World's Fair in this city in 1893, thousands and tens of thousands who did not visit the Fair at all, and who had no expectation of visiting it, were counted as petitioners for closing the gates on Sunday, thus becoming in a measure consciences for other people. Doubtless the same will be true, though not to so great an extent, with the Pan-American Exposition next summer. We are among those who believe that the question of Sunday closing should be settled, not by those who do not care to attend on that day, but by the managers and by those who could attend better on Sunday than at any other time. In short, the matter should be allowed to adjust itself without resort to the tactics adopted with only partial success to secure the Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition.
