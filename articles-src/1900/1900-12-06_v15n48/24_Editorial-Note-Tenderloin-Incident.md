An incident which occurred recently in New York City illustrates very clearly and forcibly both the quantity and the quality of the moral sentiment that is behind Sunday legislation. The incident was this: On Sunday evening, November 25, of this nineteen-hundredth year of grace, a reporter in search of news visited that section of New York known as the "Tenderloin," the home of gilded vice. Notwithstanding the crusade now in progress to purge the city of open wickedness, the saloons of the "Tenderloin" were "wide open" on this Sunday evening, and both men and women could be seen entering their front and side doors. A policeman, one of "the finest," stood complacently on a corner in plain sight of at least half a dozen open saloons. The reporter approached the officer and inquired where he might find an open barber shop. The policeman straightened himself to his greatest height, put on his most virtuous look, and in a severe tone made reply: "Young man, you won't find a barber shop open in this city Sunday evening. It's against the law."
