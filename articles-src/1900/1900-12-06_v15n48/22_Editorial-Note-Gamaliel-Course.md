So far as Sunday or any religious institution is concerned, we believe in the course advocated by Gamaliel, when he advised the Pharisees not to molest the disciples: "Refrain from these men and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye can not overthrow it."

Leave the Sunday institution alone, to survive or perish as its character may merit. If it is of men it will come to nought, spite of all the decrees and enactments of all the legislatures on earth. And if it be of God, if it is backed by the arm of Omnipotence, it will prevail without the aid of the arm of flesh. Let the Sunday stand or fall on its own merits.
