Among the resolutions adopted at a recent meeting held in Sheboygan under the auspices of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association, was one demanding the Sunday closing of the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo next summer. The action authorized the secretary to transmit a copy of the resolution to the managers of the Exposition "in the name of the convention." Of the two hundred or two hundred and fifty people present at the meeting, scarcely one in ten voted. Yet this resolution has doubtless been reported ere this as voicing the sentiment of "a large and enthusiastic mass-meeting of the people of Sheboygan."
