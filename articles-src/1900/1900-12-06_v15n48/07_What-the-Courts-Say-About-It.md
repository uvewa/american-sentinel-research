## WHAT THE COURTS SAY ABOUT IT.

SHOULD the Pan-American Exposition be closed Sundays on the ground that Sunday is a religious day which the people are religiously bound to observe by refraining from work? Is this the reason why the State should decide in favor of Sunday closing? "Oh, no;" say the advocates of enforced Sunday observance, "we only ask for Sunday closing on civil grounds. Laws enforcing Sunday rest are not religious laws at all, but civil laws; they enforce a civil Sabbath."

But is this true? History gives no such answer. The fountain head of the stream of Sunday legislation was wholly religious; at what point did the stream change its character? The courts of law have spoken over and over again upon the character of Sunday laws. What have they said on the subject? Let us note some of their decisions.

In 1824 an English judge said:

"It seems to me that the object of the statute was to prevent persons keeping open shop and disregarding the decency of the Lord's day by the public show of their ordinary trades and occupations." —Littledale J., in Bloosome vs. Williams, 5 D. and R., 82.

In 1811, in the State of New York, Judge Kent said of the Sunday law:

"The statute has, for over a century, recognized the sanctity of the obligation and punished its violators."—Ruggles' case, 8 Johns, 290.

In Boynton vs. Page (12 Wend., New York, 57) the decision speaks of "the public order and solemnity of the day."

Twenty-five years later (1859) another New York judge declared that the Sunday law of New York "explicitly recognizes the first day of the week as holy time."—Campbell vs. International Soc., 4 Bos., N. Y., 298.

A Pennsylvania decision (Jeandelle's case, 3 Phil., 509) affirms that "the day [Sunday] is clothed with a peculiar sanctity." In Moore vs. Hogan (2 Duv., 437) two statutes of Kentucky are contrasted, the decision stating that "one applies to Sunday as sacred, and the other to holidays as secular." An Iowa decision (Davis vs. Fish, Green, 406) affirms that Sunday is "sacred, set apart for rest," etc.

A North Carolina decision (Ricket's case, 74 N. C., 184), referring to the Sunday law, says that "All religious and moral codes permit works of necessity and charity on their sacred days." A Georgia decision uses still stronger language: "All courts should abstain from the transaction of ordinary business on this holy day."—Gholston vs. Gholston, 31 Ga., 625. Another Georgia decision says: "The Sabbath is regarded as the Lord's day, and it is protected from violation by so many guards, that the courts should not be allowed to invade its sanctity."—Bass vs. Irwin, 49 Ga., 436. In Weldon's case (62 Ga., 449), Sunday is declared to be a "holy day."

One class of decisions is based on the idea that the state has power to consecrate Sunday. Of this class of decisions, Mr. Ringgold, author of the "Law of Sunday," says:

"These are cases which hold that its sanctification was accomplished by statute. Thus one reason given for 'separating' the day as a 'holy' one in Massachusetts is the fact that the legislative power has exacted the observance of it as such.—Pearce vs. Atwood, 13 Mass., 324."

In the case of People vs. Ruggles (New York), Judge Kent affirmed that "the statute for preventing immorality consecrates the first day of the week as holy time."—8 Johns, 290. In Moore vs. Hogan, a Kentucky report, the judge speaks of the Sunday law as "the statute consecrating the Sabbath."—2 Duv., 437. In Weldon's case (62 Ga., 449), it is laid down that Georgia courts and magistrates are to regard Sunday as the Lords' day "as a mere matter of law, irrespective of religious obligation and duty."

Another class of decisions is based on the idea that Sunday is sacred by both divine and human authority. A decision by a New York judge in 1861 said that "It does not detract from the moral or legal sanction of the law of the State that it conforms to the law of God, as that law is recognized by the great majority of the people."—Linden Muller's case, 33 Barb., 548.

In a Pennsylvania decision (Eyre's case, S. and R., 347) it is said that "Sabbath breaking is the violation of a divine as well as a human law." Another Pennsylvania decision uses this language: "It may not be essential, but it is far from being irrelevant, to the decision of the present case, to sustain the divine authority of its institution" (Sunday). Further, it says that the day has been "set apart by divine command and human legislation as a day of rest. * * * It has come down to us with the most solemn sanctions both of man and of God."—Johnston's case, 22 Pa., 102.

An Arkansas decision informs citizens of that State who play cards on Sunday that the day "is set apart by divine appointment, as well as by the law of the land, for other and better engagements."—Stockden's case, 18 Ark., 186.

An Iowa court declared in the case of Davis vs. Fish (1 Green, 406), that Sunday observance has been "established by laws both human and divine, for public worship and private devotion—a time-honored and heaven-appointed institution." Maryland has said likewise: "The Sabbath is emphatically the day of rest, and the day of rest here is the Lord's day or Christian Sunday. Ours is a Christian community, and the day set apart as a day of rest is the day consecrated by the resurrection of our Saviour."—Kilgour vs. Mills, 8 G. and J., 268.

Georgia has gone furthest in recognizing the religious character of Sunday laws, by speaking thus:

"The law fixes the day recognized as the Sabbath day all over Christendom, and that day by divine injunction is to be kept holy; on it thou shalt do no work. The Christian Sabbath is a civil institution older than our Government."—Karwisch's case, 44 Ga., 204. And again:

"Independently of the moral obligation resting upon all men to obey the law of the Lord, and to observe by abstaining from all secular business on the day set apart for his worship throughout Christendom, the rest of one day in seven from all physical and mental labor is a great conservative, refreshing, invigorating means, designed by Almighty wisdom for the preservation of health and the recreation of our mental and bodily faculties. But neither the law of God nor the law of man forbids us to do good on the Sabbath day. * * * When the State of Georgia, therefore, excepts works of benevolence and charity from the operations of this penal statute, it but reenacts the law of the Almighty as announced by the Saviour and beautified by his example."—Salter vs. Smith, 55 Ga., 244.

Most of these decisions were rendered prior to 1875. In them the courts have pronounced with unmistakable clearness that Sunday laws are religious laws, based upon the supposed sacred character and divine obligation of the day. Back in that earlier period of American history the belief in Sunday as a sacred day was almost universal. But within the last quarter of the century, and especially toward the close of it the claims of the seventh day as the true Sabbath have been widely heralded in this country, and the old belief in the sanctity of Sunday has been greatly lessened. So widespread has become the religious indifference to the day that it has been found necessary to devise a new support for the Sunday laws, and this new-found support is the idea that such laws are not religious, but civil. But the necessity for a new support did not create a new fact; it did not in the least change the character of Sunday legislation. What it was in character before this new claim was put forth, it remained afterward. Its character can no more be changed than can the spots of the leopard.

Sunday is a religious institution, and Sunday laws are religious laws; so says history and so say the courts. In the face of such testimony there is nothing left to do but to admit the fact.
