## THE LOGIC OF INTOLERANCE.

"THIS, the best republic in the world," declared one of the speakers at the Sheboygan meeting of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association, "is built upon that rigid Puritanical observance of the Sabbath. Destroy that and you destroy the republic; and another band of Pilgrims will be found hunting some spot on which to found a Christian republic."

It is by such declarations that men attempt to identify religion and religious institutions with the state, and to make heresy synonymous with disloyalty. A notable example of this is furnished by a tract, "The American Sabbath," published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication, wherein Rev. Robert Patterson, D. D., says:

"It is the right of the state to protect by law such a fundamental support of government. This attack on the Sabbath is treason against the very foundation of government. As such, let it be re-resisted by every American citizen. The American Sabbath is essential to American liberty, to our republic, and to God's religion."

On the same subject, Dr. W. F. Crafts says in his book, "The Sabbath for Man":

"It is the conviction of the majority that the nation can not be preserved without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without laws; therefore Sabbath laws are enacted by the right of self-preservation, not in violation of liberty, but for its protection."—Page 248.

It is the same old argument in justification of religious intolerance. "It is expedient for us," said Caiaphas, "that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not." Said Demetrius: "Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands; so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshipeth."

Truly both the language and the logic of intolerance differ little from age to age.
