## NATIONAL REFORM IN JAPAN.

And now we have a Sabbath Union in the Island of Japan. During the month of October, this present year, about four hundred and fifty representatives of the Christian church came together at the capital of that country to consider questions of interest in connection with the advancement of the interests of the church among the Japanese. Among other things it was decided to organize a Sabbath Union. A proposition was made to call it "Lord's Day" or Sunday Union, but this was rejected. Deep regrets were expressed by Audrey of the Church of England and others, that the Greek and Roman Catholics were not represented in the conference, but many were the expressions of confidence that these bodies would cast their influence and support in favor of the union.

Judging from the work of Sabbath unions in other lands, we may look for a demand upon the Government of Japan for a Sabbath law, for this is the sole object of Sabbath unions.

Japan is a heathen country, and until recently the entire people worshiped heathen gods and observed heathen institutions in obedience to the laws of the country. The time came when Japan admitted the missionary to teach her people a knowledge of the Creator of the universe and the gospel of the Son of God. Can it be possible that the church of the living God is so dependent on the powers of earth that it must seek the aid of a heathen government in upholding the very institution that is supposed to distinguish the true God from all false gods?

Jesus, after his resurrection, said: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." "Go ye therefore into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." If these men in Japan are the ambassadors of Jesus Christ, they have no need of any power save that of the King whom they serve.

It is a shame for the church that calls itself Christ's to invoke the aid of any government, much less of heathen governments, in the furtherance of its work.
