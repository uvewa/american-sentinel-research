## Self-Government an Individual Acquirement.

BY H. F. PHELPS.

The art of self-government must be acquired in the lifetime of the individual who is to govern himself; and not "acquired only after centuries of study and struggle and experiment and instruction;" as a United States senator recently said. It can be of no value to the individual, nor yet to a nation, if it must take "centuries." Neither is it a thing to be "bestowed" by man upon a fellowman, nor can it be given by a nation of men to another nation of men. It is an individual acquirement, and can only be acquired as a person is left altogether free to work out the problem for himself. Even then it is true that "eternal vigilance" must be an element in the man else the lesson will not be learned.

That self-government does not fall as a legacy from one generation to another, is a lesson well attested in the history of the two greatest republics of all time. It is said, that of all peoples, the ancient Romans possessed the faculty of self-government above all others, unless it were the Anglo-Saxons. And, though the last named would not be willing to award the palm to their more ancient brethren, it may be doubted that even these, could they give their voice in the matter, would grant the claims of superiority to the men of this Republic.

But all readers of history know that with that faculty of self-government in the Romans, was also to be found, hand in hand, the faculty and love of industry and frugality. With these, there followed prosperity. And, quickly, upon its very heels, followed luxury and prodigality. With these came idleness to the masses, because of the massing of the wealth in the hands of the few, and ease to the rich because of their wealth. Then, as a result of luxury and ease to the wealthy, and idleness and want to the masses, there followed indulgence in every crime nameable in the catalogue of crimes.

As luxury, ease, and indulgence of every propensity with the rich; and want, penury, and idleness to the masses, came in; so also the art of self-government went out. Then, in order to restrain the dark passions of men, and to preserve the nation and even the world from going down under the weight of wickedness, an effort was made to save the nation, and so the world, by legislation. That is, they sought to make men better by law. But as men were not made better at heart by legislation, there was no power in law to reform men. And as men must be governed even though they had lost the power of self-government, the only logical result was a despotism,—the despotism of the army, followed by the despotism of the one-man power, as vested in the emperor.

Thus it is clear that self-government is not an art to be secured by centuries of study, etc.; but each generation of men must seize upon their opportunities, first secured to them by their liberty, in the government of each individual by himself, and that for himself alone. If they do not do this the faculty becomes a lost art.

No man can govern himself for another, nor can he govern another man for himself. The moment this is attempted, there is an attempt at despotism. As Abraham Lincoln said: "When a white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself, and another man, that is more,—it is despotism."
