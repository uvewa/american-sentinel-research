## A Protest Against State Chaplains.

BY A BAPTIST CLERGYMAN OF RICHMOND, VA.

From Sermon by Rev. Dr. Hawthorne, in Grove Ave. Baptist Church, Richmond, Va., December, 1899; reported in the Richmond "Evening Leader."

"CAN the State of Virginia commission a man to preach the gospel to its convicts without violating the fundamental principle of religious liberty?"

Dr. Hawthorne preached on this subject yesterday morning in the Grove Avenue Baptist church to a vast audience. Among those who attended the service were Governor Tyler and a great many members of the legislature. Dr. Hawthorne took for his text the words of Christ to Pilate: 'My kingdom is not of this world.' John 18:36.

He said in part:

"I deeply regret the circumstances which have constrained me to devote this hour to the discussion of the great question of religious liberty. A few weeks ago five ministers of the gospel, residing in this city, sent to the Governor of our State a communication, recommending the appointment of a chaplain to the penitentiary. For these ministers I cherish the highest regard. No one who knows them would question their ability or their fealty to the cause of Christ. Men more worthy of confidence and honor cannot be found in the Commonwealth.

"In response to the request of these Christian ministers, the governor of the State put into his recent message to the legislature a clause recommending the appointment of a chaplain for the State's convicts and an appropriation for his salary. Virginia has never had a chief magistrate more worthy of the esteem and affection of her people than the man who now occupies that exalted position. I would gladly help to elect him to any office within the gift of the Virginia people.

"To oppose these Christian ministers and the noble Governor of our State is to me a painful duty. But I could not refrain from the task without failing to discharge an obligation which I owe to the people of the State, and especially to the denomination of Christians which I represent. It is in the spirit of kindness and Christian charity that I enter my solemn protest against the measure recommended by these distinguished men.

"When Jesus said to Pontius Pilate, 'My kingdom is not of this world,' he announced a principle, which, if universally observed, would keep religion forever separate from the state and give to every human being on the globe the utmost liberty of conscience.

"It was never Christ's purpose to have any conflict with temporal government. No teacher ever taught with more emphasis and clearness of man's obligation to obey civil authority.

"There cannot be any conflict between religion and the state so long as each acts within its own legitimate sphere, and performs its own legitimate functions. The dominion of Christ is over the human spirit. Within the realm of faith and conscience he is the King of kings, and Lord of lords. As his kingdom is absolutely spiritual it can have no connection with external government. Its laws can be enforced only by spiritual sanction.

"The functions of the state is to deal with men's outward, earthly, and temporal affairs. It has to do only with civil offenses, and can punish only by the infliction of civil pains and penalties. The church should never invade the sphere of the state, and the state should never enter the sphere of the church. When either departs from this principle it degrades itself in the eyes of God and men.

"Christ took no step to connect his cause with the state. Not in the remotest way did he ever hint that it needed the support of the civil power. His kingdom rules in a higher sphere, and has all needful laws and forces of its own for the accomplishment of its sacred purposes. It needs no help from the state, and wherever it has accepted or invited such help it has soiled its purity and weakened its power. For a thousand years the alliance of religion with external government made the church, or what was called the church, a mother of harlots and abominations.

"The authority of the church is spiritual, and only spiritual. Its work is spiritual. Its mission is to seek, by the agency of divine truth and grace, to bring men into right spiritual relations with God and each other, and thus prepare them for virtuous living here and everlasting blessedness hereafter.

"Civil laws which establish one form of worship, and forbid or restrict other forms, are based upon the unwarranted and mischievous assumption that it is the function of the State to determine for its subjects what is the true faith and worship. That heresy is the mother of all the religious persecutions that have stained with blood the annals of our race. This heresy reappears to-day in various forms.

"It reappears in an organized effort to put a recognition of Christianity into the organic law of our Republic, and in the avowed purpose of a certain secret organization to prevent men who hold to a certain religious creed from having any voice in the government under which we live. Down with it! Down with it! It is the blackest treason against the rights of man. It is a conspiracy against the blood-bought freedom bequeathed to us by our patriot sires. It is as wicked as the spirit which kindled the martyr fires of Smithfield and drenched the soil of France with the precious blood of liberty-loving and God-fearing Huguenots. Down with it! Load it with righteous indignation! Brand it with the hissing iron of virtuous scorn!

"All that the State can rightfully do for religion is to protect it. The protection which it extends to one sect it must extend to all. It is unwarranted interference to make any distinction in the matter of protection, in favor of Protestant, Papist, or Jew or Mohammedan or pagan. Every human being who breathes the air of this planet has the natural right to worship what he pleases, whether it be Jehovah, or pope, or sun or moon, or mountain or tree, or beast or bird, and it is the solemn duty of the State to protect him in the exercise of this right.

"When any body of Christians receive or ask from the state more than protection—when they accept or petition for patronage in any form—they not only trespass upon the rights of conscience and violate the fundamental principles of religious liberty, but confess to a weakness in the religion to which they hold.

"We profess to believe in the immortality of Christian truth. We claim that our religion is from the Lord God Omnipotent—that it is inherently divine and, therefore, cannot be overthrown by men or devils.

"We profess to belong to a kingdom which has the God-man for its head, and that it can, and will, possess the earth, not only without the help of temporal kingdoms, but in defiance of every combination they can make against it.

"Now, when we seek any alliance with, or any patronage from, the State, we contradict ourselves and confess to a weakness which invites the ridicule and scorn of every infidel in the world. In seeking such aid we do not attract one human soul to our cause, but drive millions from it.

"Paul says, 'The gospel is the wisdom of God and the power of God.' If this be true it must live and conquer. When you ask temporal authority to support the gospel you practically deny its divinity, and confess to a lack of confidence in the means and methods which Christ instituted for its dissemination and triumph.

"Where do we see in our country an alliance between church and state? We see it first in the State legislation, which exempts church property from taxation. One local church in New York has ten million dollars' worth of dividend-paying property on which there is not one cent of taxation. This is a violation of the principles of religious liberty, because it compels Jews, Mohammedans, Buddhists, Deists, Agnostics, and Atheists, living upon our soil, to contribute to the support of a religion which they repudiate.

"If our State government should exempt bar-rooms from taxation, it would thereby compel every tax-payer to contribute to the support of the bar-rooms. This would be an outrage upon the consciences of tax-paying men who hate and abhor these crime-breeding institutions. It is not any less a violation of the rights of conscience to make churches beneficiaries of the State government. Where this is done many men are compelled to support a religion with which they have no sympathy. It costs the State of Virginia a big sum of money to protect church property. Who pays for the protection? Not only Christians, but Jews and infidels.

"It is claimed that the exemption of church property from taxation is justifiable on the ground that churches promote morality, and thus decrease the expenses of the Government in protecting the lives, liberty and property of its subjects. On the same ground any minister of the gospel, or any superintendent of a Sunday-school, or any teacher of a Bible-class, or any temperance lecturer could claim exemption from taxation, because he is a promoter of morality. I have heard of a wholesale dry goods merchant whose habit was to call his clerks and other employes together every day and lecture to them on the subject of Christian ethics. If the promotion of morality is a just ground for exemption from taxation, surely that man's business should have been exempted. Why discriminate between the promoters of morality? It is unjust.

"I do not believe that in every place of public worship morality is promoted. In Mormon, Buddhist, and Mohammedan places of worship the infamous doctrine of polygamy is taught; and when the government under which I live exempts such places from taxation, it violates and outrages my conscience by compelling me, a tax-payer, to support polygamy.

"We find an alliance of church and state again in the appointment of chaplains to Congress, to our army and navy, and to our State legislatures and many State institutions. The creation and support of these offices is nothing less than governmental patronage of the Christian religion. The ministers who fill these places are commissioned by the Government; they are responsible to the Government for the manner in which they perform their ministerial functions; they are in the strictest sense Government preachers. If that is not a union of church and state there is no such thing in England or Germany or Austria or Russia.

"What right has either Federal or State government to espouse the cause of any religion and provide for its maintenance and propagation anywhere under the sun? When and where did the people delegate to them such authority? Where, in the Federal Constitution, or in the Constitution of the State of Virginia, do you find any warrant for such procedure? Did the wise and liberty-loving men who framed these great instruments of organic law ever dream of such a thing as founding a government that should lend its mighty arm to the establishment and support of any religion? The Federal Constitution says: 'Congress shall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion.' How can a State establish religion?—By appointing and paying ministers to do religious work.

"If my son were in the navy and compelled to attend a religious service every Sunday conducted by a Mohammedan or Mormon, I should be deeply grieved. It would be to him and to me an intolerable affliction.

"We are bound to admit that the Government can just as consistently with its organic law appoint a Mohammedan or a Mormon to a chaplaincy in the navy as it can appoint an Episcopalian, a Presbyterian, or a Baptist. It is a violation of the fundamental law of the Republic and an outrage upon conscience to appoint any one to do religious work in the navy or elsewhere.

"Let members of Congress take money from their own pockets to support the men whom they choose to lead them in their morning devotions. Let the officers and privates of the army and navy contribute of their own earnings for the support of the men who minister to them in spiritual things. If they cannot do it, then let the churches of the country provide for them, just as they do for people in their mission fields.

"The governor of Virginia, backed by a petition or recommendation from five Christian ministers in Richmond, asks the legislature for authority to appoint a man to preach the gospel of Christ in the penitentiary, and to take from the State's treasury a sum of money sufficient for his support. If the legislature should authorize such an appointment, and such an appropriation from the treasury of the State, it will thereby discriminate against other religions and declare Christianity to be the religion of the State. When did Virginians ever delegate to their civil government the right to determine for them what religion they should support? The passage of such a measure would wound the consciences of many thousands of Virginia people, and practically annul the principle embodied in the great 'Bill of Rights' adopted by our fathers.

"Every true Christian in the State appreciates the importance of preaching the gospel to the convicts in our State's prison. So far, this work has been provided partly by ministers who have asked for no pecuniary compensation, and partly by missionaries, supported by voluntary contributions of the churches. The superintendent of that prison says that no chaplain could do the work which is now being performed by the churches.

"What good reason could the State give for interfering with this plan which has been operated so successfully? If more religious work is needed among these convicts let it be known, and the Christian people of Virginia will provide for it."
