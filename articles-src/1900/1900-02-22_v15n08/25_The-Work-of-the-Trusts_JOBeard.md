## The Work of the Trusts.

A MAN committed suicide in this city [Creston, Ia.] recently. The reason he committed suicide was because of financial losses which he sustained through the "trust" methods of doing business. He had been a grain buyer but was unable to continue in that business because he had been shut out by the elevator or grain warehouse combinations of Chicago and St. Louis. In his office fastened to the front of his desk was a letter from one of these warehouses acknowledging the receipt of a consignment of grain. But that was not all of the letter. It continued, "We are sorry to learn that you are not a member of the —— Grain Buyers' Association. We consider it a most worthy organization and would respectfully suggest that you become a member of it." The letter informed him that because he was not a member of that association they could receive no more grain from him. He informed the writer that in the same way he had been shut out of Chicago and other St. Louis warehouses and if he could not do something to raise the boycott against him he would soon be shut out entirely. In reply to the question, "Why not join the —— Grain Buyers' Association," he said that the association was a combination to hold down the price of grain as it was bought from the farmers, that it was formed only for dishonest purposes and that he would not be a party to any such organization.

It is against the laws of this State to form such an organization as this association is, and this man had appealed to the State authorities for a redress of his grievances. But he found no relief and the process went on, until in despair, he ended his life. Inquiry among those who had known him for years established the fact that he was recognized as a very honest and straightforward man, and one whose word was trusted by all who knew him.

Here was manifested the spirit of the men who form those combinations called trusts. They not only set out to control the prices of things but also are ready to shut off from buying and selling all who will not unite with them in their wicked schemes. And in doing this they have no regard for the welfare, nor even the lives, of those who oppose them or stand in the way of their ambitious plans.

This is a forcible illustration of what will be done in a more general way when those who "worship the beast and his image" undertake to enforce that worship upon all who dissent from them. If a few men can shut a fellowman off from selling wheat and corn how easy will it be to shut off from both buying and selling all who will not submit, when all are united in that purpose.
