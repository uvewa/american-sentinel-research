THE contention between two magnates in the steel industry, Messrs. Carnegie and Frick, reveals some instructive facts and figures concerning the modern "trust" methods of doing business. The Carnegie Steel Company, it appears, was formed in 1892, by a union of two companies having each a capital of $5,000,000. On the basis of this $10,000,000 actually paid in, by a little manipulation of stock, $25,000,000 appeared as the nominal capital of the concern and the net profits for 1899 were $21,000,000. Profits for 1900, estimated, $40,000,000. Value of property in 1899, as estimated by Mr. Carnegie, $250,000,000; and value on the London market in ordinarily prosperous times, by the same authority, $500,000,000. All this in eight years from a capital of but $10,000,000! Who will say in view of such things that the fifth chapter of James is not present truth?
