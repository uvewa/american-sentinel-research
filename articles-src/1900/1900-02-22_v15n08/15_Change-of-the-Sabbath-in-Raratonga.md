## Change of the Sabbath in Raratonga, Cook Islands.

*Some Interesting Notes on the Subject, by Dr. J. E. Caldwell, Medical Missionary of the Seventh-day Adventists.*

It is wonderfully interesting just now to go around among the natives of the Cook Islands and listen to their conversation as they are engaged in the discussion of the Sabbath question. The unusual interest in that subject grows out of the fact that an attempt has been made to bring the Cook Islands into harmony with the rest of the world in the observance of the first day of the week as rest day.

The native Parliament passed a bill at its last session providing that in these islands the coming twenty-fifth day of December, together with the corresponding day of the week, shall be repeated in our calendar on the day following, thus giving us two Christmas days in this year. This will serve to correct the mistake the early missionaries are said to have made when they came from the West and crossed the one hundred and eightieth meridian, neglecting the change usually made by navigators in crossing the day-line.

Though the mistake seems to have been recognized at an early day, it is a strange fact that all the native dialects have escaped some of the evil consequences that would naturally be expected to follow such a mistake, for in numbering the days of the week they have made no mistake in using words belonging to the dialects to correspond to the mistake in the day of the month. Thus the second day after their rest day they call *ruirua* (second day), and the day following is *ruitoru* (third day), and they have always called the Sabbath, on which they have refrained from labor, *ra itu* (seventh day), which it really is, and always has been.

It is the belief of all that the missionaries who brought European customs to these parts of the earth were Sunday-keepers; and how these things were fixed in the native language, notwithstanding the above-named mistake that is said to have been made, no one seems able to explain. Thus there seems to have been no mistake in numbering the days of the week, though the names Sunday, Monday, etc., have been erroneously applied and held in common with the mistake in the day of the month, though for a long time recognized as incorrect.

At the coming Christmas tide, the above-named errors are to be corrected, and a law to punish those who work on the first day of the week is to come into effect. A fitting time, indeed, to introduce such a practise. Since Sunday worship is of pagan origin, introduced into the so-called Christian Church through Roman Catholic interference, it is quite appropriate that that pago-papal season of festivity, Christmas, should be selected from which to date the beginning of strictly Sunday laws in the Cook Islands.

Many of the natives are convinced that some sort of a mistake was made, but they are not clear as to the nature of the mistake. Many who accept the explanation given of its origin do not see clearly why they should be compelled to forsake the seventh day Sabbath, which they all believe to be in harmony with the Scriptures, and take up with the first-day rest as a substitute. Nor does the writer see, except to fulfill the prophecy of Jesus Christ through John the Revelator, when he said by the Spirit of God, "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the Book of Life." Rev. 13:8.

There is a great deal of discontent among the natives. Some are clear on the subject, while others look upon the change with a sort of superstitious dread, fearing some plague from the Almighty as a judgment upon the land for attempting to change his laws. Some see clearly that the Sabbath is a holy day, made so by the presence of the Saviour in the person of his Spirit, without which nothing can be holy,—for he alone can hallow, and he makes holy by his presence. They see, therefore, that in forsaking the Sabbath for an institution of human origin, they are forsaking the Saviour who dwells in the Sabbath to sanctify his obedient children with a double blessing. Others see not the spiritual, but only the legal aspect of the change; but all, without exception, so far as I have observed, are opposed to the change. Even Makea Ariki, who, as head of the government, signed the bill, is said to weep and lament on account of the evil to which she consented, being carried away for the time by political and ecclesiastical advisers.

Another of the Arikis of the island, Pa by name, told me that he clearly pointed out to his peers when officially assembled, that the Sabbath belongs especially to God, and that the government should have nothing whatever to do with the proposed change.

There are rumors that the native authorities will close their houses of worship to first day worship if the present purpose to enforce the new laws is executed. I shall be both sorry and surprised if this is done, yet, doubtless, some may be alienated from their sympathy with those who have projected the change.

On May 19, 1899, the agents of the L. M. S. for Cook Islands held a meeting at Tereora, in which they decided to recommend a change in counting the days of the week. Here is their argument to the natives, as given in "Te Karere," the L. M. Society's organ for the group.

The statement is first made that those passing in ships from one group to another have great trouble on coming to Cook Islands. What the nature of the trouble is, we are not informed. The only regular vessel we have doing business in this group is the U. S. S. Co.'s steamer which comes from Auckland once a month. On crossing the day-line, the steamer simply ignores it, as did the early missionaries, and keeps the regularly succeeding first day, treating these islands as if they were on the west side of the line. Thus their rest day coincides with ours, which is the real seventh day. There is not any great trouble in this. Then the argument proceeds thus:

"Behold, let none be deceived (thinking) that we sin against God. This is not a sacred custom (Sabbath keeping), it is only a custom of the country. If we follow this new thing we shall not sin therein, and if we hold fast the ancient custom, we shall not therein be sinning. The Roman Catholics say we are sinning now in observing the seventh day, and if we change the day, that will be according to the mind of God. Lying words are these. The Seventh-day Adventists say we are right now, and if we change the day, in the mind of God that will be sin. These are also lying words.

"It will be right for us to change the day, right to hold fast the ancient observance. God will not make us trouble on account of this thing. One thing God has commanded us, namely, that we sanctify the seventh day as Sabbath no more. We now observe the Sabbath. If we change the day, we shall then still observe the Sabbath. The decision lies with the rulers of the country; but we, your missionary society, think it will be a good thing if the counting of the day is changed."

Raratonga, Nov. 6, 1899.
