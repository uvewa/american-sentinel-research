## Blue Law Arrest for Skating.

*New York "Sun."*

NEW HAVEN, CONN., Feb. 11.—An arrest under the old Blue Laws of the State, which put a penalty on various diversions on the Sabbath, occurred to-day when the Hamden, Conn., town constables took Arthur Edward Johnson into custody for skating. He was on Lake Whitney, two miles from this city, where the skating has been enjoyed by hundreds of Yale and town men. Johnson was the only skater on the lake. He was released on bonds.
