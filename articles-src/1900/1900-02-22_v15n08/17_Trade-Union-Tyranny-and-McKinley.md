THERE is a strike of granite cutters in progress in Chicago, and the Central Federated (labor) Union of that city have written President McKinley to remind him that as a member of the Union, he is expected to take action in their favor. The President became an honorary member of this organization some time ago, through being chosen to lay the corner-stone of the new Chicago post-office. The labor union controlled the situation there and were able to dictate that no work on the building should be done by non-union men. The President was of course not a member of a labor union, but the difficulty was gotten over in this case by making him an honorary member. He now finds this honorary position somewhat embarrassing.

It is reported that the tyranny of the trade unions in Chicago, exercised through an almost complete control of the labor situation there, is such that some piano firms and other manufacturing plants intend to leave the city, in order that employees, not members of the unions, may work for them without molestation.
