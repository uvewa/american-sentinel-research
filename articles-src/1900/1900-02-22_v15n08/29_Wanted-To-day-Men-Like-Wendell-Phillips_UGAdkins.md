## Wanted To-day—Men Like Wendell Phillips.

"Wouldn't there be some music if Wendell Phillips were yet alive and in good health—in view of tendencies making for the practical annulment of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the national Constitution?"

So discourses an able journal of Boston, Mass. Well, would it not be a good thing for this journal to produce a little "music" against the wholesale attacks that are now being made, not merely against the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, but the entire Constitution?

O that there were a few men, like Wendell Phillips, left, who would have the moral stamina to oppose all these party, and religio-political attacks, on our Constitution and Declaration of Independence!

ULYSES G. ADKINS.
