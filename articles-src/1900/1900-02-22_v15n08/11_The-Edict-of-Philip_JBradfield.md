## The Edict of Philip.

### BRINGING OUT BY CONTRAST THE MEANING OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION.

BY JOSEPH BRADFIELD.

I once read in an old book that James Madison who wrote the First Amendment to the Constitution, had before him when preparing the original draft, the celebrated Edict of 1550, promulgated as a recapitulation and condensation of all the previous ordinances of the Emperor Charles V, respecting religious subjects. That edict will be found in Motley's "Rise of the Dutch Republic," pp. 261, 264. Motley says that it was re-enacted by Philip with the express advice of the Bishop of Arras; and Mendham says in his "Life of Pius V," that this infamous decree was entirely approved by the Vatican; that the Bishop of Arras was made a cardinal on account of his connection with it; and that the Duke of Alva, who carried it into execution, was presented by the pope with a consecrated sword. The things forbidden by the Edict of 1550 were precisely those intended to be secured by the First Amendment, to wit: "The free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the press, and the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition for a redress of grievances."

Its leading features are as follows:

1. No one shall print, write, copy, keep, conceal, sell, buy, or give, in churches, streets, or other places, any book or writing made by Martin Luther, John Ecolampadius, Ulrich Zwinglius, Martin Bucer, John Calvin, or other heretics reprobated by the holy church.

2. No one shall converse or dispute concerning the Holy Scriptures, openly or secretly, especially on doubtful or difficult matters; nor read, teach, or expound the Scriptures, unless he has duly studied theology, and been approved by some renowned university.

3. No one shall preach, secretly or openly, nor entertain any of the opinions of the above-mentioned heretics.

4. No one shall hold conventicles in his own house, nor be present at any such, in which the adherents of the above-mentioned heretics teach, baptize, and form conspiracies against the holy church and the general welfare.

5. No one shall lodge, entertain, or furnish with food, fire, or clothing, any person known to be, or notoriously suspected of being, a heretic; and any one failing to denounce any such shall himself incur the penalties of heresy.

6. If any one, being not convicted of heresy or error, but greatly suspected thereof, and therefore condemned by the spiritual judges (the inquisitors) to abjure such heresy, or by the secular magistrate to make fine and reparation, shall again become suspected or tainted with heresy—then, although it shall not appear that he has contravened or violated any of the above-mentioned commands; nevertheless, such person shall be considered as relapsed, and, as such, be punished with loss of life and property, without any hope of moderation or mitigation of the penalties of heresy.

7. Such perturbers of the general quiet are to be executed, to wit, the men with the sword, and the women to be buried alive, if they do not persist in their error. But if they do persist in them, then they are to be executed with fire; all their property in both cases to be confiscated to the crown. No judge shall alter or moderate these punishments in any manner.

8. "We also forbid any one, of whatsoever condition, to ask of us, or of any one having authority, to grant pardon, or to present any petition in favor of such heretics, exiles, or fugitives, on penalty of being declared forever incapable of civil or military office, and of being arbitrarily punished besides."

In this edict, framed by the leaders of the Catholic party themselves, we have the real and permanent aims of the church of Rome with respect to the points it treats of. Those who framed our Constitution joined issue with the church on every one of these points, and built a wall of separation between church and state in order to protect the people of this land from the consequences of such iniquitous laws. The First Amendment is a remedial law, having in view the prevention of the mischiefs of intolerance, and was, as I have said, inspired by the memory of the Edict of 1550. It ought, therefore, to be construed with reference to that edict, so as to reach the mischief and apply the remedy; the only remedy being the non-establishment of religion, the non-interference of the civil authority with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.

But if our rulers pursue their present policy, it will not be fifty years before the Edict of 1550 will again become a law, and be operative in the United States. The only way to prevent such a consummation is to combat the principles of popery, whether they be found in Catholic or in so-called Protestant societies, in political parties or in monastic orders, in the army or among the populace.

My own opinion is that the twentieth century will witness in this country a repetition of the struggles between popery and liberty which convulsed western Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Edict of 1550 shows what true Protestants will be called upon to fight against; and the First Amendment, what they must fight for.
