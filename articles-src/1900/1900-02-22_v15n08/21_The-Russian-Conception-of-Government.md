"The genuine Russian conception of government," says *The Independent*, "is very forcibly set forth in the following, which we quote from a paper by an American published in the *Japan Mail*. The American was conversing with an intelligent and well-educated Russian officer, when the latter remarked:—

"There is one clause in the Constitution of the United States which always makes me laugh.

"What is it?" I asked.

"The statement that it is natural for all men to seek happiness, and that it is the business of government to attain it."

"But do you not consider government to be for the sake of the governed, and the welfare and happiness of the people a worthy end?"

"Certainly government is not for the sake of the people; and I do not consider happiness an end at all. We must make the people happy, else they will rebel; but this is only a means for furthering the interests of the State, while the true end of government is a great nation—Empire."

And this is not only the true Russian conception of government, but the conception held by every nation when it starts out on the road to empire; it is the imperial conception. And Russians and Europeans are now not the only people who laugh at the American Constitution.
