## The Sunday Law Against Spiritualism.

THE Sunday law has been invoked in this State for the suppression of a Spiritualist "séance," or of what claimed to be such. The facts of the case are given in a press dispatch from Mt. Vernon, dated the 11th inst., as follows:—

"Acting upon requests of the pastors of some of the leading churches of this city and with the approval of Mayor Fiske, Chief of Police Foley to-night prevented a séance of Spiritualists, which was to have been held in the People's Opera House. More than five hundred persons, many of them from Yonkers, White Plains and other places, were turned away. Manager Ring, of the Opera House, stood on the steps all the evening and told the people who came to attend the show that it had been postponed on account of police interference and would be held to-morrow night.

"The séance was to have been given by Dr. Alexander Hume, his wife and two assistants, who, according to circulars printed in both English and German, distributed widely in this and other cities, are 'the celebrated and wonderfully-gifted mediums, who have just arrived from London, England?' These circulars promised that they would cause spirits to fly through the air and converse with persons in the audience, tables to float in mid air, music to be played by unseen hands, bells rung and thoughts read through a copper wire stretched the full length of the room. 'Clergymen,' said the circulars in conclusion, 'are amazed, scientists dumbfounded. Sceptics are invited to occupy front seats. A nominal fee of admission will be charged to defray expenses.'

"The circulars fell into the hands of some of the local clergymen, and this morning one of them called up Chief Foley on the telephone and told him that as the séance was in the nature of an entertainment it should not be permitted to go on. Chief Foley promised to visit the Opera House and stop the performance immediately if the law was being violated. A delegation of ministers and church people visited Mayor Fiske and asked him to stop the affair. They said it would be in the nature of an exhibition, and, anyway, bringing back of the spirits of the dead and causing tables to float about in the air, they thought, were not proper things to be going on in Mount Vernon on Sunday night. Mayor Fiske and Chief Foley decided that the best thing they could do was to stop the show, so they notified Mr. Ring to call it off. They said it was an entertainment, and was, therefore, a violation of the Sunday laws. Mr. Ring was indignant but was forced to comply.

"'The great trouble is,' said he to-night to a crowd in front of the opera house, 'that there are other shows in town. The ministers don't want anything that will keep people away from their churches.'

"The Spiritualists, of whom there are a considerable number in Mount Vernon, were also indignant. They thought the mayor and police had exceeded their authority. Some of the women who were turned away from the opera house stamped their feet and declared that they would never go to any of the Mount Vernon churches again."
