## Lincoln's Forgotten Words.

*New York "World," Feb. 15.*

One looks in vain through the speech of Senator Depew and all the other Republican orators on Lincoln's Birthday for the words of the great President that are most pertinent to this time and its main issue. The World reproduces them—"lest we forget":

"No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle, the sheet-anchor of American republicanism."

"When the white man governs himself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also governs another man, that is more than self-government—that is despotism."

"Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us. Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands, everywhere. Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves, and under a just God cannot long retain it."

Thus spoke Lincoln the Emancipator—a martyr to Liberty.
