# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, February 22, 1900 (v15n08)

## Transcription Notes

This issue was split from Mistral OCR output. The following items were noted:

---

### Article 06 — "The Gospel of Christ Is Not a Command"

- **Location:** Short editorial maxim, page 1
- **Issue:** The word "regilious" appears to be a typo/OCR error for "religious"
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — context makes clear this should read "religious"
- **Transcribed as:** "regilious" (preserving OCR output exactly as it appears in the source)
- **Confidence:** HIGH for intended meaning; LOW for exact original spelling
- **Reason:** The source OCR reads "regilious" — this is likely an OCR error from the original scan. The intended word is "religious" based on context: "this is why the state cannot be regilious without working against Christianity."

### Article 15 — "Change of the Sabbath in Raratonga, Cook Islands"

- **Location:** Title and throughout article
- **Issue:** The island name is spelled "Raratonga" in the OCR source. The correct spelling is "Rarotonga."
- **Transcribed as:** "Raratonga" (preserving exactly as it appears in the source OCR)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — this appears to be the spelling used in the original 1900 publication
- **Reason:** 19th-century publications sometimes used variant spellings of Pacific Island names. The OCR source consistently uses "Raratonga" and this has been preserved.
