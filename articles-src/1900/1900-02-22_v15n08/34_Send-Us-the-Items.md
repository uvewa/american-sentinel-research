WE invite and request our readers everywhere to send us the news of such happenings as fall under their notice, affecting the question of religious liberty in their locality. No matter if it is but a "straw," that is what we want. A mere item often furnishes a telling illustration of an important truth. It is the news from the front that interests the people; and the SENTINEL wants to be, where a sentinel is supposed to be, at the front. But to do this it must echo the words of warning from the human sentinels (that ought to be) in all parts of the field. Then send us the items, please; and they will be better if told in your own words.
