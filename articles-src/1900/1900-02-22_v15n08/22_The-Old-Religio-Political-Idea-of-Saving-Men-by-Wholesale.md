THE old religio-political idea of saving men by wholesale, with its sensational methods, which has been revived by some modern "evangelists" and "reformers," was presented in contrast with the Scriptural idea of saving men by individuals, in a recent sermon by Rev. J. B. Hamilton, a Methodist clergyman of Brooklyn, N. Y. The speaker, among other things, said:—

"Who watched the waning of the great revival movement backed by the whole Christian organization of the City of Churches without chagrin? Leaving out the curiosity-seeking crowd drawn by sensational methods of questionable propriety, this whole city did not furnish an audience equal to that drawn by any one of fifty week-day prayer meetings. Coarse wit, the stage tricks of the buffoon, the airy conceits of individual caprice, combined to disgust a multitude of sensible and sympathetic observers.

"There never has been a silly delusion that has shamed Christianity in the past that cannot be matched to-day in the teachings of the self-styled evangelists. We have boy preachers, girl preachers, cowboy preachers, cyclone evangelists, advocating nonsense that would make a thoughtful schoolboy smile. Men of learning and experience are set aside. The Scriptural method of saving men by the individual, one at a time, is superseded by the modern plan of capturing men by the wholesale."
