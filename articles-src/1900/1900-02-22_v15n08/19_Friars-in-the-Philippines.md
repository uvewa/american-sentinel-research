"If the United States Government attempts by force of arms to reinstate the friars in the possession of their immense property in the country [the Philippines], the people say that they will fight to the last man against such injustice." So writes Rev. Jas. B. Rogers, Presbyterian missionary to the Philippines, to *The Outlook*; and this "very grave danger ahead," he says further, is one to which "Archbishops Ireland and Nozaleda are striving their utmost to blind the people of America."
