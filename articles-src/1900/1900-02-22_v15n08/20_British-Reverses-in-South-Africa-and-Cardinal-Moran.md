DISPATCHES from Sydney, Australia, state that the British reverses in South Africa have produced a great sensation in Sydney, and a Sunday was designated as a day of prayer for victory by the churches in New South Wales and Victoria. Cardinal Moran, of Sydney, was a prominent figure in the movement, and made "a remarkable speech," advocating compulsory military service in Australia.
