A RESOLUTION in behalf of Sunday rest, passed at a recent labor convention, declared the belief of the assembly that "all men should have the privilege of this day, that they may spend it with their families, or as they desire, in rest or in worship."

But the men who are calling for Sunday laws do not intend at all that the workingmen shall be allowed to spend Sunday as they may desire, because, as is evident, they might not desire to spend it as these men think it ought to be spent. The workingmen might find "rest" in recreation, attending or participating in games, or in various worldly amusements; and that would never do; no, indeed. The workingmen are to be allowed to spend Sunday "as they may desire," provided they desire to spend it in attending church or in such other way as will constitute an acknowledgment that Sunday is a sacred day.
