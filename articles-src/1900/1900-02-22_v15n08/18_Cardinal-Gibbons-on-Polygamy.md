CARDINAL GIBBONS, head of the Catholic church in the United States, said in a recent address against polygamy, that if Congress had allowed B. H. Roberts a seat in the national legislature, it "would have been to countenance the degradation of the holiest state of man." This is a confession that the cardinal and all the prelates of his church, all the priests, and the pope himself, are by the doctrine and discipline of that church debarred from the holiest state of man; which is quite the truth.
