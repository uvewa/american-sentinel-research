## Porto Rico Under "Benevolent Assimilation."

The desperate condition of the "common people" of Porto Rico, from the effects of the war, the hurricane, and "benevolent assimilation," is set forth in an appeal to be made to the United States Government by two labor leaders who have recently arrived from that island. The following facts relating to the matter are stated by the Journal, of this city:

"Iglesias and Eduardo Conde, Porto Rican labor leaders, who arrived here from that island a few days ago, have issued an appeal to this Government on behalf of the workingmen of Porto Rico.

"The two delegates, who have established a headquarters at No. 64 East Fourth Street, declare that the working class of their island have been reduced by reason of the war, the hurricane, and the action of this Government since the storm, to a condition of extreme destitution.

"They declare that unless action is taken soon riots will occur throughout the island, as the poor are desperate from their sufferings.

"To get justice, say these delegates, is almost impossible for the poor and the laws practically result in the disfranchisement of the majority of the laborers. Of the 1,000,000 inhabitants 600,000 are absolutely paupers through no fault of their own.

"The workingmen demand a radical change in the government of the island. They ask that the following ordinances of Governor-General Davis be annulled:—

"1. That laborers on the public works shall get no more than twenty-five cents per day for eight hours' work.

"2. That only property holders and taxpayers shall vote, and those who can read and write.

"3. That the payment of $1 shall be paid before a vote is cast.

"4. The workingmen also ask that the ordinance forbidding appeals from the decisions of tribunals be abrogated. They also want a general market for imports, and better schools."

We note also on this subject the following in a leading daily belonging to the political party now dominant in the Government:—

"Dr. Henry K. Carroll, recently special United States Commissioner to Porto Rico, spoke before the Methodist social union of New York Monday evening [February 12] on the nation's duty to that island. Shall we treat it worse than did tyrannical Spain? He thought not, but in his opinion that is the way the majority party in Congress is preparing to deal with the Porto Ricans. Dr. Carroll said:—

"The nation we drove out of Porto Rico for her barbarity gave it open markets to buy and sell in. She allowed manhood suffrage, sixteen full deputies and four senators to the Cortes at Madrid and twelve representatives in the local municipal assemblies. Yet we are considering letting them have but one non-voting delegate in Congress, and even that it is now proposed to take away from them. I can't conceive this plan possible. Let them have free commerce, which means life. Otherwise it is death. Grant them a free government."

"But the answer which the House and Senate Republicans—excepting Mr. McCall, of Massachusetts—are preparing to make to this appeal, is to deny that the Porto Ricans have any rights whatever under the Constitution of the United States; that they are not and cannot become citizens of the United States except by the will of Congress; that they are not entitled to any representation in the government which rules over the island and will not be given any beyond possibly one non-voting delegate; and that they are not entitled to the privilege of free commerce with the nation which has taken them over as a subject people and will not be given such a privilege.

"A situation of great distress, poverty, and lack of employment among the people of the island continues to be reported. The free markets of Spain and Cuba, which even the Spanish tyranny conceded, have been closed, and the American Congress, still chattering loudly about the 'blessings of our free government' that are to be the new heritage of the Spanish islands, proposes to deny the concession of any substitute free markets. It is to insist upon the complete commercial and political subjection of those people.

"The President has said in his message that it is 'our plain duty to abolish all customs tariffs between the United States and Porto Rico.' Dr. Carroll says the President told him two weeks ago that 'he would not back down one inch from his Porto Rico policy, as outlined in his message.' But the Republican majority in Congress plans to ignore this, 'our plain duty,' and we shall see whether any such legislation will encounter a presidential veto.

"It is a question of duty with the President. It is a moral question with Dr. Carroll—this of free trade with the island. It is a practical religious question, says United States Consul Philip C. Hanna, stationed on the island. But it is still more than this with General Roy S. Stone, who quotes from General Miles's proclamation to the islanders on the occasion of his invasion in 1898: 'We have come to bestow upon you the blessings and immunities of the liberal institutions of our Government.' Thus the extension of the American Constitution to the island is a matter also of fulfilling a solemn promise, and General Stone proceeds indignantly to say:—

"'Can we now afford to break our solemn promise to these people at the outset of our rule? Shall we give them three quarters, or some other fraction, of what is due them, and that not as a right, but as a concession which the next Congress may revoke?'

"But for all that, the administration party in Congress is making the most common welfare of the Porto Rican people a consideration subordinate to that of certain protected interests at home; and if the President is resisting this course, the fact is not generally known about the Capitol at Washington."
