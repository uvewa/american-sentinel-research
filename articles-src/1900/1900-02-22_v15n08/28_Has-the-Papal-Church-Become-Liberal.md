## Has the Papal Church Become Liberal?

### THE QUESTION ANSWERED BY POPE LEO HIMSELF.

There can be no better authority upon the question whether the Catholic Church has in this day of the world—as is so generally asserted—become mild and liberal in character, than Pope Leo XIII. From his own words and acts the present character of the church of which he is head, may be fairly and truthfully judged. To this end the following statements and quotations embraced within the pontificate of the present pope, are submitted by Mr. William Burt, D.D., in the N. Y. Christian Advocate:—

"1. Has Leo been any less pretentious than his predecessors? He has allowed himself again and again to be called 'our most holy lord Leo XIII.' He has declared himself to be the supreme ruler of rulers in this world. In his letter of April 21, 1878, after depicting the actual state of society, especially in Italy, in the darkest colors, he declared that the cause of all the evil which afflicts the world is to be found in the refusal to acknowledge the authority of the church which, in the name of God, presides over the destiny of the human race and is the avenger and guardian of every legitimate power.' 'Hence,' he says, 'we shall use our influence to maintain the authority and dignity of the Roman See, and to reclaim the territory and civil power which by right belong to us, for the temporal dominion of the Roman pontiff means the salvation of the human family. By these letters of ours we renew and confirm the declarations and protests which our predecessor, Pius IX, made against the occupation of the Roman states and against the violation of the rights of the Church of Rome.'

"On February 22, 1879, in reply to an address presented to him by Roman Catholic journalists, he said: 'My beloved sons, maintain by your voice and pen the necessity of the temporal sovereignty of the Pope for the free exercise of our supreme power, and demonstrate from history our legitimate right to the same. Let it be known that the affairs of Italy shall never prosper, nor shall there be peace, until provision shall have been made for the dignity of the Roman See and for the liberty of the Pontifex Maximus.'

"To the standing committee of the Catholic convention, meeting at Modena, September 18, 1879, the Pope addressed a brief inciting the people to arise and vindicate the rights of the papacy and restore the temporal power.

"In his encyclical of February 25, 1882, Leo XIII recommended the organization of societies among the young and among the working people and the holding of conventions to agitate the question of the Pope's liberty and of the restoration of the temporal power; to found and maintain everywhere able periodicals, 'such as shall stir up the people on this subject.'

"In reply to the New Year's good wishes expressed to him by the Roman aristocracy he referred to their high, noble, and privileged position when the Pope was king, and exhorted them to cooperate in every way for the restoration of the former dignity and influence of the Holy See.

"On June 5, 1885, the Pope declared that 'the temporal power was absolutely necessary for the free exercise of his authority as the vicar of Christ.'

"In an address to the committee for the centenary celebration of Gregory VII, Leo XIII, praising his illustrious predecessor (who was the incarnation of papal arrogance), expressed the wish that he himself might be able to do as Gregory VII had done.

"In an allocution May 23, 1887, the Pope stated that the only possible condition of peace with Italy was that the pontiff might not be subject to any earthly power.

"In his encyclical of June 20, 1888, he affirmed that all legitimate power is of God, and has been intrusted alone to his vicegerent on earth. Then, taking to himself this authority, he denied to the state the right not to profess the Catholic faith, and condemned liberty of worship, of speech, of the press, and of teaching.

"On September 27, 1888, in an address to the clergy, he said: 'Do not cease to cry aloud that the supreme power which the Pope has by divine right cannot be subject to any power on earth.' In a letter of thanks to the president of the republic of Ecuador, dated January 30, 1889, Leo XIII congratulated the president because, by a special treaty, the republic had been placed under the protection of the vicar of Christ. (It is the constant aim of the Vatican to reduce all nations and peoples to the political, intellectual, and moral level of the republic of Ecuador).

"In a letter of May 22, 1898, Leo XIII praised Cardinal Ferrari and the work done in his diocese, though he knew him to be the leader in a rebellion against civil law and the chief instigator of the Milan revolt.

"On August 1, 1898, in an address to the people and to the clergy of Italy, the Pope protested against the suppression of certain Roman Catholic papers, associations, and committees, all of which he knew to be revolutionary. Has any Pope ever pretended more than Leo XIII? Is there one encyclical, brief, letter, or address which demonstrates that he is any more liberal than Innocent III or Gregory VII, his 'illustrious' predecessors? . . .

## HIS WORK FOR THE SPREAD OF IDOLATRY

"On several occasions Leo XIII has published poem prayers addressed to the 'most blessed' virgin. In a letter to the bishops of Italy, Sept. 20, 1887, we read: 'It is well known to you how much confidence, in these calamitous times, we place in the glorious virgin of the rosary for the salvation and prosperity of Christians and for the peace of the church. At other times we have reminded you of the magnificent triumphs won over the Albigenses and other powerful enemies of the Catholic Church, glories and triumphs which resulted not only in profit to the church, but also in temporal prosperity to peoples and nations. Why could not these marvels be renewed in our days through the power and goodness of the mighty virgin? In order, therefore, to render more propitious this most powerful queen of heaven we intend to honor her more through the invocation of the rosary. Hence to increase the worship of the holy virgin we decree, beginning with this year, that the solemnity of the rosary be elevated to the second class, and we beseech all that, while making sweet violence to the heart of this mighty virgin, they pray for the exaltation of the church and of the apostolic see, and for the liberty of the vicar of Christ on earth.'

"On Aug. 15, 1889, the Pope called on all Catholics to invoke the protection of St. Joseph and of the Virgin Mary, because of the present troublesome times, and ordered that the feast of St. Joseph be celebrated throughout the Catholic world.

"In an encyclical addressed to the clergy and people of Italy, Oct. 15, 1890, complaining of the atheistic spirit manifested in the proposed law in favor of civil marriage and in the monument unveiled to Giordano Bruno, the Pope recommended all 'to have as mediator before God the most glorious Virgin Mary, the never vanquished queen of the rosary, who has infinite power over the infernal hosts, and who has often expressed her special affection for Italy.'

"On July 21, 1891, the Pope constituted by decree the Virgin Mary heavenly patron of the free states of the Congo, and in an encyclical of Sept. 23, 1891, he said that the blessed Virgin was the 'remedy for all earthly ills.'

"In his apostolic letter of April 14, 1895, addressed to the English people, the Pope offers a prayer to the virgin for the conversion of England.

"A little later the Pope wrote a letter to the Coptics, inviting them to intimate union with the Church of Rome, and exhorting them to pray to the Virgin Mary and the sacred family. In May, 1896, the Pope composed a poem to the virgin, in which he recorded the triumphs won by the church over the Albigenses in France and over the Turks at Lepanto, through the recitation of the rosary.

"Thus led on by Leo XIII, the ignorant clergy have precipitated the more ignorant and superstitious people into fetish idolatry."
