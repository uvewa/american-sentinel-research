## Some Past "Traitors."

"There were giants in those days," is the saying. There were also traitors. The fact that Lincoln was a "traitor" in the Mexican war has been proved by his recorded utterances in Congress. Daniel Webster was another, for in September, 1847, at a Massachusetts whig convention in Boston, Webster said:—

"We are, in my opinion, in a most unnecessary and, therefore, unjustifiable war.

"I say at once that unless the President shall make out a case that the war is prosecuted for no purpose of acquisition of dominion, for no purpose not connected with the safety of the Union, then the whigs ought not to grant any further supplies."

The whigs of that day—and they were the fore-runners of the republican party—were terrible traitors. The whig state convention of New Hampshire, on November 6, 1847, resolved:—

"As citizens of a free country, we claim and shall exercise the right at all times of expressing our opinions of the acts, whether of the state or the national administration, and whether these acts relate to war or peace. And we regard the attempt of the President of the United States in his last message to brand as traitors all citizens of the republic who do not yield a blind obedience to his will and approve his conduct in the unconstitutional commencement of the present war with Mexico as an insult to freemen."

Down in Kentucky, Henry Clay, in that same year, drew resolutions for a mass-meeting which denounced the war as having been brought on by deceit and unrighteousness. But why go on with this awful narrative? Every one in that day who was not a democrat, seems to have been what Mr. Cushman has called Senator Hoar—a traitor.—Springfield Republican.
