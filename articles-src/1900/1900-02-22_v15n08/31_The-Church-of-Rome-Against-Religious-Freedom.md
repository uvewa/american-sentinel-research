## The Church of Rome Against Religious Freedom.

The church of Rome does not believe in liberty of thought. Some apologists for that church say that she has been slandered—that she does believe in such liberty; but she herself boldly asserts even at this day that she does not. And as an illustration of this we cite the following paragraphs from a discourse by a Jesuit, Rev. S. Rockwell, who is a professor of rhetoric in Boston College. The discourse was on "The necessity of authority in religious matters as opposed to liberty of thought," and was printed in the *Boston Daily Globe*, of February 12:—

"We are living in the midst of a perfect chaos of opinion; there are almost as many views about our duty as there are human beings, and our ears fairly tingle with the constant talk of liberty of thought. Liberty, God-given liberty, unfettered liberty, personal rectitude, faith through experience, individualism—all these sounds are ringing continually in our ears, and some come to think that they must be right. It is called 'individualism' as opposed to religious absolution.

"The Catholic Church repudiates this liberty of thought, and as the cry is so popular and so widespread, it is of importance that Catholics should understand just what our faith rests upon, and what is meant by authority and why we reject liberty of thought.

"'God is all-wise and all-truthful, and if he speaks he cannot therefore make any mistake or tell a lie. We maintain that he has given revelation through Christ, the God-man, who confirmed his divinity and his divine commission by the miracles he wrought.

"We rest on faith in God's Word; that is the first step, the foundation. The second step is this: We maintain that Christ wished his teachings to be taught to the end of time. If they change they cease to be his teachings, but rather somebody else's. He is unchanged. He founded a church with which he promised to abide forever, preserving her from error. This is the doctrine of infallibility and unity.

"The Catholic Church has an infallible teaching authority, resting on the commission of Christ himself. Now this position of the church has never been refuted, and to-day all the talk against the authority of the church is a mere rhetorical flourish, in favor of liberty without reasons, without proof. A gesture and an apostrophe to liberty are not enough to prove one's position. You must take up the Catholic Church's position and handle her proofs one by one and show their falsity. It cannot, never has, and never will be done. The stronghold of the church is "authority," the enemy is liberty of thought, or "individualism," as some call it."

"All the mischief in the moral world to-day, all the havoc in social and domestic life, all the confusion of thought and opinion are due to an exaggerated idea and to a false application of liberty.

"The Catholic Church teaches that our Lord Jesus Christ is really, truly, and substantially in the eucharist. The non-Catholic or Protestant sects deny this, and charge the church with idolatry. In truth, one of the two must be false. But a religion which is wrong even in only one point, cannot be the true one. Therefore it is simply impossible that Catholicity and Protestantism should both be true. Sanctity can never be attained in repudiating dogma and tradition, or in tearing the creed to tatters. It can only be had in chastising the body, in refraining from things, in purifying the heart, so that it may be the worthy abiding place of the blessed Lord in holy communion."

The Catholic claim that the church of Rome has an "infallible teaching authority, resting on the commission of Christ himself," which claim "cannot, never has, and never will be, refuted," is very easily refuted by the Scriptures, as it often has been and often will be refuted. The Catholic Church wants unity in religion by the suppression of thought; the Protestant wants unity by the exercise of thought. The Catholic wants supreme religious authority vested in a fallible, mortal man: the Protestant wants such authority vested only in God. The Catholic goes to the pope, the prelate, the priest, to be taught his religious duty; the Protestant goes to God, to be taught by the Holy Spirit. The Protestant does not claim that his own judgment is a safe or proper religious guide, and this is just why he rejects the guidance of the pope, the prelate and the church "fathers," because all these were and are only mortal, fallible men like himself.

No man is invested with a new element of character by being chosen to office, even to the office of the pope; nor does he by such elevation acquire any more knowledge than he had before. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him." "The Holy Ghost, . . . he shall guide you into all truth." The Protestant is satisfied with God as his teacher and the Holy Spirit as his guide; and his satisfaction is not at all diminished by noting what has been the history of the men and the nations which have been led by the church of Rome.

Salvation, by faith, as opposed to salvation by works, means liberty of thought as opposed to that submission of the intellect to merely human authority demanded by the papal church.
