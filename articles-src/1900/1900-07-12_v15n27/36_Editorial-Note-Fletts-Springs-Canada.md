A Seventh-day Adventist woman at Fletts Springs, Saskatchewan, Canada, whose husband was away from home, did about an hour's work on a recent Sunday upon a wheat-field fence, and was a few days thereafter served with a copy of the Provincial Sunday law. The penalty for Sunday work in that province is "a fine not to exceed $100" and costs of prosecution.
