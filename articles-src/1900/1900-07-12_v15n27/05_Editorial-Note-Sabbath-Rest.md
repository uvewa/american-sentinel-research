The essential feature of the Sabbath institution is rest. God rested on the seventh day, and blessed the day and sanctified it; but he blessed the day "because that in it he had rested from all his work." The Sabbath is a religious institution, and rest from work is its essential feature. Hence the rest that is enjoined on the Sabbath day has a religious significance; it is a religious act. And because it is such no human power has any rightful authority to require it of the people.
