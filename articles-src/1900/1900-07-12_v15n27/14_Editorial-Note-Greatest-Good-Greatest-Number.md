"The greatest good to the greatest number" is sometimes urged in defense of laws which trench upon personal rights, such as Sunday statutes. But the plea is sophistical. The same logic would justify the confiscation of the wealth of the few for the good of the many. It would justify even the hold-up gang, who, for the "good" of several, rob the individual. But suppose the principle were to prevail in such matters, what then? Neither the life nor the property of any one would be safe. In like manner let the doctrine be generally accepted that the rights of the minority may be invaded for the good of the majority, and no one is secure in his rights.
