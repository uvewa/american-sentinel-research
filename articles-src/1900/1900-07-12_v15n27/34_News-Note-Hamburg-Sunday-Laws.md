A Presbyterian clergyman at Hamburg, Ia., where the question of enacting a Sunday closing ordinance is being agitated, says in a Hamburg paper that "Columns might be filled with quotations from the founders of our nation—from Washington, Franklin, Adams, Jefferson and many others, exhorting our people to enact, keep, and enforce such laws" (Sunday laws).

Not one of these many alleged quotations was cited, for the very good reason that not a line has come down to us from any of these founders of our nation favoring Sunday laws, while on the contrary Jefferson and Madison gave especial emphasis in their writings to the necessity of keeping religion and the state entirely separate, and throughout their career as American statesmen took special pains to guard against any step in the direction of a return to the entanglement of church and state affairs, from which the nation had cut loose.

Yet men who profess to be the ambassadors of the God of truth will stand before the people and say that "columns might be filled with quotations" from these men, favoring Sunday laws. Is it any wonder that infidelity in the United States finds plenty of material upon which to feed?
