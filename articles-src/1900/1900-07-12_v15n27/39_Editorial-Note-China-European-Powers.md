Who but the great powers of Europe can be really to blame for the terrible situation that exists to-day in China? There can, of course, be no possible justification for the fiendish work of the "Boxers"; but what other feeling than one of intense resentment against the foreigners could be excited by the manifest intention of the powers of Europe to appropriate the country and divide it up among themselves with no more regard to the inhabitants—their claims, their interests, feelings, and wishes in the matter—than as if they were the "cattle upon a thousand hills"? The powers which have been so coolly proceeding with this selfish program should have known that only an intense hatred of the foreigner by the Chinese could be the result, and that only such deeds as have been reported could be expected from a barbarian people thus aroused to fury.
