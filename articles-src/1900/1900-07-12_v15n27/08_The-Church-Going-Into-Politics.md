Cable news from London relative to the world's convention of Christian Endeavor to be held there this month, states that "Christian citizenship as a live power in American politics will be advocated by the Rev. Chas. M. Sheldon of Topeka, Kans." Mr. Sheldon is quoted as saying to a newspaper correspondent:

"There has never been a more favorable time than the present for the forces of Christianity to assert themselves in the realm of practical politics. I see there a promising field for the effort to throw open not only municipal affairs but state and national government as well. The support of the best individuals is bound to be coincident with the support of the best policies.

"Christian Endeavorers, as representing the youngest and most energetic workers in the religious world, must familiarize themselves with the ways and means politicians employ, and use them for the ends of good government. There is no question that the balance of power in many communities can be wielded by God's church army as soon as it realizes its strength."

The Rev. Mr. Sheldon seems to have forgotten, or never to have learned, the teaching of early church history upon this point. In the history of the early Christian church it is plainly set forth that the church, as it grew and prospered, arrived at a period when her leaders saw a most favorable time "for the forces of Christianity to unite themselves in the realm of practical politics." And they did it. An arrangement was made with the emperor whereby the will of the church was embodied in the law of the realm; the church, in return for this great opportunity to advance the kingdom of God, merely giving her influence to secure the emperor in his seat of power. What could be more proper or fortunate for the Christian cause? The mould of Christianity was put upon all the realm through Christian laws, and of course an emperor who would thus favor Christianity ought by all means to be retained in power, and could most properly be given all the support the church could possibly command, just as now the political party which would enact Christian laws in the United States would deserve the full support of the Christian Endeavorers and all other Christian bodies here. That was "practical politics" for that time.

But somehow the expected good that was to come from this great stroke of joining Christianity with politics failed to materialize. The church began to receive the mould of the state, but the state failed to receive the mould of Christianity. The spirit of politics and with it the methods of politics came more and more into the church, and the church became more and more conformed to the world. The church had gone into politics to uplift the world, but instead of pulling the world up, had simply pulled herself down to the world's level. The result was the full development of the papacy, and the long night of the Dark Ages.

Now again we are told by a leader in the Christian church that "Christian Endeavorers * * * must familiarize themselves with the ways and means politicians employ, and use them for the ends of good government." Now, candidly, in the light of Christianity and in the light of history, will it be a good thing for Christian Endeavorers or any other Christians to "familiarize themselves with the ways and means politicians employ"? What is to be gained for the cause of Christianity through its adherents becoming familiar with bribery, intimidation, lying, wire-pulling and hypocrisy, as practiced by the successful politician? What is to be gained for the cause of good by the study of evil? The "ways and means" employed by the politicians to-day are ways that will surely corrupt the principles of righteousness. The study of them and the practice of them by Christian Endeavorers and others in the church will surely bring a flood of politics into the church, and produce an image of the papacy, just as the first union of the church with politics produced the papacy itself. The Christian church cannot open her doors to politics to save sinners, any more than the ship at sea can save the man lost overboard by taking in the ocean with him. He might be drawn into the ship with the mrush of water, but the ship itself would be sent to the bottom. Many a godly church has been swamped by worldliness, through the mistaken idea that salvation can come to the world through that which is of the world.

The Rev. Mr. Sheldon has not hit upon anything new in his idea of having "the forces of Christianity assert themselves in the realm of practical politics." That is an old experiment, and anyone may read of the many trials given it from Constantine's day down to our own century, with the results that have followed. Would that Mr. Sheldon and the Christian Endeavorers might read history more carefully upon this point before proceeding further with their church-political program.
