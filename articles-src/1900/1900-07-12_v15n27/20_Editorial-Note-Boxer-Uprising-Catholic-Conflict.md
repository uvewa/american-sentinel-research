Prof. Isaac T. Headland, of Pekin University, China, says the present Boxer uprising began with trouble between the natives and Roman Catholic converts. The Catholics having the aid of priests learned in Chinese law, usually got the better of their antagonists before the authorities and secured advantages which aroused the jealousy of the Chinese to a high pitch. The two parties came into open conflict, and on some occasions several Chinese were killed. Out of this grew the present effort of the Boxers to get rid of the foreigners altogether.
