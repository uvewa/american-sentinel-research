The story is told by a contributor to the Sunday-school Times of a Chinaman who, being converted to Christianity, refused to keep his shop open on Sunday, despite the danger incurred from anti-foreign sympathizers. Some ferocious soldiers demanded admittance and were refused; but, instead of wrecking the store, as was expected, they retired, remarking that as the man appeared conscientious in his belief—which he had explained to them—they would not molest him. Surprised at his escape from the threatened danger a friend asked the newly made Christian how it was that no harm had befallen him, and the answer was: "The God whom I serve protects his children." And yet we are told by the advocates of Sunday sacredness in this country, that "the Sabbath" cannot be preserved without the aid of civil law!
