"Bishop Cranston, at least, possesses the virtue of frankness," remarks the Chicago Israelite, "and says right out in open meeting what less candid parsons think, and what they have always tried and are now trying to accomplish. The heathen Chinee must be made true and intelligent Christians, no matter how much blood it may cost. This is not precisely the doctrine taught by him who preached peace on earth and good-will to man, but it is exactly the practice of Christianity whenever and wherever it has the power to enforce its will."

The sad part of it all is that such things are said and done in the name of Christianity. But even the Israelite admits that "this is not precisely the doctrine taught by Him who preached peace on earth and good-will to men." And why cannot all men, both Jews and Gentiles, see that what He taught is Christianity, and that anything contrary thereto is no part of Christianity?

The Scriptures themselves foretold a great apostasy from the truths of the gospel, and the Saviour said: "The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service." John 16:2. Certainly, in view of these facts, nobody ought to say that Christianity is responsible for the deeds of Rome or even for the words attributed to Bishop Cranston.

"Roman Catholicism did not regard the Huguenots as 'true and intelligent Christians,' so they acted upon the identical proposition which Bishop Cranston now advances, and St. Bartholomew is on record to teach us how to inculcate a religion of love," bitterly remarks the Israelite. "The Protestants did as well by their Catholic brethren, and even to each other, when powerful enough to do so, and both treated the Jews according to the gentle Bishop's recipe—to say nothing of other heathens, barbarians, infidels, heretics, atheists, and similar dogs of unbelievers. The Bishop's readiness to break all the treaties ever made is also more in keeping with the practice than with the doctrine of his religion. Such a procedure would, no doubt, inspire great confidence in the good faith of the would-be teachers of heathens, who must be saved from soul destroying errors of their own belief and, likewise, from the bigotry of Russian Christianity."

The conclusion reached by the Israelite is that "Bishop Cranston is more anxious to make Methodists than Christians of the Chinamen, and that accounts for his willingness to spend unlimited blood and money—other people's—to accomplish that end. Christ or Cranston—which one of them is the Christian?"

There may be more truth in this conclusion than even the Bishop realizes. Intolerance, like hope, "springs eternal in the human breast." Even the mild John joined with James in the request to the Savoiur that he call down fire from heaven to consume certain Samaritans because they received not the Lord. And too many to-day, forgetful of the Lord's rebuke to his ardent but misguided disciples, cherish the same spirit, and utter the same evil sentiment, thus misrepresenting Christianity.

"To listen to men like Cranston and his ilk one would be led to believe that Protestantism and Christianity are synonymous," says the writer in the Israelite. "It is rather amusing to see a small faction of Christianity disown the great majority of that faith. Roman and Greek Catholicism are professed by an innumerable greater number of followers than is Protestantism. Yet the latter minority condemns the majority to outer darkness. What Christianity really is must be inferred from its predominant branch, especially when the predominance is so great. Judged by this standard, which is the only fair one, the peoples of Roman Catholic countries will give a fair idea of what that religion does for those whom its influence has moulded."

But this conclusion as to how we must judge of what Christianity really is, is utterly illogical. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States must be judged not by the words and acts of the advocates of military imperialism, even though they should in the end be fully sustained by a majority of the people and by the Supreme Court, but by the evident and expressed intentions of the authors of those great charters of American liberty. So, Christianity is not Roman nor Greek Catholicism, nor even Protestantism, or yet Methodism—it is what our Lord Jesus Christ did and taught; and all the world can never make it anything short of that.
