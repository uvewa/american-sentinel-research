In a recent speech at Exeter Hall, London, Lord Salisbury, touching upon the present troubles in China, said he wished the missionaries would not get themselves martyred, or if this was inevitable, that they would get martyred as quickly as possible. The English premier very properly regards it a misfortune that the martyrdom of Christian missionaries should result in serious international complications. Certainly the Author of Christianity never designed that such should be the case.
