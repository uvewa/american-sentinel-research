"Are we preparing the way for the coming of the King?" asks Mr. Dawson. "Think of the evils abroad in the land, and ask, 'Am I doing my part as a Christian patriot?'" Drunkenness, gambling and debauchery blot this fair land, defiling its young manhood and destroying its womanhood. Young people can do much to hasten the day when these things shall be no more. 'The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord,' is the hope for this and every other nation. Let us show our true loyalty by abstaining from evil, and be baptized with the spirit of Christian patriotism. For

"Breathes there a man with soul so dead
Who never to himself hath said:
This is my own, my native land?
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned
As home his footsteps he hath turned
From wandering on a foreign strand?"

What do Christian men mean by such appeals—by such a mingling of the sacred and the common? Patriotism is love of country. The Chinaman may be just as patriotic as the American. Indeed the Chinese are so devoted to their country that no self-denial is too great for them to make during life, that after death their bodies may be carried back to final sepulcher in their own beloved China.

It is "Christian patriotism" of the very kind advocated by Mr. Dawson that has made Europe an armed camp, and filled her harbors, not with peaceful merchantmen, but with floating forts bristling with engines of destruction.

The world needs to-day not more love of country—which is only another name for selfishness—but more love of souls. It is sad to see "drunkenness, gambling and debauchery blot this fair land, defiling its young manhood and destroying its womanhood," but no appeal to love of country will ever stop the inroads of sin. The heart of the moral leper may swell within him at the thought: "This is my own, my native land." The Deist may be just as patriotic as the Christian; but only the latter can feel and exhibit in his life an unselfish love for souls for whom Christ died.

The rulers of the world to-day are busy stimulating "patriotism." The thrones of earth are dependent upon it. In America it means one thing; in Russia another. Patriotism is not a virtue per se. Only three years since, patriotism—love of his country—caused General Weyler to issue his infamous reconcentrado order in Cuba. It is patriotism, love of country, that animates the Chinese Boxers to-day. Patriotism is well enough in its place. It is a conservative and preservative force which the world doubtless needs in some measure, but let us not mistake it for Christianity, nor make of it an idol. Fetishism is no part of Christianity.
