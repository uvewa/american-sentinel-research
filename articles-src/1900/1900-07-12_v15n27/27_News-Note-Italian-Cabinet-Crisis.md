Commenting upon the late cabinet crisis, the Catholic Standard and Times says:

"There is, seemingly, but one course open to the unfortunate Italian monarchy. It may have to 'go to Canossa,' as Bismarck had, and seek a reconciliation with the Papacy. The Catholics of Italy hold the key of the position, and they are seemingly the only force that now stands between monarchy and anarchy. We may have stirring events in the peninsula before the world is many months older."

And what is true of Italy is true in large measure in every civilized country under heaven. The Catholics "hold the key of the position"—that is the balance of power—not only in Italy and Germany, but everywhere, and nowhere more fully than in the United States.
