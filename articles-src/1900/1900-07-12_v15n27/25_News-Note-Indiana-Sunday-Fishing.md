The state fish commissioner of Indiana is a clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Sweeney; nevertheless it is allowable, by his permission, to catch fish on Sunday when that is the first day following the last day of the prohibited season, which in Indiana is from March 31 to July 1. Mr. Sweeney says that a good deal should be forgiven a fisherman who has restrained his strongest desire for two months.
