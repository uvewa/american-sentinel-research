The past year's growth in Christian endeavor, according to Secretary Baer, has been remarkable. More societies have been added to the rolls during the last 12 months than for several years. There are now 59,712 Christian Endeavor societies in the world, with a total membership of 3,500,000. Every single nation in the world is represented. There are three thriving societies in the Philippines. The treasurer's report showed the finances in good condition. The total receipts were $11,263, and the total expenses $11,413.
