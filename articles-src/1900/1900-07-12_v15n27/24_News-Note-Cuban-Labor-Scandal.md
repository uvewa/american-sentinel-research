A Washington, D. C., telegram dated July 1 states that "Another Cuban scandal has just come to light through reports to army officers received at the war department. Thousands of poor laborers," says the dispatch, "have been at the mercy of the money sharks, who through the favoritism of the civil administration have been permitted to buy up the time checks of the workmen." By this means these "money sharks" were "enabled to have the full pay of the common laborers turned over to them. The war department has ordered that an immediate stop be put to the practice." And thus the unsavory record goes on.
