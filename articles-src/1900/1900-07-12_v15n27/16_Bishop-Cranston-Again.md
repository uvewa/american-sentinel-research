Two weeks ago reference was made in these columns to sentiment attributed to Bishop Cranston, in a sermon delivered in Denver, June 17. According to newspaper reports, the Bishop, after expressing the opinion that civilized nations ought to rule in China, said:

"It is worth any cost in money, it is worth any cost in bloodshed if we can make the millions of Chinese true and intelligent Christians. I would cut all the red tape in the world, and break all the treaties ever made to place the armies of the United States in the fore next to Great Britain. We must not be the tail end of everything. The open door must be maintained for Christianity as well as commerce, and the bigotry of Russia, which now shows so strongly in the events taking place in China, must not be allowed to interfere with the progress of humanity, civilization, and religion."

To the credit of Christianity be it said that the protests against the Bishop's sanguinary sentiments have been neither few nor feeble. Among the briefest and best, however, is this from Rev. George Bedell Vosburgh, pastor of the First Baptist church, of Denver:

"Is it worth any cost of money or bloodshed to the United States to force Christianity upon China?

"Irrespective of the opinion of Bishop Cranston, or of anybody else, I should say 'No,' and emphatically 'No.'

"You cannot force Christianity upon any nation nor upon any people nor individual. You may force ecclesiasticism, an ecclesiastical system, upon a people or individual, but you cannot force Christianity.

"A Christian is a person who makes a free, deliberate and decided choice of Christ as his personal Savior. A man who accepts the ecclesiastical system of Christianity through force can never be at heart a true and intelligent Christian.

"Ecclesiasticism has frequently been forced upon a people by stress of arms, and has always resulted disastrously. Any return to such a means of conversion would be a return to the barbaric methods of the middle ages.

"The question is at once absurd and abhorrent. No Christian will ever take the sword to compel any people or peoples in matters of faith, and no man, not even a heathen, with a particle of manhood in him, would be so compelled.

"Christianity will conquer, but it will conquer the world as the sun of spring conquers the frosts of winter—by the power of sunshine and love."

This is sound, as to the principles involved, though we cannot share Mr. Vosburgh's confidence that Christianity will conquer the world in the sense which he probably contemplates. It is doubtful if genuine Christianity is holding its own in Christian lands. Moreover, the Scriptures do not teach the conversion of the world and a thousand years of peace before the second advent of Christ. According to the Bible the last days are to be days of commotion, strife, bloodshed and great wickedness, even among those professing godliness.
