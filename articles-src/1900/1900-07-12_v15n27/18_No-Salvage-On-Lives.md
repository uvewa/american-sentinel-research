Thomas Hood told the truth when he said that bread was dear and flesh and blood cheap. The New York tug captains put it in another way when they refused to devote themselves to rescuing perishing creatures on the burning steamships at Hoboken.

"There is no salvage on lives," they exclaimed, and worked with mercenary enthusiasm toward saving merchandise while hundreds of people burned or drowned almost within arm's length.

It is not pessimism, but plain truth, to say that the episode was largely characteristic of the materialism which pervades our so-called advanced civilization. Under the thin veneer of education and religion the primeval man still exists.

The struggle for existence no longer takes the form of murderous combats over food. It is a competition for food's equivalent—money. And no skin-clad, cave-dwelling men of the stone age ever fought more desperately over the carcass of a goat than do their enlightened descendants over the pile of money which represents the necessities and comforts of life.

Fortunately the battles of today are usually—though not always—intellectual rather than physical. The modern troglodyte does not attack his neighbor with a club and wrest from him the spoils of the chase. His weapons are cunning, dissimulation and legal machinery.

But on occasion, as we have seen exemplified at Hoboken, the prehistoric man, breaking through his veneer, shows his contempt for human life as compared with material considerations. He harks back to the stone age and hunts his dinner at the cost of his neighbor's life.

"There is no salvage on lives." A fire engine will run over and kill or maim people in its haste to save not life, but property. Firemen themselves sacrifice their lives that piles of brick and stones filled with merchandise may not burn. Firemen can be replaced without cost. Buildings and merchandise are expensive.

It is so in all the activities of human life. Men are cheap; there is no salvage on them. The New York tug captains merely declared with brutal bluntness what is exemplified in one form or another a thousand times a day in every city in every land under the sun.
