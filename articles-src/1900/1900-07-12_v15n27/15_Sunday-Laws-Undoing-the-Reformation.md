Some years ago the National Reform party, the father of all the religious organizations now calling for Sunday enforcement in the United States, expressed a desire for union with Rome in the interests of "Christian" legislation. They said:

"We may be subjected to some rebuffs in our first proffers, and the time has not yet come when the Roman church will consent to strike hands with other churches as such; but the time has come to make repeated advances, and gladly to accept cooperation in any form in which they may be willing to exhibit it. It is one of the necessities of the situation."

And also:

"Whenever they [the Catholics] are willing to cooperate in resisting the progress of political atheism, we will gladly join hands with them."

These utterances of course came to the notice of the Catholics, and in due time came the Catholic reply, given at a congress of leading Catholics, as follows:

"There are many Christian issues in which the Catholics could come together with non-Catholics and shape civil legislation for the public good. In spite of rebuff and injustice and overreaching zealotry, we should seek an alliance with non-Catholics for proper Sunday observance."

This leaves no doubt of the willingness of the Catholics to join hands with the Protestants for the promotion of Sunday observance. When the time is ripe for the union this willingness will be openly shown. Both sides anticipate some rebuffs, because Protestants in general are not as ready as are the National Reform party to strike hands with Rome, and Rome must proceed cautiously and not seem too desirous of Sunday legislation, lest Protestants become suspicious and withdraw their hands from the movement. But Catholic leaders have been, from that time to this, speaking in favor of enforced Sunday observance, standing apparently on the same ground as that taken by Protestant advocates of Sunday laws, notwithstanding the Sunday observance allowed and approved by the Catholic church admits of practices which would not be tolerated by the Puritans. It is well known that the Catholic church places Sunday on a level with other feast days which rest upon her authority, and does not enjoin that strict observance of the day which is deemed essential by Protestants who base Sunday keeping upon the fourth commandment. Other church days are of equal importance with Sunday in the Catholic view, yet it is of Sunday observance that the Catholic church has most to say at the present time.

At the Sunday Rest Congress held in Chicago the year of the World's Fair, a prominent part was taken by Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland, and the pleas then made by these prelates for Sunday observance are quoted in leaflets sent broadcast through the country by Protestant "Sabbath associations." And Catholic spokesmen have not receded since from this position of warm support of Sunday laws.

What then must result from the continued and increasing efforts that are being put forth by the various church organizations for a legal Sunday? Is it not plain that the Protestant and the Catholic churches must be drawn together and become finally united upon this point? Sunday observance and its enforcement by law is becoming more and more a bond of union between Protestantism and Rome.

It was at the point of Sunday observance that the Reformers stopped in their separation from Rome in the sixteenth century. They still retained in their belief and practice a Sabbath resting upon tradition and the authority of the church. To this the Protestant churches have persistently held; and now this very thing has become active as a power to draw the Protestant and Catholic divisions together again, and heal the breach made by the Reformation. But in this the Protestant world is simply being drawn back to Rome, for Rome has not moved at all from the position she has always held.

And thus does Sunday legislation work to undo all that was gained by the Reformation, and place Rome once more in a position of supremacy over the religious world.
