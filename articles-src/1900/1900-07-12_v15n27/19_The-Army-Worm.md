Dispatches from various parts of the country indicate a reappearance of the army worm. It is feared that serious injury to the crops may follow.

Serious injury to the crops always follows the army worm. The larger the army, the more serious the danger to the crops. It was the army worm that destroyed the Greek republics. It consumed all the crops, leaving too little food for the people who raised the crops.

The army and the army worm maintained incessant trouble in the Roman empire, the army precipitating frequent revolutions to eject unpopular rulers and enthrone pets of the army, the army worm consuming the substance of the common people.

Sometimes a variety of the army worm is developed in politics and ravages the moral fiber of a nation. It was the army worm that instigated Louis Napoleon to betray France into a conflict with Germany. It is the army worm that maintains cruel taxes upon the industry of Italy, menacing the kingdom with anarchy and the people with poverty beyond endurance.

It is the army worm that has brought on the gigantic famine of India. To maintain the imperial garrisons and the native troops the people have been taxed to death and have not enough money left to buy the necessaries of life where obtainable.

It is the army worm that has begun eating the vitals of China. Her millions can easily be mobilized into army pests to prey upon the peaceful vocations of the industrious until the empire will be ready to fall to pieces from army worm exhaustion.

It is well to be on our own guard against the army worm.
