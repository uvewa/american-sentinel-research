A Chinese riot belongs to the same class of social phenomena as a South or Central American revolution. The chief difference is that it is usually carried on against a local official or administration, and very rarely against a higher authority. Riots against provincial governments occur about once in twenty-five years, while a widely extended riot directed against the central government does not take place more than once in a century.

It must be remembered that China is not uniform in its population, language and customs. The Chinese from one vast body, and the Manchus, who constitute the ruling classes, are different in every respect. Two centuries and a half have not yet brought about a coalescence of the two nationalities. In his heart the Chinaman proper detests the Manchu, and regards him as a usurper and tyrant. The expression Fan Kwi, or foreign devil, is applied by the conquered race much more frequently to the Manchu than to the European. In fact, its application to the latter enables patriotic Chinamen to express revolutionary sentiments with comparative impunity.

After the Manchurian conquest the conquered population formed by degrees a great secret society, looking forward to the expulsion of their conquerors and the reinstatement of the Mings upon the imperial throne. With characteristic cunning the leaders of the movement disguised their organization as a religious body, and gave it the title of Wan-Kiang, or the Incense-Burners, the burning of incense at that time as to-day being a religious ceremony of universal use. The Wan-Kiang organized and conducted so many riots in the last century that it was finally prohibited by law.

The first edict proving ineffective, subsequent and severer ones were passed under which many terrible prosecutions were conducted by the magistrates. The result was that the Wan-Kiang vanished. Its five grand lodges disappeared, and its very name passed away before the end of the century. But there suddenly sprang up a new organization, known as the Pih-Lien-Kiao, or Water Lily Society. Like its predecessor it had five grand lodges, and a ritual so closely resembling that of the first that many who know the Chinese character feel justified in calling it the same body under another name. This society ran into the present century, and was likewise prohibited by the Council of State. Similar prosecutions were conducted by the magistrates until one fine day the Water Lilies vanished.

Around 1820-1821 a new society organized exactly as the Water Lily appeared in the Empire. This was the famous Triad Society, known in the northern provinces as the Tien-Ti Hwui, in the Middle Provinces as San-Hoh-Hwui, and in the Southern Provinces as Sam-Hop Wui. This is the powerful body whose members, under the name of the Hung League, were the chief actors in the terrible Taiping rebellion, which raged from 1850-1851 to 1865, a rebellion in which anywhere from twenty to thirty millions of human beings were caused to perish. The crushing of the rebellion and the terrible punishment meted out to the rebel survivors kept the Triad for a long time in the background. Not until the seventies did it make any appreciable appearance, and even then it was under many other names besides the one notorious in the ears of the magistrates. In Fuhkien, a rebellious province, it took the name of Ghee-Hin; in northern Kwang Tung of Ghi-Hing; in southern Kwang Tung, in Hunan, Hupeh and Honan of Ko-Lo-Wui or Ko-Lao-Hwui.

In the eighties it began to instigate riots in China, and incidentally to use Hong Kong as a base of supplies. The Peking authorities complained to the British Minister, and the result was the passage of statutes compelling the registration of all Chinese secret societies in the Far Eastern colonies of Great Britain, and finally the prohibition of the Triad.

As might be expected, the prohibition had merely a nominal effect. In 1888, just prior to the prohibition, the number of members of Chinese secret societies, including those of the Triad, in Hong Kong, Singapore and Penang was about equal to the male Chinese population of those three cities, while in 1893, with no Triad society appearing upon the registers, the registration had kept pace with the population, which was thirty per cent. larger than it had been six years before. Between 1891 and the breaking out of the Chinese-Japanese war the Ko-Lo-Wui instigated many riots, more especially in the central and southern provinces. A careful examination of their work showed that they were organized the same as the Triads and the Water Lilies, the only difference being in the nomenclature. Thus the Triad had five grand lodges—viz., Kwang Tung and Kwang Si, Fuhkien, Hupeh and Hunan, Yunnan and Sz'chuen, and Cheh Kiang, Kiang Su and Kiang Si. The five grand lodges covered, therefore, ten of the more important provinces of the Empire. The Ko-Lo-Wui had, and is said to have, five grand lodges—viz., Kwang Si and Kwang Tung, Hunan and Hupeh, Sz'chuen and Yunnan, Kiang Su, Kiang Si and Cheh Kiang, and Anhui and Honan, or eleven provinces. The differences are very significant to any one familiar to Chinese political life. The appearance of Anhui and Honan means that the districts controlled by the so-called literati have joined forces with the older revolutionaries, while the elision of Fuhkien simply means that it has joined the grand lodge of Kwang Si and Kwang Tung.

The Ko-Lo-Wui movement does not seem to have been conducted with the same skill as the Triad. It culminated in a fiasco so pitiable as to be funny. The conspirators, thinking doubtless to profit by the example of Chinese Gordon, hired a group of European mercenaries, who were so addicted to drink that the Chinese government, aided by the English authorities at Hong Kong and Singapore, the Portuguese at Macao, the Spanish at Manila and the Japanese at Yokohama and Nagasaki, had no trouble in suppressing the revolt in the bud. This was followed by the war with Japan in which, to their amazement, the Chinese found themselves utterly routed by a small people who for years they had called "the little brown dwarfs."

The results of the war seemed to have dampened all revolutionary ardor. There were comparatively few disturbances between 1895 and 1899. Those that did occur were piratical or predatory rather than revolutionary. In 1898, toward the close of the year, a new society was registered by the British authorities under the name of I-ho-Chuun and I-ho-Tuun. The name is essentially Mongolian in its significance. I, the first radical, means righteousness or probity, ho, peace or tranquillity and chu'un the clenched hand or the hand in action. The juxtaposition of the three radicals conveys about the same idea as the English phrase the church militant. It is on account of the last syllable or radical that the members of the latest movement have been termed Boxers. * * * The organization is conducted in about the same style as masonry in this country. * * * *

In each lodge or chapter there are grades of membership, and there is a system of representation in the prefectural and provincial lodges and the grand lodge. Orders are carried with remarkable swiftness, owing to the fact that in their membership there is at least a majority of the Imperial Mail carriers, as well as a small army of compradores and boatswains on the many steamers which ply the coast and the larger rivers.

It is from the latter that the rioters obtain their arms and ammunition. While the trade in modern weapons is prohibited by the law of China, and the importation of such goods interdicted, nevertheless every foreign craft is allowed to carry an armory sufficient to repel pirates or to subdue a mutiny, and nearly every China coaster and river boat has an armament of reasonable size. They have drills, and in addition nearly every officer practices regularly so as to be prepared for emergencies. Even the steam launches which are used to communicate with boats in the harbor are often armed, while their European commanders are almost invariably supplied with a revolver. The revolutionaries purchase these weapons from the ships, paying, of course, a very heavy profit to the mariner. He in turn has no difficulty in resupplying himself at Hong Kong and other ports.

In this fashion a steady stream of rifles, repeaters and revolvers is flowing from the Western world into the interior of China. While the amount is small for each boat, yet when it is remembered that there are several hundred boats, and that each boat makes from four to thirty and forty trips a month, the sum total may be and probably is very large.

No matter how well armed the Boxers may be they cannot prove formidable foes to European soldiers. They have no discipline and no officers. Even the Chinese soldiers are fictions of the most pitiable sort. The garrison, consisting nominally of five thousand troops, has actually a thousand or fifteen hundred. On inspection days, when high military officials come from the capital, provincial or national, two thousand workingmen are hired to play the soldier for one day. Their uniform is a red cloak, with a black and white ring target in the back. This with a gun, which may be an ancient Springfield musket or a Martini-Henry, a Winchester or a fowling piece, is all that distinguishes the soldier from the coolie.

While these coolies belong to the secret societies and are employed in the riots, they constitute a miserable and even cowardly mob. All the officers in the Chinese war service are Manchus, with a few foreigners as military instructors. Scarcely one of the two hundred thousand that appear on the nation's roster is a member of these revolutionary bodies. Unless, therefore, the Manchus in whole or in part join the Boxers there is no possibility of the latter offering any very serious resistance to the contingents of the Great Powers.

Nevertheless the Boxers and the Triad Society represent forces which are opposed to modern civilization. While they are patriotic from one point of view they have no lofty ideals and no genuine love of liberty. If they win in the present contest they will organize a government as much unsuited to the modern age as that of the Empress Dowager. It is therefore to be hoped that the Great Powers in putting down these tremendous outbreaks will not make the momentous error of restoring the Empress Dowager to the power she possessed heretofore. What is needed is a protectorate of some sort, which will faithfully and honestly administer the cumbrous legal and political system which is an organic part of the Chinese civilization. The revolt, be it remembered, is directed not against the system, but against the abuses and wrongs committed by those who administer that system. No other system is feasible, and none other would produce good results among the four hundred millions of human beings that constitute the Empire.
