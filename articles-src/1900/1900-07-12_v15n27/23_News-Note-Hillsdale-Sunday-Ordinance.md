A Sunday closing ordinance has been adopted in Hillsdale, Mich. It decrees that no meat markets, groceries, or other business places shall be open on Sundays, save drug stores, and these only between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock a. m. and 6 and 7 o'clock p. m. Livery stables are allowed to be open for "ordinary legitimate business" only. Those persons are exempted who "conscientiously believe in and keep Saturday as the Sabbath." The ordinance was passed without a dissenting vote. Any violation of it is to be punished by fine or imprisonment.
