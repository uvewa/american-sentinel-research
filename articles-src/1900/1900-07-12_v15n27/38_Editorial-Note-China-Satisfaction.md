For the atrocious insult offered to Germany and the United States by the murder of their representatives in China, both these powers have declared that satisfaction will be exacted of the Chinese; and other governments that have been similarly treated are doubtless of the same mind. But if satisfaction is sought by armed force, what will be the cost of obtaining it? This nobody seems to know, or indeed can know, and the outlook promises a terrible war if the attempt to coerce China is made. The mutual distrust and jealousies of the powers over the prospective prizes they see in Chinese trade and territory, is a further element in the problem that adds much to its uncertainty and perplexity.
