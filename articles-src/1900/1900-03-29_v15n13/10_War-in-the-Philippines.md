**War in the Philippines.**

A NEW ENGLAND journal, touching the question of the casualty list on the Filipino side since war began with the United States, says:—

"No official estimate of the number of Filipinos killed and wounded by the Americans since February 4, 1899, is likely to be made public yet awhile, because the figures would shock the country. As a starter, however, it is known that in the first battle around Manila, according to General Otis's official report, the natives lost at least 3,000 men. Since then there has been over a year of warfare, and, according to the Boston Transscript, 500 natives were killed or wounded by one regiment in the single month of January, 1900. It is conservative to say that 20,000 Filipinos have been killed and wounded, while 25,000 would not be an extreme estimate."

This is a larger number than have been killed and wounded on both sides thus far in the South African war, with its months of hard and almost steady fighting and several "pitched battles." Evidently the fighting in the Philippines has been real war.
