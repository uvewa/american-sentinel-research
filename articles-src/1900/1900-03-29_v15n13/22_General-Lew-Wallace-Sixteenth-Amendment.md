GENERAL LEW WALLACE, the well-known American soldier and statesman, proposes the following as a Sixteenth Amendment to the national Constitution:

"ARTICLE XVI.

"SECTION 1. The United States shall not in any manner acquire, hold, maintain, provide for or exercise jurisdiction or sovereignty over any island, territory or country now foreign, except with the consent of the people of the United States first had.

"SECTION 2. In cases of territorial expansion hereafter proposed the will of the people of the United States, required by the foregoing section, shall be determinable at elections, to be provided by Congress, and in every instance the President shall proclaim the result; whereupon, if there be a majority for the proposition, the Constitution shall, from the day of the proclamation, extend to the island, territory or country admitted, and to its inhabitants."
