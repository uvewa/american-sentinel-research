## Labor Troubles in Chicago.

SIGNS are not wanting which show plainly that Chicago is in all probability destined soon to be the scene of serious labor troubles.

There is a growing bitterness between capital and labor here, and both parties to the controversy are actively engaged endeavoring to gain some advantage.

Of course one cannot believe all the reports that are current, but it is said that sales of arms and ammunition usually light during the winter season have been unusually heavy. "In this circumstance," remarks an evening paper, "many persons are beginning to foresee preparations for an outbreak such as preceded the anarchist riots of 1886."

Some dealers attribute these increased sales to the general "good times," while on the other hand attention is called to the fact that the "good times" that have brought about such a demand for weapons and explosives have been felt particularly since the early part of the year, when trouble began to brew between employers and employees in many lines of industry.

Another significant fact is the increased activity of the avowed anarchists. Evidently they are only waiting their opportunity which they expect to find in the gigantic strike, which, judging from all appearances, is very soon to be inaugurated here.

A prominent representative of labor from another State, who visited Chicago a few days since, said in a recent interview: "A spark dropped there [in Chicago] might precipitate a condition for which we do not want to be held responsible. Every nation and every grade is represented. We have not forgotten the 'black road' riots of 1886. Those people are organizing, but we have nothing to do with it."

In short, the whole situation is summed up by a morning paper in these words:—

"Representatives of both sides admit that the situation is critical. They say that no labor trouble in Chicago since the great railroad strike of 1894 has been so widespread or so replete with elements of danger."
