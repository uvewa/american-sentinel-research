A WRITER quoted in the Union Signal makes a plea for the application of Christianity, in the place of the club of law, as a cure for the spreading evil of Mormonism:

"Mormonism constitutes one of the most urgent problems of the day. Utah and the common Mormon people have great possibilities of good; the Mormon system is satanic. The common people are very largely sincere, deluded persons, blinded by priestcraft; yet they have minds, feelings, capabilities, and an endless destiny like our own. They will never be clubbed into a better system. Strong law must be had for lawbreakers; but the real question is that as to whether Christianity's life, light, and love shall replace the dark superstitions of a revived paganism."
