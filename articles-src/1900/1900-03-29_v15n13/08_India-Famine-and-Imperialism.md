The unprecedented extent of the famine in India was officially confirmed the other day by the Earl of Onslow in the British House of Lords, who said "it was without parallel in the history of the country." During the week ending March 3 there were 4,375,000 people receiving government aid to keep them from starvation. There have been many famines in India in the past; but why should the severest of all come when England had ruled the country for over a century? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the imperialistic idea?—Springfield Republican.
