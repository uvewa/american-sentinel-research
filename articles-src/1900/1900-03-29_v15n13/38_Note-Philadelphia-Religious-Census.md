ACCORDING to the returns from the religious census lately taken in Philadelphia, as published in The Independent, out of 239,631 families visited, only twenty-two persons reported themselves as atheists or agnostics. Doubtless Philadelphia contains fewer people of this class proportionately than many sections of the country; yet we are obliged to conclude from these figures that real atheists and agnostics are not numerous anywhere in the United States. A vast number of people do not go to church and seem indifferent about religion; yet they believe in the existence of God. Is the fault theirs? or does it lie at the door of the church?
