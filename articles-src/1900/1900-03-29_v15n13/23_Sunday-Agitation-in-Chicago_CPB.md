## Sunday Agitation in Chicago.

The Sunday agitation in Chicago has reached another stage. A call has been issued by the Illinois Journeymen Barbers' Protective Association, in which the west side boss barbers are to have the use of the rooms of the association, at 118 5th avenue during the afternoon of Sunday, May 6, the west side bosses May 13, the north siders May 20 and the downtown barbers May 27. It is expected that the Sunday-closing proposition will be discussed and a vote taken as to closing shops. If this is decided on the bosses must ballot regarding making the closing permanent or only putting it in force during the summer season."

Business agent J. Lucas of the association, said in a recent interview:

"It is not the intention to enforce the State law as to Sunday closing without due notice to the bosses. The boss barbers of each part of the city shall decide among themselves. There will be a contract that the bosses are expected to sign, and a violation of its terms means a fine of $5 a chair for each offense."

The fact is that the State Sunday law is a mere wreck, and that is the only reason why appeal has not been made to it long ere this to force Sunday observance on all the people because it is desired by a part of the people.

There is nothing in all the catalogue of things claiming to be moral that has less conscience in it than the Sunday agitation. It is true that a great many people have real conscientious convictions concerning Sunday; but there are many more whose convictions are so weak that they are unwilling to risk anything for the sake of those convictions. They will keep Sunday if they can do it without loss, otherwise they will not keep it.

It is sheer nonsense to talk of such service being Sabbath-keeping. It could not be that even were the Sabbath of the fourth commandment observed instead of the Sunday, a day for which there is no divine authority.

He only keeps the Sabbath or any other day, who observes it "unto the Lord;" and he only observes it "unto the Lord" who is willing to sacrifice, if need be, for the sake of keeping it. C. P. B.
