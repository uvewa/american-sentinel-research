# Uncertainties — American Sentinel, March 29, 1900 (v15n13)

## Article 10 — "War in the Philippines."

- **Location:** Page 7, paragraph 1, quoted source name
- **Issue:** The source journal is cited as "Boston Transscript" — this appears to be a typographical error in the original for "Boston Transcript" (a well-known newspaper). The double 's' is preserved exactly as printed per project rules; no correction made.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clear OCR/print error but preserved faithfully.

## Article 15 — "Saloon-Keepers Fined for Sunday Violation."

- **Location:** Page 9, first line
- **Issue:** The OCR renders "have been named $150" which is likely "fined" — the word "named" does not make grammatical sense here. However, this reading is taken directly from the OCR source and may reflect a print or OCR error ("fined" misread as "named"). The text is transcribed as it appears in the OCR source.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes — "named" is almost certainly an OCR error for "fined," as context clearly demands "fined." However, without access to the original printed page, this cannot be confirmed.
- **Confidence:** LOW — transcribed as "named" per OCR source; original almost certainly reads "fined."

## Author Attribution — Article 09 (Prescott)

- **Issue:** Prof. W. W. Prescott is not in the standard known-authors list. His full name appears in the article byline as "PROF. W. W. PRESCOTT." Used author_short "WWP" accordingly.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — explicitly stated in article.

## Page 16 — Back-Page Editorial Notes

- **Issue:** The back page (page 16) contains a series of short editorial paragraphs without individual headings, each beginning with a key word in small caps (THE, IT, SUCH, etc.). These have been split into individual files (31–41) based on their distinct subject matter. The "Bound Volumes" notice at the top of page 16 is an advertisement and has been omitted.
- **Confidence:** HIGH — clear divisions by paragraph and topic.
