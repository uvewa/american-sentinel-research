## Rome Ever the Same.

"Lutheran Witness."

It has already been reported that Justice Brewer, of the United States Supreme Court, said lately in an address, that the two ancient foes, Protestantism and Catholicism, were getting closer together, and that the twentieth century would see their ultimate agreement. If this description of the trend of affairs is true, it is only because Protestantism has become less Protestant. Rome has not changed and will not change. This truth has lately been emphasized by the article which the Jesuit Clarke wrote in the *Fortnightly Review* against the recalcitrant and rationalist Prof. St. George Mivart. The Romish writer says among other things: "In the Catholic Church every dogma is essential and fundamental, and must be believed by every Catholic under pain of eternal damnation. This is the Catholic faith, which unless a man believe faithfully and firmly he cannot be saved; whether any dogma was defined by the Apostles' Creed, or by the Vatican Council, or by one of the long roll of popes speaking in his character of doctor and teacher, of the universal church, makes no difference whatever. It carries with it the same authority, whether it was declared to be a part of the faith in the first century or the nineteenth, and he who refuses to accept it is just as completely an alien from the commonwealth of God in the one case as in the other." Here there is no mincing of words and even the weakest of Protestants should be able to recognize the sign of antichrist.
