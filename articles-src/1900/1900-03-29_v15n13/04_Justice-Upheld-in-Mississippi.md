## Justice Upheld in Mississippi.

**THE CASES OF R. S. OWEN AND ROBERT NASH, ARRESTED FOR BREAKING SUNDAY, PROMPTLY DISMISSED.**

**EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL:** The cases of Josiah Nash and R. S. Owen, for Sunday work, were brought into the Circuit Court at Aberdeen, Miss., March 13. We stated to the court that we had been tried and acquitted before Justice Lantrip, and we requested that the case be thrown out of court. The witnesses were questioned on that point, and testified that this was the same case which had been tried before. On affirming this they were dismissed at once and both cases were discharged.

Trying a case the second time for the same offense after the accused party has been acquitted, is strictly forbidden by the law of Mississippi. A zeal for the law of the land that would thus violate the law of the land, is so evidently inconsistent that its injustice seems to be recognized by all parties; and the effort that has been made in that direction seems now to meet with general disapproval. R. S. Owen.

*Amory, Miss., March 16.*
