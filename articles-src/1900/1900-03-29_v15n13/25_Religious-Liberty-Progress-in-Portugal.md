In Portugal at present religious liberty is making some progress. The laws prohibiting priests, who have renowned their orders, from remaining in the country, excluding Protestants from service in the army, and forbidding public celebration of Protestant services, have been repealed. The Protestant schools are attended by a large number of children, and a state school-inspector has publicly announced a Protestant school to be the best in the country. Many young men are aspiring to become Protestant clergymen. The middle classes especially are said to be affected. Persecution has ceased, and it has been stated by persons wielding a large amount of influence that no Portuguese shall suffer for his religious convictions. There, too, the light seems to be dawning, just as it is dawning in its neighbor country, Spain.—Lutheran Witness.
