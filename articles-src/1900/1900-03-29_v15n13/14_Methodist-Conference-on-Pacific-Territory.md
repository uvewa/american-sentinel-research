"The Philadelphia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church," says a Philadelphia dispatch, "to-day [March 21] unanimously adopted a resolution presented by the Rev. Dr. T. B. Neeley commending the national administration for the acquisition of the territory in the Pacific.

"The Rev. Dr. Lippincott started to make some objection to the phraseology of the resolution, but there were so many cries for him to resume his seat and for a 'vote' that the paper was adopted. The resolution provided that the church take advantage of the providential placing of the islands of the Pacific under control of the United States by forming an expansionist army of 500,000 people who will contribute $1 a year for spreading the gospel in the islands.

"A resolution was also adopted condemning the national administration for the failure to abolish the army canteen and calling upon the President to exercise his authority to suppress the sale of liquor to the soldiers under Government sanction."
