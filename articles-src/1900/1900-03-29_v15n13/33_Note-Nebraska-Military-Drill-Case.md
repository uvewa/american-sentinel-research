SUCH accounts as that published on another page relating to a youth in Nebraska who was expelled from the public school for refusing to participate in military drill, and then arrested and dragged into court as a vicious character, although his deportment as a pupil had been uniformly excellent, are not calculated to cause right-minded people to long for the extension of the military spirit and system in this country. As men lose the love of justice, liberty and peace, however, it is but natural that the opposite spirit should take its place.
