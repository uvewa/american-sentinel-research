## Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln Repudiated.

The following from a press report of recent proceedings in the United States Senate, makes a point that is worthy of note:

"Senator Pettigrew is revenged. It was Mr. Sewell of New Jersey who denounced him as a traitor in the Senate. The other day Mr. Pettigrew innocently began reading some extracts from addresses which he wished to have printed in the Record. The sentiments sounded treasonable, or anarchical, and the Hawleys and Lodges began pricking up their ears. Finally Sewell jumped up. This thing had gone far enough. He objected to such stuff being printed at the expense of the Government. Pettigrew's eye gleamed; his hour had come, and the Senate was informed that the extracts, every one, were taken from the works of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln."
