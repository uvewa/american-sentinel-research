THE Russian government, it is reported, is about to issue a decree for the abandonment of the old-style Julian calendar and the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in its stead, which has long been in use by other civilized nations. There is a difference of twelve days between the two systems of reckoning; nevertheless the change from one to the other will not in any way affect the days of the week, notwithstanding the many and emphatic assertions we have heard that the Sabbath must have been lost at the reforms of the calendar instituted by Julius Caesar and Pope Gregory.
