A bill recently introduced in the Massachusetts legislature aims to repeal the laws against fishing and shooting game in that State on Sundays. A hearing was given on the bill, of which we find this mention in the Springfield Republican of March 21:

"There was a large delegation before the committee of fisheries and game this morning in opposition to the bill of Representative MacCartney to allow Sunday shooting. Rev. M. D. Kneeland of the Sabbath Protective League made the point that the census officials have stated that in three-fifths of the country's area game was being annihilated. Rev. W. H. Albright of Dorchester claimed the workman could get away from work on secular days if he was enough interested. Even if he lost his wages it was no worse than for other people to lose their time. Other speakers were William Shaw, treasurer of the United Society of Christian Endeavor, Representative Robinson of Springfield, and A. B. F. Kenney of Worcester."

What decision, if any, has been reached in the matter we have not yet learned.
