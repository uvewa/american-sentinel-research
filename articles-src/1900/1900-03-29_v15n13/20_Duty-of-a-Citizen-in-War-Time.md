A WRITER in the Catholic Mirror says of the "duty of a citizen in war time," that "The decision of Congress fixes the duty of every American citizen." When Congress has declared war, then "whatever he may think of it" as being right or wrong, he has no "right to refuse his aid in giving it effect."

Such sentiments are not out of place in a Catholic journal, because the Catholic system is altogether different from republicanism, and is based on the principle of submission in all things to human authority. But this is not the doctrine of free government nor of Christianity. Congress does not fix duty for any citizen in the matter of killing people, or in any matter covered by the moral law. The Bible says, "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Congress can neither add to this nor take from it. The commandment says, "Thou shalt not kill;" and to say that any body of men can by a vote make it the duty of men to kill their fellow-men, is to say that man can repeal the law of God; which to the Christian is the height of error, however it may appear to the atheist or the believer in papal claims.

The members of Congress are not chosen to prescribe duty for the people who put them in office. They are chosen to represent the people in the business of government, which in this country is to take such action as is necessary to preserve the rights of the people. The representatives derive all their authority from the people, and the people themselves are their own rulers. The sphere of civil government is the preservation of rights and not the defining or enforcing of moral duties.
