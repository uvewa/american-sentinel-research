SELF-GOVERNMENT is a simple art in itself, but civilization has made of it a complex system, altogether beyond the intellectual grasp of the inferior races. But because these people cannot govern themselves after the American system, we need not conclude they cannot govern themselves in any way. Governments are instituted among men to preserve rights and any people who respect human rights are qualified to make a success of self-government.
