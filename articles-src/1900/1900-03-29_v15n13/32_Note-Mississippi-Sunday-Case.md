THE effort, in Mississippi, to put two seventh-day observers on trial a second time for the same "offense" after they had been acquitted, in the interests of Sunday observance, met with speedy and complete failure. See p. 194. The people of that State do not countenance such an unjust proceeding, and in any other cause it would probably not have been attempted.
