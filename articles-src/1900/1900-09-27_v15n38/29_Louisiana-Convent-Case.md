A LOUISIANA court has given a decision in the case of a girl seventeen years of age who was induced to enter a convent without the consent of her parents, who brought action for her recovery. The decision affirms that the girl is subject to the will of her parents, and can be restored to them under habeas corpus proceedings, even though she were willing and even anxious to remain in the convent, and was subjected to no restraint.
