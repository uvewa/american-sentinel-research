The history of the colonial period of this country reveals the fact that it was settled very largely by men and women who, prior to emigrating from Europe, had suffered persecution for conscience sake.

The pilgrims sought and found in Massachusetts an asylum from the intolerance of the Church of England. "With few exceptions," says Baird, "the first colonists were Protestants; indeed Lord Baltimore's was the only Roman Catholic colony, and even in it the Romanists formed only a small minority long before the Revolution of 1775."

Much credit has been claimed by Roman Catholics for having established in the New World the first colony guaranteeing religious liberty to all of every faith, Protestant not less than Roman Catholic. It is doubtless true that the first Lord Baltimore, the author of the charter of the colony of Maryland, was a liberal-minded man. Reared a Protestant, he became a Catholic after arriving at the estate of manhood. "In an age," says Bancroft, "when religious controversy still continued to be active, and when the increasing divisions among Protestants were spreading a general alarm, his mind sought relief from controversy in the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church."

Calvert's change of faith did not cause a rupture with the king. James cared little whether his people were Protestant or Catholic so long as they respected his authority as king. But Catholics had more than once tasted persecution under the rule of Protestant sovereigns, and it was only natural that Lord Baltimore should desire a charter that would as far as possible guard his coreligionists against Protestant intolerance.

The Episcopal Church was established by law in England. The king was not only a member of that church, but stood at its head. The most that Sir George Calvert could do to secure religious liberty for Roman Catholics was to secure toleration for all who held the Christian faith. For this reason "Christianity was by the charter made the law of the land, but no preference was given to any sect."—Bancroft.

This was far in advance of Virginia, the charter of which, as Baird observes, "enjoined that the mode of worship should conform to that of the established church of England." But it fell very far short of the "absolute religious freedom" of Providence and Rhode Island, and of the equally broad tolerance of the Quakers of Pennsylvania, whose colony was established upon "the principle of unlimited toleration," and which was therefore "a resort for people of all creeds and of none."—Baird.

The Puritans of Massachusetts, the Quakers of Pennsylvania, the Presbyterians and Baptists found in all the colonies, and the Roman Catholics in Maryland had all felt the heavy hand of persecution in the Old World, and all sought to secure for themselves that freedom of conscience which experience had taught them to prize even above civil liberty.

Experience is a hard school, but it teaches principles not so readily learned elsewhere. History records no instance of religious liberty being granted on the motion of the dominant sect. Freedom of conscience has ever been demanded by dissenters from the prevailing faith, and has in general been rather grudgingly conceded by the majority. This is not because the Christian religion is intolerant, but because so few ever completely yield themselves to the benign spirit of Christianity.

Intolerance is due to lack of faith in the overruling providence of God. The bigot is afraid to trust the management of divine affairs to the Divine Being. Like Uzzah, he must needs steady the ark by civil enactments. The Spirit of God will, he fears, fail to subdue hearts unless His operations are re-enforced by civil penalties. On the other hand, the dissenter from the prevailing creed has nothing upon which to lean, nothing in which to trust except the justice of his cause and the power of his God. The result has uniformly been the development of a deeper piety and a more sterling manhood. B.
