## Source
Mistral OCR output from PDF original

## General Notes
- OCR quality was generally good
- Some table formatting in masthead required interpretation
- Page headers and numbers were identified and excluded from article content

## Specific Uncertainties

### Article: "Politics as a Department of Christianity"
- **Issue**: Author signature appears as "JOHN D. BRADLEY" in all caps at end
- **Resolution**: Created author initials as "JDB" following pattern of other authors
- **Confidence**: HIGH - full name explicitly given

### Article: "Love of Liberty vs. Intolerance"
- **Issue**: Author signature appears only as "B." at end
- **Resolution**: Attributed to C. P. Bollman (CPB) based on editorial role and writing style
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM - single initial matches known associate editor

### Article: "Too Busy to Notice Persecution"
- **Issue**: Ends with lowercase "s."
- **Resolution**: Appears to be author initial, left as-is in text; attribution marked as editorial
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM - unclear if signature or abbreviation

### Masthead Table
- **Issue**: Complex table formatting with pipes and dashes in OCR
- **Resolution**: Preserved as close to original formatting as possible
- **Confidence**: HIGH - information clear despite formatting

## Processing Notes
- All short editorial notes from page 1 were split into individual files per instructions
- News, Notes and Comment section items each received their own file
- Advertisement sections (pages 14-15) were not transcribed as they are not substantive articles
- No significant scan quality issues or text obstructions noted
