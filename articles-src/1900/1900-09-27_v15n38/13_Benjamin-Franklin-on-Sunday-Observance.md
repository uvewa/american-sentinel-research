The following, addressed by Benjamin Franklin to some representatives of New England orthodoxy as it was in his time, expresses the view of this great American, noted for his clear discernment and practical good sense, regarding the enforcement of Sunday laws:

"When I traveled in Flanders I thought of your excessively strict observation of Sunday, and that a man could hardly travel on that day among you upon his lawful occasions without hazard of punishment, while where I was every one traveled, if he pleased, or diverted himself in any other way; and in the afternoon both high and low went to the play or opera, where there was plenty of singing and dancing. I looked around for God's judgments, but saw no signs of them. The cities were well built, full of inhabitants; the markets well filled with plenty; people well clothed, fields well tilled, etc., which would almost make one suspect that the Deity is not so angry at that offense as a New England justice.

"If Christian preachers had continued to teach as Christ and his apostles did, without salaries, and as the Quakers now do, I imagine tests would never have existed, for I think they were invented not so much to secure religion itself as the emoluments of it. When a religion is good I conceive that it will support itself, and when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support it, so that its professors are obliged to call for the help of the civil power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.

"When religious people quarrel about religion, or hungry people about their rituals, it looks as if they had not much of either among them."—See "Many-Sided Franklin," by Paul Leicester Ford.
