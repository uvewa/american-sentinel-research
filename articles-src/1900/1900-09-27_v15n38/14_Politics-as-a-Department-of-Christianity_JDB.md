Dr. F. B. Meyer, one of England's most popular evangelists, has just spent a month in this country, during which he attended a large conference of ministers at Northfield, Mass. He is reported as saying on his return to London that "the widespread inclination manifested by American preachers to drag sensational topics into their sermons," so apparent four years ago, has largely disappeared, and instead there has come "a wide-spread return to Scriptural exposition, to the unfolding of the contents of the Bible, to dealing with the deepest questions of the soul." This is good. We would that all that he saw had been of the same character and tendency. But the report continues that "Dr. Meyer professes to have great faith in the ability of Christian Endeavorers to purify American politics," upon which he said:

"There is a generation of young men growing up which purposes to make politics a department of their Christianity. When this generation is of age I believe it will bring local and national governments to an ideal plane—at least to a plane on which will be found the best interests of the commonwealth."

The fact that "there is a generation of young men growing up which purposes to make politics a department of their Christianity" is little realized by many people, but it should be known by all. It is a fact of such significance that all the people should be awake to it, and especially should Christian people arouse to the situation. Dr. Meyer is at the head of the English Christian Endeavorers, and he doubtless knows whereof he speaks. The fact which he points out bodes no good for either religion or the state.

This will not be the first time that a generation of people has arisen with the determination "to make politics a department of their Christianity." A generation of this sort came with the falling away of the early church from the pure principles of the gospel. The manipulation of politics as a department of their Christianity by that generation resulted in firmly saddling the Papacy upon the world, and from that day to this the principal work of that iniquitous system has been to make and keep politics a department of Christianity. This scheme was tried by Calvin at Geneva; it was tried by "the saints" in the days of Cromwell; it was tried by the Mathers in New England. Because of this scheme the true church was obliged to flee for refuge into the wilderness, and millions of saints were "worn out" by the fires of persecution and the dreadful implements of intolerance. Because of the department of politics the history of so-called Christianity is one of the most melancholy records of past times.

But it would seem that the important question for Christian people when confronted by a generation which purposes to make politics a department of its Christianity, would be, Can politics be made a department of Christianity—of the Christianity of Christ? Would the Master have politics made a department of his religion? This question should appeal with special force to Dr. Meyer, who, in his excellent little book, "The Shepherd Psalm," has well written: "We take a long time ere we learn that the place of usefulness and blessedness is in following the lead of Jesus. We are much more liable to imitate, some scheme which our judgment may have passed upon after a hurried hearing of its claims than to ask where Christ wants us to be and whither he is leading. The one ambition of our being should be to be sure we are resolutely following the Shepherd whithersoever He goeth."

Let Christians turn to the text-book of Christianity—the Bible—in which Dr. Meyer notes a renewed interest, and distinguish between the true and the false in the following:

One day as the Saviour went forth, a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, gave his heart to the Master, and was on the point of forsaking his toll-booth and the business of tax-gathering. But Jesus hastened to say to him, "That is unnecessary, Matthew. You can be my disciple right here. Politics is to be a department of Christianity, and now is a good time to begin that work. The years of experience you have had as a publican is just what is needful to make that work a success, and you must remain where you are and push the work of that department." But the Master did not speak thus. He said, "Follow me." "And he left all, rose up, and followed him."

Again: Two men, brothers, were in dispute over an inheritance, and one of them appealed to the Saviour to cause his brother to divide the inheritance with him. And Jesus said to him: "You have correctly divined my mission. The settlement of disputes and the apportionment of legacies is a part of my work. Christianity is to have a department of politics for the consideration and settlement of all such affairs, and you have given me a good opportunity to start that work." Was this the attitude of the Master toward that appeal? No. He said: "Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you." And then, taking the incident as a text, he proceeded with the work for which he had come, and warned his hearers to beware of the evil of covetousness.

And again: There was a generation of people, a considerable company, in the days of the Master who were enthusiastic in the determination not only to make politics a department of their Christianity, but a department of the Christianity of Christ. So strong was this determination that they proposed that the Saviour be made a king, and in case of reluctance on his part they were prepared to force the honor upon him. Jesus perceived their purpose and hastened to assure them that their task was not as hard as they had anticipated. "I am glad," he said, "that so large a company of people is so thoroughly imbued with the true spirit of my mission. Christianity is for the good of the world and the salvation of mankind, and the sooner Christian people can obtain possession of the seats of authority and dominion the sooner will its blessings be spread throughout the earth. Where the kings of the Gentiles now exercise lordship Christians should be placed. This 'will bring local and national governments to an ideal plane—at least to a plane on which will be found the best interests of the commonwealth.' Politics must be made an important department of Christianity, and the accomplishment of the purpose which you are now determined upon will enable me to make this work a success. I therefore accept your offer of temporal dominion." What saith the Scriptures? "When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone." And again, at another time, "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence."

If there is indeed, as Dr. Meyer alleges, "a wide-spread return to Scriptural exposition, to the unfolding of the contents of the Bible, to dealing with the deepest questions of the soul," there should follow a rapid decrease in the ranks of that generation of young men or any other people which purposes making politics a department of Christianity. Sensationalism is by no means as grave a danger as is such a purpose with such a backing. But it is doubtful if this interest in the Scriptures will be deep and lasting, for there is every reason to believe that the generation of young people which purposes to make politics a department of their Christianity is constantly increasing.

The truth-nevertheless remains that Christianity and politics are everlastingly distinct and separate. They work in different spheres by different agencies for the accomplishment of different ends. A politician will, if he has an opportunity, make what is called Christianity a department of politics, but a Christian should never desire to make politics a de-department of Christianity. A politician should become a Christian, but a Christian should never, never become a politician.
