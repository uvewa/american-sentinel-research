THE instructions given the Philippine Commission, appointed some time ago by the President to take in charge the task of establishing American Government in the Philippines, are now made public. They were drawn up last April, but the present was deemed a more opportune time for setting them before the people. The Filipinos are by these instructions promised all the rights enjoyed by American citizens, except that of trial by jury and the writ of habeas corpus. They are to enjoy full personal liberty and protection of property rights under guarantees similar to those of the American Constitution. On the point of religious freedom the instructions say:

"That no form of religion and no minister of religion shall be forced upon any community nor upon any citizen of the islands; that, upon the other hand, no minister of religion shall be interfered with or molested in following his calling, and that the separation between state and church shall be real, entire, and absolute."

Further, it is provided that "no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and "the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship without discrimination or preference shall forever be allowed."

These guarantees of religious freedom are certainly all that any people could desire. They are even stronger than are those enjoyed by citizens of the United States, excepting those of South Carolina, for that State is alone in having a constitutional provision against any State legislation respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Happy will it be for the long-en-slaved people of those islands if these guarantees are carried into effect.

It is to be noted, however, that very important exceptions are made in the personal rights to be enjoyed by the Filipinos. They are not to have the right of trial by jury nor of habeas corpus. The Pittsburgh Dispatch remarks that "these two things the islanders have never enjoyed, so they will not be missed"! But no one can read the history of the events which led up to the incorporation of these rights in the American system of government without realizing that they can not be removed from that system without leaving a ruinous gap in its guarantees of personal freedom. And it may well be questioned how, without these rights, the guarantees made to the islanders under the new government are to be realized. It is provided, for example, that they shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property "without due process of law," but "due process of law" means, in America, the privilege of trial by jury; and if the tendency to unwarranted invasion of personal liberty is so great here in the United States as to necessitate for the people the privilege of trial by jury and of habeas corpus, how much more must such privileges be necessary to the security of personal liberty in the Philippines, where rulers will not feel answerable to the people, and despotism can pursue its work with so much more safety and freedom.

The good intentions of the President will come to naught through the inherent badness of the system through which they seek to be carried into effect.
