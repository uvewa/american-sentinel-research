"I have no sympathy," says Rev. Dr. Talmage, speaking of the Chinese situation, "with the suggestion that the Powers should employ force of arms to maintain the status of Christianity in the empire. The day for crusaders has gone by. If China wishes to exclude the Bible from entrance at the 'open door, then these men and women who wish to carry it to them must prepare themselves for the career of martyrdom, as has been done by Christians in all ages."
