SPEAKING in behalf of Sunday observance, Hon. John M. Pattison, of Cincinnati, is quoted as warning the liquor dealers that if they pursue a course tending to "the breaking down of the American Sabbath" "the people will finally shut the saloons, not for one day in the week, but for seven."

If this is so, then by all means let the saloons pursue just that course.
