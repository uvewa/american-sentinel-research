"The facts of the Indian school question," says the Catholic Mirror, "constitute an urgent plea for Catholic federation." This new federation of Catholics is not for political purposes at all, we are assured, but we learn from the Mirror that it will be an organization before which politicians and political parties may be expected to make obesiance. "No public official, no political power, can afford to scorn so many of his fellow-citizens when it is known that they are united, and can, if necessity arise, stand together in defense of their rights."

The Mirror hopes for a resumption of "pleasant relations" between the Catholic Indian Bureau and the Government, though anticipating "bitter opposition from the bigots." It intimates that this Catholic agency might still be getting money out of the Government if this Catholic federation had been organized years ago.

So here it is, in their own words. The purpose of this federation will be to enable Catholics to demand Government aid and recognition for institutions of their church, and its political power will be strong enough to compel politicians and parties to do its bidding. That is the way the federation will "keep out of politics," and some Protestant societies that we might mention are keeping out of politics in the same way.
