We learn from a sermon delivered recently at St. Joseph's College, Philadelphia, by a Jesuit "Father," that it was Lord Baltimore who "gave to the Constitution of the United States its most precious tenet—that of religious freedom"! And Catholics have much to say about Protestant falsifying of history.
