A PROPOSITION to license clairvoyants is before the Chicago city council. This class of persons have been recently put under the ban in Manchester, N. H., and opinion as to the propriety of permitting them in Chicago is not wholly in their favor. One resident writes to the Daily News advocating the prohibition of clairvoyancy as a misdemeanor, and opposing license on the ground that it would operate in favor of the wealthy clairvoyants and against the poor ones. The News adds that the proposed ordinance should be considered with unusual care, because "to license clairvoyants is to give them a legal standing and to throw about their calling the respectability of law," which, in its opinion, would be practically the same as legalizing a fraud.

Clairvoyants are undoubtedly frauds, but not all frauds can be rightfully prohibited by law. The line can not be drawn between clairvoyants and spiritualists, which are recognized as a religious sect. The question whether a person can hold communication with or derive information from occult intelligences or not is not one that a city council or a legislature can settle. We believe the best thing is for everybody to let clairvoyants alone.
