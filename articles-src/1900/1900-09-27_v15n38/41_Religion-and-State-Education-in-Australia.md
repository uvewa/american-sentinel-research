The question of state teaching of religion is being agitated in Australia. A Melbourne journal says:

"The effort now being made in Victoria to introduce religious instruction into the state school system of the colony has called forth the following protest from the Lutheran Synod. We copy from the Age of July 19:

'At a ministerial conference at Murtoa of the eastern district of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Australia, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved that this conference, after due deliberation, emphatically protests against the intended introduction of religious instruction into the state schools for the following reasons, viz: 1. That according to Holy Writ, the sacred duty of religious instruction does not rest with the state, but with the parents and the church. 2. That state interference in religious matters is contrary to the constitution of our colony. 3. That there is no necessity for religious instruction in state schools, since not only the Roman Catholic Church, but also our church, although a very small body, support their own parochial schools, which clearly proves that the other denominations can do the same. 4. That it is impossible to give religious instruction of an undenominational and undogmatic character, especially in a community of different persuasions.

'It was resolved to forward a copy of this resolution to the Minister of Education.'

These conclusions are certainly logical, and must commend themselves to reasoning minds. God has not made the state the exponent of His Word in any way. On parents and the church He has placed the solemn duty of teaching His will and His Word to the children. No person who does not for himself humbly seek wisdom from God, and who is not enlightened by the Spirit of God, can teach to others the Word of God. This preparation can neither be given nor demanded by any earthly government."
