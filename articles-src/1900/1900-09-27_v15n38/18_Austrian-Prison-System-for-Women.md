"AUSTRIA," says the *Catholic Mirror*, "is the only country in the world which never put a woman in prison. Instead of giving a woman so many months in jail she is sent, no matter how terrible her record, to one of the convents devoted for the purpose, and kept there during the time for which she is sentenced."
