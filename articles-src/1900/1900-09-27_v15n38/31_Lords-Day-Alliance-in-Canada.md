A BRANCH of the "Lord's Day Alliance," the Canadian organization for promoting Sunday legislation, was recently organized in St. John, New Brunswick. It is, of course, composed mainly of clergymen. The clergymen, a correspondent writes us, have been showing their zeal for Sunday in various ways, one of which was the serving of a notice on the electric-car company to stop running their cars on Sunday. As it happened that this company also supplied the city and some of the churches with light, the reply was made to the ministers that the company would not discriminate between the running of cars and the manufacturing of light, but that if the cars were stopped the entire plant would shut down, leaving city and churches in darkness. Upon learning this the ministers saw things in a different light, and the cars have continued on Sunday as usual.

It is insisted by the members of the Alliance that the law enforcing the "Lord's day" is purely a civil regulation, and they declare that as such it must be served on all alike. The Rev. Mr. Fotheringham (Presbyterian), on being interrogated as to its effect upon observers of the seventh day, replied that the latter "must get out of the way." This states the real purpose for which the Sunday laws are now invoked —to get an opposing religion and its advocates "out of the way."
