"Is Sunday for God or for golf?" was the subject of an impassioned discourse by a San Francisco pastor on a recent Sunday. He pronounced a severe philippic against Sunday desecrators, and particularly the young women who play golf. It appears that golf playing is becoming very popular among the leisure-having young ladies of California, and in their enthusiasm for the game they do not distinguish between Sunday and other days of the week.

Among the denunciatory sentences of the speaker (Rev. A. C. Bane), as reported in the San Francisco *Examiner*, are the following:

"If the women are going the same way as the men what will become of the Sabbath?"

"When the Sabbath is gone God's hour and God's people are gone."

"When the churches are gone the nation is gone."

"How fast are the women enlisting with the men in yielding to temptation! Women at the Sunday golf tourney, at the Sunday theater, at the Sunday ball game, at the Sunday horse race! Think of that!"

"To-day the places of worship are not crowded, but the places of revelry are."

"Think of the unholy spectacle of thirteen young ladies, high up in California society, actually participating in the golf games at Del Monte on Sunday last, and for a prize, a silver cup!"

All this denunciation was natural and proper enough from the stand-point of the Rev. Mr. Bane, who, we may suppose, fully believes that Sunday is a sacred day, upon which all persons are solemnly bound by decree of Heaven to abstain from worldly labors and amusements. But suppose some one of the denounced Sunday golfers should turn on him and ask, Why should we not play golf on Sunday? What is your evidence that Sunday golf or other forms of Sunday recreation are contrary to the mind and law of God? What could the clergyman say in reply? Could he point them to words of Scripture designating Sunday as the Christian Sabbath, and commanding people to observe it by refraining from worldly occupations? No; he would be obliged to admit that no text in all the Bible commands anybody to stop either work or play on Sunday. No text designates Sunday as the Sabbath. The whole claim that is made for Sunday as a sacred day of divine appointment—the whole claim upon which the Rev. Mr. Bane's philippic against Sunday golfers was based—rests on mere assumption! Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the first day of the week; therefore we assume that the Sabbath was transferred from the seventh day to the first day in honor of that event. The church instituted the change from the seventh to the first day, and we assume that the transfer was in harmony with the will of God. There is no recorded command for such a change, but we assume that Christ gave such a command to his disciples, etc. All this is only what the advocates of the day themselves admit. The Rev. Mr. Bane's denunciations, therefore, are shorn of all their force, save such as can be derived from mere assumption, which is certainly very little indeed.

This is the truth, and our friends who are denouncing people for spending Sunday in secular occupations may as well look it in the face. It is a fatally weak point in the cause of which they are the champions. However conclusive in their own minds may be the arguments based on inference and tradition in support of Sunday as being the Christian Sabbath, the young men and women of the rising generation are certainly not blind to the weak and flimsy nature of such proofs, and it is useless to expect that they will feel solemnly bound by such evidence. If clergymen would have their denunciations of Sabbath breaking taken seriously by well-informed people of this day they must speak in behalf of the day which really has solid support in the declarations of Holy Writ.
