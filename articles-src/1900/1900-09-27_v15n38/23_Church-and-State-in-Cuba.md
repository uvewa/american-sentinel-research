A Cuban correspondent of American Catholic journals writes that "nowhere in history perhaps has the union of church and state wrought more evil effects than in Cuba, and in their desire to effect a separation the Cubans are going to many unreasonable extremes."

People who have experienced the evils of church-and-state union are usually willing to proceed to any necessary extremes to get rid of it.
