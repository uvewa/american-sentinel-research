The Sunday-closing crusade in Boston, considered with reference to its effect upon the Jews, is thus described by the American Israelite (Cincinnati):

"The statement made in these columns last week that the Massachusetts law made no provision for the exemption from the operation of the Sunday laws of conscientious observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, was erroneous. The law reads:

"Whosoever conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the penalties of the section for performing secular business and labor on the Lord's day, if he disturbs no other person."

"Under this statute law the Jewish stores have been allowed to keep open on Sunday. But the police have discovered many cases where the storekeepers didn't observe Saturday and sought to keep open Sunday also. In these cases the offenders have been brought into court when it was known they did business both on Saturday and Sunday, and fined as violators of the Sunday law. It has been constantly charged by the Gentile storekeepers that the Jewish proprietors used the law as a subterfuge, closing from Friday at sunset to Saturday at sunset, the extent of the Jewish Sabbath, and then opening Saturday evening, thus obtaining the cream of the trade.

"The courts, however, have never convicted the Jewish storekeepers where it was shown that they conscientiously kept their places closed from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday.

"But the board of police have been diligently studying the statute with the idea of enforcing it against the Jews, notwithstanding the clause which seems especially to exempt them. They have decided to place the burden of proof upon the storekeepers themselves, and make them prove not only that they observed the Jewish Sabbath, but that they 'conscientiously believe that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath.' Police officers say it will be interesting to note the method by which the proof is submitted.

"The rule which has gone forth involves some 1,500 storekeepers in the South End, West End, North End, and Roxbury. Besides the Jewish storekeepers it applies to the fruit dealers, shoeblacks, and all those who sell goods not especially exempted by statute law. Baker shops are permitted to do business during certain hours, and so are newspaper stores. Drug stores also are exempted and are also permitted to sell cigars, while cigar stores are interdicted from doing business. Stable-keepers may let horses and carriages, and boats and yachts may be hired on Sunday or any other day of the week.

"The Jewish dealers, it was stated at police headquarters, were willing that a test case should be made. It is, therefore, the intention of the police to summon all storekeepers who do business on Sunday to appear in court Monday [September 10]. Then a case will be selected to be carried to the Supreme Court for adjudication."

Notice the fact that the authorities have placed the burden of proof upon the exempted storekeeper, and require him to show not only that he observes the seventh day, but that he conscientiously believes that day ought to be observed as the Sabbath. That is the way Baptists were treated under laws exempting them from contributing to the support of the State church. They were required to furnish proof that they had been immersed, etc. Thus the Sunday law leads the club-wielding official of civil government into the inner sanctuary of conscience. And this is due to "exemption." In such cases it will be "interesting," no doubt, "to note the method by which the proof is submitted."

As recently pointed out in these columns, moreover, those bent on enforcing the law have discovered that there is legal precedent for construing the exemption in a narrower sense, so as to exclude the permission to keep open places of business. Between this interpretation of the law and the necessity of proving a conscientious regard for the seventh day, "exemption" does not appear to be any very great blessing to the seventh-day people in New England's leading city.
