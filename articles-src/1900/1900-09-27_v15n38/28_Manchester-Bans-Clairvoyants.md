The Boston Herald reports that the city of Manchester, N. H., has prohibited within its limits the avocations of palmists, card readers, and clairvoyants. "Some interesting questions," says the Herald, "will be raised, and it is more than likely that some of them will be settled in court to test the validity of the New Hampshire statutes."
