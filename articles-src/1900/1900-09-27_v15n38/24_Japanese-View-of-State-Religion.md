The Marquis Ito, one of the foremost of Japanese statesmen, in a recent conversation expressed this view of state religion, on which point it seems Japan sees clearer than most of the "Christian nations": "At one time I held the opinion that if Japan was seeking admission into Christendom she ought to adopt Christianity as the state religion—a conventionalism like the dress-coat—but now I am inclined to sympathize with many of our more thoughtful people who urge that no country can be benefitted by playing fast and loose with religion and the deeper matters of what they call the soul."

"Playing fast and loose with religion"—that expresses the character of state "Christianity." Its Christianity is exalted or laid aside, just as will suit the selfish purposes it has in view.
