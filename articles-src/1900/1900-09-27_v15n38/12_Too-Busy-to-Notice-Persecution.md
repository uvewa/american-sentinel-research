A TERRIBLE and bloody persecution of Jews is in progress in Roumania. It presents the picture of "honorable men practically expelled from their fatherland; helpless women and children wandering footsore and weary from place to place, hundreds not knowing whither to turn." "The descriptions by eye-witnesses of the miseries of these poor creatures whose only crime consists in their being Jews," says a Hebrew journal, "makes the saddest reading imaginable. It seems scarcely possible that such things can be." The same paper recalls the mass-meeting held in the Mansion House, London, during a similar persecution in 1872, at which meeting the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Bishop of Gloucester, and others made ringing speeches in behalf of religious liberty, and it was declared by resolution that "this meeting protests against the outrages committed on the Jews in Roumania as a disgrace against modern civilization, and deeply sympathizes with the unhappy people."

But no one thinks of calling a mass-meeting to take note of the like outbreak of persecution to-day. Scarcely a thought, indeed, is given to it. Scarcely a mention of it has found its way into the columns of the press. What is the matter? Oh, England is very busy just now civilizing the Boers and extending her empire in China, and the United States is also very busy with the task of carrying the "white man's burden" in Asia, and the whole civilized world, in fact, is very busy watching the great work of empire building and the extension of the blessings of "Christian civilization" in Asia undertaken by the world Powers—too busy to pay attention to such a trifle as a persecution of the Jews in Roumania, or of a war in Central America, or of any minor disturbance anywhere. England and the United States, moreover, are getting familiarized with the picture of human suffering—that always goes with the work of empire building. The death lists that come back from the Transvaal and the Philippines no longer excite any general interest. Greater things are before the public eye.

Take note that the present time is unusually favorable for bigotry and intolerance to do their work in this country. A few years ago the arresting and imprisoning of seventh-day Christians in various States under the Sunday laws excited no small comment in the public press and aroused no small degree of sympathetic interest in the public mind. Should the like movement to prosecute these people be inaugurated now, or even a greater one, it is wholly unlikely that the public would either know or care anything about it. Times have changed, and we are being swiftly carried forward to events that are to mark the final, crowning struggle of Despotism against Liberty for world mastery. s.
