SOMEONE has sent us the following press item relative to the chain-prayer political movement said to have been started by the Indiana W. C. T. U., which, it appears from this statement, was far from being of the dimensions given it in the newspaper reports:

"INDIANAPOLIS, IND., Sept. 10.—The endless prayer scheme of Mrs. Mary Balch to defeat President McKinley was turned down at a meeting of the officers of the Indiana W. C. T. U., which was secretly held at the residence of Mrs. F. T. McWhirter, president of the State organization. Mrs. Balch is secretary of the Indiana organization, and her scheme had the appearance of having been a State movement. Every member of the central committee was present at the meeting, and Mrs. Balch presented her scheme. She was permitted to explain it in detail, and some heated speeches were made against the proposition. Mrs. Balch was the only one to vote in favor of it, and the vote decided that the W. C. T. U. would remain out of politics."
