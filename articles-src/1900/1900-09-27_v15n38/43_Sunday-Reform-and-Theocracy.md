"Under the old theocratic form of government," says a "Sunday reform" leaflet "God made, construed, and executed law through his own instrumentalities. We in this land do the same thing by the will of the people."

But it will not do for the people to put themselves in the place of God and make and execute the same kind of laws that were in force under the ancient theocracy.
