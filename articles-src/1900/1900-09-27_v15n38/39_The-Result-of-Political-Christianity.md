From all the evidence relating to the causes of the Boxer outbreak in China thus far gathered it is clear that among the chief was the system of political "Christianity" established by Roman Catholic missionaries. For the purely religious part of the missionary's work the Chinese care nothing. It is only when religion is made to serve a political purpose that their antagonism is roused. The following statements throwing light on the situation in China as regards this point are made by an English journal, *The Bulwark*:

> "After China's defeat by Japan the French minister plenipotentiary obtained the monstrous privilege for popish bishops embodied in the following regulation: 'In the different degrees of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the bishops, being in rank and dignity the equals of the viceroys and governors, it is convenient to permit them to demand interviews with the viceroys and governors.' As a viceroy in China is next to the emperor, papal bishops have obtained this rank and the privileges connected with it. Now, even consuls have no access to viceroys or governors, but the papal bishops have. Then priests are allowed the position and authority of a mandarin, and sit and act as magistrates. And what do they do? The Rev. W. O. Ellerich, of Chefoo, writing on June 20, says: 'Their business really is to look after lawsuits, and the training they possess is not so much in being able to expound the Scriptures, of which they are very ignorant, but to carry on a lawsuit successfully before the Chinese officials. . . . The foreign priest will back up the case before the native official, and if he refuses threatens him with the power of his country.' Another missionary, the Rev. F. M. Royal, writes: 'Bishops and priests are allowed the authority of a magistrate or mandarin. If of a higher rank than the mandarin, they sit in judgment in the case of a convert who is accused or is a party to a suit with a heathen, or if of equal rank the ecclesiastic sits with the magistrate and practically controls the decision.' Thus, we are told, in order to have a friend in court, in order to save law expenses and gain cases at law, hundreds and thousands of Chinese turn Roman Catholic. 'Unscrupulous men have joined the Romanists in thousands here this year. In Shantung ten thousand persons have been baptized, and the Romanists claim twenty thousand adherents in four districts. This policy is deliberately carried out all over China.'"

The purpose of this religio-political system, it appears, is to facilitate the getting of converts from the Chinese. It thus appears as an evil system used to promote hypocrisy, and attended with the most disastrous results; and it is no less evil in principle when endorsed by Protestants in the United States, as it is by the many whose aim is to set up a Christian government.
