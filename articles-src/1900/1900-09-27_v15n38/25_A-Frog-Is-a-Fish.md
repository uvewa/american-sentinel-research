SUNDAY, June 16, a resident of New Britain, Connecticut, was arrested on a charge of fishing in the "Farmington reservoir," near that town. The defendant, at his trial, averred that he was not fishing, but had merely killed a frog. Being convicted and fined $3, he appealed to the superior court, the judge of which, in order to sustain the verdict of the lower court, decided that a frog is a fish, notwithstanding proof to the contrary from zoological authorities and the dictionary submitted by defendant's attorney. The Sunday law does not bother itself with fine distinctions.
