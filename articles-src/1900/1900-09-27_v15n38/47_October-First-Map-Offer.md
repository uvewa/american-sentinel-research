As previously announced, our special map offer to old and new subscribers will be withdrawn on October 1. You can still secure the map by sending your subscription or your renewal immediately. All orders in the mails before October 1 will be honored by us, though the letter may be several days in transit.

We have mailed several hundred of these maps to patrons of The Sentinel during the past few weeks and have received only words of commendation therefor. Our limited supply now remaining we shall continue to mail to all purchasers at the nominal price of fifteen cents. Order your copy of this map of China before it is too late.
