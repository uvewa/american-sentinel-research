The New York Tribune reports the enforcement of the Sunday law of that State upon two Italians at Mount Vernon, Sept. 16. "The old blue laws," says the Tribune, "were enforced in Mount Vernon yesterday [Sunday], when policeman Kirkeby arrested Michael Mispare and A. Ciclime for chopping wood. The men were caught by the officer sawing and splitting a log near their home in Fourteenth Avenue. They said they wanted the wood to kindle a fire, so their wives could cook dinner. 'This is not a free country,' exclaimed one of the prisoners. 'If a man can't cut wood in this country on Sunday I'm going back to Italy to live.'
