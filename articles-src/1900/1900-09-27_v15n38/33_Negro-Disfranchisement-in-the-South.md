The New York Christian Advocate gives this condensed statement of the movement for negro disfranchisement in the South as it now stands:

"The negroes in North Carolina are to be deprived of the right of suffrage. The constitutional amendment which was passed provides that no white man and no descendant of a white man who was entitled to vote in 1867 needs to be able to read or write in order to be qualified to vote. No negro, however, can vote unless able to read and write any section of the Constitution, nor then unless he has paid a poll-tax. This is going on in all the Southern States, yet it is probable that the Federal Government will do nothing, though the strong presumption is that all such enactments are contrary to the Constitution of the United States as it now is. The candidate of the party promoting this scheme assured his audiences that the amendment will not disfranchise a single white man, and the most illiterate will be allowed to register, even though not entitled under the provision popularly spoken of as the 'grandfather clause,' and that the most rigid educational tests will be applied to negro applicants."

The disfranchisement of the negro can tend only toward the re-establishment of negro slavery. The negro can not stand still in a position of "disfranchised freedom;" the South would not long tolerate him in that position. Either he must advance upward toward the political and intellectual heights occupied by the race with which he is in contact, or retrograde to his former position of servitude. "Half slave and half free," as Lincoln stated it, is a condition less tolerable than the old-time slavery.
