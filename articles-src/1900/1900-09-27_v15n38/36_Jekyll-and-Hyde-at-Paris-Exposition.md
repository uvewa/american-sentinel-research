Among the exhibits which make up the display at the Paris Exposition an impressive but unintentional one is that of the dual character—the "Jekyll-and-Hyde" combination—in human nature. It is thus described by Mr. Charles Wagner in the *Outlook*:

"From the gallery where I stand, surrounded by suffering and charity, between the statues of Valentine Hauy and Abbe de l'Epee, I look over that alcohol plain where clerical and lay distillers enter into rivalry, and a heartbreaking contrast takes possession of me. The same epoch that displays such care in solacing that which is wretched in life has exercised its ingenuity in distilling all these poisons, in opening the worse fountains of evil; and, through some curious unpremeditated coincidence, the two elements are brought close together, and the devil's stills are placed, side by side with the laboratories where steep and simmer the salutary drugs which destroy microbes and restore strength. It would be impossible in this age to declare in a more tragic manner that there are two men, two natures, in each of us. These two men may be found everywhere—in the mad competition existing at the same time, and despite itself, with combination; in the conjunction of the serious and the frivolous, of liberty and oppression, of antiseptics and intoxicants.

"If the reader permits, I will show him these two men in still other forms. Here, at the head of the bridge of the Trocadero, there is a heavy red, cupola-like structure, in shape a gigantic soup-tureen cover. From holes pierced in the side come out long stems, but not of spoons; these are cannon of all calibers. The firm of Schneider, of Creusot, among others, exhibits these enormous guns. A little further on are found the land and sea artillery of all nations—a collection of engines of destruction such as the world has never before seen. As we leave the place our imaginations picture scenes of naval battles, bombardments, villages on fire, fleets thundering and wrapped in smoke. Mankind seems to us mere food for cannon. Age of iron and of fire, of violence and blood.

"But while you are thus reflecting, there emerges to view from the pleasant shade close by a pretty little house in Louis XVI. style, as attractive and pleasing as the Schneider tower is threatening and repellent. On the entrance you read, 'Nursery for Infants.' You enter; here are white cradles, nurses busy in tending the babies, glass boxes built with extreme care to shelter in cotton the delicate bodies of those born too soon; the heat and amount of air are measured; in watching an almost fearful tenderness is used, as with precious treasures with which no risks must be taken. A moment ago we saw how to destroy at a blow hundreds of lives of strong men in the flower of their age; now we are invited to see what may be done to cherish the least hope of life, the least germ of human existence. What does this mean? What a mad contradiction! And how well might this age, if it understood itself, sum up all the anguish of its divided and tormented self in that sad cry of St. Paul, 'O, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me?'
