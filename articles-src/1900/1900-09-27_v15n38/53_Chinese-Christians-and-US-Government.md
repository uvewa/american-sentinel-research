By the treaty of 1858 between China and the United States the Chinese government is bound to afford protection to Chinese converts to Christianity against physical harm, and now the United States Government is pondering the question whether to withdraw its troops from Peking and leave the Chinese Christians to meet the revengeful onslaught of their anti-Christian enemies or to take these converts along with its army for protection, thus distinguishing between Christian Chinese and heathen Chinese. The Government does not wish to do either one.
