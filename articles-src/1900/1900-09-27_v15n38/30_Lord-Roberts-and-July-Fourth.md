Lord Roberts, the British commander in South Africa, has shown a disposition to make the occurrence of the chief acts marking British success there fall when practicable upon important dates in English history, and now he is said to have chosen July 4 as the date of his proclamation annexing the Transvaal, an event designed to mark the extinguishment of that republic. Does Lord Roberts believe it is time to give a different meaning to July 4?
