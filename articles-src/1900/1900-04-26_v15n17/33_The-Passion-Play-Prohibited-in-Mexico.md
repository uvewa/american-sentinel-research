A great sensation in religious circles in Mexico has been caused by an ecclesiastical order prohibiting the annual "passion play," depicting the scenes of the betrayal, trial and crucifixion of Christ, which has been a great feature of "holy week" in Latin-American countries for many years. A press account says:—

"The new order of the archbishop of Mexico regarding the passion play, customary on Good Friday, was observed in the valley of Mexico, although the masses resented the prohibition of the spectacle, which has been a feature of holy week for centuries, originating with the clergy when they were Christianizing the Indians. But at Yautepec, in the state of Morelos, the people assembled at the parish priest's home, demanding that he distribute, as usual, the costumes of the passion play. This he refused to do. It is reported that he was driven out of town, the people declaring that they would not stand such a priest, and must be allowed their ancient custom."
