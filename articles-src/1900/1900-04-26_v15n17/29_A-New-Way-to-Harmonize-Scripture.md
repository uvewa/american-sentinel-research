As an illustration of the practical skepticism that is taking the place of faith in the Christian church, the following from the question and answer column of *The Outlook*, a professedly Christian journal, is to the point:—

"How do you harmonize the doctrine of God's free love with the Biblical accounts of his commands for the slaughter and extermination of peoples (for illustration, the Midianites)? Are the two consistent?

W. T. M.

"Where we read of such massacres as enjoined by divine command, the phrase 'the Lord said' denotes only that the Hebrews thought he said so. God spoke to men then in the same way as now, i. e., through the dictates of reason and conscience. Then, as in the comparatively recent times when men were put to death for heresy, both reason and conscience were at fault in viewing such things, as St. Paul viewed his early career of persecution, as pleasing to God. The phrase 'the Lord said' really implies no more than that the people who used it attributed what they regarded as their wisest and best impulses directly to God."

This is harmonizing Scripture not with itself—one text with other texts—but harmonizing it with the conceptions of the human mind. The establishment of this kind of harmony is not of the slightest consequence to any person in the world.

Human conceptions are to be harmonized with Scripture, and not Scripture with human conceptions. If reason had been a sufficient guide for mankind, there would have been no need of revelation.
