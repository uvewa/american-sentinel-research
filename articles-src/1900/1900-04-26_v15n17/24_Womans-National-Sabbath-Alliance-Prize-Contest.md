The Woman's National Sabbath Alliance, which has headquarters in this city, has sent out for publication the announcement that the alliance, "desiring to meet the demand for children's literature, offers two prizes, one of $15, and one of $10, for a short story suitable for children, teaching the value of the Sabbath and God's command for its observance."

As the material for the vital portions of these essays must be drawn from the Scripture, and must be adapted to the minds of children, there is plainly a problem before the writers to teach Sabbath observance in a way that will point to Sunday as the day to be observed. Children are accustomed to taking people at their word, and when they read that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," they are ready to believe it because it is perfectly plain to their understanding; but they cannot comprehend the obscure "reasons" and inferences and strained arguments by which theologians have arrived at the conclusion that the fourth commandment means the first day of the week where it says "the seventh." They may be told that Sunday should be kept because on that day Christ rose from the dead; but this is not a scriptural reason, and reasons not scriptural are worth nothing.

The institution and obligation of the seventh-day Sabbath can be made plain to any child; but the arguments for Sunday can be grasped only by an educated mind. Is not this the truth? We believe it can be demonstrated at any time.
