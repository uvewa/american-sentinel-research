Under many if not most of the laws for Sunday observance, the sale of tobacco on Sunday is recognized as a "necessity," thereby avoiding what might be for the law a disastrous conflict with the strong sentiment behind the trade in that noxious article; but recently the Supreme Court of Massachusetts decided that the Sunday law of that State prohibits the sale of cigars on Sunday, by all persons holding licenses as victuallers. The effect of this, upon the Sunday trade in cigars is described by the following in the New York Herald of April 2:—

"'Package of cigarettes, please?'

"'Can't sell cigars or cigarettes to-day,' said the restaurant man, with a smile. 'I can sell you a box of matches for five cents, though, and make you a present.'

"That was the way the Sunday cigar law worked in Boston yesterday. The devotees of nicotine obtained all they wanted. There were no arrests, and the whole affair was nothing more or less than an April-fool joke.

"The police were supposed to have an eye open for those who sold cigars and tobacco, but they 'used their own discretion.' Boston policemen never think of buying cigars any more than they think of buying peanuts, and, as the captains had not provided expense money, that settled the matter.

"The hotels all kept their cigar cases open, on the ground that they could furnish tobacco to their patrons, but some of the small restaurants resorted to all kinds of methods in order to get around the law.

"In many instances a box of matches was sold and a cigar given as a premium, but more than one restaurant had on sale a sort of a property pie, which was sold for ten cents, and if all that were sold had been eaten, the hospitals would have been filled. A cigar went with a pie. In the great majority of cases, however, the law was openly disregarded, except when a policeman was in sight."
