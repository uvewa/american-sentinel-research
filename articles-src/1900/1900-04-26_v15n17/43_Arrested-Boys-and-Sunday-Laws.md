The arrest of two young boys in Massachusetts recently, for watching a game of marbles on Sunday (see p. 259), is something for those people to think about who regard the Sunday law as a mild and benevolent institution. How safe is religious liberty for adults in a country where mere children are arrested under a Sunday law for looking on at a game being played by others? This of course is an extreme case; but the spirit that prompted such work as this is the spirit of zeal for Sunday enforcement, and the occurrence only shows to what this spirit may lead when a sufficient degree of zeal has been attained. The effectual way to guard against such exhibitions is to repeal the law which is so ready a channel for fanaticism and intolerance.
