[The following condemnation of English rule in India, made by a New England journal, is not a condemnation of the British nation, but of the imperial policy England has pursued in dealing with the territory of inferior races under her authority. Just at this time, when the United States has undertaken to govern inferior races in a distant territory, the ghastly picture presented by India to-day affords an object lesson which should not be lost upon the American people:—]

The ultimate test of government is the condition of the people. English rule in India is over a century old, yet if there is a God-forsaken people to-day on the earth's surface it is that wretched section of humanity in the land of Clive, Lawrence and Kipling, that is dying by the thousands from simple hunger. The secretary for India, Lord George Hamilton, has lately admitted in the British House of Commons that the present famine is the most serious that has occurred during the past 100 years. That is equivalent to saying that it is as terrible as any that has occurred in the known history of the country, before or after the British conquest. So far as the 19th century is concerned, the succession of famines indicates conditions of deterioration rather than of growing prosperity among the masses, while the century ends with an awful climax in the worst famine of them all.

If British rule has been the blessing to India that many have claimed, why does it fail so utterly to meet the simplest and most fundamental of tests? Improvements in the administration, the purification of the courts and the prohibition of a few heathen rites amount to nothing if the mass of the people are unable to procure food. The ability to live and produce wealth is a condition more essential to any civilization than the manner in which we live or the particular organization of industry.

No government can be pronounced good under which the population suffers from recurring famines of great extent and increasing intensity. And no more terrible indictment can be brought against a ruler than the simple fact that millions of his subjects periodically die of starvation. It is absurd to pronounce famines "an act of God." No intelligent person now loads upon the Almighty the responsibility for the great famines in Ireland during the past century. To be sure, the potato crop failed, but why was it that the Irish people had nothing except a few potatoes between them and starvation? In India there has been a failure of the monsoon. That was "an act of God." Yet why should 61,000,000 people suddenly be threatened with death from hunger because of the lack of rain?

In the recent brief debate in the House of Commons one or two daring members did not hesitate to attack British rule in India as being in a measure responsible for the present state of affairs. Sir William Wedderburn, who knows India thoroughly, opened the debate by moving "that in view of the grievous sufferings which are again afflicting the people of India, and the extreme impoverishment of large masses of the population, a searching inquiry should be instituted in order to ascertain the causes which impair the cultivators' power to resist the attacks of famine and plague; and to suggest the best preventive measures against future famines." Sir William attacked British officialism, and laid particular stress on the point that the Indian ryot, or peasant, is not encouraged to provide against drouths. Samuel Smith, supporting the motion, brought up the appalling poverty of the people. "In Madras in the past 11 years," he said, "the number of evictions for non-payment of rent amounted to 152,000, the number in the preceding 11 years having been 840,000. Such a state of things stands self-condemned. We are governing an excessively poor country far too expensively."

Mr. Maclean, a government supporter, who could not be accused of partisan bias against the party in power, and who has spent a large portion of his life in India, visiting the country again only last year, made a vigorous assault upon present conditions. When last in India, he said, he was struck with the apathetic and despairing attitude of the native population, who, under recent calamities, had had taken from them even the last remnants of hope. The real cause of their impoverishment was heavy taxation. The salt tax was a most oppressive burden to the poor man. As a matter of fact, all the resources of India were mortgaged to England. All the great businesses, the shipping, railways, banks and great industrial institutions of all kinds were in the hands of Englishmen, who, drawing large salaries, transmitted their savings to England. What were the consequences to the native population? Famine followed famine, cattle died, household goods were pawned, and, having no means to replenish their farms, the natives lived mere slaves to the village usurer. They had willingly voted £60,000,000 for the war in South Africa, and Mr. Maclean urged the House to fulfil their obligations to the noblest of British possessions—India.

The trouble with India, according to Mr. Maclean, whose right to speak on this question is not disputed, is substantially the old trouble with Ireland, that other monument of the failure of British rule. Financially and industrially it has been made a mere tribute bearer. India is literally the financial slave of the British money power. The sum of £60,000,000 is annually sent to England by the Englishmen in India, which they have drawn from the wealth of the country. And heavy taxation, according to expert observers, is "the real cause of India's impoverishment." These charges certainly help to explain the situation and to make it clear that the responsibility for India's present condition cannot be entirely charged against the people of India themselves.

The closing year of the nineteenth century is probably the most inglorious in British history during the century's passage. Sir William Wedderburn's motion was rejected by the House of Commons. The British are lavishly and passionately spending their money by the hundred million to crush the nationality of a brave people in South Africa, yet millions of the queen's Indian subjects starve.
