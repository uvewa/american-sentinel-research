*"The Argus," Prescott, Iowa.*

You can not mix religion and politics successfully, and the proposition to bring into the field a "Christian party" is the height of folly.

The lowly Nazarine does not ask his people to strive for a kingdom on earth, but admonishes them to keep their eyes on that everlasting kingdom where nothing is corrupt.

This question, "What would Jesus do?" is becoming sickening the way it is being handled. If a Christian would carry it into his or her daily life individually it is all right, but whenever they attempt to dictate the course of life along this line to the public and try to rule the world with Christianity as they see it there is going to be trouble.

Christ wants his religion forced on no one; he wants his followers to bring in the sheaves by showing a loving spirit, and not by bulldozing the people.

We defy anybody to show us by his teaching that he desired an earthly kingdom and that he attempted to set up one against the powers that were.
