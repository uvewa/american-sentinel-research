The following press item presents a feature of war not usually taken into account, but one worth considering by humane people—its infliction of suffering upon dumb animals. Enormous numbers of horses used by the combatants in South Africa have fallen victims to sudden or more frequently slow and painful death upon the battlefield, to starvation, disease, and other evils peculiar to that country, and a great business in importation has sprung up to supply the demands of the cavalry and other branches of the service in which the horse is required. We are told that "the consumption of horse power by the British in South Africa is causing great prosperity in the American horse market. British agents now here are buying immense consignments in Chicago and Louisville and New York, and the total purchases may reach 25,000 animals. The existence of the horse is secure so long as wars continue to require his breeding for the operations of the battlefield and military raid. The automobile can hardly displace the equine race as a fighting machine."
