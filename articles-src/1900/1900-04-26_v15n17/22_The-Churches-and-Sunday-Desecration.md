Why should the promoters of "Sabbath reform" seek to realize their object by reforming the State (so that the civil authorities shall enact and enforce laws for Sunday observance), when it is evident from their own testimony that the most appropriate place for such reforms is in the church. Here are two testimonies among many others that have been given upon this point.

In answer to a question from a correspondent asking whether it would be proper for a Methodist minister to travel by Sunday trains to keep an appointment for preaching when he could easily make the journey on the preceding day, the New York Christian Advocate said:—

"If he desired to exhibit contempt for the spirit and practise of the genuine representatives of Methodism with regard to the Sabbath, and make an impression upon the students to whom he was to preach that Sunday traveling is a matter of indifference, the most effective way of doing these things would be to take the Sunday train, arrive just before the service, and take another for his home as soon as possible after the service. But if he wished to promote a regard for the observance of the Sabbath, he would never travel from one city to another on that day, except in a case of such extreme necessity that he would be justified in the public conscience. In addition to that he should take pains to have the reasons stated. The observance of Sunday has been broken down more effectually by professed Christians than by all other adverse influences put together."

The second is the following stated in the Topeka Daily Capital (Sheldon edition) by Rev. W. F. Crafts, who has for years devoted the major portion of his time to "Sabbath reform" work:—

"You have asked me to report on the above subject [Sunday observance] at a time when the Sabbath is more attacked from the front and rear than ever before. Its worst foes are those of its own household, Christians who patronize Sunday trains, Sunday newspapers and Sunday mail. One often hears a preacher speak openly of going on a Sunday train, which is run in violation of both human and divine law. Churches advertise in Sunday papers that are also violations of both codes. Sabbath schools adjourn fifteen minutes before church to leave time to sandwich a visit to the postoffice in between the services. In a New York village I recently heard a Methodist preacher say that communion would be in the evening because so many of his members worked in the paper mill in the earlier hours of the Sabbath. Thousands of persons are received into church membership while they are breaking the Sabbath laws of heaven and earth, on the ground they might lose something if they refused. What fools the martyrs were who lost life rather than do wrong! With such news coming in from the churches, we cannot expect much from those who represent the state.

"The observance of Sunday has been broken down more effectually by professed Christians than by all other adverse influences put together," says the leading Methodist journal in the United States, and a man whose long experience in Sunday reform work has made him thoroughly familiar with the situation, says that the worst foes of Sunday are those of its own household. Is it not time, then, to turn the energy of the "reform" movement upon the churches—upon the worst offenders—instead of directing it longer against those who naturally look to the churches to set them an example in such matters?
