Establishment, or union with the state, is not working well at present for the Catholic party in the Church of England, and leaders of that party are accordingly agitating for the severance of the relationship. In England the state dominates the church, and as the church is divided into two contending parties, and the state cannot side with both, one of these parties—which happens to be the ritualistic or Catholic party—finds itself opposed by the government and brought into a state of subjection for which it feels—quite correctly—that disestablishment is the only remedy. This is what the Duke of Newcastle, who, next to Lord Halifax, is the leader of the Catholic party in the established church, says of the present situation:—

"We in England are passing through a most anxious time. At the moment the war absorbs public notice, and we are enjoying a temporary lull, but it is only temporary, and I fear we have much trouble ahead. When the archbishops delivered their preposterous judgment last July Catholics were dumbfounded, because most of them thought that at least it would be a compromise, odious as compromise always is when matters of Catholic faith and practise are at stake. But the judgment being what it was, the right course would have been for Catholics to present a very united front, and firmly to refuse obedience. That the decision was only an opinion we have the primates' own authority for stating.

"Unfortunately Catholics did not act together, and many of those priests whom we had looked up to as pillars of the faith were the first to yield, some through sheer panic, others through what I think a mistaken sense of duty. Thank God there are some who remain firm! Their positions are very difficult, and in some dioceses the bishops are pursuing a course of systematic persecution of those priests who will not betray their people by surrendering their Catholic principles.

"I have maintained throughout that incense must be fought for vigorously, because the real attack is not upon it, but upon the whole doctrine of the Eucharist. It is the Real Presence that Kensit and all the blatant Protestants of England hate, and it is that great Catholic truth that they are determined to root out of England's church if they can. Incense is only a preliminary object of attack, but it is quite certain that all the rest will follow; and that is why we cannot submit.

"I feel—many Catholics feel—that the only remedy for the evil is disestablishment. In the days when every M. P. was at least nominally a churchman the connection between church and state was possible, but now, when Parliament contains men of all religions and of no religion, the connection is an anomaly, and if Parliament should attempt to revise the prayer book—a contingency by no means impossible—I tremble to think what the result would be. I dislike to see old things disturbed, but my conviction is that we Catholics in England should work for the complete independence of the church."

Whether the state dominates the church, as in England, or the church dominates the state, as during the papal supremacy in Europe, the result is trouble for both church and state,—on the one side because there is a denial of freedom, and on the other because of the mixing of religious and secular affairs. In either case there is a combination of force with religion, the suppression of freedom in both church and state, the loss of hope and aspiration from the souls of the people, the decay of enterprise, and finally the moral, mental and physical ruin of the nation.

There is no decaying nation where liberty is left unfettered.
