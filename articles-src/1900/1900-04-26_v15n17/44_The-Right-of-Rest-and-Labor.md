The right of one person to rest on Sunday does not demand for its preservation the loss of another person's equal right to labor on that day. Every person is free to rest on Sunday, and there is no invasion of rights until there is introduce the compulsion of the law. It is compulsion that interferes with personal liberty, and the right denied is not the right of rest but the right of labor. This is a sacred right, and only tyranny will interfere with its enjoyment.
