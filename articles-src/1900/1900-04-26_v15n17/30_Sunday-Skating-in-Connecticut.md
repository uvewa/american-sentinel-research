The case of a Yale College student named Johnson, who was arrested in February last for skating on Sunday, was decided in the Superior Court of Connecticut April 19, the decision being that skating on Sunday in Connecticut is not a crime. A New Haven press dispatch says:—

"Judge Wheeler, of the Superior Court, to day indorsed the views of State's Attorney Williams regarding the enforcement of the Blue Laws relating to Sabbath observance. Mr. Williams nolled the case of Albert Johnson, who was arrested one Sunday last winter while skating on Lake Whitney.

"There was no proof that Johnson played any game. State's Attorney Williams said that anything that could fairly be considered to be recreation was permissible on Sunday, and that there was no more reason why a man should be prosecuted for skating on Sunday than for riding a bicycle, taking a walk, or driving."
