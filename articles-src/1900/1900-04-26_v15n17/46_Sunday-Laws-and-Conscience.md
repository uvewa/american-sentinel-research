"No Sunday law lays any burden on any man's conscience," says Rev. W. Allen Butler, LL.D., in a leaflet, "The Sabbath in Civil Law." If this is so, what is it that makes observers of the seventh day prefer imprisonment and work in the chain gang, to obedience to such a law? If their conscience is free in the matter, what reason can they have for making such sacrifices? Certainly they are not fond of going to jail, nor do they crave to take exercise in the chain gang. It is only conscience that can lead a people to sacrifice for the Sabbath as these have done.
