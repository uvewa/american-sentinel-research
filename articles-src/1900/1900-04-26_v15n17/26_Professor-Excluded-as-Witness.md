PROFESSOR PERSIFOR FRAZER, of the University of Pennsylvania, was excluded from the witness stand as incompetent in a trial at Philadelphia, to which he had been called, the reason for his disqualification being his disbelief in the Christian religion. Such action is plainly contrary to the Constitutional provision against discrimination before the law on account of religious belief, contained in the fundamental law both of the United States and of the States.
