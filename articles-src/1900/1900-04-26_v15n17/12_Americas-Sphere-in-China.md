In *Harper's Weekly* of April 14, Mr. W. N. Brewster, a missionary in China, writes of the failure of Japan to establish a government in the island of Formosa. After five years of effort, he says, Japan has been able to establish her supremacy over only a third of the island, and has been obliged to make humiliating concessions to the powerful robber chiefs who rule the remaining two-thirds of the island, and the latter maintain a state of practical independence. This fact, he continues, is of importance in view of another fact, which is that Japan covets the province of Fuhkien, in China, and is making steady efforts to extend her authority over it. This province has a population of 20,000,000 people.

His conclusion is that Japan, having failed to conquer and govern Formosa, with its 2,000,000 people, is utterly incompetent to govern the Chinese province of Fuhkien, and the province must come under the authority of some other power. The location of the province, it is to be noted, is close to the Philippine islands. Finally he says:—

"In view of the above facts, it would seem to be the height of folly for Japan to attempt to handle a whole province with ten times the population on the mainland. Disastrous failure would be certain. All this points to the possible possession of this great province by America in the not distant future. In case China breaks up, as now seems most probable, America cannot escape a share of the responsibility for the government of her next-door neighbor. Japan's failure in Formosa will naturally throw this province, which Japan seems to want but can never govern, to America as the nearest great power that has not already marked out its 'sphere of influence.' It is not safe to prophesy with too much confidence in such a matter, but the past two years have realized far stranger and more improbable events in American history."

Some time ago it was settled by American missionaries in China that the United States could not escape a share in the responsibility of governing the millions in China when the final breakup of the empire takes place. American statesmen concur in this view, and all questions have seemed pretty well settled except that of the location of "the slice." And now this question is in a fair way to being settled, if this writer in *Harper's Weekly* is to be accepted as authority upon the subject of which he speaks.
