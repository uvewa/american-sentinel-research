The opening of the great international Exposition in Paris, was the occasion of an exhibition of the secularism now prevailing in the French government, which seems even in Protestant quarters to be viewed with a degree of apprehension. The Independent (New York) in describing this feature of the opening ceremonies, says:—

"What chiefly interests the French public is the relation of the Exposition and its opening exercises to socialism and religion. The address at the opening was by the Socialist member of the Cabinet. There were no religious exercises, no blessing by the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris, no allusion to the Deity in the speeches of M. Millerand and President Loubet; and the hymn that was sung, instead of recognizing God, was addressed to Victor Hugo. These are new departures; they look a bit like a return to 1789. It is not strange that, following other acts against the church, such as the canceling two days before of the usual recognition of Good Friday by the Navy, the feeling on the religious question has been greatly embittered, and even the popular success of the Exposition endangered. France is still at heart Christian, strong as the Socialists are, who are mostly anti-religious."

"The conditions in France," the Independent continues, "are not reassuring." This is true enough; but it would be no less true if the French government stood upon a religious instead of a secular basis, and bowed to the decrees of Rome, as it formerly did. "Patriotism is taught in the state schools, as religion is in the church schools. Patriotism almost takes the place of religion. The French have not yet learned that the two can coincide." They have learned, however, that true patriotism cannot coincide with the religion of Rome. "Despite all the efforts of the popes, the church remains hostile to the state, and desires its overthrow; and, to the common people, the church is represented in its worst and most medieval aspects by its most widely circulated organs. It is no wonder that this provokes the state to hostility and reprisals. The condition is an extremely sad one." And it would be sadder still if the government submitted to the decrees of the church without a protest.

The Independent then proceeds to justify secular government, as follows:—

"Why is it that we have here utter peace between church and state, while France has war, and Great Britain has constant disturbance? The reason is a simple one. In this country the church tells the state that it will have none of its help, and so none of its interference. . . . There will be no real peace anywhere between the two so long as either meddles with the functions of the other. Just now the Duke of Newcastle, a leader of the English Ritualists, declares that the only remedy for the restraint they suffer is through disestablishment. He is right, and so becomes the ally of all Free Churchmen. Ritualists in the Anglican Church ought to be allowed to do foolish things, such as the use of incense, and to hold and teach unreasonable things, such as the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the bread and wine of the sacrament. They should have the right to be wrong, and the restraint of their religious freedom is a tyranny. So in France, as long as the state supports the church, and so many sorts of church, Christian and Jewish, it will have a fight with the church. A complete severance is the only way to peace."
