From Speech in Congress by Senator Hoar, April 17.

First—I would declare now that we will not take these islands to govern them against their will.

Second—I would reject a cession of sovereignty which implies that sovereignty may be bought and sold and delivered without the consent of the people. Spain has no rightful sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. She could not rightfully sell it to us. We can not rightfully buy it from her.

Third—I would require all foreign governments to keep out of these islands.

Fourth—I would offer to the people of the Philippines our help in maintaining order until they have a reasonable opportunity to establish a government of their own.

Fifth—I would aid them by advice, if they desire it, to set up a free and independent government.

Sixth—I would invite all the Great Powers of Europe to unite in an agreement that that independence shall not be interfered with by us, by themselves, or by any one of them with the consent of the others.

Seventh—I would declare that the United States will enforce the same doctrine as applicable to the Philippines that we declared as to Mexico and Hayti and the South American Republics. It is true that the Monroe Doctrine, a doctrine based largely on our regard for our own interests, is not applicable either in terms or in principle to a distant Asiatic territory. But undoubtedly, having driven out Spain, we are bound, and have the right, to secure to the people we have liberated an opportunity, undisturbed and in peace, to establish a new government for themselves.

Eighth—I would then, in not a distant future, leave them to work out their own salvation, as every nation on earth, from the beginning of time, has wrought out its own salvation. Let them work out their own salvation, as our own ancestors slowly and in long centuries wrought out theirs; as Germany, as Switzerland, as France, in briefer periods, wrought out theirs; as Mexico and the South American Republics have accomplished theirs, all of them within a century, some of them within the life of a generation. To attempt to confer the gift of freedom from without, or to impose freedom from without on any people, is to disregard all the lessons of history. It is to attempt

A gift of that which is not to be given
By all the blended powers of earth and heaven.

Ninth—I would strike out of your legislation the oath of allegiance to us and substitute an oath of allegiance to their own country.
