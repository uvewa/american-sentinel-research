*"Sabbath Recorder."*

It is interesting to note that most of the appeals for the enforcement of the existing Sunday laws are made upon the ground that all men must be compelled to cease from business on Sunday lest the few who desire to cease, from religious motives, shall suffer pecuniary loss. The effort to close barber-shops, for example, is made upon the ground that some barbers want to rest on Sunday, but they cannot unless they lose patronage which those who keep open on Sunday will take from them. Therefore, it is urged that the state must interfere and compel those who do not desire to close to do so for the sake of others. Such appeals lose sight of the idea of conscience, or the willingness on the part of men to suffer loss for the sake of right-doing. The case is pushed still lower because, in most instances, those who want to close desire to do so that they may have leisure for recreation, and not from any religious motive. A man whose conscience toward God and right-doing is what it ought to be, would readily accept the loss of wages, or of a day's business for the sake of right.
