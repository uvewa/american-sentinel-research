THE "religious census" idea is being tried in Toronto, Canada. The Canadian Baptist says of it:—

"A general canvass is being made of the city of Toronto, by house to house inquiry as to church and Sunday school attendance of the occupants. The canvassers are being generally acceptably secured, but in some cases their inquiries are resented as impertinently inquisitive. These are no doubt among the lapsed members of the different communions."
