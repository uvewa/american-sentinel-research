The movement for the enforcement of Sunday observance in this country, which is being pushed by the religious organizations engaged in the promotion of moral reforms—as they view them—has taken the form in some cities of "Sunday Observance Leagues," which aim to bring pressure upon Sunday desecrators both by the enforcement of Sunday laws, and by the boycott wherever this weapon can be made effective. The following from the Richmond, Va., Times, of recent date, describing a meeting of the Sunday Observance League of that city, gives a fair idea of the nature and working of these organizations:—

"The pastors and laymen of the city interested in the organization of the Sunday Observance League of Richmond and vicinity, met last night in the Assembly Hall of the Smithdeal Building, at Ninth and Broad Streets.

"The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Eugene C. Massie, who called upon Rev. Dr. William S. Campbell to invoke God's blessing upon their meeting and work.

"The minutes of the last meeting were read by Mr. G. M. Smithdeal, secretary of the meeting, in which connection he read the constitution as discussed at that time, but not adopted.

"Upon the adoption of the constitution there was much discussion and several amendments offered. Rev. Mr. Goodwin, of St. John's, moved the adoption of the constitution as amended, but Mr. Campbell asked that the section of the constitution which stated the object of the league be read, to which he offered an amendment, striking out that section which stated that its object should be to enforce the observance of Sunday as a civil institution, and stated that if the enforcement of the existing laws be the only object of the league he feared it would not succeed.

"'The citizens of Richmond,' said Mr. Campbell, 'should be educated to a proper observance of the Sabbath. The officers do not do their duty now, because they are not backed by public opinion. We will not,' he continued, 'accomplish a great deal if we restrict ourselves to the enforcement of present law, and to securing necessary legislation for the proper observance of the Sabbath as a civil institution.'

"Mr. R. E. Gary took the other side of the question, and said that he thought it better to stand on the basis of enforcing the law. 'The law,' said he, 'is the only thing we can enforce, and if we succeed in doing that it will be enough.'

"Rev. Mr. Goodwin agreed with Mr. Gary. He said: 'You cannot find three men who will agree as to how the Sabbath should be observed. That question must be left to a man's conscience and for him to decide. We can organize this league, but cannot dictate to any man what he shall do on Sunday.'

"'Let the league,' he concluded, 'enforce the civil Sabbath, but each member use his influence on his neighbor for the proper observance of the day.'

"Mr. Campbell's attention was called to the fact that the constitution contained the provision that each member should use his influence to the end that the Sabbath be properly observed. Mr. Campbell stated that he had overlooked that provision, and that that was exactly what he desired; consequently he withdrew his amendment.

### A BOYCOTT PROPOSED.

"Mr. Thomas C. Diggs said that he was in favor of circulating a petition asking the citizens to withhold their patronage from those places of business which kept open on Sunday, and that he thought extraordinary means should be resorted to by the league in accomplishing their object. 'I know,' he said, 'that I am speaking for a lost cause, but I do not think we should be content to enforce the law and go no farther. We should arouse the people and show them a better way to keep the Sabbath by circulating literature, holding mass meetings, and interesting the people.'

"'What if we do enforce the law? We can only close a man's shop and put him in jail possibly, but that should not be the whole aim of our league.'

### EXCURSIONS TARGOED.

"Mr. T. W. Wood spoke in regard to Sunday excursions, and went on to say that only the other day he was talking with a city official, who said that the officers were willing and able to carry out the law, but that the courts would not sustain them.

"Mr. Campbell was appointed a committee of one to have a thousand copies of the constitution printed, and to mail a copy to each and every pastor in Richmond and vicinity, with the request that they read the same to their congregations, and appoint from their churches a committee of five to solicit members for the league."
