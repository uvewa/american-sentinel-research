Dr. Thoburn, of the Central M. E. Church, of Detroit, addressed the "New England Society," of that city, Tuesday evening, April 17, on "The Meaning of Our Monuments."

He said, "The Puritan spirit of to-day is the spirit of freedom and independence and intelligence and integrity and industry." His excellent interpretation of Bunker Hill was that it "declares the inalienable right of human beings to be free!"

With true and prophetic utterance he said, "We are approaching the greatest crisis in our history!" What does Dr. Thoburn see which should call forth such a sentiment as this? Ah, "There is a worse calamity," he says, "than war." "We are threatened by the perils of liberty." "If we should drop out of our providential place, and if we were to fall self-betrayed, what would become of the temple of civil and religious liberty? . . . If we fail, it will be the most disastrous wreck the world has known. If we succeed, it will be the sublimest victory in all the annals of time."

It is his hope we shall succeed. But whatever the issue, the crisis of which he speaks is surely coming. Let us view the whole situation from the true view point,—God's Word—and upon its promises trust for deliverance; for to all such ones, deliverance will be given.

Clifford G. Howell.
Brighton, Mich., April 18, 1900.
