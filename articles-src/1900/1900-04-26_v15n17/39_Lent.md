*From the "Canadian Baptist."*

This word means Spring. It comes to us from an old Saxon verb which means to lengthen; because in the Spring the days grow long. But the word has an ecclesiastical meaning. It denotes that season of forty days preceding and leading up to Easter, during which people are supposed to fast, in imitation of our Lord's fasting in the wilderness before his temptation.

The observance of Lent began early in the development of the system known as Roman Catholicism. The date of its institution is doubtful; but directions concerning its observance were issued by the Pope in 311 A. D. The fast has also been adopted in the Greek and Episcopalian denominations. The purpose of the institution of this long fast was sanitary. In olden days, the festivities of the Christmas time were such as would be considered barbarous by us. The community was given over to banqueting, reveling, eating, drinking and all manner of dissipation. This went on for weeks before Christmas, and continued for weeks after the New Year. For the time being everybody was given over to unrestrained license and the gratification of appetite. There could be but one result. The end of the Christmas and New Year festivals found the people surfeited in body, stupefied in mind, beclouded in spirit. Some means must be found to restore to health these three departments of human life, and Lent was devised for that purpose. Let the people for forty days live plainly. Let them forego luxuries and confine themselves to necessities. Let them cease wandering about at all hours, and let them abide at home. This was certainly common sense, and a good program for the whole year as well as for the Spring-time. How was this to be enforced? Make it a religious observance; and like the sanitary laws of Moses, and the ablutions of Mohammed, it becomes practicable. This was done, and the result is Lent.

Is there the same reason for the observance of this fast as in days of old? Yes, verily. For many people the winter months are still times of revelry. There are still scores of people who live in a very merry-go-round of social enjoyment. The writer knows of one woman whose invitations for one season numbered ninety-seven. Twice, at the close of the season, has this woman gone to the hospital with nervous prostration. Such fast livers need a season of retirement, or they will become physical and spiritual wrecks.

Is the observance of Lent the true remedy for this social ailment? Not by any means. There is a more excellent way. Let the whole year be dedicated, not to five o'clock prayers, and week night vigils, and punishing of the flesh by abstaining from food, but to "living soberly, righteously and godly." Let us have our citizenship always in heaven, and let us look for the appearing of our Lord Jesus; and we shall need no forty days of special self-denial, because every day will be given to God.
