Speaking of present relations in the South between planters and ex-slaves, the writer of the "Louisiana letter" to the New York Sun tells how the forms of slavery in that region have survived the overthrow of the institution—facts suggestive of the ease with which slavery could be re-established if the barriers of public sentiment and constitutional law erected against it by the Civil War should be—as seemingly they are steadily being—removed:—

"Practically the mental attitude of the planter toward his former slaves, and the children of those slaves, is unchanged to-day. He does not pay taxes on them. If one of them is executed for murder, he is not entitled to recover one-half his value from the state. He regards them still as dependents, however. Most often he names them when they are infants. He acts as sole arbiter and judge in their disputes. If they are sick he gives them medicine, and his wife and daughters nurse them if the battle with death be a hard one. Each Christmas morning, as in the old time, they come up to the 'big house,' dressed in their best, to yell 'Chris' mus gif!' and get their presents. If one of them wishes leave of absence from the plantation, he is apt to request it as deferentially and hopefully as in the days before the war. If refused, he returns quietly to his labor, muttering a little and rolling his eyes viciously toward any other 'fiel' nigger' who may be laughing at him.

"It is not by any means an infrequent sight in 1900 to see a planter in the field on horseback while in front of him a gang of the ebon laborers are toiling. He is 'overseeing' them, just as in 1850 his father's overseer oversaw them. One of the negroes, a burly buck weighing 200 pounds of bone and muscle, will be lazy. He will lag behind his companions and turn a deaf ear to adjurations. Then will the planter swing himself from the saddle, throw the reins over his horse's head, take a whip of rawhide in his right hand and belabor the recalcitrant hoeman right heartily. When he thinks that enough punishment has been administered, he goes back on his horse and the negro resumes work with a notable acceleration of speed. He may dance about and yell while the lash is applied, but he will never think of resisting. He will lower his bull head and butt the soul out of any companion who presumes to taunt him with his chastisement, but toward the planter he has the attitude of a repentant child which knows that it has deserved correction."
