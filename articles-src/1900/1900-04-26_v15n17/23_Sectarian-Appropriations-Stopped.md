New York "Independent."

For the first time in fifteen years the Indian Appropriation bill goes through Congress shorn of any provision in aid of sectarian schools among Indians, commonly known as contract schools. The coming fiscal year will perhaps be the first since 1819 that Government appropriations for Indian education will be applied solely to the support of schools carried on by the Government.

This is the consummation of a policy outlined by Congress in 1895. For that fiscal year the allowance for contract schools was over $2,000,000. In each succeeding year Congress reduced this allowance 20, 30, 10, 10 and 15 per cent., leaving only 15 per cent., or less than $60,000, available for the current fiscal year. The contract schools have thus had ample opportunity to adjust themselves to inevitable Americanism, and the Indian Bureau has meantime largely increased its own facilities for taking care of Indian pupils.

A vigorous attempt was made in Congress to continue contract school appropriations on the specious plea that the enrollment in Government schools being already greater than the capacity of those schools, no place could be found for an average of 2,000 or more Indian children who are now being cared for under contract until the Indian Bureau should erect more buildings in which to house them. This would, of course, require a year or more at the very least. But the argument fell to the ground when it was pointed out that the average attendance on Government schools was less than their capacity, and, moreover, that the Indian Bureau stood ready, and had done so for several years, to purchase any contract school plant that might be offered.

Of the 25,202 Indian pupils enrolled in school last year, 20,712 were in schools supported by the Government, 2,903 in contract schools aided by the Government, 326 in public schools at Government expense, and 1,261 in mission schools without expense to the Government. There is, therefore, no question that the Government will be able to take care of any Indian pupils now in contract schools whom those schools shall be unwilling or unable to provide for next year.
