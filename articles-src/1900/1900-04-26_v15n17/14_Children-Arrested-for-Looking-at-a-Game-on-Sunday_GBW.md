The working of the Massachusetts Sunday law was seen recently in the arrest of two boys in Somerville only 13 and 14 years of age, who were taken through the streets in an open patrol wagon, followed by a crowd and guarded by an officer, and were both fined for the crime of looking on at a game of marbles played by other boys on Sunday. The boys injured no one, infringed upon no one's rights, but were themselves injured by being placed openly before the public as criminals, made to pay a fine, without any just reason whatever. Yet the advocates of Sunday laws claim that they are made in the interests of humanity. That this is not the case is plainly shown in the above incident. Whenever the interests of humanity stands in the way of Sunday observance it does not weigh a feather.

Sunday laws are tyrannical; they take away the individual right of judgment in the matter of sacred days, and compel him to observe Sunday as a sacred day regardless of his belief, or interests. The ridiculous character of our Sunday laws was seen in a ruling of the Supreme Court recently, which allows cigars to be sold by a druggist on Sunday because they are a drug, but they are not to be sold at other places. Now as Sunday laws are declared to be made in the interests of humanity, and to preserve the sacred character of the day, the query is, how is humanity served, or the day kept sacred by having cigars bought at a drug store and smoked as a drug, rather than bought at some other place as a commodity, and smoked as a commodity?
