For several years the Sultan of Turkey has been making promises to the American Government to pay a claim of $100,000 damages demanded for loss sustained by American missions in Turkey. The Government is now bringing pressure to bear upon the sultan, and the European nations who have unsuccessfully tried to collect damages on similar grounds from the Turkish ruler, are interested spectators of the effort now being made by "Uncle Sam." What adds more interest to the situation is the report that the sultan relies upon his power in the Philippines to check the American Government in the event of resort to extreme measures. What this means is explained by the statement that "there are in the Philippines more than 3,500,000 Mohammedans, whose devotion to their calipha is fanatic. The sultan would have but to lift his finger and these Malays and Moros would join forces with the Tagalogs. The war in Luzon would be extended in every direction throughout the islands, and the American forces would necessarily have to be greatly increased."
