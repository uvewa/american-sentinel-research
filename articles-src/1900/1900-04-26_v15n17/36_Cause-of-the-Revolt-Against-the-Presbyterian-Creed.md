New York "Sun."

This being a period of keen sensibility to all suffering, the thought that God has condemned or will condemn a great part or any part of his creatures to everlasting torment in hell is horrible to many people. Societies for the prevention of cruelty, not only to children, but also to animals, have been established . . . Cruel and unusual punishments have been abolished throughout civilization. The method of administering the death penalty prescribed by law has been changed in this State on grounds of pure humanity from hanging to killing by electricity. It has also been made secret, and the time when the execution of the sentence is to be carried out has been made indefinite, so that the assumed public demoralization by the old manner of hanging and the shock to the public sensitiveness caused by it shall be diminished. Meantime at nearly every session of the legislature of this State earnest efforts are made to secure the abolition of the death penalty as a remnant of savagery, and in five States it has already been abolished actually. Even in war, Red Cross activities are expended to mitigate the miseries, to inflict which is the purpose of war. People nowadays suffer sympathetically whenever they see suffering. They turn away with revulsion or indignation when a horse is whipped. So keen is this sensibility in many people that they will not even read of cruelty practised or endured.

At such a period the doctrine, once universally accepted by Christendom, that never-ending torture is to be administered by God to the condemned denizens of hell becomes inexpressibly revolting to sensitive souls. They may declare in formal creeds that they believe in it, but in their hearts they reject it as impossible.

This doctrine of hell is thus expressed in the Westminster Confession, and as there formulated it is essentially that of Christendom generally:—

"God hath appointed a day wherein He will judge the world in righteousness by Jesus Christ, to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father. . . .

"The end of God's appointing this day is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect, and of his justice in the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient. For then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and refreshing which shall come from the presence of the Lord; but the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power."

It is the revolt of the keen sensibility of this time at such a possibility which is the real motive of the present Presbyterian outcry for the revision of its confession of faith.
