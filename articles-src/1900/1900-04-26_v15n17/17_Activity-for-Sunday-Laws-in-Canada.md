THE "Lord's Day Alliance," the chief organization in Canada for promoting the enforcement of Sunday observance, is vigorously at work in this field of mistaken endeavor, according to the following, which we note in the *Canadian Baptist*:—

"This organization is taking on more vigorous life since the appointment of Rev. J. G. Shearer as Field Secretary, to devote his whole time to its work. Public meetings have been held in many of the chief centers, and the work of the Alliance is being more thoroughly organized and pushed. Various forms of Sabbath breaking have been discovered. In the border towns, American Sunday newspapers are being circulated on the Lord's day. Refreshment booths are being opened on the Sabbath day along the line of bicycle travel. A large paper mill in Cornwall is being run, and in other places building, repairing, etc., is being done, and photograph galleries are open, on the Lord's day. Most lamentable of all, in certain sections, Sunday excursions are gotten up by certain churches to attend grave decorations, laying of corner stones, opening of new edifices, etc.

"The very existence of the Alliance is having a restraining influence upon would-be Sabbath breakers and Sabbath breaking, as it is known that law breaking in reference to this day will lead to legal proceedings. We give the Alliance our hearty sympathy in its efforts to preserve a day of rest for our people. While we as Baptists cannot seek Sabbath legislation for the sake of religion as would some, we can aid in securing laws for the protection of one day of rest on civil and economic grounds. There is no more serious threat to the best interests of our country than in the encroachment business and pleasure are making upon the Sabbath institution. Let us be wide awake to protect it by every legitimate means."
