## SUBJECTION TO THE HIGHER POWERS.

PAUL says, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God." The words, "higher powers," do not here mean civil powers, but heavenly powers. Heaven is higher than earth; God's law is above all earthly or civil laws. Man's first duty is to obey God, that is, the "higher powers." Man should also obey the "powers that be," that is, the civil powers, when those powers are in perfect harmony with the "higher powers" that be, the kingdom of Heaven, the government of God. The law of God is made for all the universe, and every being that obeys this law is subject to the higher powers. This obedience and subjection exists in every inhabited world but ours, and Paul was desirous that it should exist in this one, therefore the injunction, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers." We should honor God's law before the highest earthly powers, and when we do so we show that we are subject to the higher powers. We should do this although the powers that be command us, under penalty of death, to do otherwise.

This test will soon be brought to bear upon those professing godliness, as it was upon the Hebrew captives when they refused to bow down to a graven image at the command of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon. They were subject to the higher powers, but were not in this instance subject to the powers that be. We may ask, Why did they not obey the king of Babylon? Why were they not subject to the powers that be? We answer, they disobeyed the king and were not subject to the powers that be, for one reason and for only one; and that is, if they had not done so they would not have been subject to the higher powers. So the only right thing for them to do was to be not subject to the powers that be, but at the same time be subject to the penalty that must follow the violation of the civil statute. This is exactly what they did, and God signally justified them in their course. If they had obeyed the king in this instance, they would have disobeyed God.

This shows us how far we can be subject to the powers that be. It must be in everything that does not conflict with the higher powers. It is evident that this point is not well understood. Why so? Because we are often asked, Shall we not obey the powers that be? Our answer always has been and must be, Yes, when the commands of the powers that be are in harmony with the higher powers that be. In so doing we shall recognize God as the supreme ruler, and thus honor the law of his kingdom. This the meek and humble Jesus did, and this the meek and humble follower of Jesus will do. From the course events have taken in our nation the past few years, we may conclude it will not be long before the test that was brought upon the Hebrew captives will be our test. Rev. 13: 10-18. May we endure as they endured.

H. W. REED.
