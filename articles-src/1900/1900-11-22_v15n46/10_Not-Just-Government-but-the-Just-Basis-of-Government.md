# NOT JUST GOVERNMENT, BUT THE JUST BASIS OF GOVERNMENT.

Civil government may or may not be just, and we can not reasonably expect that any form of civil government always will be just; but it is possible that civil government should always rest upon a just basis, and the people have a right to expect and demand that this shall be true of the government under which they live.

The United States has not always been a just Government, but it has always rested on the just basis of civil government. The Government was for a long period unjust to the negro—it maintained the system of negro slavery. Other acts of injustice might be cited. But all the time the basis of the Government has been a just one—the consent of the governed. The basis of this Government is the principles announced to the world when the nation had its birth—July 4, 1776. Those principles are stated in the Declaration of Independence. The reason why the colonists separated from Great Britain, as there stated, is that Great Britain did not recognize the "self-evident truths" that "all men are created equal," that the Creator has endowed all with "certain unalienable rights," and that the purpose of civil governments among men is to "preserve these rights," and therefore that civil governments derive "their just powers from the consent of the governed." The colonists separated from Great Britain in order that they might establish a government which should recognize these truths—which should be established upon this basis. In the Constitution, however, there was a recognition of the system of negro slavery; the Government was not true to its own basic principles, and the Civil War was the terrible price it had to pay for its inconsistency and its injustice.

The consent of the governed means always the just basis of government, but it cannot always mean justice in government. And an act of injustice or incompetency on the part of a republican government cannot properly be used as an argument for dispensing with the consent of the governed and setting up a different form of government. Nor can the fact that the only government that would never do injustice would necessarily be based upon the law of God, be taken as an argument for making that law the basis of civil government in the United States. The government of God is based on the law of God, and is never unjust; but should men try to administer the civil government on that basis, they would do terrible injustice to some of the people all the time.

Touching this distinction between just government and government on a just basis, the following statements, addressed to the *Outlook* by one of its correspondents, are to the point:

"When you deliberately reject this moral basis of government [the consent of the governed], and treat as illusive the central idea of our national life, not a few of your readers are shocked. A favorite illustration with you is the sanitary gain to Santiago under General Wood. Suppose, if Maximilian had established his throne, that he would have cleansed Vera Cruz of yellow fever, would that justify his forcible government of the Mexicans? Your illustrations of the rule of Quay and of the Tammany Society would be to the point if the Declaration said that all governments resting in consent of the governed are just. Instead, the principle declared is that the test of fitness of a government to do its work and be rightly administered is the moral basis, the support of a majority of the citizens. None maintain that such a government is necessarily just; but that, when sustained by the popular will, its errors are, on the whole, less than its effect if enforced from a power without, acting against that will.

"The injustice and mistakes of governments constituted by the people are inevitable. But we do not question that the Supreme Court at Washington is a just and right depository of judicial power because of its errors in the Dred Scot case, or in its last decision against the income tax. Compared with the slow but pervasive and natural growth of public sentiment leading to an enlightened consent of the governed, the arbitrary and forcible rule—even if benevolent, hygienic, and puritanic—is plainly against nature, and is not less tyranny because it has good ends in view. Surely this gradual process of education and consent is the ethical, moral way—the method of divine rule and revelation in the world; and the readers of the *Outlook* have learned to look for enlightened spiritual theories of government, and not to expect there arguments for the obsolete, materialistic, and specious doctrine of so-called Divine Right as a basis of ruling others against their consent."

The reason why civil government can not be based on the law of God is that no man or assembly of men—king, emperor, or a majority of the people—are competent to apply the law of God to human affairs with infallible correctness.
