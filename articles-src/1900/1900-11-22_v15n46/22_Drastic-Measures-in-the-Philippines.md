ACCORDING to the New York *Tribune's Philippine correspondent* American control in those islands has been too lenient, and there is to be commenced at once a "drastic" campaign against those who fight for "liberty and loot." He reports a Spanish friar as saying: "You could stop this revolution at once if you wanted to by taking drastic measures against the leaders; shoot them on the Luneta, or banish them, and the people will believe you are in earnest in your efforts to stamp out revolt." This is exactly what a Spanish friar might be expected to say. It was the tyranny and "drastic measures" of the friars that drove the Filipinos to war in the first place.
