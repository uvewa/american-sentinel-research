## SUNDAY FISHING APPROVED.

"It is all right to fish on Sunday," declares the rector of the Episcopal Church at Lake Geneva, Wis., whose congregation includes many prominent society people, with a number of millionaires who have summer homes at Lake Geneva. The propriety of Sunday fishing is, however, according to this authority, limited by circumstances. If a man is busy through the week working to support his family so that he has no time to go fishing it is all right he says for him to engage in this sport on Sunday, "provided he has done his duty to his Maker by attendance upon divine service at some place of worship." But "when a man can fish any and all of the six days of the week it is wrong for him to do so on Sunday." While fishing is in itself an innocent pastime on any day, says this Episcopal clergyman, it is made "sinful when we indulge in it to the neglect of our religious obligations."

This opinion touching this popular form of Sunday sport is quite in harmony with the Roman Catholic conception of proper Sunday observance, and as history shows us no authority for Sunday observance other than the Roman Catholic Church, we see no reason why the propriety of Sunday fishing should be questioned, although the rector's statement is said to have given something of a shock to the larger part of the congregation to whom it was spoken. Fishing is not at all in harmony with the Bible idea of Sabbath-keeping, it is true, but while authority for Sabbath-day fishing is wanting in the text-book of Christianity it is equally wanting for the obligation of Sunday. The Bible idea of Sabbath-keeping belongs with the day Scripturally designated as the Sabbath, which is not the first day of the week, but the seventh. The Roman Catholic conception of Sabbath-keeping, on the other hand, belongs with the day set apart by decree of that church, which is Sunday. And the longer the Protestants churches hold on to Sunday the more will they approximate to the Roman Catholic idea of religious obligations and the more completely will they be drawn back to the ground occupied by the church from which they drew away in the sixteenth century. In short, Protestants must either give up Sunday as a religious day or give up Protestantism. To this decision they are held by a logic that is inexorable. And of this the Papacy is well aware.
