# THE LAW OF GOD AND THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE.

Some weeks ago the Outlook, a prominent eastern journal, replying to a correspondent's query as to what basis civil government rested on if not on the consent of the governed, said that the proper basis of civil government is the law of God. Replying to this, another correspondent inquires: "Who is to say what the law of God is? The Pope at Rome? He claims that right. The Czar in Russia? He crowned himself with the phrase, 'Dei Gratia'—'by the Grace of God.' The Kaiser in Germany? He says he is the vicegerent of God on earth, and will interpret God's law to his subjects. Will it be in your opinion an aristocracy? Such was the despotism of the old regime in France. * * * Or would you turn over to a plutocracy the power of saying what is the law of God? Plutocracies are claiming the power now because they say they represent the intelligence and will, the executive power and brains, of the community,—hence they should do the directing.

"If you ask me to answer this question, I will say that there is no infallible discoverer and stater of the law of God on this earth. No prophet, no book, no priest, no king, no class of men, no matter how well born or highly trained, no parliament, no matter how skillfully chosen, not even the majority of the people, no matter how calmly and deliberately their voting is taken, will always tell us aright what the law of God is, and always apply it aright."

This is manifestly true, so far as human authorities are concerned, because no man is infallible, and therefore no number of men can be infallible, and only an infallible authority can be trusted to define the will of God. And this is just the reason why the law of God cannot be the proper basis of civil government. Not that there is anything faulty in the law of God, but man is finite and fallible, and as the authority in all civil government is necessarily human, the law of God, *as interpreted and applied by civil government*, would not constitute a correct standard of righteousness to which men could justly be held amenable. But mankind must be held strictly accountable to the divine law if the government of God is to be upheld before men and before the universe, and therefore an infallible authority to reveal to mankind the will of God is indispensable to God's eternal purpose for mankind; and there exists just such an authority, namely, the Holy Spirit. The Spirit interprets to men the meaning of the word of God, the Bible. This enlightenment of the Spirit being conditioned on the exercise of faith, it follows that each individual must be enlightened by himself and for himself alone, and therefore that the only government which can properly have the law of God for its basis is one whose fundamental law is made known, not by a supreme court or by decree of pope or king or the vote of a majority, but by the Spirit of God. The law of God, in other words, can be the basis only of the government of God.

But the correspondent before quoted believes that the voice of the majority, while not infallible, must in any case prevail over the voice of the individual or over that of the minority. He says:

"Far superior to any minority is the voice of the majority of the people. The individual has a right to his own opinion as to what is the law of God. He has the right to advocate it even unto his own death if he deems that necessary or wise. He has not the right to impose his opinion on others. Society, as an organic whole, speaking by the voice of the majority, has a right to say that this or that is a social matter, and to it the individual must submit because it is not an individual matter, but it concerns the whole."

Has society a right to say that Sabbath observance is a "social matter" and not an individual matter? and must the individual submit in this to the dictates of the majority? But still stronger than this is the following quoted by the *Outlook* from the *Springfield Republican*:

"Is there any other way within reach of human society of so perfectly consulting God as through the conscience of the people, not one or several, but all—the general conscience, freed, as far as it ever can be found, of the individual warp and twist of interest or pride or prejudice or sin or hereditary defect?"

Now put with these quotations the following statement made by Rev. David McAllister, editor of the *Christian Statesman* and chief spokesman of the National Reform party, made at a hearing before a committee of Congress in behalf of a bill to "Christianize" the Constitution:

"I say it comes to this: This matter of conscience is one that goes back to the moral sense of the people. It is not simply an individual conscience. * * Here is the nation which gives its decision according to its sense of right and wrong. That is the national conscience, and when the nation thus gives its decision, individuals whose conscientious views may conflict— * * * in such cases the individual conscience must yield to the conscience of the whole people which is over him, and should be over him in order to enforce what is right, but which can be over him only by recognizing the Lord's supreme authority over the nation."

The essential harmony of these three quotations is apparent. The *Outlook* says that the proper basis of civil government is not the consent of the governed, but the law of God. Some of its readers and exchanges give expression to a different view, but all agree in saying that the individual conscience must submit to the "public conscience" or the "state conscience" which must be over the individual to "enforce what is right." And if civil government does not rest on the consent of the governed, the law of God is the only other basis on which it can be alleged to rest. As surely, therefore, as that the doctrine of government by consent of the governed is being abandoned in this country, we are coming to the time when the "conscience of the people," the "voice of the majority," will decide for the individual what are the requirements of the law of God; not questions of political economy and national prosperity in secular affairs as heretofore, but questions of religion, in which an individual is bound by conscience toward God. This is the National Reform scheme which that party has long been seeking to have realized in the nation. To this false and ruinous ideal of civil government we are now hastening.
