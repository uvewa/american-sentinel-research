THE recent lynching of a colored criminal in Lincoln County, Colorado, is generally admitted to be the worst example of this form of lawlessness that has occurred in any part of this country. Terrible as was the crime for which this criminal was put to death (by burning at the stake), the fact remains that lawlessness can not be suppressed by lawlessness; fire can not be extinguished with fire. The education the public mind receives from such occurrences is necessarily of the most baleful kind. What other conclusion can be drawn from them but that the people are losing that regard for their own constitutional forms of justice which indicates the faculty of self-government?
