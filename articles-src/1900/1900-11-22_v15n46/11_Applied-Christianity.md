## APPLIED CHRISTIANITY.

We are heartily in favor of applied Christianity, because we believe in Christianity and know from observation and from the testimony of others that the application of its principles to the affairs and conditions of human society tends to elevate human character and alleviate human misery.

But we do not believe that in order to apply Christianity it is ever necessary for a Christian to do that which in itself is wrong or to put on an appearance of evil, since both these things are contrary to express injunctions of Scripture. And, therefore, we cannot agree with the idea of applied Christianity presented in the following editorial by a leading Chicago paper, the *Inter-Ocean*, and printed under the heading given this article:

"The Rev. H. M. Allen of this city offers the latest novelty in applied Christianity. In the district where Mr. Allen lives the sale of strong drink is forbidden. Sundry persons constantly seek to violate this prohibition. Few of the citizens who stand for temperance thereabouts are fitted by experience to get the evidence necessary to convict the law breakers. Many of them never took a drink of any alcoholic liquor. Hence, they find it difficult to go into court and swear that any beverage which happens to be in question is of the forbidden kind.

"Now it occurred to the Rev. Mr. Allen that certain experiences of his youth, long since repented, might be made profitable to righteousness. So he did not thunder in his pulpit over the blighting influence of the dramshop, but went quietly to the suspected places, bought and consumed their illicit merchandise, and then appeared as a witness in court against the sellers.

"When asked how he knew that he had bought beer from the accused, Mr. Allen answered that when a college student he was in the habit of drinking beer and had not forgotten its taste and effects, although he had ceased to indulge in its use. As a result of Mr. Allen's efforts, the 'blind-pig' business on the South Side is proving decidedly unprofitable.

"Many people doubtless felt a decided shock when they read of a minister's visiting saloons, even for the purpose of obtaining evidence against violators of the law. Upon reflection such feeling will be seen to have but little justification. While many worthy people consider beer drinking a sin, they will admit it is not a crime. But the selling of liquors in certain places and to certain persons is a crime.

"Now, the duty of every good Christian to the commonwealth is plain. The injunction, 'Render unto Caesar,' and others like it, are universally held to require a Christian to obey and help enforce the laws and to aid in the punishment of crime. While we may rejoice, for many reasons, that it is seldom necessary for a minister to run the risk of getting drunk in order to discharge his duty to the state, we must confess that the risk, in cases of necessity, involves no moral turpitude.

"Mr. Allen unquestionably limits his example in beer drinking to cases which he deems of absolute necessity. Any man, no matter how high his moral standards, feels justified in taking human life under certain conditions. The end does not justify the means, but it often justifies unusual activity. In taking an unusual method to protect his parishioners from the evil of grog-shops at their doors Mr. Allen doubtless feels entirely justified. And the common-sense Christian, while he may not applaud Mr. Allen's course, will think long before condemning his application of Christianity."

The trouble with the "applied Christianity" of this day is that men want to apply Christianity in some other way than was shown to the world by its divine Author. The life of Jesus of Nazareth, who "went about doing good," is purely a record of applied Christianity, and that record was written in order that the men of this day might apply Christianity according to the perfect example set them long ago in Judea. But many who profess faith in Christianity to-day seem to have lost faith in Christ's way of applying it to the heart of the individual sinner through his faith in its author, and want to apply it to society *en masse* through the civil government. It is sufficient condemnation of this kind of "applied Christianity" that it finds no warrant for its claims in the teaching or example of Jesus.
