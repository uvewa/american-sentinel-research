The *Catholic Mirror* reports that an informal conference was held in Philadelphia, Sept. 16, to consider steps to be taken for the formation of the proposed Catholic federation in this country. A committee was appointed to issue a call to the various national Catholic organizations to select delegates to a preliminary meeting, which is to be held Thanksgiving day in New York City.
