## THE DESTRUCTION OF PEKING.

From the Michigan *Christian Advocate* of Nov. 17, we take the following description which pictures the present state of the former Chinese capital, after having fallen a prey to the armed forces of the "Christian nations:"

"Peking has been almost as thoroughly destroyed as Jerusalem of old. In the northern city were four allied banks supposed to be as safe as the Bank of England. All are destroyed and the bank bills thrown into the streets, burned, or carried off as souvenirs. The city gates and towns have been burned or leveled with the ground. The temple of heaven has been turned into a military camp. The palaces of princes and the handsome dwellings of the rich have either been razed or transformed into dwelling places for foreigners and headquarters for officers. The sacred temples and altars where mighty pagans worshiped, have been turned into stables for horses, doors to sacred retreats have been thrown open wide, and tablets to deified ancestors have been cast down or sent to museums in foreign lands. Around the base of the marble altars rinderpested cattle have been cremated in the very urns that were used for Imperial sacrifice. Surely the departed sages will turn in their graves if they know that those azure domes have been blackened by the smoke of burning beasts unfit for the table of foreign devils!"

The emperor's hall of fasting is a storage room for the army, and cart-loads of loot are sold at auction for a song in its courts. The world-famed libraries have been torn to pieces, costly volumes which can never be replaced destroyed, and innumerable essays and documents thrown to the four winds or turned into firewood for troops. The famous Han-Lin University is so completely demolished that only two of its spacious halls out of twenty-five remain. In the southern division of the city, where the anti-foreign sentiment has always been more pronounced than elsewhere, and where nick-names for all persons not Chinese reached the lowest line of the vocabulary, the encroachments of military devices and modern inventions are conspicuous and complete. The hated railroads, electric cars, and telegraph lines penetrate its spacious squares and thread its ancient streets, and large portions of its sacred soil, no foot of which could ever be purchased for missionary purposes, will hereafter be obtainable for foreigners' uses as foreigners may desire or ask.

"The 'forbidden city,' too, which no foreigner was ever allowed to enter, has been made as common as any other part, the British field artillery having three months ago penetrated its inmost recesses and fired a salute of one and twenty guns to indicate that the occupation in force of the innermost shrine of Chinese exclusiveness was now completely accomplished. Thus was added the last touch to the punishment of Peking."
