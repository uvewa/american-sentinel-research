AN illustrated lecture, entitled "The Passion Play," was advertised to be given in an opera house in Trenton, N. J., on Sunday evening, November 11. The pastor of the First Methodist church of that city "characterized the production of the lecture on a Sabbath and for pay as an outrage," and a painted sign was displayed in his church, reading as follows: "Don't go to an opera house show on the Sabbath. Come and hear the word of God."

Of course this minister has a right to speak his mind on this matter, and certainly his method of preventing "Sabbath-breaking" is far more commendable than the method that is frequently resorted to. It is better to invite people to come to church and hear the word of God than to command them under penalty of the law not to do something else that they wish to do.
