An institution of religion can never be a proper subject of human legislation.

***

The only reform which reforms is that which begins in the heart. True reform works from within outward, not from without inward.

***

The law of God is suited alone to the government of God. The law of the Infinite cannot be administered by finite man.

***

If one government must not attempt to enforce the laws of another government, then certainly no earthly government has any business trying to enforce the laws of the country and government of Heaven.

***

The only government that will never do injustice must be based on the law of God, but such a government must have God himself to administer it. With only man to administer such a government, it would be the worst of all governments.

From the Christian point of view, justification by faith is the only basis of true reform.

***

According to Christianity, every man has the right to work six days in every week, and also the right to determine his working days by the Word of God and his own conscience.

***

The law of God is perfect in itself, but as interpreted and applied to human affairs by men—as by Congress or a State legislature—it could not constitute a rule of righteous conduct. The office of interpreter of the law of God belongs to the Holy Spirit.
