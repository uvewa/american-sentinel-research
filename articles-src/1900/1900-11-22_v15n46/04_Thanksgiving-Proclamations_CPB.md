## THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATIONS.

The President of the United States and the governors of the several States have issued the usual Thanksgiving proclamations calling upon the people to lay aside their usual vocations on Thursday, the 29th day of November, and, assembling in their usual places of worship, give thanks to God for the blessings of the year. Of course no two of these proclamations are identical in phraseology, but while some are more devotional in tone than others, they one and all call upon the people to engage in acts of worship.

There is scarcely anything in our political system that affords a better illustration than does this custom of proclaiming days of thanksgiving, of how a wrong custom may come in time to have all the force of law.

Speaking of the principles of complete separation of church and state, Mr. Madison said: "There has been another deviation from the strict principle, in the executive proclamations of fasts and festivals."

Mr. Jefferson, while President, wrote to Rev. Mr. Miller, saying:

"I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, disciplines, or exercises."

This letter was written July 10, 1822. Seven years previous Mr. Jefferson, writing of an address from Baptists, said:

"The Baptist address, now enclosed, admits of a condemnation of the alliance between church and state under authority of the Constitution. It furnishes an occasion, too, which I have long wished to find, of saying why I do not proclaim fastings and thanksgivings as my predecessors did."

Mr. Jefferson's reason, briefly stated, was: "The Constitution has directly precluded them [the United States] from" assuming any authority over religious exercises.

"But," said Mr. Jefferson, "it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and prayer—that is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises which the Constitution has directly precluded them from. It must mean, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those who disregard it, not, indeed, of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps, in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed?"

Mr. Jefferson's reasoning is sound. It is manifestly improper for a civil ruler to issue religious proclamations. His recommendations must of necessity have something of the force of law, however much he may seek to make it appear otherwise, and, in the very nature of the case, they come in time to be clothed in more imperative language.

It is interesting to contrast the language of President McKinley's recent Thanksgiving proclamation with the idea of simply recommending such observance, which seems to have prevailed among all classes of citizens a century ago. Mr. McKinley designates Thursday, November 29, "to be observed by all the people of the United States, at home and abroad, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Him who holds the nations in the hollow of his hand."

Observe that the day is appointed and "set apart" "to be observed," not that it may be observed. The language is not permissive, but mandatory; and for this, not William McKinley, but custom is to blame. The recommendation of to-day becomes the command of to-morrow. A century ago the President was asked merely to recommend a day of religious observance; to-day he appoints and sets apart such a day "to be observed by all the people of the United States at home and abroad."

Nor did Mr. Jefferson object to religious proclamations solely from the standpoint of the Constitution. He maintained not only that such proclamations were inimical to religious liberty, but that they were also injurious to the best interests of religion. He said:

"I do not believe it is for the best interests of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines, nor of the religious societies that the general Government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoining of them an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands where the Constitution has deposited it."
