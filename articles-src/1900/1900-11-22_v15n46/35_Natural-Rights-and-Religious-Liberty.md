"I DON'T understand all this THE SENTINEL says about natural rights and religious liberty," some people are saying. Well, dear reader—if you are one of these—the subject of man's proper relation to the civil power, and of the distinction between the things of Caesar and the things of God, is rather a deep subject, and we can't help that; but it is an intensely practical subject. It is one you can not separate from your own experience, and that you will be called upon some day to explain. We do not ask you to study these things for our benefit, but for your own. The themes of the Scripture are deep, but we can not afford to skip them, nevertheless.
