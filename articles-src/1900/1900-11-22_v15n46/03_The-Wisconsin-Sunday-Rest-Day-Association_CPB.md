## THE WISCONSIN SUNDAY REST DAY ASSOCIATION.

The tenth annual convention of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association was held in Sheboygan, Wis., November 15 and 16. The president, Perry Millard, D.D., presided. The several meetings held in two of the largest churches and in the largest hall in the city were well attended by an excellent class of earnest Christian people.

The first meeting was held in the German Reformed church, and the first address and a portion of the devotional exercises were in the German language.

The address in German was by Rev. H. C. Nott, pastor of the German Reformed church of Milwaukee. His subject was "Der buergertiche Sontag und persoenliche Freiheit," or "The Civil Sunday and Personal Liberty."

Evidently Mr. Nott was deeply impressed with the importance of his subject, and with the danger the American people are in of allowing liberty to degenerate into license.

Mr. Nott seemed to entertain not even the shadow of a doubt as to the divine authority for Sunday. To him the "day when my Lord arose" and the day "blest at creation's close" are one and the same, and he plead eloquently for the preservation of Sunday as a day of worship, taking substantially the same position as Rev. Joseph Cook, of Boston, that "the Sabbath [Sunday] can not be long maintained as a day of rest unless it is maintained as a day of worship." The argument is an admission that the Sabbath is essentially a religious institution, dependent for its very existence upon its religious features. Therefore to ask the state to maintain the Sabbath is to ask it to maintain religious worship, for the latter is absolutely essential to the former.

Mr. Nott was at times eloquent, and again, as he reviewed the desecration of the day he holds sacred, his tone became pathetic. "It seems to me," he said, "that the sun shines brighter upon Sunday than on other days, and all nature unites in thanksgiving and praise to the Creator."

One thing, however, Mr. Nott forgot to tell his audience, namely, that while it is true that sin enslaves, and that in righteousness only is there liberty, let the people once admit—the principle become established—that the state may for any reason undertake to maintain religion, and personal liberty becomes only a memory. The Word of God teaches and all history testifies that religion, to be pure and uplifting, must be preserved separate from the civil power. The union of the two is corrupting, and in the Scriptures is called adultery.

### "The Epidemic of Crime."

The second address of the evening was by Rev. Judson Titsworth, of Milwaukee, and was in English. Mr. Titsworth's complete subject as assigned to him by the committee of arrangements was, "The Epidemic of Crime the Nation's Peril."

The speaker found fault with this phrasing of the subject, and spent not less than fifteen minutes in showing that "there is no epidemic of crime," and that the subject should have been described as "The Spirit of Lawlessness the Nation's Peril."

In Mr. Titsworth's opinion the world is rapidly growing better. This he sought to prove, not by statistics, but by glittering generalities and personal reminiscences. Forty years ago, he said, drinking was very common among ministers of the gospel. His own pastorate was separated by two pastorates from that of a highly esteemed old minister who habitually returned from his pastoral visitation, "not a little, but a good deal the worse for 'flap,'" a mixed drink common only two generations ago. But drinking is now practically unknown among ministers, and while still too common, in polite society drunkenness is everywhere disreputable.

But while looking upon the bright side of things, and cherishing as a sacred thing the belief that the world is growing better, Mr. Titsworth declared that there is a growing spirit of lawlessness which does constitute a menace to the nation. This lawless spirit is manifest in the failure and even refusal of civil officers to enforce the laws they are sworn to administer. Holding up the Sunday law of Wisconsin, he said:

"Go to-morrow morning to the mayor of the city or to some police justice and say to him, 'Here, so and so is violating this law; I want a warrant for him.' Do you suppose you would get it? No; he would laugh in your face."

This condition of affairs the speaker characterized as "anarchy."

That there is a growing spirit of lawlessness in this country, and that it is a menace to free institutions, there can be no doubt. But it is not due primarily to disregard of Sunday and to the failure and refusal of civil officials to enforce the Sunday laws. The root of the trouble is much deeper than this, and the fault lies not at the door of the magistrate, but at the door of the preachers, as any one can readily see who will candidly consider the facts for even a few moments.

Reverence for God and his law lies at the foundation of reverence for all law and regard for our fellow-men. Anything that undermines reverence for God and for his law destroys in like measure respect for all law.

For years the ministers of the country have been discrediting not only the law of God, but his entire Word, and this very largely in the interest of the Sunday institution. The law of God says plainly, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." The ministers say, "Not so; the first day is the Sabbath," and stigmatize the ancient Sabbath as "Jewish," speaking of it as "that old Sabbath," calling it and the whole law in which it is embosomed "a yoke of bondage," etc. Thus the ministers have educated the people to despise the law of God. Is it any wonder that they despise the laws of men?

Again, men have come to know their rights as men better than they used to know them, and all attempts to maintain and enforce so-called "laws" that trench upon personal rights serve to increase contempt for law in general. Of no class of laws is this more true than of Sunday "laws." Men feel and know inherently that the keeping of a day as a Sabbath is a matter with which the state has of right nothing to do; they feel that every attempt to compel them to render such a service is flagrant usurpation, as it is, in fact, and thus feeling they, one and all, disregard in greater or less degree all such 'laws.' Few indeed can be found who do not disregard, more or less, the letter of the various Sunday laws.

Those who are really alarmed at the growth of lawlessness, instead of urging as a certain panacea the maintenance and enforcement of religious "laws" against which the better sense of all right-thinking men revolt, should favor only the maintenance and enforcement of such laws as appeal to the common sense of mankind as being just and necessary to the preservation of equal rights. But Sunday "laws" do not belong to this class.
