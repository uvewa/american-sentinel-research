## SUNDAY REST CONGRESS AT THE PARIS FAIR.

From the New York Independent.

ONE of the most significant facts of the time is the attention being given in Europe to the question of Sunday rest for employees. Three years ago an International Congress on the subject was held at Brussels, followed this year by another in connection with the Paris Exposition. The attention given to it by the Paris journals and the membership indicate the hold the question has on the public mind. The presiding officer, Berenger, was a member of the French Senate and Institute, and among the delegates were representatives of various associations and industries, as well as of several of the states of Europe.

The discussions took up the various phases of the question in relation to manufactures, commerce, transportation, public service; but the point that occupied far more attention than any other in the congress was that of legislative intervention for the protection of the Sunday rest. On the one hand, delegates from Belgium, Germany, Austria, Great Britain, and Switzerland, where Sunday laws are now enforced to a greater or less extent, urged the justice and necessity of such intervention to protect the rights of the great majority in any branch of business against the selfish competition of the few, on the principle so generally accepted in this country that the liberty of rest for each depends upon a law of rest for all, while, on the other hand, all such legislation was earnestly opposed, especially by the French members of the congress, as involving infringement of personal liberty. It was urged by them that after all such laws could not be enforced, except so far as they accorded with the customs and convictions of the people, and that reliance for the procuring of Sunday rest must be placed upon the good will of employers.

It was conceded, however, by both sides, that it was the duty of the state to set the example of according Sunday rest to all engaged in the public service, save in cases of real necessity. This question (which seemed for a time likely to divide the congress) was finally settled by the adoption of a resolution affirming the right of the civil law to intervene in favor of the Sunday rest, but refraining from expressing any judgment as to the application of this principle in different countries; the circumstances of each country must be left to decide as to whether and to what extent the State should thus intervene.
