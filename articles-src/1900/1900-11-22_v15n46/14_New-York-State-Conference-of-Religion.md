Among the topics announced for discussion at the "New York State Conference of Religion," to be held in New York City November 20–22, we note, "Political Ideals of the Bible," "Dangerous Classes in a Republic," "Religion Vital to Democracy," "Religious Education in the Public Schools," "The Ideal Commonwealth as the Kingdom of God," "The Unused Power of the Church in Politics." The announcement circular states that the purpose of the conference is "to promote the largest practicable junction of religious forces for the furtherance of these fundamental religious, moral, and social interests which are vital to the stability of the commonwealth."

This gathering is not designed to be a "parliament of religions," but a "conference of religion." No effort at contrasting or comparing the views of different denominations will be made, but the effort of the meeting will be in the opposite direction. Every point upon which unity of action is possible will be emphasized and its importance magnified. That Sunday observance will be one of these it is easy to foresee.

A special report of the proceedings of this convention will be given in THE SENTINEL.
