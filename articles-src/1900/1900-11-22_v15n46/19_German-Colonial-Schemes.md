PRESS dispatches state that the recent presidential election is taken in Germany to mean the abandonment of the "Monroe doctrine," which has heretofore stood in the way of German colonial schemes in South America. A dispatch from Bremen to the Chicago *Record* states the following:

"Bremen, Nov. 11.—The pan-Teutonic view of Mr. McKinley's re-election is that it makes the Monroe doctrine a thing of the past. The abandonment of the famous doctrine is thought to have been fully indorsed by the approval given by the popular vote to an imperialistic American policy. The Weser Zeitung declares that all is now clear sailing for Germany, which, in the pursuance of its own expansionist ideals, need not fear a conflict with the United States."

The naval program for the coming year, it is stated, calls for an expenditure of over $80,000,000.
