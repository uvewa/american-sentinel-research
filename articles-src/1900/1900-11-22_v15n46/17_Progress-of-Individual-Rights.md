FROM the date when the barons of England compelled King John to sign Magna Charta, down to the time when negro slavery was abolished in the United States, the civilized world in general made steady progress in the direction of the recognition of individual rights. Following Magna Charta, the people of England secured from the British monarchy the Petitions of Rights, next the Bill of Rights, and later the Writ of Habeas Corpus, all of which were bulwarks erected between the common people and the arbitrary exercise of governmental power. Following these came, in America, the Declaration of Independence, proclaiming to the world the political equality of all men and setting up an ideal of government to which even the people who gave it birth never perfectly attained. Now, however, a reaction has set in, a retrograde movement has begun, indicated by the growing tendency to disparage the Declaration, the Constitution that grew out of it, and to disregard the rights of the inferior races of men. Where will this reactionary movement find a stopping place? This is the important question, and it will become a more serious question as the days go by.
