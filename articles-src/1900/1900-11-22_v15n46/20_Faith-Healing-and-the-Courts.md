THE attitude of the courts of law toward the practice of "faith healing" is indicated by the following statement made by a Cleveland (Ohio) judge in passing sentence upon a "faith healer" in that city who had failed to report to the health department a fatal case of diphtheria. After the public prosecutor had declared that the act of treating the case by "faith healing" was close to murder, the judge said:

"There is more in this case than the mere violation of an ordinance, and the sooner we get rid of these faith-cure people the better it will be for society in general. I am going to impose a heavy fine in order to deter others from practicing a doctrine without medicine, which is absolutely necessary."
