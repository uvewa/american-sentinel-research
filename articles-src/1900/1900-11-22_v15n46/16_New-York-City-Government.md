Is it not barely possible that there is something the matter with "our civilization" and "our political system" when such a journal as the New York Independent feels obliged to speak of the government of our leading city after this fashion:

"A center of learning, of art, and of ethical enthusiasm, the home of a multitude of the strongest intellects and most forceful moral personalities of the New World, endures a government unspeakably vile, conducted by men more brutal than the beasts of the field, and who excel the Patagonian savages chiefly in their knowledge of the arts of wickedness. New York City, with brains and energy enough in it to create the most efficient, the cleanest, the wisest and the most progressive administration which the world has ever seen, has a government that smells to heaven worse than the murders of Macbeth."

Is it not barely possible that "our government" is not so essential to the happiness and prosperity of the less civilized races as certain political orators would have them and us believe? Is it not barely possible that these less civilized peoples, less skilled in the arts of wickedness, would be just as well off under some governmental system of their own devising as under one thrust upon them from the country where boss rule has risen to such infamous preeminence?
