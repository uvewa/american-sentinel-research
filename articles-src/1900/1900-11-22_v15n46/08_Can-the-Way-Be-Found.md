## CAN THE WAY BE FOUND?

Touching the merits of the controversy between the Filipinos and the friars, the *American Israelite* says:

"The question of the right of the United States to make some sort of an arrangement in the Philippines by which in an equitable manner its people can regain the vast properties wrung from them by the ecclesiastics can be answered in only one way. Almost, if not every nation in Europe and many on the Western continent, have replied in the affirmative. It is not 'confiscation,' as the Roman Catholic Church calls it, but simple restitution of what has been stolen. The kings and nobles who drove the serfs from their cultivated lands to turn the soil into forests for the chase, were no more guilty than the friars who filched from the peasants their little holdings to make their freeholders slaves, upon whose labor their taskmasters grew fat.

"Of all the curses that the people of the Philippines have labored under, none is greater than the domination of the priestly caste. It is no wonder that the friars want the strong arm of the United States to replace that of Spain to protect them from the just wrath of an enslaved and long-suffering people. It remains to be seen whether this country will lend itself to the iniquity that flourished so long under the protection of priest-ridden Spain. If this country intends to govern the Philippine Islands it must find some way of returning to the people the lands of which they have been robbed by the friars, and then relegating the latter to the position which all other priests occupy under the Constitution of the United States."

No man has any right to commit any aggression whatever upon the equal rights of another, no matter how exalted he may be nor however humble his victim.
