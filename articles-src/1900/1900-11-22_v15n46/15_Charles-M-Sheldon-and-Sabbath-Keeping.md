THE following item is from *Harper's Weekly* of November 10:

"The Rev. Charles M. Sheldon, the author of 'In His Steps,' had lately an interesting experience of Sabbath-keeping in this exaggerated city. He thinks that no one should work on Sunday but ministers, and disapproves the running of street cars and all public and private conveyances, except, doubtless, on errands of necessity or mercy. His Sunday engagements a fortnight ago included morning service at Carnegie Hall and evening service at Sterling Place in Brooklyn. He was staying in Brooklyn. He walked from there over to New York to the day service and back to Brooklyn for the evening service, arriving an hour late for the latter and keeping 500 persons waiting. Some of the brethren, who are less sweeping than he in their Sabbath-keeping convictions, are disposed to smile at him. Nevertheless he did well. There is nothing so instructive to a preacher, and especially a rigid Sabbatarian, as to practise regularly what he preaches. Nothing else will help him so much to arrive at a conclusion as to the precise point at which Sunday work should stop."

This indicates that Mr. Sheldon is determined to be consistent at any cost. But a man who is so severe with himself is not likely to spare others when he is able to invoke the law in behalf of his ideas of "Sabbath-keeping."
