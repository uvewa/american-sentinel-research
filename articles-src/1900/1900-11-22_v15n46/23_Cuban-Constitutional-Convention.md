A CONVENTION is soon to meet in Cuba to adopt a constitution which will be the basis of government in the island. We note on this point some interestings words in the Catholic Mirror of November 10:

"HAVANA, CUBA, October 31.

"There are indications of stormy times for the Cuban Constitutional Convention and its breaking up in a row is not an impossibility. It appears now that there will be at least three factions, and it is doubtful if either one will have a very strong working majority. The cause of the trouble and the danger of the failure of the convention lie in the fact that it has virtually become known that the administration is coaching a clique of delegates with the object of presenting the convention with a constitution carefully drafted in Washington. This was suspected from the first. Whether or not the coterie with the intervening government back of it will be strong enough to carry its point and give Cuba an American-made constitution remains to be seen."

There can, of course, never be real self-government under a constitution which the people have not themselves made.
