## A TALE OF TWO NATIONS.

### The Bible and the Nations.

Five times in two short chapters in the book of Daniel it is written: "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men." No other statement of fact in the Bible is repeated so explicitly and so often in such a brief space. The fact that this truth is so often and so plainly stated ought to make it abundantly clear to thinking people that God wishes to impress mankind, and especially the rulers of the earth, with the idea of his kingship over all. The very words were spoken to two of the kings of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, and their empire was the most brilliant of the old time monarchies.

Moreover the same inspired record states that this truth is recorded "to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men."

In this elder hour of time in the governmental affairs of earth we see only the strife of nation with nation and party with party. We see two powerful political factors struggling for the supremacy. We discuss their platforms and their principles. We praise, criticize, or condemn according to the promptings of judgment, habit, or taste. But how seldom do we stop and consider that God is behind it all, ruling and overruling in it all.

"God ruleth in the kingdom of men." Forever let these words sink into the ears of citizen and subject. They are worthy of an hour's thought. Our better natures owe them this.

But the bad king comes to the throne just the same as the good. A wicked magistrate takes the reins of civil rule. Nevertheless God's word standeth fast forever. "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men." Yes, God may set up the basest of men over a nation to punish that nation for its evil deeds and to bring it to an end.

Babylon was a great empire. In pride Nebuchadnezzar ruled over it. He was humbled by the Almighty, and made to eat grass like a beast for seven years. He repented and sought the Lord and commanded all of his people to do the same thing. Then his kingdom flourished. He died, and afterwards Belshazzar, his grandson, came to the throne. He knew the experience that Nebuchadnezzar had passed through. Nevertheless he did wickedly. The figures of national guilt climbed higher and higher. And then God brought him and the wicked nation over which he ruled to an end.

The empire of the Medes and Persians followed next. In the beginning the rulers inclined to righteousness. They sought the Lord and assisted in the promulgation of the knowledge of the true God in the earth. Rulers and people alike were temperate and frugal. But ere long things changed and God brought this nation also to an end.

The empire of Greece followed with Alexander at its head. His career was meteoric. In the course of his travels and conquests it is certain that he had abundant opportunity to learn of God and know of his ways. But these were neglected; his empire was humbled to the dust and the Romans succeeded to the first place as a great world power.

Of all the ancient nations none had such an opportunity to be taught of God as the Romans. It was during the days of their prowess and power that Jesus Christ was born into the world. They had already conquered the Jews, and were in constant communication and business intercourse with them. The greatest of the apostles preached in the capital city, and the churches of the simple Christians dotted the empire from east to west. Yet Rome persecuted the Christians, and the rugged Germans came and swept the once world-conquerors away.

So it has ever been and will ever be. As nations can not be punished in the world to come they receive their punishment here. An account is just as surely kept by the Almighty with a nation as with an individual. And when the figures of crime and transgression reach a certain limit which God has fixed there is no more mercy; disaster, disgrace, and disintegration quickly follow.
