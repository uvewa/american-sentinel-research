THIS is the masterpiece of a modern politician, how to qualify and mould the sufferance and subjection of the people to the length of that foot that is to tread on their necks; how rapine may serve itself with the fair and honorable pretenses of public good; how the puny law may be brought under the wardship and control of lust and will.—John Milton.
