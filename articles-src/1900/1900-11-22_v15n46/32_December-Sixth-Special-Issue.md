**DECEMBER SIXTH.**

As announced last week, THE SENTINEL of December 6 will be specially adapted to educational effort in connection with the agitation for closing the Pan-American Exposition on Sunday. Do not forget the date, and do not fail to share this effort with us, by circulating a goodly number of this special issue.

This number will be profusely illustrated with half-tone cuts, and printed upon supercalendered stock, thus making the paper attractive as well as instructive. The price will be one dollar per hundred, or eight dollars per thousand to tract societies.

It will be remembered how far-reaching were the results of the Sunday closing agitation in connection with the World's Fair, when our nation took so important a step in repudiating the principles of Protestantism by enacting a confessedly religious law, making as a condition of governmental support the closing of the gates on Sunday. We now have opportunity to recall the tremendous significance of that legislative action under circumstances that will at once add interest and lend force to that bit of American history. We are confident that friends of religious liberty everywhere will gladly embrace this opportunity to sow the seed of truth under conditions so favorable.
