"The soldier should not have a will of his own, but all of you should have one will, and that is my will. There exists only one law, and that is my law; and now go and do your duty, and be obedient to your superiors." So said the German Kaiser to his soldiers on one occasion, according to a writer in *McClure's Magazine*. This writer continues:

"So the German soldier waits patiently for orders, and when they come he obeys, no matter what obstacle lies in the way. And in the next European war he will be next to invincible if he is well led."

From this it can be seen why military excellence has nothing in common with Christianity and excellence of manhood. It means that men must have no minds and consciences of their own; that they must become mere brute machines, subject to the will and law of another. This would be bad enough of itself, but the purpose for which men are thus degraded—to slaughter their fellowmen against whom they have no grievance—is so much worse than the purposes of ordinary slavery that it hides and excuses as it were this great wrong; for how can men carry out such a purpose on the part of others unless they are first hypnotized and drilled into machines?
