THE following good reasons for keeping religion separate from politics were given in a sermon delivered the Sunday before election by a Methodist Episcopal clergyman of Phoenix, Arizona:

"We legislate as citizens, not as church members or Christians. Religious convictions may constitute the highest citizenship and the citizen may enter the field. But why not the Christian, as such, enter this field? Because it is opposed to the spirit of our institutions, which have been so delicately poised on the question of religion.

"The church can not healthfully espouse any political method. First, because political methods are not first in importance, being rather resultant than causative. Second, because the church needs equal evangelical influence over men of all political creeds. It is the mission of the church to save all classes in all parties.

"It is unwise for a church to take any political attitude that would produce among organized classes any irritation against it. There is but one step from hatred of a church to hatred of religion.

"Whenever a religious organization voices itself on the political exigencies it goes beyond itself and blunders.

"The infection is abroad. These are times of more or less ecclesiastical tinkering with politics. Many of our people are not drawing the line. There are preachers and churches unconsciously in the double business of politics and religion. A non-sectarian state can not exist in harmony with a partisan state."

The subject of "good citizenship" is making no small stir among religious people of all churches in that Western city.
