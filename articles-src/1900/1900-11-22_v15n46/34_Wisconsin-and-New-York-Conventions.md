We print this week a partial report of the proceedings of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day Association; more will appear later. And immediately following this convention in Wisconsin comes the "Conference of Religion" in New York City, of which we will also give a special report. The next few issues of THE SENTINEL will be among the best that have ever been issued. Now is the right time to circulate a few copies among your friends.
