WHERE there is no liberty there can be no temperance. The inmates of a State prison are all total abstainers, but this does not make them all temperate men. [We believe, too, that they all keep Sunday and go to church.] The object of teaching, preaching, and example should be to make men temperate—that is, self-controlled. The social ex-communications, the rule-making, the legislation, which tend to substitute the control of one man over another man, work against temperance because they work against self-control.—The Outlook.
