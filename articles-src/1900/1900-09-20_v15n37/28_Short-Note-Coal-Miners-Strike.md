THE great coal miners' strike in Pennsylvania, inaugurated to compel the coal companies to redress the heavy grievances of the miners, really affects only the miners themselves and the millions of people dependent for fuel upon the product of their labor. The coal companies simply raise the price of their stock of coal and lose nothing. Indeed, it is said they often find it to their advantage to precipitate a strike for the purpose of obtaining a higher price for surplus stock.
