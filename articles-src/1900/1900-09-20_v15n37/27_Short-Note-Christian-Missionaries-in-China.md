"THEY'LL never insult another Christian missionary in China," exclaims the California Independent. Perhaps not, but the prevention of insults is not quite the point in Christian missionary work. It is more important to ask, Will the chastised and intimidated Chinese be any more disposed to accept Christianity than they were before they felt the wrath of the Powers?
