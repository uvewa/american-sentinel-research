An idea which underlies much of the effort that is put forth to-day in the interests of moral reform, is that people would be good if they only had a chance to be good. They do not have a chance to be good, we are told, because under existing political and industrial conditions they are held in slavery against which the individual will and conscience struggle in vain. It is declared with great positiveness that in this condition of "Egyptian bondage" it is impossible for the people to do right, and that what is needed first, therefore, is deliverance from this state of oppression. This is the first great step to be taken in the direction of realizing in society the ideals of Christianity, and this deliverance must be accomplished by the state. The strong hand of the law must be raised to strike off the shackles and overthrow the taskmasters and set the people free to serve the Lord.

One of the foremost advocates of this idea is Prof. George D. Herron, of Iowa, who is widely known as an author and lecturer. "Christianity," says Prof. Herron, "needs the state for its realization." "The people can never be wholly Christian," he affirms, "until the state becomes the organized Christianity of the people." When the state becomes Christian it will make and enforce Christian laws, and this will be the true remedy for the evils under which the people are held in servitude. So we find Prof. Herron and other would-be reformers of the day—a large number and representing powerful organizations—turning to politics and legislation, to secure from thence the word of command to the modern Pharaohs, "Let My people go, that they may serve Me."

Now, there are certain things recorded in sacred history which we are told were written for the instruction and admonition of the people of later times. Rom. 15:4. And particularly is our attention called to the history of the ancient Israelites, who were the chosen people of God. The Israelites in Egypt were in a worse condition of bondage than are the people of this day, who, we are told, would be good if they only had a chance. They were in actual slavery, and so bitter was it that when Moses spoke to them of deliverance "they harkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage." Ex. 6: 6-9. And from this bondage they were delivered, and their deliverance was as full and complete as God himself could make it. The Omnipotent, by a most awful display of his power and majesty, broke the power of Egypt and set his people free upon the pathway to Canaan, drowning all of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea as the final crowning act in the drama of their emancipation. No deliverance from oppression could possibly be more complete; no exercise of power, political or legislative, could ever afford a people a better chance to be good than was given to that ancient people who went up out of Egypt. But what was the result?

Were the people good because they at last had a chance to be good? Alas! the truth was far otherwise. Scarcely had they gotten out of Egypt before they began to murmur and complain. First, they murmured because there was a lack of water; and, next, because they were afraid they would starve to death in the wilderness; and then they said, "Would to God that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, when we did eat bread to the full." Ex. 16: 2, 3. They began to be sorry that they had ever been delivered. The rigorous bondage under which they had groaned in Egypt seemed actually to be preferable to their condition as a free people; and this was their sentiment on every occasion when they were put to the test. At Sinai, while Moses was absent on the mount, they set out to return to Egypt, having first made them a god to lead them back like unto one of the gods of Egypt. And, finally, out of the whole vast multitude that experienced the great deliverance from Egyptian bondage, just two individuals went through to the land of Canaan! The rest all died in the wilderness, and their deliverance, great as it was, profited them nothing.

How much, then, will it profit the people of this day, morally and religiously, to be delivered from the "slavery" of which Mr. Herron and his associates complain? How much can politics and legislation do for the people in the way of elevating their lives to the plane of righteousness? So far as deliverance from oppression was concerned, the Israelites had all the chance in the world to be good, but they failed completely, and even sighed for their former state of life. What was the trouble? Ah, they had not been delivered from the bondage of sin. That was the deliverance that they needed, and that is the one thing needful for the people everywhere at this day—the one thing that will bring them peace and contentment and real and lasting benefit. Mr. Herron and his fellow-reformers may as well cease their efforts to promote righteousness by legislation. They can at most only lead the people out to perish in the wilderness. Their vision of an earthly Canaan is but a mirage in the desert.

This history of the experience of the ancient chosen people was written expressly for the benefit of the people of this latter day, and why will not the would-be reformers, who are beseiging legislatures and grasping at political power in the name of the Lord, be admonished by the lesson it sets before them? Why will they not cease trying to reform society by might and by power and seek its accomplishment by the Spirit of God? It is their own fault if they turn away their ears from the truth and become blind leaders of the blind.
