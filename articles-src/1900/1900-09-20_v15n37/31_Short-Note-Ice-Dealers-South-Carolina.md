ICE-DEALERS in Florence, South Carolina, have recently been indicted for selling ice in that city on Sunday. The Charleston News and Courier condemned the proceeding, observing that the case "would excite no surprise or comment if it were reported from a town in New England," but was entirely foreign to the spirit of South Carolina.
