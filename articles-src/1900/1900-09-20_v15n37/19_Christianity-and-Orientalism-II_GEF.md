### More of Gnosticism and Its Speculations.

Beyond the regions of light, where God and his family dwell, existed a rude and unformed mass of matter, heaving itself continually in wild commotion. This the Supreme God would never approach, as it was contrary to his nature. But in the peopling of the pleroma, since the divine evolutions of life become feebler the farther they are removed from the first link in the series, since their connection with the first becomes more loose at each succeeding step, out of the last step of the evolution proceeds an imperfect, defective product which can not retain its connection with the divine chain of life, and so sinks from the world of Aeons down into chaos, or, what is the same notion differently expressed, "A drop from the fullness of the divine life spills over into the bordering void." Now first the dead matter, by connection with the living which it wanted, received animation. The wild and heaving mass of matter is reduced to order and beauty and peopled with human beings, and with animals of different species, and, finally, endowed with and enriched by some portions of the celestial light or substance. This builder of the world, who is thus distinct from the Supreme God, they called the Demiurge. He is a being who, though possessed of many shining qualities, is arrogant in his nature and much inclined to domination. He therefore claims absolute authority over the new world he has built, and that he may retain such authority he jealously and by every possible means excludes the knowledge of the Supreme God.

Man is composed of a material, and therefore of a vicious body, and of a celestial soul, which is in some sense a particle of the deity himself, hence the conflict within between good and evil. The nobler part of man is miserably oppressed by the body, which is the seat of base lusts. By these lusts of the body we are not only drawn away from the knowledge of the Supreme God and induced to render our homage to the Demiurge and his associates, but we are filled and polluted with the love of terrestrial objects and sensual pleasures.

From this wretched bondage the Supreme God labors to rescue his offspring in various ways; and especially by the messengers he sends to them from the world of spirits. The most powerful of these messengers, and one of the Aeons from the pleroma, was Christ. But this effort of the Supreme God to restore the knowledge of himself to his offspring, is resisted in every possible way by the Demiurge, or world-builder. Still God will ultimately prevail, and having restored to liberty most of the spirits now imprisoned in bodies, he will dissolve the fabric of the world; and then the primitive tranquility will return and God will reign with the happy spirits in undisturbed felicity forever.

## Scripture Teachings Overturned.

Such in general was the theory of Gnosticism, but the variations of it in different places and by different teachers were almost infinite. It will be seen that this philosophy puts God the Creator practically into the place of Satan, making him the author of evil and the enemy of the Supreme God. The serpent, too, was a sacred symbol, the symbol of redemption, for he only sought to obscure the knowledge of the world's creator that he might restore the knowledge of the Supreme Deity.

One sect, the Cainites, carried this overturning of the Scripture teachings so far as to exalt all the bad characters of the Bible, with Cain at their head, into heroes of the true faith, who were opposed and oppressed by the Demiurge because they sought to restore the knowledge of the Supreme God.

Especially Gnosticism, in all its varied sects, arrayed itself against the human nature of Christ. As all matter was malignantly evil, how could Christ, who was an emanation from the Infinite Spirit, have a human body, a material body, subject to the same temptations as our own? They generally considered Christ our Saviour as consisting of two wholly separate natures, or even of two persons, the man Jesus, and the Son of God, or Christ. Some denied the human nature and the human body entirely, and asserted Christ to be a pure and divine spirit only wearing the outward semblance of a body so that we might see him. Small idea can be given in this paper of the wonderfully imaginative genius displayed in these speculations; but as one historian has said, "Gnosticism was pure poetry."

## Gnosticism the Pride of Knowledge.

All genuine reformations begin with the humble and lowly and those untaught in the schools, and so unhampered with human creeds and the pride of human knowledge. The early church was no exception to this rule. Gnosticism was the reaction of the aristocratic and philosophical spirit against what was termed the narrowness and ignorance of early Christianity. It arose almost simultaneously in all the great centers of Christianity. Its progress was especially among the higher and more opulent; and in their lofty pretensions, they claimed great superiority over the humbler Christianity of the vulgar.

Paul had warned the church against this very thing when he wrote, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ." The peculiar power of this deception over the Christians lay in the fact that it professed to be "after Christ," and to glorify him far beyond the dream of the humbler Christians. To these Gnostics the Christian idea of Christ's humanity and of his being tempted in all points as we are was debasing to Christ, yet it is in that very fact alone that the gospel is revealed in Christ to tempted souls.

## Christianity Triumphant Over All the Forces of Evil.

All historians agree that Gnosticism did the church more injury than all its open conflicts with Judaism and paganism. But, though this Orientalism has colored many of the teachings of the popular Christianity of the day, yet over this most insidious foe, as far as any outward organization is concerned, Christianity has grandly triumphed, and this, too, without any earthly aid. In the second century Gnosticism rivalled Christianity itself in numbers and influence. It was of a sublime and imposing character as an imaginative creed. It was adapted to music and poetry, and for two centuries the world rang with the mystic hymns of its greatest poet, Bardesanes; but by the sixth century it had almost entirely disappeared.

The grand conclusion of this series of papers is that since Christianity has met once, and entirely unaided, has conquered grandly all the various forces of evil, it can do it again. The man who says it can not do this alone, and who makes this assertion the reason for asking for some other power to aid it, is, while having a form of godliness, denying to Christianity its pristine power.

But Jesus said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore and preach the gospel to every creature, and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."
