### EXAMINE THE LABEL.

The yellow label on your paper indicates the date on which your subscription expires. Please examine it closely, and if it reads §19 you should forward your renewal without delay in order to avoid the loss of any papers.

Please also bear in mind that even though your subscription may not expire until October or November it will be safe to renew your subscription now, and by so doing secure our map of Asia at once. We send it post-free to old subscribers who advance their subscription one year by the payment of one dollar. See description of map elsewhere, and if you desire it, act on this suggestion.
