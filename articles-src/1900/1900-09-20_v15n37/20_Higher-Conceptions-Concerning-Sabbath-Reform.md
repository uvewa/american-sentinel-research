The Sabbath must not be reduced to a ceremony, and Sabbath-keeping must not be made burdensome. The evolution along this line finds its most prominent expression in the history of the Jewish people and in the attitude of Christ. So far as recorded statements show, Sabbath-keeping among the Jews found highest expression at the lips of Isaiah, as recorded in the 58th chapter. Here the spiritual side of Sabbath-keeping, and its mission and power to uplift men and bring them into communion with God, is set forth sharply. It is a glorious ideal, and men of all time are blest who seek to gain the heights on which Isaiah stood, when he wrote the words in the 13th and 14th verses of that chapter. During the century which preceded the birth of Christ, Jewish conception of the Sabbath and of its importance reached a low point, so far as spiritual observance was concerned. The Sabbath became a ceremonial affair, burdened with unjust and unscriptural restrictions. Christ sounded the key-note touching the Sabbath as it ought to appear in his kingdom, when he rejected the low ground and burdensome restrictions that Judaism had placed upon it, and exalted it for its worth in developing the spiritual life of men and bringing them into communion with God. The standard Christ set concerning the Sabbath is the starting point from which Sabbath reform ought to radiate, and the form by which Christian practice ought to be regulated.

The position taken by Christ was so far above that occupied by the Jews, and so much deeper as to spiritual meaning, that neither the Jewish convert, nor, at a later period, the converts from paganism, grasped it. Whether they could have done so we may not answer, though we believe that they would have approached much nearer to a just conception but for the sharp opposition to Judaism, which identified the Sabbath with the narrow views of the Jews, and failed to rise to the height which Christ occupied. This failure, coupled with the theory that the law of God, as contained in the Old Testament, was inferior, or was abrogated, resulted in the first great perversion of the Sabbath question under Christianity. Rejecting the idea that the Scripture, as interpreted by Christ, was the standard in Sabbath-keeping, logically and actually, men were forced to create a new standard. From the middle of the second century forward this new standard took rapid shape and development, resulting in the state-church, after the Roman Catholic model. For centuries this model was followed, and all higher features of the Sabbath question were lost sight of, while the Sabbath itself, as Christianized by Christ, was buried under a mass of holidays, with Sunday at their head. The deep darkness that followed, the loss of spiritual power on the part of the church, the comparative degradation of Christian life, and the numerous evils which grew up, form God's answer to the state-church theory. These results unite to show that under Christianity the Sabbath must not be based upon the authority of the state-church, and that it must remain where Christ left it. The law of evolution, as shown by the history of the first fifteen hundred years of Christianity, has declared an infallible verdict on this point. That verdict is in accordance with Christ's statement: "By their fruits ye shall know them." No one can be indifferent to that verdict and hope to escape increasing difficulties.
