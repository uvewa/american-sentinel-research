Nothing can be more fatal, even to moral growth and spiritual progress, than a stereotyped immobility—that blind and narrow stagnation in the infallibility of opinionated ignorance, which delivers brawling judgments all day long on all things, unashamed, and which has always been as characteristic of imperfect and narrow religionists as it was of the "priests and Pharisees and hypocrites" in the days of our Lord. The example of those days, even if they stood alone, would be sufficient to show us that men, in the name of religion—and even while they claim to be the sole faithful supporters of true religion—are capable of committing in the name of the religion which they profess, the deadliest of crimes. If any other instances were wanting we may see them in the deadly guilt of inquisitors, who, in the name of the Lord of love, blackened the blue of heaven with the Tophet-smoke of their bale-fires of hell by burning many a dear saint of God who held the truth which, to their own perdition, *they* rejected, and who lived lives transcendently holier and purer than their own.

In a milder form we may see the same pernicious results of incompetent religious arrogance in the fact that some of the best, wisest, most earnest, and most brilliantly gifted divines of our own day—men, such as Professor Maurice, and Charles Kingsley, and F. W. Robertson, and Dean Stanley, and others—were all through their lives the favorite victims of the venomous attacks with which the so-called "religious" press of party church newspapers is rife. Like Wesley and Whitefield, like Luther and Melancthon, like Savonarola and many more, these men, owing to the refusal of "priests" to accept the new truths which shake their usurped authority and expose the ignorant baselessness of their "infallible" judgments, have stood up, "the very butt of slander and the blot of every dart that malice ever shot." An unprogressive religion is a decadent and dying religion; a religion which refuses new light is a dead religion. Such forms of belief will inevitably sink into abject and priest-ridden superstitions or into the cumbersome paraphernalia of externalism, which thinks that God cares for the murmuring of rites and ceremonies, whereas he has again and again taught us that he requires our hearts, and that without heart sincerity all else is but as the small dust of the balance.—*Rev. F. W. Farrar, Dean of Canterbury, England.*
