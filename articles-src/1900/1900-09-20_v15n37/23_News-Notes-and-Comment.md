# News, Notes . . . and Comment

The effort recently made to commit the G. A. R. organization to the project of securing the transfer of Memorial Day to the last Sunday in May, was defeated, but a strong minority manifest themselves in its favor. It will be heard from again later.

It is regretfully acknowledged by American press writers that American troops in China participated with those of the European Powers in the sacking and looting around Peking. The only troops that held aloof, we are told, were the heathen Japanese.

In a letter treating on the present political outlook, ex-Secretary Olney says that "perfection in a candidate or a platform is an idle dream." This is true, and this is the reason why the plane of politics can never be raised to that of Christianity, and no stream that flows out of politics can reach the kingdom of God.

Not much can be said with certainty regarding the outcome of the Chinese situation, but the *Independent* (New York) is of the opinion that for the present "a detachment of each army will probably remain in Peking" to "watch the Empress Dowager," and also "to watch each other." As regards the latter statement this is quite a safe prediction to make.

"The principles of the Declaration of Independence," says the *Independent*, will apply to the people of the Philippines only when they "shall be fitted by the diffusion of civilization and education to be independent, and 'assume among the Powers of the earth' a 'separate and equal station,' needing no protection." All such talk is good encouragement for the men who are trying to re-enslave the Southern negro.

A LETTER sent out by the Vatican to the Catholic governments with reference to the change of Italian rulers, states that since 1870 the condition of the Papacy has been steadily growing worse, and invokes the assistance of all Catholics and all Catholic states to relieve the Roman pontiff from a situation that has become "intolerable." We do not anywhere read that He whose vicar the Pope claims to be, whose home was not a palace or His raiment kingly, who owned no vast treasures of gold and jewels and received no princely income, ever sought to be relieved from such an "intolerable" situation.

SPEAKING of the complaints of outrages made by the missionaries in foreign lands, that are almost daily received at the State Department in Washington, the *Church Standard*, of Philadelphia, offers this commendable comment:

"It would seem that comparatively few such letters ought to be written and that many indignities should be silently borne. Indeed, we may go further and admit that there is much force in the contention of the Rev. J. Hudson Taylor, of the China Inland Mission, that in the long run appeals to home governments work nothing but harm. His testimony was that he had known of many riots that had never been reported and of much suffering endured by missionaries in silence, which had 'fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel.' 'If we leave God to vindicate our cause,' he said, 'the issue is sure to prove marvelous in spirituality.'"

A RESIDENT of Springfield, Mass., a man named McFethries, has drawn up a plan for securing and perpetuating general peace throughout the earth, which he has submitted to the President and to the sovereigns of Europe, and has also given to American and European newspapers for publication. It provides for a combination of Russia, Germany, France, England, and the United States, representatives of which governments are to draw up a preamble "with conditions satisfactory to all," agreeing to cease from war themselves, and, further, to "use their combined efforts" to prevent war between other nations. International jurymen are to be named and authorized to decide international disputes, their decision to be binding upon all. Then the armaments of the nations are to be reduced yearly, at a great saving of money, etc.

There is only one thing standing in the way of the success of this and similar schemes, and that is the fact that people are selfish, and don't want to be bound by agreements they may have made when it seems to their advantage to disregard them; and there is always an excuse to be found or invented for disregarding obligations when the disposition to such a course is in the heart. The whole history of the Powers of Europe is full of illustrations of this truth. We may read there in the clearest language that policy and not principle is the deciding influence in political affairs.

We have the assurance of Scripture that wars are to cease, even "unto the ends of the earth," but this grand result is to be secured only by the intervention of Him who is to come and dash in pieces the kingdoms of earth and destroy the wicked out of it. "He breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire." Ps. 46: 8-10. After that grand but awful consummation "the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."

ACCORDING to the Boston Sunday Post of Sept. 9, the strict enforcement of the Sunday law in Boston has led to an agitation of the question whether the sale of beans should be allowed or prohibited on Sunday. The Post says:

"The crusade against the selling of pork and beans on Sunday, inaugurated last week, has attracted much attention, and the bakers are indignant over the matter. The police officials and the bakers interpret the law regarding the matter in a widely different way. It appears that the law of 1895, chapter 434, permits the 'making and selling on the Sabbath by bakers and their employees of bread and other food usually dealt in by them before ten o'clock in the morning.'

"Now the question seems to hinge chiefly on the interpretation of the phrase, 'other food usually dealt in by them.' The bakers hold that this includes pork and beans; the police officials hold the contrary opinion. The police officials, too, believe their view is sustained by the action of the court in the cases which came up last week.

"At any rate the police department of Boston has set its intricate machinery at work to run to earth the succulent Sunday morning bean. No baker, so it is understood, will be allowed to sell pork and beans on Sunday mornings hereafter, and this action, the police say, is based on an intelligent interpretation of the law governing Sunday selling."

In these times of riotous outbreaks and general increase of crime, it is nothing less than ridiculous for the government of a great city to concern itself and waste its police energy over the question of whether the sale of beans ought to be allowed on Sunday. Such questions have no proper place in civil government. They belong wholly to the sphere of religious controversy, and are best settled by each person for himself by the dictates of his own conscience.

The large cities have enough to do in making life and property secure within their limits, without giving time and attention to questions of theology. The matter of Sunday selling of goods is one that in no way affects the life, liberty and property rights of the people, until the government steps in to prohibit it; then the liberty and property rights of the people are at once invaded, and criminals are left more at liberty to prey upon good citizens in proportion as the energies of the police force are expended upon such inconsequent questions. Indeed, if the city government were to try to establish by law all the points of morality urged upon them by zealous people whose ideal of government is a theocracy, the murderers and other criminals would have a very free field for their nefarious operations.

There is certainly no call for the manufacture of new "crimes" to occupy the attention of the police. All such efforts can only detract from the security of society under civil government.

THIS item from the Springfield Republican is a nut that contains some solid meat:

"In calling attention to the Christian sack of of Tien-Tsin, the Republican said that full reports from Peking were not in. Details, however, are beginning to arrive. In an Associated Press dispatch it is stated:

"'The ministers remain in Peking. The city has been entirely looted except the palace, and auction sales of loot, in which valuable silks, furs and bronzes are the principal articles, are held daily. The chief bidders at these sales are army officers.'

"Take facts as they are, and you find that pious and civilized Christendom has looted two rich Chinese cities within two months, while all that can be said of the Filipinos in this respect is that they might have looted Manila, although they actually did not loot its sister city of Iloilo when they had a chance. The argument is, of course, that the Filipino 'savages' were incapable of self-government."

IN all lands the view is the same to the Christian when he looks toward home—the world above.
