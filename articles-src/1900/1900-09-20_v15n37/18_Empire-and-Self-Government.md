Among the sayings of Thomas Jefferson recently brought to renewed attention is this: "I am persuaded that no constitution was ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire and self-government." The sort of empire that goes along with self-government was the empire that Jefferson had in mind. He was talking about that kind of empire which the poets tell about when they sing of the empire of mind and the empire of affection and the empire of freedom. Nobody need have any quarrel with that variety of imperialism.
