*(Concluded.)*

Not very long after the Farewell Address was delivered Monroe gave birth to the now famous "Monroe Doctrine." From that day to this his thoughts on this subject have been a part of the political creed of all parties. This doctrine was announced by the President of the United States some seventy-six years ago, and the essence of it is:

"We owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the United States and those Powers, to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety."

And immediately after this there was enunciated the solemn declaration:

"With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European Power we have not interfered, and shall not interfere."

The words of the Monroe Doctrine are wonderfully deep, and especially significant on the point under discussion. Mark it! This doctrine is promulgated against the "system" of European statecraft. That system is essentially monarchical and imperialistic in its fundamental nature and tendencies. In its basic, nerve principles it is not founded upon the principle that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

Now, why was President Monroe opposed to the extension of the European principle of statecraft to this hemisphere? He tells the answer himself, stating that it would be "dangerous to our peace and safety"—that is, President Monroe saw that it would not be safe for the two systems of statecraft—that of the United States (government by the consent of the governed) and that of Europe (government by the consent of some of the governed only)—to come into too close contact with each other. He discerned that close relations between the two would lead to the destruction of all that had been fought for in the war of the American Revolution. He knew that the two systems could not thrive together on the same soil. He foresaw that the safety of the American principles lay in guarding them with a "splendid isolation."

In all of these doctrines the Fathers of the American Republic were only carrying out the mind of the great God above in the case of the new nation. They may not, and doubtless did not, in all cases and things know that they were doing this, but they were doing it for all of that. Hence it has been most truly said, that "they built better than they knew."

Equally President Monroe bound this nation not to interfere in concerns distinctly European. He was determined that the United States should dwell alone. Providence and nature had set her alone on the face of the earth, and this was done that in spirit and in life as well as in geographical body she might dwell in a sacred and splendid isolation.

"It was for this we bade the Old Word leave
Us to ourselves, and set the vacant seas
Between our youth and her age-worn iniquities."

The Monroe Doctrine was proclaimed at a time when the "allied Powers" of Europe, whose representatives, assembled at Vienna, took to themselves the name of the "Holy Alliance," were attempting to give renewed prominence to the thought that kings govern by divine right. "It was intended to teach the people that all the liberties they were entitled to possess were such only as the governing monarchs deemed expedient to grant them; that they were entitled to none whatsoever by virtue of the natural law; that the attempt to establish representative and liberal government, like that of the United States, was an unpardonable sin against God, and that the highest duty of citizenship was obedience to monarchical authority."

Such were the principles of the "Holy Alliance" of the crowned heads of Europe. Its specific object was to re-establish the despotism of Spain upon her revolted colonies in South America and in Mexico. On the other hand, the essence of the Monroe Doctrine as then understood by all the world was that "while we forbid the establishment of despotic governments upon the American continent, we recognize the corresponding obligation to refrain from any attempt to force our political system upon any part of the Old World."

Be it even so. One voice and one alone is wafted down from the days of the forefathers. The silent artillery of time has mown them down, but from their very sepulchres their warning voices say to the sons and daughters of the Republic: "THE PEOPLE SHALL DWELL ALONE, AND SHALL NOT BE RECKONED AMONG THE NATIONS."
