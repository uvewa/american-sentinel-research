"The only legitimate prayer in politics," says Rev. J. P. Brushingham, pastor of the Chicago First Methodist Church, "is this: 'Thy will be done,' or 'May heaven bless the nation and guide those who are in authority.'" If a person, therefore, votes as he prays his vote must be too indefinite to count.
