There has been renewed effort recently in behalf of saloon Sunday observance in some parts of Louisiana. The new mayor of New Orleans seems determined to enforce the Sunday law against flagrant violators, i.e., against those saloon-keepers who keep their doors "wide open." Accordingly word was passed to the police force to keep a strict lookout for open saloons. Arrests were made, and the saloons for the most part were compelled to suspend business on Sunday. This forced the drink element to repair to towns across the river and elsewhere in an effort to "quench their thirst." The New Orleans mayor had no jurisdiction over these near-by towns, and so the rival saloons soon did a large business, to the detriment of the New Orleans dealers, who made a demand on the governor of the State to see that justice was done to all parties. The governor wrote the following letter to the sheriffs of Jefferson and St. Bernard parishes:

"My attention has been called to recent complaints in the public press of New Orleans and in other quarters that while the authorities of that city are earnestly striving to have the Sunday law strictly enforced within its limits, certain persons in your parish are openly violating this law in plain knowledge of, and without interference from, the authorities thereof, thereby profiting from enforcement in New Orleans.

"There are diverse opinions as to the justice or expediency of the law adverted to, just as there are in regard to other laws, but there can be no difference of opinion as to the duty of the officers charged with the execution of the laws. They can not undertake to discriminate between laws, enforcing the one and ignoring the other. Hence, so long as any law remains upon the statute book it is the sworn duty of the officers charged with the enforcement of the laws generally to enforce such law.

"I would, therefore, enjoin upon you that you exercise the utmost vigilance in the enforcement of the Sunday law, so that the violators thereof may become convinced that it shall be executed as well as other laws, and that they will not be permitted to profit from the observance of this law by their neighbors. W. W. HEARD, Governor."

The principle involved in the matter is further expressed in an editorial of the New Orleans Times-Democrat, which we give:

"The attitude of the sheriffs of the two parishes adjoining Orleans—Jefferson above and St Bernard below—in respect to the Sunday law calls up a number of difficult problems. That law is no more popular in New Orleans than it is in these parishes; and if it were submitted to popular vote we have no doubt that it would be overwhelmingly defeated. But does this unpopularity authorize the officials in one parish to nullify the law when it is enforced in a neighboring parish? Is the latter to be discriminated against and suffer positive injury because its officials believe it their duty to enforce the laws on the statute books, as they are sworn to do. In other words, is Orleans to suffer because it obeys the law and Jefferson and St. Bernard to be allowed to profit by the conscientiousness of our city officials?

"Whatever may be one's views as to the Sunday law, or even as to whether an official should enforce all the laws or not, no one can or will question the correctness of the governor's declaration that the people of no parish will be allowed to take advantage of the enforcement of a law in New Orleans. In other words, no one will assert that New Orleans should suffer because its officials obey an act of the legislature, while St. Bernard and Jefferson make a handsome profit at the expense of this city out of their nullification of that statute. The Sunday law is one for the whole State, not for certain parishes; and if the people of New Orleans are made to accept it against their will, there is no reason why Jefferson and St. Bernard should escape its provisions. There must be equality in this matter, not discrimination against New Orleans in the interest of neighboring parishes."

Sunday laws are unjust from whatever view they may be considered.
