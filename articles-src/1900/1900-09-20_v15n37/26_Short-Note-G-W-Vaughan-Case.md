AFTER some delay, due to a misunderstanding, we are apprised of the final facts in the case of Mr. G. W. Vaughan, of Hickory, North Carolina, who was arrested under the Sunday law of that State in June last. As our readers will remember, Mr. Vaughan was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $25, besides costs of trial. He took an appeal to the superior court of the State, and this court reversed the verdict, setting aside both fine and costs imposed by the lower court. Thus a stumbling-block has been laid in the way of religious intolerance in that State.
