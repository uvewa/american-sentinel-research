## DEPARTING FROM AMERICAN PRINCIPLES.

### What Prominent Americans Are Saying.

The axiom that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed is a baseless assumption.—Lyman Abbott.

The Constitution or national policy adopted by thirteen half-consolidated, weak, rescued colonies, glad to be able to call their lives their own, can not be expected to hamper the greatest nation in the world.—Franklin McVeagh.

It is a favorite notion now to quote the words "governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed," as if these embodied a law of application to all inhabitants alike. . . . The Declaration of Independence was a formal notice that the inhabitants of the colonies consented no longer to British rule.—New York Tribune.

The Declaration of Independence was made to suit a particular existing condition of things. The Declaration meant simply that the colonies had become tired of the English domination, deeming it oppressive and intending to set up a government of their own, by the right of revolution. They were not laying down a principle for anybody except themselves.—New York Sun.

I want to say before I conclude, Mr. Chairman, that I am not impressed with the argument that all government is by consent of the governed. That is a proposition that, however nicely it looks theoretically, we have never adopted in practice in this country. . . . The rule does not apply to republican representative government.—Speech in Congress by Representative Dalzell, of Pennsylvania.

And so to-day there are those who wave the Declaration of Independence in our faces, and tell us that the thing to do is to deliver over those islands of the archipelago in the East to the people who are their rightful masters; for "all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." So wrote Thomas Jefferson. Do you remember that the Lord said to Joshua, "My servant is dead"? And so is Thomas Jefferson.—Rev. P. S. Henson, Chicago.

The Declaration of Independence was the greatest campaign document that was ever written, but when the colonial representatives argued the question that all men were created equal, what they meant was that they were just as good as Englishmen. They had no thought of the negro slaves who were toiling on American plantations, or of the Indians, whom they despised and detested. The application was direct to themselves, and the sweeping generalizations were gratifying because they imparted the necessary fervor to the document.—Chicago Times-Herald.

The framers of the American Declaration of Independence were inspired by an ardent patriotism and by lofty motives, and their statements embodied a sufficient justification of the cause to which they sought to devote their countrymen; but there was no revelation of universal and eternal truth in the "glittering generalities" with which they prefaced those statements. On the contrary, they consecrated to perpetuity some of the most obvious fallacies that were ever promulgated to mislead men. They proclaimed it to be a self-evident truth "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Whatever interpretation and exegesis may do for this declaration, in the sense in which it is commonly accepted and used in the place of argument, it is neither self-evident nor truth. . . . All men are simply not created equal in any possible sense of the word.—Amos K. Fiske, in North American Review.
