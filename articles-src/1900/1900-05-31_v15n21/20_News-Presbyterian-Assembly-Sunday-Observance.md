In the Presbyterian General Assembly in St. Louis, May 18, the Special Committee on Sabbath Observance presented by its chairman, Rev. I. W. Hathaway, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, a report, resolutions nine and ten of which were as follows:

"Resolved. That we deprecate the rapidly increasing Sabbath slavery of corporate employees in this country, so that to-day by careful estimate no less than 4,000,000 men are thus enslaved and robbed of their inalienable rights to this day of rest."

"Resolved, That we call upon the railroad companies of this land that are engaged in running Sunday excursions, or allowing their road and rolling stock to be used for such purpose, to reconsider their action in this regard, so as to secure the minimum of transportation and service of their employees on this day, both on economic and moral grounds."

A report in a daily paper says that subsequently "slavery" was softened to "employment" and "forcibly deprived" was sustituted for "enslaved and robbed" in the first resolution, and "earnestly request" for "call upon" in the second.

"But these changes were not made until Dr. Hathaway and Dr. McKibbon had expressed their opinion of the terms employed by the committee. These ministers thought they should stand, but others wished to modify them for fear the St. Louis strikers should receive unintended encouragement."
