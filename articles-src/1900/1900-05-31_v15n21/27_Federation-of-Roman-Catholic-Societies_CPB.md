A movement is on foot for the federation of all Roman Catholic societies in this country. The proposed federation is stated to be "for the purpose of better carrying out the fraternity taught by societies, of establishing a bureau for the dissemination of Catholic literature, employment bureaus, etc."

A further clue to the real purpose of the movement is given in the following paragraph from an eminent Catholic divine, taken from the Catholic Mirror (Baltimore):

"The organization of Catholic societies is an effort to furnish Catholic laymen the benefits offered them in societies that, to say the least, are dangerous to Catholic faith. And I think it is the experience of most of us, lay and clerical, that those societies have not accomplished all that was hoped of them. In fact, in some instances they have succeeded in little else than exciting a fear and suspicion on the part of some outside the church that their ulterior purpose was to secure control of the government or some such wild idea. If their federation will render them more efficient, let them be so united."

It seems that by federation it is hoped these societies can do something more than merely excite suspicion; that is, united they may be able to accomplish that which is now only suspected. Therefore, "let them be united," says this "eminent divine."

One way in which the proposed federation is expected to operate is thus suggested by Gen. H. T. Rush, Chairman of a special committee appointed to perfect a scheme of federation. Among many other things General Rush says:

"We are paying taxes for the education of other people's children, and the whole system, the libraries included, is a public system which we should see is not used for the propagation of falsehood and misrepresentation. If we had not a child in the public schools we should still have the right and be under the duty of seeing that school libraries be not made channels of falsehood and breeders of unnatural prejudices. The very text books of history in many of our high schools are grossly unfair and objectionable. Individuals here and there may raise objections, but nothing but organized effort all over the country can hope to accomplish any real and lasting good. It is a misfortune for anybody to be misinformed as to any fact, no matter what its nature. And without going so far as to say that "history is a conspiracy against truth," it is known to us all that much of the history written to-day for the young is not history but fiction written with a design to blacken the Catholic Church. All this certainly offers a wide field for lay action. With some such federation as this any society might still maintain its immediate purpose and still cooperate in carrying out some or all the purposes here outlined."

The ability of Catholics to manipulate history, to minimize or suppress certain facts and to magnify out of all just proportion other facts, is well known. Some of this work has been done even in the public schools and with the accomplishment of this federation we may look for much more to be done. And in this connection the statement made by the Mirror is significant, that "the Knights of Columbus of the District of Columbia are beginning to manifest a great interest in the endowment of the Chair of American History in the University."
