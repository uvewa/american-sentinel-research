Touching the proposed interference of the general government with the spread of Mormonism, the New York Christian Advocate has this to say:

"As a religion Mormonism cannot command the assent of thoughtful, intelligent persons. It may draw uneducated people within its circle, and they may become shrewd and able within that sphere, and be involved with its property and social influences, and their children may be intelligent and capable of looking over the moral and intellectual fences which have been built around them; but in the open field of discussion and in free association with the public, Mormonism can make no real progress. But whither is our logic leading us? Is not this country the birthplace of modern Spiritualism and Christian science, and the harvest field of anti-medicine faith-healing? Who knows what may happen? Do not the clairvoyants and fortune tellers thrive here, and nowhere more than in Boston and New York? Is not this the paradise of quacks of all sorts, . . . to say nothing of all sorts of political delusions and other mental and moral epidemics? But federal interference, never, unless people violate the law. Federal interference and state interference with the practice of polygamy, yes. But neither federal or state interference with Mormonism as a religion, for that would simply mean a possible interference, federal or state, with Protestantism where Catholicism is in the majority, or Catholicism where Protestantism is in the majority, or any branch of either. It is 'pleading the baby act' for any religion in this country to ask for federal interference in its own behalf or against another. Let the Christian church know the danger and use Christian means of counteracting it, and all will be well. Let them send as many missionaries, and better support those they have; let pastors and laymen scour the unchurched communities, and no such ungodly mixture of the carnal and the spiritual as Mormonism can long flourish."
