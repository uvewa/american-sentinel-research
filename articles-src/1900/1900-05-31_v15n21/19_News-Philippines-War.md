A Boston clergyman, Rev. Clay MacCauley, just returned to Boston from Japan and a recent visit to the Philippines, is interviewed by the Boston Transcript. In speaking of the war the United States is now carrying on in the Philippines, Mr. MacCauley said, among other things:

"The Philippine question will never be settled securely and permanently until it is settled right, or until the nation degrades itself with yet deeper dishonor than marks our century of dealings with the Indians of our plains. This nation can crush the Filipinos out of existence in time, of course, and our good people may be deluded into thinking this the fit thing to do. But perhaps I would better say no more about this matter now. The American people, so far as I can see, seem to think that their present government has been acting wisely, throughout the course of events in the East. I am unwilling to blame, but this I am sure of, that however much 'world politics' has made it necessary that the United States should take possession of the Philippines, the manner in which the government set about to gain that possession bears no fit apology for it, better than ignorance and Caesar's will."
