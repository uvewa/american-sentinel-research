Some few people at least are becoming alive to the fact that something more is required to reform society than conventions and resolutions, or even civil laws. "An American Mother," writing in the "Ladies' Home Journal" for April, says:

"There are other and graver facts of which I can but hint here which prove how deep is the decadence of the old sacred family life, and how rapidly the instinct of motherhood is dying out among our women. One is the rapid and enormous increase of divorces in this country, especially in the northeastern farming states. It is not only the gay, self-indulgent husband and wife who tire of each other, but the plodding farmer and the woman who is old and worn out with work. Another fact, even more tragic and significant, is the number of childless homes in the northern states. Hundreds of the oldest leading American families have become extinct in the last decade. The women of these families were notably active in public work. So large has been the decrease of births of American parentage in one section of this country that there is a real danger that the native stock there will entirely die out. There are darker depths here which I shall not uncover. All women have looked into them."

The particularly significant statement in the foregoing is that the women in the leading American families which have become extinct "were notably active in public life." They gave speeches and essays and high moral instruction to the world instead of giving children.
