We shall have something interesting to report in a week or two regarding the result of an attempt to establish religious intolerance in the province of Ontario, by means of Sunday laws enacted by the provincial legislature. The question of the validity of the Ontario Sunday law—known as the "Lord's Day Act"—has now come before the Court of Appeals, and the decision of the judges concerning it will be of much interest and importance to the cause of religious freedom in Canada.
