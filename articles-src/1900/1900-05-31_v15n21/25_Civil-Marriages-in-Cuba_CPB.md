When General Brooke became Governor General of Cuba he took from the Catholic Church the exclusive right to perform the marriage ceremony and turned it over to the civil magistrates at the request of the revolutionary and radical members of his cabinet. "The Catholic Church," remarks the Mirror (Baltimore), "with the tacit support at least of the Protestant ministers in Cuba, is preparing to bring pressure on Governor General Wood to induce him to revoke General Brooke's order making civil marriage alone legal."

General Brooke's order has been the law in Cuba for more than a year, but it is likely a change will be made soon. Of the efforts in this direction, the Catholic Mirror says:

"Archbishop Sbarretti has consulted with General Wood concerning the matter and has asked for the revocation of the order. General Wood has the same feeling in this matter that he has on the question of divorce. If the Cuban people want the law changed so as to legalize both civil and religious ceremonies, he is disposed to make the change. This is all that any religious denomination could ask.

"Archbishop Sbarretti is getting up an enormous petition for presentation to General Wood in order to show him the feeling of the people of the island. The Protestant clergy will also urge the revocation of the law, and unless the element opposed to the churches proves the stronger, it is expected that the change will come."

This is only right. It is an infringement of the rights of conscience to require people to submit to civil marriage who believe the rite to be a sacrament of the church. Marriages should be a matter of public record and such safeguards should be thrown around marriage as will make reasonably secure the rights of all parties, but to require either that all marriages shall be religious or that they shall all be civil is wrong. General Brooke's order ought to be so modified as to permit religious, equally with civil marriages.
