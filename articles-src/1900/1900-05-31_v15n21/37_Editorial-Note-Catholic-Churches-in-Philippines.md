The Catholic press in the United States is still endeavoring to work up the basis of a claim for large damages against the Government for the "desecration" of Catholic churches in the Philippines. It seems pretty generally understood, however, that most of the alleged desecration occurred as the direct result of the use of the churches by the "insurgents" as forts in which to resist the advance of the Government forces in the islands.
