In the prelude to a recent sermon in Carnegie Lyceum, New York, Rev. Henry Frank, pastor of the Metropolitan Church, declared that the freeing of the negro was a mistake. He said: "His (the negro's) native sluggishness, the evidences of his gradual extinction since his enfranchisement, his imperceptible improvement since liberation, his startling lapses into barbarism, all must incline thinking people to conclude that the freeing of the negro has proved a disastrous failure.

"Every thinking man must believe that the franchise must be removed from the negro in such places, at least, where negro suffrage must mean negro domination.

"A new system of voluntary and penal servitude should be instituted. A section of country should be set apart to which all negroes would be permitted to voluntarily migrate and there yield themselves as slaves to such persons as would agree to possess them, give them humane treatment and education."
