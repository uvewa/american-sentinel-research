"Who will haul down the flag?" quoth he.
Why, no hand of flesh or bone
Can lower that flag on land or sea
Till the faith of the flag is gone!
Till a few shall rule and cunningly keep
The bunting to garnish their greed;
Till dollars are dear and humanity cheap
By the force of a Tory creed!
Then will it fall! but answer us clear,
Do you fancy that hour is drawing near?

Did our liberty bell ring in vain?
Was our Declaration a lie?
Must we turn to the Old World again
With the penitent prodigal's cry?
Must we arm us and march in the van
Of Europe's barbaric parade,
And boom out gunpowder gospel to man
To open a pathway for trade?
Shall we strut through the world and bluster and brag
With the dollar mark stamped on the brave old flag?

Nay! haul up the flag! raise it high!
Not yet is its spirit spent!
Let it sing to the wind and the sky
The truth that it always meant!
Let it sing of the birthright of man,
Of progress that never can lag;
Let it sing that trade may go where it can,
But liberty follows the flag!

ANON.
