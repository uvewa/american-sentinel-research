The fatherhood and consequent sovereignty of God, and the brotherhood, and consequent equality of man, is more than a poetic fancy; it is a fundamental truth, obscured indeed by human selfishness, but none the less true. The framers of the Declaration of Independence recognized it when they set forth that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their *Creator* with certain unalienable rights; and that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." All of these truths are just as vital to-day as they were in 1776.
