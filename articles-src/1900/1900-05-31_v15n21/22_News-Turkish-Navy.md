In a recent interview in New York, Rear Admiral Ahmed Pasha of the Turkish navy said: "From what I could learn of the desires of the Sultan in conversation with him he is anxious to increase the prowess of his navy. I will not give the reasons. I will not say whether we fear Russia, or England, or any other country, but, at any rate, we see that our navy must be put on a basis with western countries."

And then other powers see that their navies must be correspondingly strengthened, so the building and equipping of floating forts goes on in an ever increasing ratio.
