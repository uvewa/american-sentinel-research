Only an infallible authority can safely define morality, and any power which cannot be trusted to define morality, cannot be trusted to foster it.

No individual has any right to force his ideas of morality upon another person; and as no individual has this right, no number of individuals can have it; and as no number of individuals can have it, it cannot belong to the state.
