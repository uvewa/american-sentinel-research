An eastern exchange reports an agitation in Hackensack, N. J., over the question of permitting Sunday golf. The golf club of the city declares it is their intention to regulate their playing only by the state of the weather, and certain of the Hackensack clergy threaten to invoke the law unless Sunday playing is stopped; which, as our exchange remarks, "is not at all neighborly, as the golf players have made no objection to the churches being open on Sunday."
