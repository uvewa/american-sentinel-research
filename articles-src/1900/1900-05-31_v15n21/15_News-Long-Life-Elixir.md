A recent despatch from Paris says that a renowned physician, Rastineuf, after long experimenting with a certain variety of "long-life elixir," concluded it was perfectly safe, and injected a dose into his aged mother's arm two days in succession. She died in horrible suffering on the third day. The doctor, who had taken a hypodermic injection simultaneously, in order to prove to his mother how harmless the stuff was, survived his mother only twenty-four hours.
