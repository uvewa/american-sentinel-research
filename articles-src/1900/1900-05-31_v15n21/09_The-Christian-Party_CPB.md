As the readers of the Sentinel know, there is in the field of national politics a party styling itself the "United Christian Party," the platform of which says:

"We believe the time has arrived when the eternal principles of justice, mercy and love as exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ should be embodied in the Constitution of our nation and applied in concrete form to every function of our government. We maintain that this statement is in harmony with the fundamental principles of our national common law, our Christian usages and customs, the declaration of the Supreme Court of the United States that this is a Christian country and the accepted principles in judicial decisions that no law shall contravene the divine law.

"We deprecate certain immoral laws which have grown out of failure of our nation to recognize these principles, notably the permission of the desecration of the Christian Sabbath, authorized unscriptural marriage and divorce and the license and manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage."

This is but putting into slightly different phrase the demands made for years by the National Reform Association, article 2 of the constitution of which reads:

"The object of this society shall be to maintain existing Christian features in the American government; to promote needed reforms in the action of the government, touching the Sabbath, the institution of the family, the religious element in education, the oath, and public morality as affected by the liquor traffic and other kindred evils; and to secure such an amendment to the Constitution of the United States as will declare the nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and so indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions, and usages of our government on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."

The points of similarity between the two planks which we have quoted from the platform of the United Christian Party and article 2 of the National Reform constitution are certainly striking. Just what such utterances mean can be best told by those prominent in this so-called reform scheme.

In a convention held in New York City, Feb. 26, 27, 1873, Jonathan Edwards, D. D., said:

"We want state and religion, and we are going to have it. It shall be that so far as the affairs of state require religion, it shall be the religion of Jesus Christ."

At a convention held in Pittsburg, Pa., a year later, Prof. C. A. Blanchard said:

"Constitutional laws punish for false money, weights, and measures. So Congress must establish a standard of religion, or admit anything called religion."

In the Christian Statesman of Nov. 1, 1883, Rev. W. J. Coleman said:

"To be perfectly plain, I believe that the existence of a Christian Constitution would disfranchise every logically consistent infidel."

Again, in the Christian Statesman of Jan. 13, 1887, Rev. M. A. Galt, at that time a prominent National Reform worker, said:

"Our remedy for all these malefic influences is to have the government simply set up the moral law, and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it."

Dec. 14th of the same year, in an open letter to the editors of this paper, Rev. W. T. McConnell said:

"You look for trouble in this land in the future, if these principles are applied. I think it will come to you if you maintain your present position."

And no longer ago than December, 1899, in a National Reform convention held in New York City, Rev. J. M. Foster said:

"We sometimes think the Pilgrim Fathers were too severe in their legislation against immorality. There was a law in the colonial statutes of New England that for a flagrant violation of the Sabbath the offender should be hanged. We may say this was wrong; but let me ask, were they nearer or farther from the moral law as interpreted by the Mosaic legislation than we are? Under the Mosaic law a man guilty of idolatry and Sabbath breaking was to be executed; and I apprehend that we ought to return to that order of things to-day, and execute the penalty for the violation of moral law. A man who openly and violently blasphemes the name of God has forfeited his right to live under the God whose law he has broken."

But let us hear some official testimony upon the meaning of this demand that "the teachings of Jesus Christ" shall "be embodied in the Constitution of our nation and applied in concrete form to every function of our government." March 11, 1896, there was a hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington. The subject under consideration was a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the preamble to the Constitution of the United States, as follows (the part inclosed in brackets being that which it is proposed to insert):

"We, the people of the United States [acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and His revealed will as of supreme authority in civil affairs], in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

At this hearing Mr. Baker, a member of the committee, asked Dr. McAllister, Secretary of the National Reform Association, this question:

"Who is going to decide that justice, the Protestant or Catholic, the Hebrew or Mohammedan?"

Dr. McAllister: "It will be decided as it is to-day. A man comes here to Congress, receiving the suffrages of the people. His voice enters as an element in the voice of the nation, and that collective being, the Government, must interpret what is right and wrong, just as it does to-day. * * * What we ask is that you acknowledge in your legislation the moral principles of Christianity."

Mr. Baker: "Do you, then, believe the voice of the people is the voice of God?"

Dr. McAllister: "When it is right."

Mr. Baker: "Who is to determine what is right?"

Dr. McAllister: "The nation in its responsibility to God."

Mr. Baker: "How are you going to determine that?"

Dr. McAllister: "By the people themselves; just as they do now."

Again, in the same hearing, in replying to a question as to how this would affect the individual conscience, Dr. McAllister said:

"I say it comes to this: This matter of conscience is one that goes back to the moral sense of the people. It is not simply an individual conscience. * * * Here is a nation, which gives its decision according to its sense of right and wrong. That is the national conscience, and when the nation gives its decision, * * * the individual conscience must yield to the conscience of the whole people which is over him, and should be over him in order to enforce what is right, but which can be over him only by recognizing the Lord's supreme authority over the nation."

* * * * * * * * *

The Chairman: "Do you believe the Bible to be the word of God?"

Dr. McAllister: "I do; but that does not enter into the question."

The Chairman: "Now, if you believe that, do you intend by this amendment to have the Bible recognized in the Constitution as the word of God?"

Dr. McAllister: "As the standard of morality, acknowledged by the people, by the nation, as given by God."

The Chairman: "I want to get at exactly what you mean here. I read your proposed amendment—'We, the people of the United States [acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all power and authority in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of nations, and His revealed will as supreme authority in civil affairs]"—in civil affairs. That is the point. What do you refer to by His revealed will?"

Dr. McAllister: "The Bible."

The Chairman: "Then you wish the Constitution to recognize the Bible as supreme authority in civil affairs, do you not?"

Dr. McAllister: "Yes, sir."

The Chairman: "Then the supreme authority—that is, law—in civil affairs must be construed and enforced by the courts, must it not?"

Dr. McAllister: "Certainly."

It is not likely that this so-called Christian party will poll any considerable number of votes at the approaching presidential election; but it is one of the several organizations committed to this same mischievous idea of moral reform by act of Congress or by constitutional amendment; and their evil influence is spreading.

Personally those who are prominent in the several branches of this movement are worthy men. We give them credit for the best of intentions; but the success of their scheme could result in nothing short of persecution for conscience' sake. It has been well said that "among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for the violation of what government denominated the law of God. To prevent a similar train of evils in this country, the Constitution has wisely withheld from our government the power of defining the divine law."

With the constitutional safeguards removed the fear expressed by Jefferson when he said, "A single zealot may commence persecution, and better men be his victims," would be quickly realized. "There is but one protection against the tyranny of any class, and that is to give that class very little power."

This is just as true of such men as are leading out in this "reform" movement as of any other class. They are only human.
