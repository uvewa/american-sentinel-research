The question of exempting church property from taxation has become a political issue in Nebraska, the Silver Republicans in that state having made the taxation of church property a plank in their party platform. The Omaha Bee calls attention to the fact that this is not the first time this question has been connected with Nebraska politics. "Church taxation," says the Bee, "was one of the much debated features of the constitution submitted to the voters of Nebraska in 1871. This subject was the prime rock of contention on which that constitution foundered, or rather was counted out. It afforded the only opportunity and the only example for a union of the church militant of all denominations. The Catholic priests and the Methodist preachers for once slept in the same bed and preached the same crusade denouncing the proposition as an attempt to tax the bones of their fathers interred in the cemetery and the most sacred places of worship." The Bee concludes that "If the Silver Republicans succeed in engrafting church taxation in their national platform they will resurrect the echoes of the memorable Nebraska campaign of 1871 and unchain the dogs of war by bringing the battalions of the church into battle array against the phalanx of the political reformers."

Probably there is not much danger of any general disturbance over this question in the United States; but it may be observed in passing that the exemption of church property from taxation is not supported by any principle of republican government; and while a conflict of clergy and politicians is much to be deprecated, a battle for the right is far preferable to peaceful acquiescence in the wrong.
