The city council of Topeka, Kans., not very long ago passed a Sunday closing ordinance, which, however, was not very strictly enforced, and it was alleged that "loud complaints" of this laxity were made by the merchants of the place. Now the mayor has announced that beginning with Sunday, May 27, the law will be strictly enforced, even to the closing of florists' shops and ice cream parlors. The mayor appears to be unmindful of the fact such an effort as he is now making to secure Sunday observance in Topeka, has been tried in numerous other cities in various States, but never with any permanent success. Reform without conscience must be a failure always.
