The following appeared in a recent issue of the Washington Post:

"Cuban Scandals—Honeycombed with fraud—Further Disclosures of Rottenness in the Cuban Postal System—Postmaster Thompson, of Habana, Under Detention, and as Wholesale Arrests are Impending, a Fort will be Prepared for Prisoners.

"Habana, May 14, 1900.

"The extent of the postal frauds is far greater than what was originally expected. Besides taking in the postal department, the frauds seem to include the local office at Habana and various other offices throughout the island, and also to have extended to outside points which have been used for the sale of some of the old issue of stamps that were ordered destroyed.

"Messrs. Reeves and Reynolds, the auditors of the postal department, are still under arrest at their own rooms, in charge of detectives. Special quarters, will, however, be prepared in some fort, where all the prisoners connected with the frauds will be taken as soon as arrested.

"To-day's arrests and the suspension of Mr. Thompson did not take place until after dark, and consequently these new features of the case are not generally known throughout the city this evening; but there is a perceptible excitement at the post-office, where no one knows who may be the next to be singled out.

"Every additional revelation increases the amazement of the Americans here. The Cubans seem to be immensely pleased. They declare that the Americans can no longer boast in Cuba of their superior honesty when in Government employ."

In the light of history, there is nothing surprising about such governmental corruption as is here described. It is the legitimate fruit of the system of government which disconnects the power of office from responsibility to the people governed, leaving the governing officials answerable only to an authority in a foreign land whose people feel little interest in the affairs of a distant province. As was said by a speaker in Congress, "It has been the history of the world from the days of the Roman empire to the present hour. Where men have been sent abroad to maintain military occupation and to govern a subject people, they have been robbers, and American citizens have proven in the case of Cuba to be no exception to that rule."

We do not present this statement of official corruption in Cuba because of any importance it has in itself, but because of its bearing upon the great question of the extent to which history will repeat itself in the United States. In sending governors to rule over foreign provinces this republic has followed the example of ancient Rome. In corruptly administering the affairs of their office the American governors have followed the example of the Roman governors. How much further will the history of the Roman republic be repeated in the course of the American republic? Will it be repeated to the end of the republic and the setting up of empire and despotism upon its ruins, as was the case with Rome? This is a question of tremendous importance to American citizens of to-day, and no one can afford to set it aside as one unrelated to his own personal interests.
