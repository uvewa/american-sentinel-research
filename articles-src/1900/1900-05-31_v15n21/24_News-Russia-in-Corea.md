"The news that the Russian government will make Masampo, in Corea, the winter headquarters of the Russian fleet is considered ominous of further encroachments by the Muscovite in that country," remarks the Springfield Republican. "The Russian minister, M. Pavloff, has secured a site for a coal depot and naval hospital in Masampo harbor, but, at the same time, he has renounced for the czar any purpose to acquire land on the mainland opposite the harbor. London evidently has no faith in the renunciation. It is Japan that is more concerned in these developments than any other power, and it is certain that the establishment of a Russian naval base just across the straits of Tsushina will not please the Japanese. The alarmists, who have been predicting an early war between Russia and Japan, will find in the news fresh fuel for their fears."
