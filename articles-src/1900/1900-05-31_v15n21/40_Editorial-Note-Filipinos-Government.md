A proposition announced in the platform of a political party in Oregon, is "to give to the Filipinos, first, a stable form of government." To which a New Bedford, Mass., journal truthfully replies: "Well, you can't do it. Nobody can do it. A stable form of government depends on the people themselves, whether they are ruled from within or without."
