[By the late James T. Ringgold.]

ALTOGETHER OF FAITH.

Christianity is essentially and altogether of faith, for Jesus Christ is both "the Author and Finisher of our faith;" and it is written, "Whatsoever is not of faith is sin." It being true that whatsoever is not of faith is sin, and as Jesus Christ was manifested to take away our sins, it is evident that the salvation offered by Christianity and wrought by Jesus Christ is wholly of faith. And as he is the Author and Finisher even of the faith, as he himself is the giver of the faith which saves from sin, it is therefore and further evident that the salvation offered by Christianity and wrought by Jesus Christ is by grace through faith. And so it is written: "By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD."

NOT A CREED BUT A LIFE.

In this truth, that faith is not of ourselves, but is the gift of God—in this, lies the distinction between Christianity and all other religions. And even more than this; in this truth lies the distinction between the true and false Christianity. True Christianity is not a creed, it is a life; not a body of doctrines formulated by men, but the expression of the life of God in actions of men. This is the difference between "the faith of Jesus Christ," and "the faith of the creed;" between true Christianity and false Christianity; between the true religion and false religions of all kinds.

FAITH WORKS BY LOVE.

The true faith, the faith of Jesus Christ, being the gift of God, bears in itself, and brings to him who exercises it, the divine life, the divine virtue, and the divine power. It brings to men the divine life to renew the soul, the divine virtue to cleanse from sin, the divine power to keep the renewed soul in the way of righteousness, and the divine energy to produce good works even the works of God. "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love"—not faith and works, but faith which works. "Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent." This faith draws the soul to God, subdues the heart to him, and moulds the whole life in the image of Jesus.

RECEIVED BY FREE CHOICE.

This faith is exercised, all its gifts are received, and all its fruits are manifested, at the free choice of the individual himself alone, before Him who is the Author and the Finisher of the faith itself. For it is written, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge (condemn) him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." Thus the Author of the true faith, of the faith of Jesus Christ, leaves every man absolutely free to accept or reject, to believe or not to believe his word. This is true Christianity. God is the Author of freedom of choice and freedom of thought in religion, and whoever in anything or in any degree whatever would invade this perfect freedom, thereby and therein supplants God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.

FALSE FAITH—FAITH OF THE CREED.

There is another kind of belief, a false faith, which is from the side of man himself, otherwise called "the faith of the creed." This sort of faith is essentially human, for the creed is only an invention of men. The creed being wholly an invention of men, and therefore only human, the faith of the creed is but the same. Being only human, it is utterly impotent to bring to men any shadow of virtue or power to take away sin or to renew the life; and the only seeming virtue even that it can possibly have is but a form of godliness, a mere outward profession. This is false Christianity wherever found.

FALSE FAITH BURNS MEN TO SAVE THEM.

By its extreme conception of the importance of a man's belief of the creed to his eternal welfare, this false yet popular Christianity was led into the requirement of such belief, elaborate and complicated beyond all precedent. If one may suffer eternally by reason of his wrong belief on one subject connected with the "hereafter," may he not probably so suffer in consequence of his wrong belief on some other subject in the same connection? Obviously, the only way to "save" him with absolute certainty was to provide him with the right belief on every point that could be imagined as possible to arise. This amiable desire gave birth to the long and mysterious "creeds," for the sake of which those who misunderstood them in one way plundered and shot and burned and ravished those who misunderstood them in another way, for hundreds and hundreds of years; for whose sake John Huss suffered, and Calvin burnt Servetus alive, and the Puritans murdered the "witches" and Quakers.

Belief in the creed was held to be essential to salvation. But many could not be persuaded to believe the things laid down in the creed, nor even to say that they believed them. In dealing with such persons, the end was great enough to justify any means. The adaptation of the means to the end was not seriously questioned. The propagation of the "faith" was deliberately undertaken on the assumption that it could be shot into a man or burnt into him, or racked into him, and it was conducted on that hypothesis for hundreds of years; and this notion still pervades popular Christianity.

IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE THE MIND BY TORTURE.

Such a conception of the psychological nature of belief would be wildly grotesque if the results had not been so full of misery to the race. The apparently fundamental principles that it is impossible to convince a man of any proposition by torturing him, since the reasoning faculty is not controlled by the body, but the reverse; that we can never really know what a man believes in the matter of religion, because we have no possible way of ascertaining this except from his assertions, and men may lie on this subject as on others; that persons capable of adhering to an abstraction in the face of a horrible death are just the manly, courageous, faithful citizens most desirable in any community, while acquiescence extorted by pain or terror is not only to be suspected of insincerity, but argues a weakling, if not a hypocrite, and in any event a lack of the highest attributes of human nature—such simple truths as these were utterly beyond the grasp of intellects capable of persecuting for conscience's sake.

PERSECUTORS MOVED BY SENSE OF DUTY.

We may admit that Charlemagne and other "Christian" princes disguised the greed of power under the cloak of religious zeal, and waged destructive wars against unoffending nations upon the pretense of anxiety for their salvation. But a great deal of "Christian" persecution was carried on in times of peace and within the domains of the civil authority which directed it; and its victims were often men who were not suspected of any disposition to defy or ignore the government. Political aggrandizement could form no inducement for the proceedings against such persons. The motive must be sought elsewhere. No doubt in many cases personal animosity, greed, lust, made their baleful influence felt; and perhaps the proportion of such cases would be larger, could we sift the evidence at this late day. But conceding to such motives their utmost force, the fact remains that they could not have thus manifested themselves if the ostensible purpose of the deeds had not been one which commended itself to the public conscience of the times.

No candid student of history will deny that many of those who actually directed these persecutions, as well as thousands who applauded them, were moved by sincere and disinterested ideas of duty. Their hearts seem hard and cruel, but, fixed immovably at their very roots, lay a profound and perfectly honest conviction that the fire and the torture were necessary for the good of the sufferer, and that the present pain was a means, and the only means, in the last resort, of preserving him from a far worse fate in the other world. Many a priest would sooner have gone to the stake himself than have neglected the duty of holding the crucifix close to the victim's lips throughout his agony, if haply the spirit might move him at any instant to kiss it, and thereby accomplish his salvation.

## THE VICTORY OF FAITH.

It is hard to know which to pity most—the poor heretic whose body is seen in the pictures bound fast to the stake, or the shaven and cowled figure standing near by, watching with conscientious eagerness every movement of his mouth and head, and ready to assist the sufferer at any instant, even at the risk of setting himself on fire, to give the saving kiss to the emblem he carries in the air.

When we remember what that emblem was, whose image it bore, and what an awful scene it commemorated, we see on one side of the picture a human soul so humiliated, so blackened, so tortured, twisted, beaten into such dissemblance of its Creator, that the spectacle of the burning body on the other side, from whose eyes a spirit looks up with a rapture that flames cannot quench, but only consummate, is a relief to the contemplation.
