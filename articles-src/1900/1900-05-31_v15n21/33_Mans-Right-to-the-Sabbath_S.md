"The Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:27. Therefore, man has a right to the Sabbath day.

He has this right as an individual, for the Sabbath was given to the individual man, and man's relation to God is an individual relation, and must be so long as it embraces faith, love, and individual accountability.

All days were made for man, but the Sabbath above all other days. No other day of the week is especially designated in this way. Man has a higher right, therefore, to the Sabbath day than to any other day.

Any interference by the state with a man's right to an ordinary working day, would be recognized as an act of despotism. What then must be true of state interference with man's right to the day especially made for him?

The state has no right in the Sabbath and can have none, since the Creator did not, and man cannot give the Sabbath to the state.

Man cannot give the Sabbath to the state because it is not his to give. The Sabbath is the Lord's, and man can neither give it into other hands nor transfer any right which he has in the day. Hence there is no way by which any right in the Sabbath can be acquired by the state.

Therefore, any state Sabbath law (assuming Sunday to be the Sabbath) is wholly without foundation in right and justice, and represents only an act of meddling with that which the state has no right to touch. The Sunday laws (if Sunday be the Sabbath) interfere with the highest right a man can have with respect to days of the week. They touch the very day which was especially made for man, and from which, of all days, the state should keep hands off.

This being true, such laws have no rightful place upon the statute books of state or nation, and can derive no justification from the good and pious motives with which many men engage in their support. And this would be equally true of laws enforcing the seventh day, specified as the Sabbath in the law of God. In any case, state Sabbath laws are wrong in principle, and can only be evil in practice, however plausible in appearance.

No gift of God to man needs to be enforced by civil law. No blessing can be drawn down from heaven upon men by the civil power. No good from the institutions of Christianity can be extracted by law. Man's right to the Sabbath can be infringed by law, but not preserved. That right is secured only through man's individual relation to the Creator.
