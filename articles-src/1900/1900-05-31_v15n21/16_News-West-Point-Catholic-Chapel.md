The Roman Catholic chapel on the Government reservation at West Point has been finished, and will be dedicated June 10. The Secretary of War who some years ago authorized the erection of this chapel, as the reader may remember, tried to justify the proceeding by offering other denominations the same privilege; but thus far all the advantage of the offer has accrued to the Catholic church. Government support of the church is peculiarly a papal principle, and its practice must always result in exalting the papacy above the Protestant churches.
