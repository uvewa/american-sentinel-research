It is stated that Queen Victoria is greatly annoyed at Premier Salisbury's gratuitous anti-Irish speech, as it destroyed at a blow the entire effect of her visit to Dublin. The story goes that when Lord Salisbury visited the Queen at Windsor on her return from Ireland he minimized the significance the Queen sought to attach to her reception. He followed this up at his first public appearance by classing the Irish in the same category with the Boers, on whom the virulent hatred of the bulk of Britishers is now concentrated.
