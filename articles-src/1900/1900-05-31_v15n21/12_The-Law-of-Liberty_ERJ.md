The law of God is called the law of liberty. James 2:21 says: "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the perfect law of liberty." From the preceding verse we learn that the law here referred to is the ten commandment law given by God on Mount Sinai; for it is the law that says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," and "Thou shalt not steal."

But why is it called the law of liberty? How can a law that consists of prohibitions be a law of liberty? The answer is found in the first words of this law. It does not consist wholly of commands beginning with "Thou shalt not," but its principle of perfect freedom is revealed in the words: "I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Then follows the command, "Thou shalt have no other Gods before Me." But if this is a law of perfect liberty what is the purpose of this command, and why is it introduced, if not to abridge man's freedom?

The Loving Father has brought Israel out of Egyptian bondage where they could not serve Him even though they desired to do so; and He now says to them, "I have brought thee out of the house of bondage," therefore "have no other gods before me." Since God had delivered them from bondage, He alone could keep them out of bondage, and if they desired to remain free they must continue under His leadership; for the moment they left Him to serve other gods, they would be brought into bondage to other gods. But why were they not just as free when serving other gods as when serving Jehovah, provided they chose to do so? Because when they entered the service of other gods they were utterly unable to be free from that service and its results; they were held bound, no matter how much they might desire to be freed from that service. Their only hope was to cry to the God whom they had forsaken to deliver them again; but when they were once more in the service of Jehovah they were not bound at all, but were free to leave that service at any time.

Thus did God's grace abound toward his people who departed from His ways, turning to other gods. When they cried unto Him in their affliction and distress He came to their rescue, delivering them from the bondage to which they had voluntarily submitted, contrary to His warnings, and giving them the perfect law of liberty for their guidance and instruction. He gives them in answer to their prayer the Spirit and the heart to serve Him. Then, though they are servants of obedience unto righteousness (see Rom. 6:16, and other verses of the same chapter), they serve as free men, in the newness of the Spirit.

Without this Spirit of service it is impossible to serve God or to obey His law. But when men attempt to enforce this law under civil penalties can it still be called a law of liberty? Not in any sense. Can the penalties attached make the sinner free from sin? Can the sword, or the rack, or the prison cell, kindle within the soul that Spirit of heart service? Not at all. The Spirit that "worketh in us to will and to do of His good pleasure" is the gift of God; but it is given only to those who ask. God will never force the door of a man's heart. He stands without and knocks, but will enter only by invitation.

When then will man assume to do what even God himself will not attempt—to force men to serve Him and compel them under pain of imprisonment or death to obey the law of God contrary to their own wills? Do they not in so doing attempt to place themselves not only "above the stars of God," but above the Most High Himself?
