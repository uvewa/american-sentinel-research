Men do not need civil law to teach them their duty toward God; indeed, the civil law cannot by any possibility do this, for those who make civil law are neither qualified nor authorized to declare the will of the Lord. God is his own lawgiver, and has reserved to himself the right to judge violators of his own law. To all who would usurp this divine prerogative he says: "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant?"
