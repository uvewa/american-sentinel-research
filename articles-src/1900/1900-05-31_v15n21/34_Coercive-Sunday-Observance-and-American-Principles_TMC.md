[By the late Judge Thomas M. Cooley.]

This is a country of religious liberty, not of religious toleration merely. Every person is entitled to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, under the obligations which rest upon all alike, that public order shall be respected, and the requirements of morality and decency observed. Whenever the law, either in terms or by the method employed in its enforcement, goes beyond this, and undertakes to compel observances that are only required by particular creeds, no matter how numerous may be those who consider them of divine obligation, it becomes tyrannical and destructive of a fundamental principle of American liberty. It is also tyrannical when it punishes as a public offence the management of a citizen's private affairs in such a manner as his own conscience approves, taking care in doing so neither to wrong nor to disturb those of his fellow citizens who differ with him in their views. If, in their opinion, the course he pursues must be displeasing to the Ruler of the world, the question involved belongs not to human tribunals, and it is the purpose of our constitutional system that human laws administered by imperfect human instruments shall not assume to deal with it. This is a commonplace in the United States of America, but it cannot be too often repeated or too distinctly borne in mind.
