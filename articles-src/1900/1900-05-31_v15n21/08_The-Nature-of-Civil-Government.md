Civil government is ordained of God, but not in the sense understood by some. We are not taught in the Scriptures that there is anything divine about human government. Had man never sinned, there would have been no such thing as civil government.

"God is love," and had sin not entered, love would have reigned supreme over all. But God is never taken by surprise. He is never confronted by an emergency for which he has made no provision. Man was so constituted that in harmony with God he would gladly yield to the divine government of love. Alienated from God, his innate love of order, his sense of justice, and his instinct of self-preservation would lead him inevitably to organize in some manner for the attainment of these ends. And such government is ordained of God in just the same sense as are any of our social relations which inevitably result from human nature and environment, and which in their proper exercise are for the good of mankind. Moreover, this governmental power is just as liable to be misused as are any of the functions of mind or body.

It must be apparent to every one who will give the matter even a moment's thought, that civil government in some form is absolutely essential for a race of social, free moral agents, in a state of alienation from God.

Had not God committed to men the conservation of their own rights, one of two things must have happened; either vengeance for transgression against human rights would have been so swift and certain as to terrorize men, thus destroying in a measure their free moral agency, or else punishment would have been so long delayed as to afford no protection to those in need of it.

"God is love," and when in consonance with his character, he cannot, because of man's sin, do for him what he otherwise would do, he does the very best thing that can be done under the circumstances.

To permit civil government among men was the best thing that God could do for a race that had refused his divine rule. Since men would not willingly submit themselves to their Creator in all things, as they would not so yield themselves to the God of love that he might work in each one to love his neighbor as himself, they must, for the preservation of the race, be compelled to submit themselves one to another in civil things, that is, in their relations one with another. "But from the beginning it was not so." And in giving allegiance to human government instead of yielding to the Lord, in putting human statutes above, or upon an equality with, the divine law, men just as truly reject God to-day as did the children of Israel when they demanded a king that they might be like all the nations.
