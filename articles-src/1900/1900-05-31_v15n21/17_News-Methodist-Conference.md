The Methodist Conference which has been sitting in Chicago the present month, has put itself on record against sectarian appropriations for Indian schools. The resolution passed on the subject, after citing that "A desperate effort by the Roman Catholic authorities is now being made to force open again the national treasury to secure funds for sectarian and politico-eclesiastical propagation," declares:—

"This General Conference, representing the largest single organized Protestant constituency in the republic, protests against the reopening of the sectarian question. This General Conference also demands that civil and religious liberty shall be guaranteed to the people wherever the flag of the republic floats over our most distant new insular possessions.

"It is directed that a record of this action be promptly forwarded to the President of the United States, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Secretary of the Interior."

The Conference is to be commended for this plainspoken word in behalf of religious freedom. Still the men who passed this resolution believe in Sunday-observance laws, which impose a money tax indirectly by appropriating an individual's time one day in every seven, forbidding him to engage in money-making occupations on that day. In principle, where is the difference between this and imposing taxes for the benefit of any other church institution than Sunday?
