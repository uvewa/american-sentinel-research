We are told in reports from Manila that three causes are operating to prevent the restoration of peace. Filipino agitators and the friars constitute two of these causes, and the third is "suppressed by the censor." The American people are supposed to be supreme in American affairs, but we hardly think they have hired a censor to keep themselves in ignorance concerning affairs relating to their business in any portion of their possessions.
