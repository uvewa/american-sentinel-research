The necessity for such a publication in this country as The Sentinel of Liberty, is made evident not alone by acts of religious intolerance to which our attention is drawn from time to time, but by a work of education that is being pushed all the time by the advocates of religious legislation. This feature of the opposition to religious freedom in this land is less startling than the prosecution of Christians for conscience' sake under the "Sabbath" laws of the states, but far more dangerous in its results. Religious persecution naturally shocks public sentiment in at least many parts of the country where the facts come to be made known; but the educational work of the religio-political reform parties who are seeking to Christianize the Government, is for the express purpose of preparing public sentiment everywhere to acquiesce in the enforcement of religious observances by law even against the conscience of the dissenter.

One point that is aimed at in this educational campaign is the inculcation of the doctrine that the state has the right to define and enforce morality upon its citizens. We cite as an illustration the following from "Lord's Day Papers," a publication of the Wisconsin Sunday Rest Day association. The doctrine, as will be observed, is put forth to serve the cause of Sunday enforcement:—

"Day. What right has the law to say how I shall spend Sunday more than any other day, and what good will result from Sunday law?"

"Ellis. It is the business of the law to protect our rights. We have each, for example, a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

"Day. That is the very thing I believe in, personal liberty.

"Ellis. But not liberty to take away another's rights. Law may always curtail any one's liberty so far as it infringes on the rights of others. My personal liberty ends when it meets your rights. If a state or country believes that every one has a right to a weekly rest day, that it is a very valuable right, and that many will be deprived of it, unless law protects them, it becomes duty to make and enforce laws for this object. The people of this country do so believe and practice.

"Day. Although I do not altogether agree with them, I must admit that right, since majorities must rule; but I cannot admit the right of law to recognize Sunday as a religious day, or to enforce it as such.

"Ellis. If the mass of the people believe it a holy day and use it for worship, they have a right to protection from disturbances. Law has no right to say how you shall spend Sunday or any other day, and does not attempt it. It does tell many things you may not do on any day, and more that you may not do on Sunday, because they conflict with the rights of others.

"Day. Do I understand you to admit that law ought never to interfere with my action, unless by it I deprive some other individual of some right?

"Ellis. I do not say quite that; for the law must work on general principles, and beyond individual rights lies the general welfare. Our republic depends for its value and stability, not on armed force, but on the integrity and morality of its citizens; and its first duty should be to protect and foster such integrity and morality. Every student of history knows that the Christian religion always produces the highest type of morality, and that Christian nations best guard the equal rights of all. Thus it becomes a patriotic duty to give such protection to the Sabbath as shall enable all classes, if they wish, to use the day for public worship, and as shall give religious teachers a fair field for work as opposed to the teachers of greed and lawlessness."

Note the statement that the "first duty" of the state is "to protect and foster integrity and morality" on the part of its citizens; and also that "the Christian religion always produces the highest type of morality." Taken together, these two statements amount to a declaration that the first duty of the state is to protect and foster the Christian religion, of which Sunday observance is held to be an essential part. This is the impression conveyed to the mind of the reader, and designed to be received by him. And when public sentiment is educated to the point of accepting it as the truth, it will sanction the enforcement of Sunday laws in every case, and under its deceptive light religious persecution will appear and be sanctioned as a matter of civil necessity, to which only "teachers of greed and lawlessness" stand opposed. To the understanding thus darkened, conscientious dissenters from this doctrine take on the appearance of criminals and enemies of the state, whose suppression by law is only a matter of regular prosecution for crime. Let public sentiment once become educated in this way, as widespread efforts are now being made to educate it, and strange scenes will be enacted in this erstwhile land of liberty and religious equality before the law.

The doctrine that the state can of right define and "foster" morality is a fundamental error in the scheme of "Christian" government which the "moral reform" parties have in view. Once give the state power to define and punish immorality, and any religious dogma may be enforced in the alleged interests of morality. It is here taught, for example, that the dogma of Sunday sacredness is essential to public morality, and with equal propriety the disregard of any other religious custom or practice might be prohibited as immoral. It might be decreed that the disregard of Thanksgiving day or of Christmas or Easter tends to immorality, and their observance enforced accordingly. No separating line exists or can be drawn between morality and religion; and when the state gets upon the domain of morality it will unavoidably trespass upon the field of religion, and religious legislation, with prosecution of dissenters—the old historical story of religious persecution—will be the result.

Therefore, the people need to be educated to a clearer understanding of the doctrine laid down at the founding of this Republic, that governments are instituted among men to preserve rights, and not to enforce human conceptions of morality—not to stand between the citizen and the one infallible Teacher of moral truth, to whom each individual of and for himself must give account. The question for the state is not, What is moral? but What is an invasion of natural rights? Let the state deal with the rights of its citizens in its appointed way, and God in his way can be safely trusted to deal with immorality.

The doctrine that one man must surrender his right to work on Sunday because of another man's right to rest on that day, is an absurdity upon its face. Rights are equal, and one cannot overbalance another. The state is as much bound to protect the right to labor as to protect the right to rest. Every person has the right to stop work on Sunday, and each one has also the equal right to work on that day or engage in any lawful recreation; and this right can be questioned only on religious grounds, with which the state has no concern. The right of labor is a sacred right, and its prohibition by the state in deference to a religious day of the week can never be sanctioned by any principle of free government, or of right and justice.
