It is said that the only feeling in the town from which hails the central figure in the Cuban postal frauds is one of indignation against the man who betrayed him. "He was under obligations" to the chief conspirator "for his appointment," and this it is thought by some ought to have forever sealed his lips! It seems never to have entered into the thought of those who take this view of the matter that the man whom they say was "betrayed" was under obligation for his appointment, and under solemn obligation and oath to discharge honestly the trust committed to him.
