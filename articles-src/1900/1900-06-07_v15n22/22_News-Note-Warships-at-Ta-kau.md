At the time of the closing of the columns of this paper twenty-three warships were at Ta-kau—nine Russian, three British, three German, three French, two American, two Japanese, and one Italian. In addition to their crews, the Russians had on board their warships 11,000 troops from Port Arthur, with field equipment. Fourteen thousand Russian troops are held in readiness at Port Arthur. Three hundred "international" bluejackets were already at Peking.
