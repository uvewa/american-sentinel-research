A recent Vienna despatch states that the Archbishop of Bucasert, at a recent audience with the Pope, received an autograph letter from the Pontiff for King Charles of Roumania. This letter virtually marks a complete reconciliation between the King and the Vatican, after years of strained relations. The Crown Prince's first son was baptized according to Orthodox rites, and the Pope, angered at the act, has pardoned slowly.
