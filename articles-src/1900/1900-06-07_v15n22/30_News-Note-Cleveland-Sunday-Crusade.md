A report from Cleveland, Ohio, states that on May 13th sermons were preached in fifty churches in that city "on the observance of Sunday. The general discussion of the question is preliminary to the active crusade which the city ministers' union is to institute against violators of the Sunday law. A permanent committee to conduct the crusade will be appointed and will probably consist of two prominent ministers, one or two labor leaders, and three or four prominent business men, and a leading lawyer. The general plan of the crusade will be to cause the prosecution of those performing and requiring unnecessary labor on Sunday."

The lawyer is quite an essential feature in every Sunday crusade. What an oversight it was on the Lord's part, to be sure, when in giving the gospel commission, he omitted all mention of the employment of lawyers to enforce his religion on unwilling people! How easy it would have been for Him to have said: "Only limited power is given unto Me in heaven and on earth. Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; compelling not only those who believe but those who do not believe to observe the first day of the week; and for this purpose employing lawyers to prosecute in the civil courts those who refuse to observe this day; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."

But Jesus did not say this. The statement upon which the gospel commission is based forbade it. The "therefore" refers to the declaration: "All power is given unto me." And this is the power with which the gospel minister should be clothed. It is the only power to which he has any right to appeal. It is the power of the Spirit of God, not the power of the civil magistrate.
