## Germany in South America.

Much weight has been attached to Secretary Root's words at the celebration of the birthday of Grant, and the comments on it have not been confined to this country. Speaking of Grant's support of the Monroe doctrine, he pointedly referred to the eagerness of European nations to secure more territory, and the probable consequence that the United States must prepare to make a determined stand for that doctrine or else abandon it.

The application of the remark might be quite general, but there are good reasons for the common disposition to refer it to Germany, especially in connection with the movement to enlarge the German navy. With a population of two-thirds that of the United States and a country smaller than Texas, there is abundant cause, quite aside from any colonial ambitions, why Germany should be seeking opportunities for expansion. It has been plain for some time that she was encouraging her migrating people to settle in South America rather than make their new homes altogether in North America. Brazil especially has been the land that they have been seeking. Naturally, as strangers in a strange land, they have been drawn closely together. Large German communities have been formed especially in one state, and great regions in Brazil have passed into the hands of Germans that still remain at home.

Brazil has not viewed the situation with entire satisfaction. She has fancied that there were traces of a definite policy in the immigration. It has been hinted that the plan of "spheres of influence," which has been applied so largely in Africa and somewhat in China, might be extended to another continent as well, and that on some plausible pretext occasion might be taken to declare a German protectorate over the German colonies of Brazil. Such a step would be but the prelude to action that would end in making a large section of South America a German possession.

Whatever may be said for German government as contrasted with the rather unstable equilibrium of the Latin races, Brazilians still have a prejudice in favor of governing themselves. It is suggested that Secretary Root's utterance was not impossibly prompted by a South American appeal for some such declaration. At all events, it is plain that the United States would have a very decided interest in any movement that would result in putting any European nation in a controlling position in South America.—Christian Endeavor World.
