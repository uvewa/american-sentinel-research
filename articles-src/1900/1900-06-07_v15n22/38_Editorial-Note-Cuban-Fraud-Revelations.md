The country has been startled by the revelation of great frauds practiced under the United States administration of affairs in Cuba, and the latest information is that only a tithe of the whole story of dishonesty in this matter has yet come to the light of publicity. But why should the people be startled? Why be surprised over the occurrence of that which is as natural as the law of gravitation? It only shows that the people have not taken pains to view present occurrences in the light of the past. Let them read ancient Roman history and the history of every nation which has governed provinces as the United States is now governing the late Spanish possessions, and they will find only one continued story of governmental corruption in the administration of provincial affairs. The evil is inherent in the system itself, and no indignation the government may now show over the Cuban revelations will long arrest its working. In process of time the people will become used to the story, and such practices will come to be accepted as a matter of course. And this is not our verdict in the matter at all, but that of history.
