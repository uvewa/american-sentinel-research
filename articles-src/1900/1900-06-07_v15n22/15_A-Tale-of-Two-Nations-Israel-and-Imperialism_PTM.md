## A Tale of Two Nations.—Israel and Imperialism.

God had set the people of Israel in the world for a double purpose. They were to give to all mankind the true principles of the Christian religion. They were also to give to all nations the correct principles of civil government. According to the plan of the Lord, Israel was to be a power among the nations; but she was not to be a nation among the powers. The principle of government by the consent of the governed was instilled into her national economy by God Himself. The King of Heaven caused this precious principle to distill itself into the hearts of the children of Israel as the dew of the morning is distilled from above on leaf and flower. As long as Israel held to the principle of government by the consent of the governed and obeyed the mandate of God expressed in the words of Balaam, "From the tops of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him; lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations"—as long as Israel obeyed this mandate, she would be great among the powers and blessed by them. With one voice they would proclaim "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding nation, for what nation is there so great?"

## ISRAEL A COMMONWEALTH.

From all this it is clear that Israel was a *commonwealth*, and was so recognized in the Bible itself. The true principles of the Christian religion and of civil government were designed of God to be her crown of glory, in things spiritual and in things temporal. God was Israel's Sovereign by her own consent, as well as the Guardian of her every way.

The government of Israel was administered in the name and by the authority of God. The work of Moses, of the seventy elders, of the rulers and judges, was simply to enforce the laws that God had given; they had no authority to legislate for the nation. This was, and for a time continued to be, the condition of Israel's *existence as a nation*. From age to age men inspired of God were sent to instruct the people, and to direct in the enforcement of the laws.

The civil government of Israel was very simple. It was simple in the outward form as well as in the inward spirit. There was none of the pomp and glory which naturally accompanies royalty. There were no titles and no thrones. The mind cannot conceive of a more simple administration of civil affairs than that which God Himself planned for His chosen people.

For a number of years Israel, to a greater or less extent, followed the plans and wishes of God in the matter of their civil government; but little by little a new wave of feeling, unknown to the older generations, began to vibrate the heart chords of Jehovah's chosen host. Increase of population and intercourse with the other nations began to work changes of thought, sentiment and principle.

## CUSTOMS OF THE HEATHEN.

These introduced themselves insidiously; little by little, they stole the hearts of the children of Israel. The people began to adopt the customs of the heathen round about. Thus they sacrificed, to a great extent, their own peculiar, holy character, "gradually they lost their reverence for God and ceased to prize the honor of being His chosen people. Attracted by the pomp and display of heathen monarchies, they tired of their own simplicity. Jealousy and envy sprang up between the tribes. Internal dissensions made them weak; they were continually exposed to the invasion of their heathen foes and the people were beginning to believe that in order to maintain their standing among the nations, the tribes must be united in a strong central government. As they departed from obedience to God's law, they desired to be free from the rule of their Divine Sovereign, and thus the demand for a monarchy became widespread throughout Israel."

We have now reached one of the saddest days and chapters in the history of God's people. From being a government by the consent of the governed—a commonwealth—Israel became a monarchy; and the story of the inauguration of this new state of affairs is of the most supreme interest to every soul who loves and values civil freedom.

It was during the days of Samuel's administration. He was divinely invested with the three-fold office of judge, prophet and priest. Under his administration the people had prospered in temporal things and godliness had been promoted. With the full consent of the nation, Samuel appointed his sons to office as his assistants. These young men "turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment." This was a bad thing for both them and Israel; but Samuel had adhered to the true principles in appointing them to office, that is, he had obtained "the full assent of the nation."

## LIKE ALL THE NATIONS.

Thus came that gathering long to be remembered in the annals of Israelitish story. "All the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, 'Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.'" (I. Sam., 8th chap.)

Here was a plea on the part of the people for a monarchy. They wanted a king to judge them "like all the nations." In other words, they wanted to be like all the nations.

But all the other nations on earth at that time, save Israel alone, were heathen nations. Their inspiration came from Satan, and their principles were born of evil and not of good. Every one of these were monarchies. Their kings obtained the thrones, whether by fair means or foul, they little recked. The people were not asked whether they liked the form of government or not. It was for them to obey the king and ask no questions.

The common idea of things was that the majority of mankind were born saddled and bridled for the minority, born booted and spurred to ride them. So when the elders of Israel gathered together to ask Samuel to make them a king to judge them like the nations round about them, they asked that the principles of Satan in government might be installed in place of the principles of God. This was the beginning of a long dark night, the gloomy clouds of which even the advent of Christ, the Day-Star, could not entirely dispel, and which even to this present time has not come to the morning.

"The cases of abuse among the people had not been referred to Samuel. Had the evil course of his sons been known to him, he would have removed them without delay; but this was not what the petitioners desired. Samuel saw that their real motive was discontent and pride, and that their demand was the result of a deliberate and determined purpose."

Samuel plead with God. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them." In the request which the people of Israel made to God, through Samuel, they rejected the government of God and the principles of that government, but these principles involved that one eternal and almighty principle, "the consent of the governed." This principle also invoked the idea that Israel should dwell alone and should not be reckoned among the nations.

"The days of Israel's greatest prosperity had been those in which they acknowledged Jehovah as their king, and when the laws and the government which He had established were regarded as superior to those of all the other nations. Moses had declared to Israel concerning the government of God, 'this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and shall say, surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people,' but by departing from God's law the Hebrews had failed to become the people that God desired to make them, and then all the evils which were the result of their own sin and folly they charged upon the government of God. So completely had they become blinded by sin.

"The Lord had, through his prophets, foretold that Israel would be governed by a king; but it does not follow that this form of government was best for them or according to His will. He permitted the people to follow their own choice because they refused to be guided by His counsel. Hosea declares that 'God gave them a king in His anger' (Hosea 13:11)."

## A MIRACLE OF UNSELFISHNESS.

Israel had petitioned for a king. God knew that a monarchy would not be the best form of government for them; nevertheless, He said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee." In these words the Lord admonished the prophet to do for the people a thing which He knew would not be best. Was divine wisdom blinded? Had the power of omniscience deserted the Omniscient One? Nay, verily. But the God of Heavens was simply standing by the principles which are the basis of eternal government now and forevermore. The people wanted a king. They wanted to set aside that simple form of government by the consent of the governed with which God had provided them, and in its place they wanted a hereditary monarchy. To this new form of government their minds consented, and God was willing that the principle of government by the consent of the governed should work, even if it expelled Him from being king over His own people. O, miracle of unselfishness! Wonder of the ingenuousness of the soul of the Most High! God is love. In love volition is everything and arbitrary force is nothing. And God would not o'erstep the bounds which He set, even to keep Himself enthroned in the hearts of His people. He would not force Himself upon a nation which preferred another king—another kind of government.

Samuel faithfully set before the people the burdens that would be laid upon them under the new regime. He contrasted this with their present perfectly free and prosperous condition, "their king would imitate the pomp and luxury of other nations, to support which grievous exactions upon their persons and property would be necessary."

"Ye shall be his servants," were the closing words of the prophet, "and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you, and the Lord will not hear you in that day." However burdensome its exactions should be found when once the monarchy was established, they could not set it aside at pleasure.

## "WE SHALL HAVE A KING."

But to all the pleading of the prophet, only one answer rolled back from the people, "Nay, but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles."

"Like all the nations." Could Israel only have heard the sobs and seen the tears and known the anguish wrung from the breasts of many a thousand subject among "the nations!" Could Israel only have heard the piteous wail of the little children lacking bread—could they have seen the look of pinching want of mothers among "the nations" whose husbands had been taken for the service of the king—in a word, could they only have realized the differences between the sweets of liberty and of the many bitter things of monarchy, their petition would never have been heard. Their voices would have been hushed in solemn silence, as inwardly they blessed God for their happy lot.

Jehovah Himself had ordained that they should not be like the nations. This they should have considered a privilege and sacred holy distinction; but they deserted the cold snow waters of Lebanon for the murky streams of the valley. They left that which was high and holy for that which was earthly, sensual, devilish. Long years afterwards in the straitness and the siege, when the Roman armies surrounded Zion, the beauty of the whole earth, the harvest of this sad day was reaped to the full. The dregs of the cup which they now, for the first time, put to their lips, they drank to the double.

But on this memorable morning their eyes were blinded; they could see only the glitter and tinsel of royalty, the splendor of monarchical regalia. A mist obscured their vision. Their brains were swimming in the intoxication of pride. They knew not the hour of their visitation. God let them have their way that that sacred principle of government by the consent of the governed might not be marred even by its own Maker. And from this unfortunate hour began the Empire of Israel.
