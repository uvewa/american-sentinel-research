A former vice-consul at Hong Kong, Edward Wildman, has an article in a recent number of "Leslie's Weekly" entitled, "A Reign of Terror in the Philippines," in which he gives some startling facts quite at variance with the official reports published from time to time regarding the condition of affairs in the islands.

Mr. Wildman says that "there exists a veritable reign of terror in most parts of the archipelago within a gunshot from our army posts. Either Gen. Otis is blind to the situation, or is keeping the real facts from the American people. Aguinaldo's forces have scattered into marauding bands and, leaguing themselves with the mountain tribes, terrorize the country, effectually check the cultivation of crops and the sale of marketable products, and wage war against all who hesitate to acknowledge the Aguinaldo government."

He is also of the opinion that the present military force in the Philippine Islands is entirely inadequate to cope with the situation and bring the war to a close. The American people may find that imperialism, like some other attractive looking things, comes high, and is scarcely worth the price after it is obtained.
