Recent advices are to the effect that the Czar has obtained from the Persian Government well-defined concessions of great political and commercial importance. Among these concessions is a grant of the right to construct a railroad from Erwan, in Caucasia, to Tabriz, and also for the opening to Russian trade of the entire district of Khorassan. Engineers have already begun surveying this railway, which leads to the center of the Azerbijan district, and which really is the beginning of the road which will eventually extend through all Persia to Bararbbas, and give Russia an exit to the sea through the Persian Gulf.
