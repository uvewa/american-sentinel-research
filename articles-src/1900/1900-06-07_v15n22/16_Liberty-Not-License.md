## Liberty Not License.

Liberty is not license. The idea is frequently expressed that people must be deprived of a certain amount of their liberty, as a safeguard against the evils of license and anarchy. The expression is an unfortunate one, because while it is meant to state what is true, it tends to obscure the distinction between liberty and lawlessness, and to accustom people to the idea that real liberty can rightfully be taken away from individuals for the public good,—an idea which divests liberty of its essential sacredness and breaks down every safeguard about it.

Liberty and license are opposites, always contending against each other. License always interferes with somebody's liberty; that is the very reason it is frowned upon by the laws of civilization. All people should have liberty, and therefore none should have license. It is not liberty that should be taken from the people, but the opportunity to do that which interferes with liberty in others, and this interference with liberty is the only reason there can be for its prohibition. Real liberty is not against itself, and to prohibit liberty in the name of liberty is an act contradicting itself.

Liberty is a natural right. It is a self-evident truth that "all men are created equal," and "are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Being thus a natural and God-given right, it manifestly does not need to be prohibited to secure God-given rights. The rights bestowed by the Creator are not in conflict with each other.

Liberty is a law, and is therefore not against law, but against lawlessness. The highest law—that of the Ruler of the universe, is denominated by Him the "law of liberty." What higher testimony than this could be given touching the sacredness of liberty, and its perfect harmony with all just law and right government?

The preservation of personal liberty, not as a mere privilege existing by right of sufferance, and subject to the dictates of expediency, but as an inalienable right, granted not by government but by God, and of which no innocent person can ever justly be deprived, is essential to the preservation of this Republic.
