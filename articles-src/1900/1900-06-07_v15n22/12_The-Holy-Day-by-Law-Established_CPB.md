## The Holy Day by Law Established.

The advocates of legal Sunday enforcement are manifesting more than ordinary activity at the present time in Wisconsin. One of the themes discussed by the secretary of the Sunday Rest Day Association of the State is, "Can We Afford to Change Our Holy Day for a Holiday?" Of course nobody who has a holy day can afford to change it for a holiday; nor is there any reason why he should. Whoever pleases to observe either Sunday or another day as a holy day has a perfect right to do so; and no earthly power has any right to require him either to think of it or to treat it as a holiday. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day unto the Lord he doth not regard it." Therefore to the individual to whom any day is holy it is holy, and nobody but himself can make it otherwise. It is just as true that to the individual to whom any day is a holiday, to him it is such and no earthly power can make it any thing else to him.

Probably, however, the question refers not to individual belief and practice, but to the legal recognition of Sunday by the State. In other words, the real question is, Shall the State change its "holy day" for a holiday? But what right has the State to have a holy day? And if the State has a holy day what right has the State to require the individual to observe that holy day if he does not wish to? The rights of the State are simply the rights of the individuals. The State has no rights apart from the individuals. The State exists simply and solely to secure the free exercise of individual rights. It is for this purpose that "governments are instituted among men," as declares the Declaration of Independence.

But the point we wished specially to note is that according to the logic of the situation and of the demand made by the Sunday Rest Day Association, the State of Wisconsin not only has a "holy day" but that "holy day" is dependent upon a statute made by the legislature, not only for its existence as a holy day in the first place, but for its continuance as such. If the plea of the secretary means anything it means that let the civil law either be repealed or become a dead letter and the so-called holy day becomes merely a holiday.
