## Great Britain's Danger.

"There is a greater danger for England than the danger of defeat in this war," remarks the Chicago Journal. "There is the danger that has grown steadily since Gen. Kitchener's defeat of the mahdi's wild men, that England will exalt military prowess above all the other good qualities of her people. This is the curse of France to-day, and we cannot help thinking, as we read of drunken crowds surging through the streets of London, of a lord mayor sending hysterical telegrams and of sober statesmen and clergymen betraying unsuspected hysteria, that England herself may be in a frame of mind that will soon send her well along the road her neighbor is traveling to ruin. The calmness and self-restraint that is supposed to characterize English public life has been missing for a long time, and, to the amazement of the world, there have been discovered qualities that we had assumed to be the exclusive possession of the Latin races. No mob in Paris or Rome could have exceeded the fury of the London mob, and neither in Paris nor in Rome could the men of 'light and leading' have shown less inclination to chill the ardor of the throng than Englishmen of authority have shown."

Nor is this danger confined to England, nor yet indeed to any one nation; it is world-wide. "The nations are angry." The war spirit is everywhere. It would require only a very little thing to set the world ablaze.
