## White Ribboners in Oshkosh.

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Wisconsin held its twenty-seventh annual convention at Oshkosh, May 22 to 24, in the Algoma Street M. E. Church. The convention was called to order by the president, Mrs. Mary C. Upham, wife of ex-Governor W. P. Upham. The number of delegates was one hundred and twenty-six. The church was beautifully decorated with flags and banners; five national colors were artistically arranged. A large picture of the late Frances E. Willard was in the front of the auditorium. Above the chancel were the letters in white, "W. C. T. U.," which were very large, and over them was neatly arranged in blue the word "Welcome." Several large white ribbon bows were neatly arranged.

## THE DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES.

were conducted by Mrs. L. A. Hodge of Waunakee. The morning session consisted mainly of the seating of the delegates in the order of the counties represented, the roll call and the reading of a few reports.

The first report read was that of the corresponding secretary, Mrs. W. A. Lawson of Baraboo. The report did not deal with statistics, but mainly with the

## BRIGHT PROSPECTS IN MEMBERSHIP

and interest, and also contained several valuable recommendations to the different unions in the state organization. Mrs. Lawson called attention to the fact that the state W. C. T. U. had grown by the addition of between 700 and 800 new members during the past year, and also that thirteen new local unions had come into the organization during the same time. She recommended that every union in the state be visited by some worker in the W. C. T. U. outside the state at least once a year to encourage and instruct. Mrs. Lawson further recommended that funds be secured for the use of the unions in bringing these outside speakers into the state. She mentioned that many of the unions in the state are doing work of reform and improvement that is not outlined or prescribed in the plans of the organization. One of the most important of these, she mentioned, was

## THE CURFEW.

The unions of the W. C. T. U. have pushed the enactment and enforcement of the curfew law in many parts of the state with success. Much charitable work has been done by the unions, pastors' salaries have been readjusted, reading rooms, libraries and traveling libraries have been established; with the aid of the W. C. T. U. churches have been built and many other lines of reform and improvements have been started and aided by the state W. C. T. U.

Mrs. G. I. Follett of Spencer, secretary of the

## LECTURE BUREAU OF THE WISCONSIN W. C. T. U.

read a report of her work for the past eight months. There were four lecturers in the state, viz.: Mrs. Lenora M. Lake, vice-president of the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America; Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman, president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Missouri and recording secretary of the National W. C. T. U.; Miss Marie C. Brehm of Illinois, national superintendent of the Franchise Department and national lecturer, and Miss Della C. H. Cox, organizer and lecturer for the Wisconsin W. C. T. U. Mrs. Follett mentioned that 326 lecture meetings had been held in the state in the past eight months; 731 new members had been secured; eighteen county conventions had been held and nineteen county institutes had been conducted.

## THE REPORT OF THE STATE TREASURER,

Mrs. Ida M. Cooke of Green Bay, was replete with interesting figures. Her report for the year ending May 1, 1900, showed general receipts, $2,794.05, with lecture receipts $709.54; grand total, $3,503.59. The total balance on hand was $285.03. Total number of unions, 174; total paid membership, 3,388, a gain of ninety-eight; twenty-three of the sixty-three counties show a gain in membership; two counties lead with large gains—Grant county has added 87 members and Green county 101; thirteen new unions were organized during the year.

By a vote of the convention a telegram of greeting was sent to the convention of railroad engineers then in session in Milwaukee.

When Mrs. Upham rose to read her annual address she was greeted with applause, at which she said good naturedly: "I know if you applaud now you won't when I have finished." Her report showed the

WONDERFUL GROWTH OF THE ORGANIZATION

during the last twenty-five years and that it was now one of the largest in the country and its work is known and felt everywhere. She advocated that the children be brought up in a proper manner and taught to lead pure Christian lives, abstaining from liquor and tobacco and other bad habits. She stated that the supreme courts of several states had declared against the sale of cigarettes, and she also urged that anti-cigarette literature be circulated among the schools.

Mrs. I. W. Black of Racine, who is a branch secretary, made her report. This report showed that there have been added eight new unions of

THE LOYAL TEMPERANCE LEGION.

She divided the L. T. L. societies into three classes, the senior, junior and intermediate. Of the first, there are seventeen societies in the state; the second, thirty-four, and the third, nineteen. The enrolled members are 2,537, and the pledged members are in number 1,045. During the past year 575 diplomas have been issued.

Mrs. Maria F. Hanchett of Madison made her report of the "Motor," which is the official organ of the W. C. T. U. of this state.

ANOTHER MILE-STONE.

The report of Mrs. L. A. Hodge of Waunakee, superintendent of evangelistic work, reported in part as follows: "Dear Sisters: Time has fled all too swiftly and we reach another mile-stone on our journey. Though we feel that the time has been redeemed, still we look forward to much more to be accomplished. Only two of our state evangelists have been in the field this year, Mrs. K. S. Lewis and Mrs. A. W. De Long."

Mrs. K. V. Stevens, Lake Geneva, superintendent of

SABBATH OBSERVANCE,

made the following report: "Again the superintendent of this department for lack of material with which to build must present a meager report. Only ten local unions have sent any report. Five new local superintendents have been appointed during the year. Mrs. Masse, superintendent of what was formerly the tenth district, has done good work in circulating literature. Mrs. M. E. Smith, superintendent for Portage county, reports 1,800 pages of literature distributed and a number of sermons delivered by pastors. No other county superintendents have reported. Owing to the lateness of the date for the annual prayer week we will be obliged to defer gathering reports from meetings held then, until we make up our report for the national convention. The following is a summary of what has been reported: Local superintendents, nineteen; literature distributed, 2,500 pages; sermons preached, ten; responsive exercises used in Sunday schools, 300. We trust that a much deeper interest has been taken in this department, and more work done by the unions than has been reported."

Mrs. Cornelia M. Foster, Sparta, superintendent of Sunday school work, reported in part as follows: "Sunday schools already organized have given us a field prepared for our seeding with temperance work, and this department has been very readily adopted in a very large number of unions, because it can be so easily done. Over four thousand pledge cards have been signed. Local superintendents have been very active and have made much of the temperance lessons each quarter; have held concerts with 'Temperance' as the keynote, secured temperance books for their libraries and distributed temperance leaflets and papers."

OTHER REPORTS.

Space will not allow me to give even a brief report from the other superintendents, but will name their departments and give name and address.

Mothers' Meetings and Child Culture Circles, Dr. A. J. Shaw, Eau Claire; Prison, Jail and Almshouse, Mrs. Anna Russell, Milwaukee; Work Among Soldiers and Sailors, Mrs. Frances Nau, Green Bay; Work Among Lumbermen and Miners, Mrs. E. W. Shores, Ashland; Scientific Temperance Instruction and Anti-Narcotics, Mrs. J. E. Kinmore, Baraboo; Medal Contests, Mrs. Lizzie Axon, Lodi; Temperance Literature, Mrs. E. E. Prath, Evansville; Influencing the Press, Mrs. Clara B. Fleth, Merrill; Work Among Foreign Speaking People, Mrs. O. A. Breakey, La Crosse; Non-Alcoholic Medication, Dr. R. Bird, Beaver Dam; Schools of Method, Mrs. M. C. Upham, Marshfield; Parlor Meetings, Mrs. L. H. Uren, Hurley; Flower Mission, Miss Edith Nugent, Ashland; Fair Work, Mrs. W. E. Thompson, Milwaukee; Franchise, Mrs. Maude Sanders, Milwaukee; Christian Citizenship, Mrs. M. A. B. Smith, Madison.

I regret that I cannot speak of these reports now, but I may be allowed to at some future time. I also regret that I cannot give even a very brief synopsis of the several able addresses and especially is this so of the lectures given by Mrs. Mable Conklin, New York, national lecturer, and Miss Marie C. Brehm, Chicago, Ill., superintendent franchise department, National W. C. T. U.

At proper times there were devotional exercises, which were very helpful, this is especially true of the consecration services. They helped very much in maintaining sweet Christian influence during the three very busy days of the convention.

## OFFICERS ELECTED.

The election of officers was done in a quiet manner and were as follows: President, Mrs. Mary C. Upham, Marshfield; vice-president, Mrs. G. I. Follett, Spencer; corresponding secretary, Mrs. W. A. Lawson, Baraboo; recording secretary, Mrs. Augusta E. C. Strong, Baraboo; treasurer, Mrs. Ida M. Cooke, Green Bay; editor of the Motor (official organ), Mrs. Maria F. Hanchett.

The following named persons were chosen as delegates and alternates to

## THE NATIONAL CONVENTION

to be held in Washington, D. C., in November; Delegate, Mrs. G. I. Follett of Spencer; alternate, Mrs. Bessie N. Prothero of Ashland; delegate, Dr. A. J. Shaw of Eau Claire; alternate, Mrs. J. B. Hoagland of Menominee; delegate, Mrs. Jennie E. Kinmore of Baraboo; alternate, Mrs. Martha E. D. Hurlburt of Fond du Lac; delegate, Miss Clara Peters of Monroe; alternate, Mrs. Mecca Varney, Monroe; delegate, Mrs. L. A. Hodge of Waunakee; alternate, Mrs. M. A. B. Smith of Madison; delegate, Miss Pamella A. Hand of Elkhorn; alternate, Mrs. Isaac Ellsworth of Milwaukee; delegate, Mrs. Hannah Patchen of New London; alternate, Mrs. Alma Robb of Green Bay. Aside from these the officers of the W. C. T. U. of this state will represent the union at the national convention.

## WISER COUNSELS PREVAIL.

During the Thursday forenoon session Mr. J. B. Davidson of Milwaukee, secretary of the Sunday Rest Day Association, was presented to the convention by the chair, Mrs. Mary C. Upham. While speaking he asked the delegates to make a motion that the chair write a letter to President McKinley condemning his action in recently giving a Sunday dinner party. Mr. Davidson urged it in the strongest language he could command both in feeling and voice quality. He was very sorry indeed that President McKinley, who had been such a good Sabbath-keeper before should thus break the Sabbath. At the close of his remarks the chair sweetly and smilingly replied: "I hope, ladies, that you will not make any such motion," but added, "If I see him I can speak to him with better effect than to write to him." Here the matter was dropped, for no motion was made. In the afternoon session the subject came before the convention in the form of a resolution thus: "And hereby express our regret that the chief magistrate of our nation and his wife have lowered the hitherto high standard of Sabbath observance at the White House by giving a social reception and Sunday dinner." A motion was made to strike it out, which was carried. Only about fifteen delegates voted against the motion, while more than three times as many delegates voted for it. This action of the convention was right and worthy of commendation by all God-fearing and liberty-loving people. And may all of their actions in the future be as righteous as this act is my prayer.
