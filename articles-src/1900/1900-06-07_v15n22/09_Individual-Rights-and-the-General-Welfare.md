## Individual Rights and the General Welfare.

The general welfare can never be promoted by the sacrifice of individual rights. This is contrary to a widely prevalent idea, but it is the truth. It is impossible to separate the general welfare from the individual welfare, or individual welfare from individual rights. It is impossible to reach "the masses" without touching individuals. The individual is not touched through the masses, but the masses through individuals. Whatever works against the individual cannot fail to work against the masses.

This is not saying that the circumstances of all individuals must be the same, or denying the necessity of certain restrictions upon individuals for the public good. It is only denying the idea that the public welfare may be something quite apart and essentially different from individual welfare, so that individual rights might in some cases be utterly set aside under the plea of public necessity. The danger is that people may be "educated" to the point of accepting this idea, and thus the barrier of public sentiment be removed from the pathway of misguided zealots who would stop at nothing in their efforts to bring about certain moral reforms through which they imagine themselves divinely commissioned to save the nation.

Rome was greatest when the individual Roman was most exalted by the privileges of Roman citizenship. England's greatness dated from her Magna Charta, which declared for the individual rights and liberties of the barons, and marked the dawning of the day of individual liberty for all the people. The United States rose to greatness by giving to the world the Declaration of Independence, championing the cause of the individual against the government, which under the plea of the "general welfare" or any other plea would deprive him of his inalienable rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." The love of liberty has ever been the chief factor in promoting national greatness, and the love of liberty is always the love of individual liberty. On the other hand, the denial of individual liberty under despotic governments has always been defended by the plea that it was necessary to promote the welfare of the nation. This is the way of the Russian government to-day and of other despotic powers that might be named. In Spain, individual rights have been so long subordinated to the "general welfare" that the nation is far advanced on the road to extinction and its evident decay is a subject of general comment. In every despotic government, the people must sooner or later assert their individual rights through a revolution, or the individual spirit which animates men to perform heroic deeds in the name of liberty must die out under the crushing heel of the oppressor, and decay seize upon the system from which the life spirit has departed.

The protection of individual rights is for the individual welfare, and this conservation of the individual welfare directly promotes the general welfare. The two can never be in antagonism to each other. But once the line is drawn between the rights of one individual and the general welfare, the way is open for debarring the rights of other individuals, and there is no logical stopping place short of the worst systems of despotism which the world has known.

The "general welfare" is always the sum total of individual welfare, and the body politic may be affected throughout by the injury done to a single member of it. Deny the rights of one member and a blow is struck at the rights of all. Promote the welfare of one, and the good that is realized flows out in blessing upon others. Leave every individual free to enjoy his God-given rights and thus to promote his own welfare, and the highest state of the general welfare must be the natural result.
