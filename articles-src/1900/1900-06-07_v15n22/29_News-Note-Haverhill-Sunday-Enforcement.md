Haverhill, Mass., seems to be experiencing a regular spasm of Sunday virtue, purely civil of course, for the law is "civil," but nevertheless operated in the interests of a religious institution. The Gazette of that city in its issue of May 14 says:

"Marshal McLaughlin made a tour of visitation among a number of the fruit dealers in the city yesterday afternoon and found that they were doing business contrary to the statutes. He took samples of fruit and summoned the dealers to appear in the district court this morning. The following are the leaders who received the summonses: N. Martin, Arid Moosh, N. H. Choalain, John Murred, Harry O. Jacobs and Tarrijian.

"Game Warden Girard caught a local man, George W. Kimball, and a small boy fishing for eels yesterday afternoon at Ward Hill. Upon being detected thus in breaking the Sabbath the man surrendered the fishing tackle and promised to appear in court next morning to answer to the game warden's charges."

Certain of the New England states used to employ "tithing men" to see that the people went to church on Sunday and to keep them awake after they got them there. They don't do that now, but try to accomplish the same end by a little different method.
