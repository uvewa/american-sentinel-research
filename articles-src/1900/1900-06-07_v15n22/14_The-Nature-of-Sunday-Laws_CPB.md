## The Nature of Sunday Laws.

There is one very important difference between Sunday laws, and laws creating and setting apart holidays. It is this: Sunday laws are mandatory, while laws touching holidays are simply permissive. Sunday laws say that you shall neither work nor play; while laws setting apart holidays leave the individual free to work, to play, or to be idle according to his own tastes and convenience.

Familiar examples illustrating this difference between statutes touching holy days and holidays are furnished by the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. Business is very generally suspended upon these days, but people are not compelled to observe them as they are Sunday. The law simply makes such days *dies non*, or *dies nefasti*, that is, days upon which legal business cannot be transacted—courts do not sit, and notes, bills, etc., falling due on one of these days, are due and payable on the succeeding day. But nobody is required to observe such days by refrain in from anything he wishes to do, which might properly be done on other days. He may work, he may play, or he may buy and sell, if he can find those who are willing to engage in trade with him. But he cannot compel his neighbor to answer to a suit upon a national or state holiday; nor can he mulct a debtor in costs for failure to redeem his commercial paper on such a day. In short, in the one case the egis of law protects the *man*; and in the other, it shields the *day*. In other words, the law recognizing holidays seeks only to secure to the individual the largest measure of personal liberty; while statutes touching Sunday are designed to secure from every man tribute to a religious institution, and this for religious reasons pure and simple.
