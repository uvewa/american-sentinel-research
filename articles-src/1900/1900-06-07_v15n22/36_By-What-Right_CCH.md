## By What Right?

[By Chas. C. Holbrook, District Judge, Alamosa, Col.]

If I believe in the continuing force and authority of the fourth commandment as a part of the necessarily unchangeable law of the unchangeable God, and you believe that by some mysterious, unexplained and unknown process, the unchangeable God so far changed his mind as to change his law by substituting the first day for the seventh, and then forgot to tell us about it, what right have you to punish me for not understanding as you understand this mysterious, unexplained and unknown process of doing that which the Lord has never admitted doing?

If you have evidences upon which you are enabled to base a belief, and from which you do believe, that God changed his fourth commandment by substituting the first day for the seventh, and I am so constituted that the same evidences do not convince me, by what claim of right would you punish me because my God-given conscience cannot be satisfied by the same evidences which satisfy yours? And by what right do you assume to force me to serve God according to the dictates of your conscience instead of my own?
