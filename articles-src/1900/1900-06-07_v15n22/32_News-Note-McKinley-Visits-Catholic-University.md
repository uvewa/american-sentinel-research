June 1 President McKinley, accompanied by Secretary Long, visited the Catholic University, the professors and students greeting them with applause. Rector Conaty made a speech of welcome to the President on his first visit to the university, explaining the purposes and aims of the institution.

"The cross which surmounts our buildings," he said, "is indicative of our religious faith, and the flag which floats to the breeze beside it is indicative of our national spirit. We are Catholics, holding our authority as an institution from the pontifical constitution granted us by the holy father who founded this university, and we are Americans, obtaining our legal existence from the statutes of this district.

"Under this roof minds are taught to love the cross and reverence the flag. Catholic Americans, we are taught and we teach loyalty to God as the source of loyalty to the republic."

In response the President said: "I have been glad to note building after building rising on these grounds in the last half dozen years, and I extend to you my cordial congratulations. This nation is in advance of every other nation of the world in the matter of educational advantages and opportunities, and no nation in the world is in greater need of educated young men. They are the pillars of strength to this republic, and we need them, it seems to me, never more than at this hour."
