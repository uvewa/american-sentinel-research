Instead of showing any signs of improvement the strike situation in St. Louis grows worse. At least two persons have been instantly killed, one of them a woman with a child in her arms. She was shot while crossing the street, and was in no way concerned in the strike. Several persons have been seriously injured, some it is thought fatally.

Last Sunday the crowning outrage of the strike was perpetrated upon a poor servant girl. Knowing little and possibly caring less about the strike, this girl, tired with her toil and desiring to visit her mother in another part of the city boarded a passing car. Arriving at the proper street she left the car and was immediately set upon by a mob of men (?) who, after striking her in the face and violently pulling her hair, actually tore from her body every vestige of clothing except her shoes. She finally escaped from them naked, bruised and bleeding, finding refuge in a cellar until rescued by the police.

This strike is not for "living wages" but to compel the street car companies to recognize union labor, that is, to allow the unions to say who shall be employed and who discharged by the companies.

It should be remembered that this outrage was not perpetrated by any of the barbarians to whom the United States is trying to teach the art of "stable self-government," but in one of the leading cities of "Christian America."
