## "Has Finally Gripped Even the United States."

The Springfield (Mass.) Republican referring to the recent wild demonstrations of joy in London over the news of the relief of Mafeking, South Africa, and its plucky defenders, says:

"As the crowds were roaring through the streets of London the press dispatches to America were telling of the official correspondence coming from India relative to the famine—the situation in various districts being summed up after this style: 'Crops, practically nil; water, hardly any; cattle, all dead; people, thriftless class dead, people with small means at end of their resources and either on relief works or dying; crime, abnormal.'

"At the same time a committee of 100 in New York City was issuing an appeal for American money to send to India. It stated that 60,000,000 of the queen's subjects were suffering from famine, and that at least 10,000,000 of them were face to face with death from starvation. The deaths are reckoned by the thousands daily, and the Indian government, with all the outside help it has been able to obtain, is caring for only about 6,000,000 of the affected 60,000,000. American money to save the queen's subjects from starvation by hundreds of thousands, while England at home throws money right and left to celebrate in drunken disorder a petty triumph of arms, and sends out from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000 a month—enough to keep as many people alive in India—to strangle two little republics in South Africa in their own dust and blood!

"It is a painful picture, from whatever point of view may be chosen. But it may profitably arrest the attention of all mankind. It brings home to the humane heart of the world, with overpowering force, the utterly brutal and savage nature of the jingo aggression which has seized upon the leading nations and has finally gripped even the United States. Our own Philippine aggression of the same general nature, with its thousands of innocent victims, awful as it is in all its aspects, appears almost feeble in comparison with this parent exhibition of an ambition which leaves millions of its subjects to starve while in drunken joy it pursues a bloody triumph over the life of weaker states."

We have no wish to intermeddle with the South African imbroglio; nor do we think England worse than other nations. Human nature is essentially the same everywhere, and the madness manifested in London is world-wide. It awaits only occasion to show itself.
