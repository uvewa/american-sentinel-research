The Dreyfus affair is again making trouble for the French Government. M. Waldeck-Rousseau is openly branded as a liar and scoundrel while presiding over the chamber, and on several occasions it has been necessary to surround him with guards to protect him from personal violence while in the chair. The French seem determined to maintain their reputation as the most turbulent of all civilized peoples.
