"'The power of the penny.' There is a sermon there," says the Michigan Christian Advocate. "The penny and the Sunday candy store switches the child into the downward path." And how so? Oh, the child spends the penny for candy on his way to Sunday school instead of taking it to the school and putting it into the contribution envelope. And this if not the sum of the offending of the Sunday candy store is at least the great count in the indictment against it.

Of course it is right and entirely proper that the child should be taught to give to the cause of religion. But it is neither right nor proper that the civil law should be invoked to make this education in some measure compulsory. There are those who go to meeting on another day, namely on the last day of the week instead of the first. They teach their children to give to the cause of religion; and these children are exposed to all the temptations to spend their money to which other children are exposed. Now if it were the duty of the State to protect the children of Sunday keepers from the temptation to spend their pennies on Sunday instead of putting them into the contribution envelope, would it not be under just the same obligation to guard against temptation the children who with their parents worship on another day? It is evident that this is a matter which the state should let severely alone.
