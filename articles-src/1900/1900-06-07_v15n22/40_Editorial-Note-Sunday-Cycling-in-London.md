The St. James Chronicle (London) says "that already Sunday cycling is becoming a source of perplexity and distress to those who regard the Lord's day as a day of rest." But why "a source of perplexity and distress?" We are quite sure that there is no law in England compelling anybody to ride on Sunday who does not want to.
