These facts furnished to a London weekly by the secretary of the Church Association go to show the rapid growth of ritualism in the Established Church of England. Concerning a certain parish the secretary writes:

"It now seems that the long-suffering Protestant parishioners, instead of getting that redress which they were entitled to at the hands of the Archbishop, have had set over them another ritualistic law-breaker. On Sunday last six candles were kept burning during the whole of the service, and four more were lighted at the communion, wafer bread was used, and the consecrated elements elevated. The new churchwardens, who are decided Protestants, protested after the service against these illegal practices. The action of the Archbishop of York in this case shows more clearly than ever that the bishops are not to be trusted."

There is a strong drift in the English Church not only toward ritualism, but toward Rome. Stranger things have happened than the return of the Established Church to the Papal fold.
