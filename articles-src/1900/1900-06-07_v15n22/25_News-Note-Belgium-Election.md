A late dispatch from Brussels says the election in that city has "resulted in the return of eight Catholic deputies, five socialists, three liberals and two progressists for the chamber and five Catholic members, two liberals and two progressists for the senate. The general results of the election so far show that eighty-five Catholics, thirty-three liberals, thirty-three socialists and one Christian Democrat have been elected."

And that is the way some people would like to have election returns read in this country, only, of course, each denomination or religious federation would like to see their party in the lead.
