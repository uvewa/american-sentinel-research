The Social Forum is by no means pessimistic, indeed it is decidedly optimistic, nevertheless it sees that civilization is confronted by grave problems which demand settlement. It says:

"Our present industrial system cannot last. From every viewpoint it stands condemned. Economically it is organized wastefulness, forbidding men to supply their needs from nature's boundless store, and chaining forces that might make the desert blossom. Ethically it is monstrous, denying to man the most sacred of all rights, 'the right to live a guiltless life.' Socially it is a Minotaur, its jaws dripping with the blood of its own children. It must go.

"On all this we are agreed. But how shall it go? Peacefully, almost noiselessly, like the ice and snows of winter, subdued by the force of the vernal sun, or as moribund feudalism went out in France a hundred years ago?"

Of course the Forum inclines to the view that the change will come peacefully, but the signs all point to a repetition of the scenes of the French Revolution.
