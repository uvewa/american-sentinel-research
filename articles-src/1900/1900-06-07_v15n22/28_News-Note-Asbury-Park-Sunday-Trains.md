It is announced that hereafter Asbury Park, N. J., is to have Sunday trains. The resolution requesting the railroads to stop their Sunday trains at the Asbury Park station is said to have been introduced in the city council by Mr. Bradley himself, the founder of the town. According to newspaper reports his remarks upon introducing the resolution were in effect as follows:

"The Sunday of to-day is not the Sunday of twenty-five years ago. The people are more progressive, and Asbury Park has progressed with the rest of the world. To-day we want and get the Sunday newspapers. We must bring ourselves to the idea of a broader and more liberal Sunday. I believe that Sunday railroad trains are necessary to the proper growth of our beautiful city, and I trust that old-fashioned prejudices will not impel anybody to vote against the resolution."

Adjoining Asbury Park is Ocean Grove, the great camp-meeting resort controlled by the Methodists. Ocean Grove is a distinct corporation but separated from Asbury Park only by a narrow creek. There is said to be much feeling in Ocean Grove against the Sunday trains, and it is feared that they will bring to the place much that is objectionable on that day.
