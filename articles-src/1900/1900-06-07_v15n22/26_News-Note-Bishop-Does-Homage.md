The following from a recent number of the English Churchman (London) will seem strange to American eyes:

"On Monday the Bishop of Liverpool went to Windsor Castle and did homage to the Queen on his appointment. The Home Secretary was present and administered the oath. We presume our neo-Anglicans would wish these 'formalities' to be dispensed with."

But why should it seem strange? In our own country chaplains are elected by legislatures and by Congress, and in the Army and Navy they are appointed and sworn. After all, we are only a step behind our English cousins.
