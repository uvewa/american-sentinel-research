Upon receiving the effects of the American Sentinel from New York we discovered that the files of the current volume were incomplete, numbers 6 and 10 being missing. The New York office has not a single copy of either of these numbers, hence we are compelled to apply to our subscribers. We would like to get twenty-five copies of each of these numbers—No. 6, date of February 8, and No. 10, date of March 8. Will our friends send them to us?
