## Should Majorities Rule?

The question, Should the majority rule? may be answered correctly by both yes and no.

In all matters of public policy touching public affairs the majority should rule. If a road is to be opened or a bridge to be built or a street to be paved the end sought should be the greatest good to the greatest number. But no majority, however great, has any right to trench upon the liberty of the individual. In the matter of rights the peasant is the peer of the noble, the individual the equal of all the race besides.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain inalienable rights." As long as these words remain true so long will it be true that in the matter of inherent rights—rights which men have in virtue of being men, that is human beings—are not justly subject to the will of anybody but of the God who gave them.

There is no thought more utterly ruinous to all that is noblest and best in man, than the idea that the will of the majority has anything to do with moral obligation. If a thing is wrong the concurrence of all the race cannot make it right. No more can the condemnation of all the race make wrong that which is right.

"The framers of the Constitution," said Richard M. Johnson, "recognized the eternal principle that man's relation with his God is above human legislation," and of course above the voice of majorities, however large. Only thus could rights be rights. That which is dependent on the will of any man or of any number of men is not a right but a privilege.
