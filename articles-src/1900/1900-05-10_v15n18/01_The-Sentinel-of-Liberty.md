# The Sentinel of Liberty.

With the issue of this paper a new period is reached in the publication of the journal heretofore known as the American Sentinel. The change that has now come, like others that have preceded it, is in the direction of increasing its efficiency in the cause to which it has been dedicated.

From the very nature of the work it has undertaken, such changes have from time to time been necessary. The American Sentinel was established to defend the rights of the people of this country in view of the rise of a religio-political movement by which those rights were threatened. That movement began in the formation at Xenia, Ohio, in 1863, of the National Reform Association, with the purpose of overthrowing the structure of American republican government, and establishing in its place a theocracy, or political rule by the church. Slowly, but surely the leaven of this movement permeated religious and political circles until some action was imperatively demanded to call public attention to the threatening evil and resist its further advance. It was this necessity which called into being the American Sentinel, and as the movement it opposes has increased in power and extent, it has been necessary to increase the facilities of the Sentinel to meet the demands of the situation.

The American Sentinel was first published in Oakland, Cal., January 1, 1886, as an eight-page monthly. January 30, 1889, it was changed to a weekly, the size of the paper remaining the same as before. In December, 1889, the Sentinel was removed to New York City, the first number appearing there January 2, 1890. In 1897 it was changed from an eight-page paper to one of sixteen somewhat smaller pages, in which form it has continued to the present time.

Meanwhile the movement which began with the formation of the National Reform Association has spread and enlisted in its baneful work numerous other organizations larger and more influential than the first. The American Sabbath Union, the W. C. T. U., the Society of Christian Endeavor, the Christian Citizenship League, League for Social Service, the New England Sabbath Protective League, and other organizations that might be named, all aim to establish in this country a union of the state with religion, which is the essence of the National Reform plan of government.

The movement has been greatly furthered also by the Supreme Court decision of 1892, declaring the United States to be a Christian Nation, by the act of Congress in the same year closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, declaring Sunday to be the Sabbath of the fourth commandment and enforcing its observance as such, and by State legislation, and decisions of the courts enforcing Sunday observance. The present is no time for relaxing the efforts made to stay the progress of this church-and-state crusade. Its organized support was never more extensive in both church and state, and never more rapidly increasing; and never was it more strongly intrenched in public sentiment.

The Sentinel now passes into the hands of an organization whose whole energies are devoted to the furtherance of the cause of religious liberty, and opposition to the schemes of religious intolerance. It is fitting that such a paper should be directed by such an organization. While the name is changed to one of slightly different signification, there is no change in the principles for which it stands or the results at which it aims. All that the American Sentinel has been as an exponent of the principles of free government and a defender of the rights of the people, will be realized in The Sentinel of Liberty, with as much more as can be gained from the increased facilities now placed at its disposal.

And now we ask and expect from all those to whom this paper comes the same earnest cooperation and support they have so freely given to the American Sentinel. We shall expect even more enthusiasm in its behalf, as we are prepared to give more through it for the furtherance of the cause it represents. Call the attention of your friends to this paper and ask them to become readers of the new Sentinel. No pains will be spared to make the paper all that it should be as a sentinel guarding the rights and liberties of the people in the great crisis which the cause of liberty has now reached.
