## A Question of Principle.

There is now before the American people a question second in importance to none that has ever occupied the attention of the statesmen in this or any other country.

This question is, Shall the United States remain true to the principles which have made this the greatest nation in the world; or shall the principles of republicanism be repudiated, and the principles of imperialism be adopted in their stead?

It may be objected by some that this is a political question, and that being such, it has no proper place in the columns of The Sentinel of Liberty. Let us see.

This is indeed a political question, though not yet a party question, though it may ere long become such. But every question pertaining to governmental affairs is political. Slavery was once a political question. Prohibition is still a living political issue; while only a few years ago the maintenance of the Sunday law was the supreme issue of a state political campaign in California.

These questions are cited merely because in each is involved a vital principle. Many issues are political merely, being wholly matters of policy, not involving vital principle any more than does the question with the farmer of whether he shall follow diversified farming or devote his energies wholly to the production of wheat, or corn, or hay, or potatoes.

But the question now before the American people is not one of mere policy, but of vital, fundamental principle. It is this, Shall we, not only as a nation but as individuals, continue to respect God-given rights? or shall we deny those rights and trample them under our feet?

We cannot avoid individual responsibility in this matter by remaining silent spectators. He who fails to protest when his neighbor's rights are invaded, and who by that failure gives to that invasion the sanction of silent consent, forfeits thereby the right to protest when his own rights are trampled under foot.

This nation was established upon the principle that rights are God-given and inalienable, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

This principle involves both civil and religious liberty. And it is impossible to deny the principle as applied to "inferior races" in distant lands and to maintain it as applied to ourselves in our own land. It is either true of all peoples everywhere, or it is not true of any people anywhere. Therefore he who by his silence now consents that this principle is not true in Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands consents to the same thing for this country, and for himself and his children.

When Israel demanded a king, the Lord sent Samuel to tell them just what was involved in their demand. And Samuel said: "This will be the manner of the king that shall rule over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; and he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear (or plant) his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.

. . . And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which you have chosen; and the Lord will not hear you in that day." I Sam. 8:11-18.

These words are just as true to-day of the policy of imperialism as they were of Israel's king. It will not only take fields and vineyards by means of taxation for the building and equipping of navies and the maintenance of armies, but it will take our sons, as it has already taken thousands of young men, not only to be servants, but to learn the art of war—to kill and to be killed upon the field of battle.

It is just as true now that this government cannot endure partly republican and partly imperialistic as it was true in 1860 that it could "not long endure half slave and half free." Imperialism cannot be confined to those outlying islands that have come to us as spoils of war. The policy pursued toward them is sure to react with disastrous results upon our most cherished rights.

Indeed the policy pursued thus far toward Porto Rico and the Philippines, and which bids fair to be adopted as a settled policy by the nation, is the true measure of the decadence of that loyalty to principle which characterized the early days of the Republic. The degree of liberty preserved among us as a people seems to be due more to the native conservatism of mankind than to adherence to principle for its own sake. It is to be feared that we have reached the time foretold by Thomas Jefferson in his "Notes on Virginia":

"The spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people careless.

. . . It will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect due respect to their rights. The shackles, therefore, which shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights shall revive or expire in convulsion."

Probably nothing that can be said or done will stay in any degree the rising tide of imperialism. But one thing can be done: the individual can preserve alive in his own heart and in his life the great principle of government by consent of the governed. This is the principle of God's government. Satan governs by fraud and force; God governs by truth and love. To which principle shall we be loyal? B.
