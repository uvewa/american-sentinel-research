An organization assuming the title of the "Union Good Citizenship" has been busy for some time trying to enforce Sunday laws, in York, Pa. Notice was given to all business men in the city, about two months ago, to close their places of business on Sunday. The newsdealers sold their Sunday papers as they did before, and were arrested and fined four dollars and costs each. But the people agreed to pay them one cent extra per copy so they could pay their fines. The subject is discussed rather excitedly, and the Good Citizenship Committee is said to be somewhat disappointed in the results of their efforts.
