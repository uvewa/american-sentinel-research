Enforced idleness is not liberty, but bondage.

Every self-appointed trustee of God is an embezzler of the rights of men.

Religious despotism binds him who exercises it no less than him who is its victim.

The denial of religious liberty to one is a threat against the religious liberty of all.

Conscience being itself a law of moral conduct for the individual, given him by the Creator, cannot be amenable to any law of man.

Liberty cannot degenerate into license when it is enjoyed equally by all, since license for one must interfere with liberty for some other.

There is no more justice in a law compelling a man to be idle, than in a law compelling him to work. The right to rest and the right to work are equal.
