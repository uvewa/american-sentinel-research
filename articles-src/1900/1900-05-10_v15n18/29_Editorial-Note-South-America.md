It is becoming apparent that the nations of the Old World have designs upon South America, which are almost sure to make that country the theater of warlike operations in the near future. Just now there is much discussion in English, German and American papers over Germany's claims in Brazil, and the recent announcement of Secretary of War Root, declaring that the United States must fight if it is to maintain the Monroe doctrine, is regarded as a significant utterance. The London Spectator affirms the correctness of this view, and says that "if America should wish to enforce the Monroe doctrine she must be able to destroy the German fleet." Germany, however, is now building a big fleet, and if America "sticks to the Monroe doctrine and yet refuses to prepare there is in store for America great humiliation."

Having divided up most of the available territory of the Old World, the European powers are looking with greedy eyes toward South America, where vast districts yet lie uncontrolled by any power strong enough to resist their aggressions. The United States must either surrender the Monroe doctrine or reckon with the fleets and armies of Europe sent to partition that country, or at least large portions of it, as Africa has been partitioned; and by its own aggressions upon Old World territory the United States has lost all moral support for the Monroe doctrine and strongly invited the European nations to adopt a policy which will make militarism a stern reality to the American people.
