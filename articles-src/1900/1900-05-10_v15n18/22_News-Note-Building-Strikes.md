A strike in the building trades has been in progress in this city for some weeks, involving from five thousand to six thousand men; and the end is not yet. Numerous efforts have been made to settle the differences between employers and employees, but without success.

One man has been killed outright in this conflict, and many have been injured, some of them very seriously.

In several places in the city non-union men are working under police protection, not daring to leave the buildings either to eat or sleep. Meals and cots are furnished by the contractors.

Nor is this spirit of unrest confined to Chicago. Under date of May 1st, strikes were reported also from Buffalo, N. Y.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Duluth, Minn.; Savannah, Ga.; Seymour, Ind.; St. Louis, Mo.; Passaic, N. J.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Omaha, Neb., and Kansas City, Mo.

Six thousand six hundred men were out in seven of the cities named, no figures being given for Duluth, St. Louis or Omaha; nor does this number include the thousands of idle men in this city.

The outlook for the near future is not reassuring. It has been broadly intimated that, owing to the political campaign now so near at hand, the civil authorities will hesitate to adopt the same stern measures for preserving the peace they otherwise would, for fear of alienating the labor vote.
