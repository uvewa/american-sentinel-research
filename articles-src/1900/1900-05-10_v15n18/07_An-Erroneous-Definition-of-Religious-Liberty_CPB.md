## An Erroneous Definition of Religious Liberty.

We hold it to be a self-evident truth that every soul should be left perfectly free to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience,—yea, more, that every one should be left free even to violate his own conscience, if he so elects. In other words, The Sentinel of Liberty denies the right of any human authority to require any man to do even that which he himself believes to be his duty toward God.

Said the Saviour, "Render to God the things that are God's." The Creator has not authorized any man to exact from his fellows that which is due to Him. To all who would attempt such a thing he says, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant?"

It may be said that there is nobody in this country, or but few at least, who are disposed to coerce any one in matters of religious faith or practice. But this is an error. There are many such.

Human nature is just the same as it has ever been. Men are naturally intolerant, and given the power and the opportunity, this intolerance will manifest itself in some form of persecution for opinion's sake. Says Buckle, in his "History of Civilization in England":

"There is but one protection against the tyranny of any class, and that is to give that class very little power. Whatever the pretensions of any body of men may be, however smooth their language, and however plausible their claims, they are sure to abuse power if much of it is conferred upon them. The entire history of the world affords no instance to the contrary."

Nor is this the only reason why such a paper as The Sentinel is necessary. Very many who, if they were asked if they believe in religious liberty, would promptly answer, yes, have only a limited idea of what it really means. Cardinal Gibbons, in his book, "The Faith of Our Fathers," declares in favor of "religious liberty," but defines it as "The free right to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience."

But religious liberty means much more than this; it means that no man or set of men shall have any power to define a "right conscience," and to enforce that definition on anybody by any sort of civil penalty whatever.

Men are altogether too prone to assume the right not only to define the law of God and human duty under that law, but to enforce their interpretation of both law and duty. It has been truly said that, "Among all the religious persecutions with which almost every page of modern history is stained, no victim ever suffered but for violation of what government denominated the law of God."

The sure preventive, then, of all such persecution in the future is to withhold from government absolutely all authority to define in any manner the law of God.
