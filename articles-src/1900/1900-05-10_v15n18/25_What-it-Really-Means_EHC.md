### What it Really Means.

Portis, Kans., April 18, 1900.

Editor Sentinel of Liberty:—

I was interested in the letter which was sent you by a Baptist clergyman of Cleveland, Ohio. Now I believe there are many like him who "do not believe in trying to make people religious by civil legislation," yet who are working hand in hand with those who do believe in it.

Allow me to quote from Rev. I. W. Hathaway, D. D., General Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, in his remarks at the Nashville Convention of Christian Endeavor, as follows:

"We are often told that we should not endeavor to promote Sabbath observance upon religious grounds with those who are not professed Christians, or who do not accept our religion or Bible. But we cannot ignore the fact that man is a religious creature; and more, that he is a child of God; and in connection with this the fact that the Sabbath is a divine institution, given of God to meet the innate demands of man's nature. If man shall reject God and turn from the truth, it will not change his nature nor his needs, nor can the purpose and nature of the Sabbath be changed to meet the conditions of his unbelief. . . . No Sabbath can long be maintained apart from its divine authority and sacred character. A secularized Sabbath becomes a positive source of evil. God is less honored and Satan better served on a secularized Sabbath than on any day of the week.

"There is little, if any, physical rest in a secular Sabbath. A body, to be rested, must have the cooperation of a healthy mind and a clear conscience. Monday morning does not find the laborer recuperated for his task, either in brawn or brain, who has spent the Sabbath forgetful of his spiritual need, even though he may have refrained from all positive excess, save that of laziness, during the day."

Now, what can Mr. Hathaway mean other than that a man must religiously observe the Sabbath to be rested for his work? While this may be all true enough, yet the question is, with him, "Shall we endeavor to promote Sabbath observance upon religious grounds with those who are not professed Christians, or who do not accept our religion or Bible?"

For a man to be recuperated in brawn or brain, he must have: "clear conscience"; he must not be forgetful of his "spiritual need." But if the man is forgetful of his spiritual need, shall we endeavor to promote Sabbath observance with such a man? Mr. Hathaway's answer is, "We cannot ignore the fact that the Sabbath is a divine institution, given of God to meet the innate demands of man's nature. The purpose and nature of the Sabbath cannot be changed to meet the conditions of his unbelief."

So, while our Baptist friend does not believe in trying to make people religious by civil legislation, he is working in company with those who do believe in that very thing, and is putting a weapon into their hands which they will use for that purpose.

While our Baptist friend is in favor of giving the men time for physical rest, and laws "should be enforced" for that purpose, his partner, Mr. Hathaway, says, "No Sabbath can long be maintained apart from its divine authority and sacred character."

Now, if men who are not religious are not permitted to work they will spend the day in amusement of some kind. But, again Mr. Hathaway says, "A secularized Sabbath becomes a positive source of evil. God is less honored and Satan better served on a secular Sabbath than on any other day of the week."

It is certainly plain that the aim of the American Sabbath Union is to make men religious, even by law, if in no other way.

They make themselves the conservators of "clear consciences" for other men. But what more than this did the papacy ever do?

It seems to me as I read the articles of our Baptist friend and Mr. Hathaway, that I can hear the creak of the rack and the crackle of the flames; I see again the Roger Williams of the not distant future, leaving his family fireside to find a home with the savages and wild beasts, who were not so savage and wild as the men who would see to it that their neighbors did not spend "the Sabbath forgetful of their spiritual need."

Let us remember that every man is responsible to God alone for the manner in which he spends his Sabbath.
