**France and the Roman Catholic Church.**

The recent trial and condemnation in Paris of twelve Assumptionist priests is thought by some to be the beginning of an anticlerical movement similar to that of the early days of the Third Republic.

The feeling against the religious orders is very bitter, and seem likely to become more so. Indeed it might truthfully be said that only a radical change in the industrial conditions of the country can prevent the growth of this feeling. And since the danger point has been reached already, the future is not bright for France.

"The French Liberals complain bitterly," says M. E. Saint-Genix, in an article in the Contemporary Review for March, that "monks and nuns are found nowadays occupying all the highways and byways of life. . . . Trades, industries, and professions are invaded by them to the detriment of the family-supporting layman. You can buy of Franciscan friars beer brewed by Cistercian monks, drink tea, coffee, or chocolate imported and sold by pious Trappists, who themselves never taste any of these concoctions; finish up your dinner with a glass or two of liqueur distilled by holy but rival anchorets, who are believed to have fled in horror from this world of sin and sorrow, and buried themselves in a cloister, in order to give themselves wholly up to God; you can polish the enamel of your teeth with patent powders and sweeten your breath with marvelous elixirs invented by men of God who have themselves no further use for either; you can get shod by enterprising Assumptionists, have your purple and fine linen made by nuns or their orphan slaves, and generally get your perishable body as well as your immortal soul taken in and done for by the members of modern congregations."

Nor does the trouble end here. These orders are, it seems, making their influence felt not only in industrial but in educational and political as well as in religious life. Rome is evidently working hard to restore France fully to "the Church." Saint-Genix says:

"In certain walks of literature, in the less dangerous domains of science, in the work of education, and, above all, in the schemes and intrigues of subterranean, as well as in the debates of daylight politics, they are indefatigable organizers, clever leaders, venturesome pioneers."

The methods pursued not only in France but elsewhere in Europe, especially upon the Continent, are thus described by the same writer, and are certainly not such as to commend themselves to those who believe the minister of God should "follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness":

"On the Continent, especially in Central Europe, a zealous priest will frequent public-houses, chat and crack jokes with the workmen, coax them to the church, and keep them there by means of chains the very furthest links of which cannot be said to reach to heaven. The well-known Jesuit, Father Abel, of Vienna, highly approves and zealously employs these latter-day methods. In a speech which he made some months ago to a number of pilgrims in Altotting he said: 'In Vienna I act on this maxim: I catch more people with a glass of beer than with an Ave Maria. I certainly do not exclude the Ave Maria, but to cap an Ave Maria by quaffing off two half-measures, that is a thing I relish. . . . But I will not have anything smacking of the devotee. . . . I tell you frankly those feats which we have accomplished in Vienna have been effected less in the church than in the public-house. . . . The main point is confession. If a man has confessed well, he will pray a little, and then he is gay and jolly.' Father Abel then went on to describe the nature and extent of the successes which he obtained by this up-to-date method. In Mariazell he once got one hundred and five men to confess to him at a single sitting, sinners whose confessionless years amounted together to eighteen hundred! A second address to the same hearers was begun by Father Abel with the comforting assurance that he would keep them but a very short time so that they might soon get back again to their glass of beer! In this simple way is the great conversion trick performed!"

In conclusion, Saint-Genix says: "The Roman Catholic Church has degenerated in France, and become a bloodsucking vampire of a kind probably unmatched in history. It keeps tens of thousands in intellectual thraldom and material poverty, that its own ministers may wax fat. And it is on account of these and similar practises that French Liberals are now violently and vainly agitating to bring about the expulsion of the congregations which have organized and are directing the movement."

And what is true of France is true in varying degrees of every country in the world. Nor is Rome the only offender against the rights of mankind. Every false and every apostate religious system is helping to enslave not only the souls, but the bodies of men. Only the genuine religion of the Lord Jesus Christ—the religion described by the Apostle James—gives liberty to anybody: "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." Politico-commercial religion, full of scheming, wire-pulling and selfishness, can only rivet the shackles the more firmly upon the wrists and ankles of poor fallen humanity.
