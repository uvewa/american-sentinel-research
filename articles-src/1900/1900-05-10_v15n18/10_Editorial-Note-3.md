To the horrors of the famine in India, which affects a larger number of people than there are in all North America, is now added that of pestilence, from an outbreak of the cholera, which as yet shows no signs of abating. The noted atheist, Ingersoll, said not many years ago that civilization had abolished famines; but probably no famine of ancient times affected half the number of people who are suffering from the present visitation in India.
