Baron Von Kupfer, who is in the German foreign diplomatic service, says the reason why the Sultan does not pay the indemnity claims presented by the United States, is that "there is an agreement between him and Russia to divide up the empire's revenue between them." Turkey owes Russia a vast sum for war indemnity incurred a quarter century ago, and Russia no doubt would be very unwilling that Turkey should under such circumstances satisfy claims of much more recent date presented by other powers.
