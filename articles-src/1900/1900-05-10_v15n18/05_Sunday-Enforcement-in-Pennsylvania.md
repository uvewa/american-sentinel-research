## Sunday Enforcement in Pennsylvania.

A Seventh-day Adventist named Field was arrested recently in Pennsylvania for working on Sunday, and was fined four dollars and costs by a justice of the peace.

The law under which the arrest was made and this fine imposed was passed in 1794, and prohibits all "worldly employment or business on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday (works of necessity and charity only excepted)."

The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has declared (Johnson's case, 22 Pa., 192) that in sustaining this law the courts recognize "divine command and human legislation." Thus the law is distinctly religious. In other words, it is an effort to enforce a human interpretation of the divine law.

Mr. Field belongs to a people who believe that the seventh day is the true Lord's day according to the Scriptures, and that it is their duty to keep it. And not only so; they believe that Sunday is a rival and counterfeit of the true Sabbath, which is the seventh day; and that to observe it as the Sabbath, knowing its origin and character, is displeasing to God.

Something as the government takes a piece of paper or metal, and by putting its stamp upon it gives it a distinctive character unlike all other pieces of paper or metal not similarly stamped by the same authority, so God has stamped the seventh day with a character peculiar to itself, and this distinction all men are under obligation to respect.

But this the law of Pennsylvania forbids; for while in that State no man can be arrested avowedly for keeping that part of the divine law which forbids labor upon the seventh day, any man is liable to arrest if he does not treat another day outwardly just as he does the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Thus the law of Pennsylvania, by forbidding worldly employment on Sunday, forbids the making of the very distinction between all other days and the Sabbath of the Lord, required by the fourth commandment.

In this connection the following points made against the Pennsylvania Sunday Law in 1821 by Alexander Campbell in the Reporter, of Washington, Pa., will be of interest. Mr. Campbell says:—

"My objections are the following:—

"(1) Because the law is intended to compel all citizens without respect to any conscientious conviction to observe a day in one sense only, by abstaining from industrial employments which in some instances only facilitates the commission of crime and greatly increases these very vices and immoralities which are bewailed. To instance this, I will only mention one fact known to many, viz., that hundreds of men, nay thousands, commit more sin in being compelled to refrain from the daily business of life on this day than they do on any other day of the week. The wagoner, so often fined for driving his team on this day, ninety-nine times in every hundred spends the day worse in lying by than in traveling.

"(2) It tends to oppress the consciences of some who conscientiously observe the seventh, and cannot conscientiously observe the first day,—such as Jews and Seventh-day Baptists.

"(3) The obedience which the law constrains is neither pleasing to God nor profitable to men. The man who observes the first day merely because the law requires him, performs not that kind of obedience which flows from the heart, and consequently it is with him an unwilling service.

"(4) The law itself is unjust, inasmuch as it is partial: it consults the taste and voluptuousness of the genteel folks in the large cities by allowing them to go to market morning and evening, to buy such things as may satisfy their craving appetite, while it would fine the poor farmer for saving his harvest, or gathering the labors of the year, a work of much greater importance than buying and selling fresh oysters, melons, leeks, and onions, or a fresh beefsteak before sermon, or even after they return from worship.

"(5) A fifth objection I have to the law is that the law itself is on its own principle lame, because it does not secure anything to the interests of even common religion or morality, because that, while it prohibits many from industry allowable on all other days, it allows them to spend the day reading newspapers, writing letters of business, or amusement, talking politics, or speculating upon any carnal or temporal topic. This, I say, it allows because its jurisdiction extends not to such things, but merely to overt acts on the highway or in the field."

The Sunday law of Pennsylvania is no better now than it was when Mr. Campbell so ably dissected it nearly eighty years ago.
