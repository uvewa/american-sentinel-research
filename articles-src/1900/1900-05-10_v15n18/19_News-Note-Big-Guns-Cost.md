Big guns cost something since, contrary to the prevailing thought concerning them, they are quite perishable. It is now said that ordnance officers in the United States army are beginning to be doubtful of a 16-inch gun, which has cost $130,000, and which needs a $1,000,000 turret to protect it. The fear is that by the time the gun is tested it will be burned out.
