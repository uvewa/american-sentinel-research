## A Tale of Two Nations.

GOVERNMENT AMONG CELESTIALS.

Away back in the dim and misty vistas of the eternal ages, the question as to what constitutes right principles of government agitated the breasts of celestial beings.

There was then, as now, a problem of government true and false. On one side the principals were the Father and the Son—God and Christ; on the other Lucifer, the Star of the Morning. And the history of all this was interesting then, it has been growing more so ever since, and is of deepest moment to all inhabitants of the universe, human, devilish, and divine, at the present hour.

"God is love." His very nature is love. The foundations of his eternal law are love. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind." This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

Since, therefore, the law of God is a law of love, it follows that the government of God must be a government of love. That is, the sovereignty of God involved fullness of happiness to all created beings. The only obedience for which Heaven cares is an obedience born of love. The King of the Universe asks nought but a voluntary allegiance. In other words, the government of God is a government by "the consent of the governed." And the "consent of the governed" doctrine is the foundation stone of the government of God.

This is made clear all through the Bible. Of beings who dwell in heaven, it is written in the Book of Revelation:

"A throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an amerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. * * * The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:

"'Thou are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.'"

This is a living picture of the operation of the government of heaven. The four and twenty elders address the Lord, saying, "Thou art worthy to receive glory and honor and power." God, the King, receives his glory from these. True, he sits upon the throne, but these all wear crowns, the symbols of sovereignty. God is King over them, because they want it so. Were all the power of the universe theirs, they would not have it otherwise.

Again, it is written of those who are redeemed from this earth, and who ultimately become dwellers in the better land beyond:

"The four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and priests; and we shall reign on the earth.

"And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."

Those of the children of men who are saved out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation do not become subjects controlled by the arbitrary will of another. They will not desire to be in such a state, and God would not have them in such a state. On the contrary, God makes them kings and priests. More than this, he makes them kings and priests unto God, and they "reign on the earth." And they say with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing."

Now all of this does not sound as if there were subjects or serfs in heaven, or in the world to come. It does show, beyond a shade of a shadow of a doubt, that in the realms of God every redeemed man is a king. To be sure, the Father and the Son are kings over all, but pre-eminently and fundamentally they are this "by the consent of the governed." God and Jesus are kings because every soul in the redeemed universe wants it so. They would not rule over unwilling subjects.

"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us."

This, then, is our status in the world to come. The spirit of bondage gone, we become "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." Heirs and joint-heirs to what? To the kingdom, of course.

Again, in Ephesians, 2:12 and 19, it is written: "At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world; but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ."

"Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." The redeemed are "fellow-citizens" with the saints, not fellow-subjects, and great is the difference between the two estates. Subjects exist in monarchies; citizens in "governments by the consent of the governed."

Therefore, from all of the above testimony, it is abundantly clear that God's plan of government in heaven before this earth was created, and after it is ended, is by "THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED."

It was Satan who first opposed government by the consent of the governed. This was the governmental doctrine of heaven, and he proclaimed against it. He it was who first advocated that pernicious tenet of government *without* the consent of the governed.

In the book of Isaiah it is written, "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are thou cut down to the ground, which didst *weaken* the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, *I will exalt my THRONE* above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north."

God accepts power from those who reign with him. Satan announced, "I will exalt my throne." Not simply, "I will exalt myself;" but "I will exalt my throne." A throne signifies government. Satan therefore proposed to set up his government over the angels of God. He proposed to do this without regard to their wishes in the matter. In other words, it was his plot to overthrow government by the consent of the governed, and establish in its place a monarchy, a one-man power without the consent of the governed.

Over this "there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."

It was over the question, therefore, whether God's own system of government, which is always "By the consent of the governed," should be maintained in heaven for time and eternity, or whether it should be overthrown, and in its place the government of Satan should be established, the government of a one-man power, without the consent of the governed—it was over this question that Satan lost his first estate. This was the question then; this is the question now. It is the problem of ages, and trembles on the tongue of time.
