It is stated that Andrew Carnegie, who refused to contribute to the Dewey arch fund, has given $1,000 to the fund for the widow of Sergeant Douglas, who was killed at Croton Dam during the recent strike. In sending the check Mr. Carnegie wrote: "Sergeant Douglas fought not for foreign conquest, but for peace and order at home."
