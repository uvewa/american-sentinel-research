## Liberty.

The liberty for the defense of which this paper is set, is "the state of being free from the domination of others, as far as this may be without trespassing on the rights of others." That which goes beyond this is license. That which falls short of it is vassalage, or at best, toleration; and toleration instead of being liberty is a denial of it.

Rights are God-given. They exist in the very nature of things. They are in no sense derived from government, being only defined and protected by human law. The sphere of civil government is thus accurately defined by Thomas Jefferson: "No man has a natural right to commit aggressions on the equal rights of another; and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him; every man is under the natural duty of contributing to the necessities of society; and this is all the laws should enforce on him."

Liberty does not admit of special privileges for any. A privilege implies one of two things; either those to whom it is granted are permitted thereby to trespass upon the rights of others, or else those not enjoying the privilege are forbidden to do something which they have a perfect right to do.

But whoever assumes either to authorize aggressions upon the rights of others, or to forbid the exercise of natural rights, is a tyrant. Nor is he less a tyrant who assumes to grant his fellow men the privilege of doing that which they have a God-given right to do. Toleration is in some respects the most hateful of all the myriad forms of tyranny known among men. Any people who accept it barter their birthright as freemen for a paltry mess of the serf's pottage.

Every man has a natural right to relate himself to God in whatever way seems to him most fit, so long as in so doing he does not trench upon the equal rights of others. For instance, no man has a right to offer a human sacrifice; and this not because in so doing he would shock the moral sense of those who hold such offerings to be abomination, but because he would deprive a fellow creature of the natural right to life. And this principle is as broad and far-reaching as the relations of moral, social beings.

## RIGHTS ARE EQUAL.

Nor does it make the slightest difference whether the rights of one or many are involved. The natural rights of a single individual differ not one iota from the rights of all the world. The heathen Chinaman, dwelling in one of our great cities, earning his bread in the most menial way, has the same right to set up his joss and to prostrate himself before it, and to offer incense to the dumb idol, that the richest and most numerous congregation has to erect the most stately cathedral and to worship the true God therein.

The Creator made man free that he might form moral character. And that freedom no man has any right to abridge except within the narrow limits which we have indicated, namely, in so far as may be essential to the preservation of the equal rights of others.

Nor does this mean that the moral sense of one, nor yet of many, must be protected from the shock incident to the failure or refusal of the minority, or even of a single individual, to worship as the majority hold to be right.

No man has a right to enter a place of worship and manifest open contempt for the place, the forms observed, the worshippers, nor the object of the service. The man who voluntarily enters a place of worship may very properly be required to conform to the rules that obtain there.

But it is just as true that no man can of right be compelled to attend or support any place of worship. Nor is it right to expose upon the street, to carry in procession, or in any manner to force upon the attention of the public any religious forms, institutions, symbols, objects, or relics, and require anybody under civil penalty to show them respect by uncovering the head, bending the knee, or doing any other act indicative of reverence.

Religious liberty consists not merely in freedom to worship as one's conscience dictates; it means also freedom from all dictation and compulsion touching the religious faith, forms, institutions and usages of others. The Protestant who, though permitted to receive the Lord's supper in both kinds—partaking of both bread and wine—should be required to receive also a wafer at the hands of a priest, would in such a case, be denied religious liberty just as truly as though forbidden to receive the supper at all.

The same is true of the Jew, Seventh-day Baptist, or other Sabbatarian who, while permitted to keep the day of his choice, in obedience to what he believes to be the divine command, is required to observe another day which his neighbors hold to be enjoined by the Creator.

Again, men generally recognize the fact that the taking of money from an individual by taxation for the support of religion is a denial of religious liberty. Comparatively few, however, see that exactly the same principle is involved in taking a portion of time, as is done by laws requiring the observance of sacred or supposedly sacred days. Sunday legislation, as it exists in nearly all countries, is no more defensible than is any other form of taxation in the interests of religion.

The Sunday law practically shuts everybody up in their homes or in the churches, on the first day of each week; thus treating them as criminals who ought to be deprived of their liberty, instead of free citizens.
