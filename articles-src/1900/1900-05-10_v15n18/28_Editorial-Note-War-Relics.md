In 1896, Congress passed an act to authorize the Secretary of War to loan or to give to soldiers' monument associations, Grand Army posts, and municipalities, war relics in the shape of out-of-date cannon, columbiads, mortars, solid shot, shells, etc.

It is said that thus far the government has not succeeded in giving away these war relics to any great extent; the demand does not nearly equal the supply. Two reasons for this have been suggested; first, that the people do not care for that kind of thing, and that they do not really take delight in the display of such murderous relics. The other suggestion is, that the people are willing to accept nothing except the latest and best; and that while the taste for war is increasing, they want to see not antiquated, but modern weapons. The latter seems altogether more likely than the former reason, since it is an undeniable fact that the martial spirit has increased many fold in this country in the last four or five years.
