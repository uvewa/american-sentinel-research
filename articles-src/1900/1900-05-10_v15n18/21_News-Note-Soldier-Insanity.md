The report that large numbers of American soldiers in the Philippines have become insane, and that the number is being constantly augmented, though denied not long since, refuses to down.

It is said that "between May 1, 1898, and April 1, 1900, nearly a thousand men have been shipped from the camps and posts of the army in the Philippines and Cuba to the government hospital for insane soldiers at Washington."

In addition to this number many have returned to their homes with minds shattered almost, if not wholly, beyond remedy. And during the same period of twenty-three months there were eighty-three suicides, nearly all due, it is said, to insanity. Twenty-nine of these suicides have occurred since the first of last December.

The cause of this frightful increase of insanity among soldiers in foreign lands is said to be due to climatic conditions and homesickness.
