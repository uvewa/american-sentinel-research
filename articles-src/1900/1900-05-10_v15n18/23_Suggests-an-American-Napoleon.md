### Suggests an American Napoleon.

A German paper, the "Bremen Weserzeitung" sees spectacular possibilities in the American trend toward imperialism. The United States, it says, is passing through a serious crisis. The coming presidential campaign, it believes, will decide the fate of the republic, which, it holds, is in serious danger.

"Full equality and true liberty, as they existed under the first presidents," the journal declares, "now have become legendary, and it is possible that modern republicanism may produce an ambitious president who shall repeat the role of the Great Napoleon."

It is strange, but nevertheless true, that observers in other lands see more clearly than do the majority of Americans just what is involved in the changed attitude of this government toward the fundamental principles upon which it was established.
