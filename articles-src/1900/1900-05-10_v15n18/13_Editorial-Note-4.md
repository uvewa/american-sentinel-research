Christianity is far more than an ethical system; it is divine power in the life of the individual. This power is given by the Lord himself in response to the faith of the individual who receives it. Nothing short of this is Christianity, and only those who have this experience are Christians.

Since this, and this only is Christianity, and since nothing short of this divine life in the soul constitutes anyone a Christian, it is manifest that only the power of God received by faith can make Christians.
