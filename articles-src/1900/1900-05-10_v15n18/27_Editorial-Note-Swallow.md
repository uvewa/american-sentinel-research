Mr. Swallow, the presidential candidate of the self-styled "Christian party," seems to be an ideal leader. In 1898, he was the Prohibition candidate for governor of Pennsylvania, and received 125,746 votes, or 12.61 per cent of all the votes cast for governor. The Prohibition candidate for State treasurer polled only 18,072 votes, or 2.28 per cent of the entire vote at the same election. This shows that it was the man and not the party that commanded the confidence of the people. Mr. Swallow is known as a "heroic fighter of political wickedness," and to this fact is due his popularity in Pennsylvania.

Of course those who have made a study of the subject recognize the fact that no permanent relief could be secured by turning the government over to any party, however high its profession. Calling a thing Christian does not make it so; and it matters not how honest Mr. Swallow and those who are associated with him in this movement may be; just as soon as success might appear probable all the political tricksters in the country from both the old parties would be prompt to secure for themselves front seats in the new organization, carrying with them all the corruption from which the people are seeking relief.

The organization of the "Christian party" and the nomination of a presidential candidate is simply another step in the direction of practical national reform in this country, which means simply, union of church and state. We do not mean to be understood as maintaining that men should not be honest in political life. We mean simply this—that men who are honest will be honest wherever they are placed, and under whatever name they may be called; but it will not make a man honest to make him a member of a "Christian party," any more than it makes a man honest to make him a member of the church. It will simply give dishonest men a chance to masquerade as Christians politically. In other words, as hypocrites.

The organization of this new party is, to say the least, significant. It is not likely that it will cut any great figure in the coming campaign; but, unless we are much mistaken, we have not seen the end of this movement. It will be heard of again, and may prove to be an important factor in politics in the not distant future.
