## Power From on High.

From its first issue the Sentinel has pleaded for the power of Pentecost as against political power in the promulgation of the gospel of the kingdom. Its watchword has ever been, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts."

As a friend of the Sentinel and an advocate of the principles, I wish to bear witness to the practical working of those principles in my ministry.

At the closing service of a series of revival meetings held in an eastern city, a gentleman past middle age arose and said:

"I am an agnostic, but I am having more trouble accounting for the manifestations of power which I have witnessed during these meetings, than with all the difficult questions regarding the inspiration of the Scriptures. Pray for me that I may find the truth."

Prayer was offered for the man, and according to his wife's testimony, which is usually trustworthy, the man was converted. What was it that softened and subdued this unbeliever? It was none other than a manifestation, though meager, of the same power which moved the multitude on the day of Pentecost.

"There are some who cannot remain to the evening service," said the messenger, "and they have sent me to request a five o'clock meeting." I was tired from the incessant labor of the meeting, but the thought that there were people hungry enough for the gospel to request an added meeting was refreshing.

The Lord gave a theme while a brother minister opened the meeting with prayer, and there followed thirty minutes of witnessing to God's power to save. After the benediction, a brother hurried to the desk, and with face beaming with joy said: "The arrow of truth has done its work. Mr. ——, the infidel of the neighborhood, is under deep conviction, and is sitting yonder, weeping. Come and speak with him."

"I am getting old, as you see by these gray hairs, and yet I am without an anchor," began the man. "I am helplessly drifting. I have tried to anchor in infidelity and failed; then I tried to find an anchor in Spiritualism, but it does not satisfy." "What you need is the Saviour. Receive Him, and you will find an anchor," I replied. "How?" asked the man. "Yield yourself to the Lord; acknowledge your sins; ask for forgiveness; believe that He forgives, and He will receive you. 'Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out,' is His promise." "I cannot believe," was the reply. I have been accustomed to explain away the phenomena which you call faith, on psychological grounds, and I cannot believe." "I can," I replied. "Once I was a helpless, hopeless wreck, but the Lord has wrought a miracle in my life, and is giving me the victory over those things which once enslaved me. I know He can save, because He is saving me." "That is what impressed me," he added earnestly. "I see you have something in your life that I have not. You are anchored, while I am drifting."

"Now, my brother," I continued; "you acknowledge you are in need of salvation, and you believe that I have the very salvation that you need. Hadn't you better accept it, too? If you should consult your trusted physician, and he should describe your affliction accurately, and then prescribe a treatment which had resulted in his own cure, would you not be acting wisely to faithfully follow it?" "Yes," was the reply. "Will you not then take the treatment which I prescribe, and which has healed me?" "I will try," was the feeble response.

Then we found a retired spot, and kneeling, he acknowledged his transgression and pleaded for pardon. Kneeling by his side, I watched the struggle with intense interest, and met each despairing cry of doubt with a promise of the Word. Presently he prayed, "Lord, I will act on the promise. I accept forgiveness. I am forgiven. But what did you forgive me for? Will I fall back into my old sins again? Will I get angry again? Will I be profane? I am afraid I will bring disgrace upon Christianity. O Lord, I am afraid." At this cry I placed an open Bible before his face, and asked him to read the following promise, which he read aloud, slowly:

"Fear thou not; for I am with thee. Be not dismayed; for I am thy God. I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness." Isa. 41:10.

This Scripture completed the victory, and we returned triumphantly to find many of his Christian neighbors anxiously waiting the outcome of the struggle; and ministers and people without regard to denomination, gathered around him to rejoice with him over his new-found hope.

After thanking the Lord for the victory, I sat alone meditating over the meeting and its results. "What did I say that moved him?" I queried. "All I did was to witness to the power of God to save. The witness was neither deep nor eloquent. It was the simple story, simply told." It was none other than the Holy Spirit that had done the work. He had taken the witness I bore and given it power to convict and convince. "Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you."

It is not civil law that the church needs to-day, but the convincing life. It is not power from Congress that is needed to save the world, but power from on high. Not a tarrying in the lobby of the legislative hall, but a tarrying in the upper room hard by the throne of God.

Reader, do you hunger for power to convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment? Then receive the promised power from on high. The need of this promised power is illustrated by the following possible scene:

It is the ninth day, the day before Pentecost. Peter and John have left the praying company for a few minutes and are walking pensively down the street to buy bread for their companions. Suddenly they confront a priest who recognizes them and addresses them thus:

Priest—"Well, if here aren't Peter and John. How glad I am to see you and to know that at last you are free from that awful delusion."

Peter—"What delusion?"

Priest—"Why, the delusion that the Nazarene was the Messiah."

Peter—"What makes you think we are free from that so-called delusion?"

Priest—"I should think you would be, now that He is dead."

Peter—"Dead? No, indeed; He is not dead. He is risen, and is alive forevermore."

Priest—"Nonsense; He is dead, for I saw Him after He died. That resurrection story is a fraud. You, His deluded disciples, came by night and stole His body while the soldiers slept, and now are circulating the lying report that He is risen from the dead. This I hear from the most influential people in both the church and the state. Why continue the fraud longer? No one will believe your story. Produce Him if He is risen."

Peter—"Fraud? there is no fraud. He is risen. I saw Him, and ate with Him, and talked with Him; and so have we all. He is not only risen, but ascended to the right hand of God, whence He came. I saw him ascend. He is not dead. He is alive; alive forevermore."

Priest—"Delusion upon delusion! Falsehood upon falsehood! Ascended? Never! He is dead forevermore."

Peter—"That is false. He is—"

John—"Come, Peter; don't tarry here. Let us hasten on. When we are alone I will tell you what impresses me deeply. And this it is, Peter: We can make no impression on the priest until the Holy Ghost is come. Rememberest thou not how He spake while He was yet with us, saying, 'Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high.' 'And ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto Me.' 'Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient that I go away, for if I go not away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart I will send Him unto you. And when He is come, He will convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. Of sin, because they believe not on Me; of righteousness, because I go to My Father and ye see Me no more; of judgment, because the Prince of this world is judged.' Let us return to the upper room and wait for the promise of the Spirit. Peter, did you not see how powerless you were to convince the priest of the resurrection of our Lord? O, how powerless we are! Let us return and pray more earnestly for the promised Power."

"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. . . . Now, when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded. . . . And they were all amazed and marveled."

I can easily think of that stubborn priest, hurrying with the surging multitude to the place of power. I can see him pressing his way through the eager crowd until he fetches up at the feet of Peter, who is just saying with a strange convincing power:

"This Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ." Acts 2:32-36.

And now I see this same priest (for "many priests were obedient unto the faith"), listening, startled, silent and subdued, until Peter reaches this point; and then I hear him, pricked in his heart, with earnestness cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"

Reader, can you not see that what is needed to-day to silence the scoffer, to convict of sin and of righteousness, and prove the resurrection and point out Jesus at the right hand of God, is the Holy Ghost from on high? No other power is needed in the Christian church. To seek any other power is to discount and deny the Holy Spirit, the all-sufficient and only legitimate power for the advancement of the kingdom of God. May the Lord bless The Sentinel of Liberty and make it potent in this time of turning from the upper room to the committee room of human legislation.
