### The "Christian" Party.

May 1st, the national assembly of the Christian Political Union met at Rock Island, Ill. After discussing at length the theme, "The Principles of Christ: shall we apply them in concrete form to state and national governments?" it was decided to launch a new political party, to be known as the "United Christian Party."

May 2d, a platform was adopted and candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency were placed in nomination. The ticket is, For President, Rev. Silas C. Swallow, of Pennsylvania; for Vice-President, John G. Wooley, of Illinois. The platform says:

"We believe the time has arrived when the eternal principles of justice, mercy and love as exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ should be embodied in the constitution of our nation and applied in concrete form to every function of our government principles. We maintain that this statement is in harmony with the fundamental principles of our national common law, our Christian usages and customs, the declaration of the supreme court of the United States that this is a Christian country and the accepted principles in judicial decisions that no law shall contravene the divine law.

"We deprecate certain immoral laws which have grown out of failure of our nation to recognize these principles, notably the permission of the desecration of the Christian Sabbath, authorized unscriptural marriage and divorce and the license and manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage."

The platform also favors prohibiting the sale of cigarettes and tobacco to minors; declares against war and for the arbitration of all national and international disputes; for the daily reading of the Bible in the public schools and all educational institutions under the control of the state; for government ownership of all public utilities, and favors the election of president, vice-president and United States senators by direct vote of the people.

The advent of this party is significant, and we shall have more to say concerning it in the future.
