Stories of fiendish barbarity continue to come from China; and unfortunately they do not all tell of the cruelty of the Boxers. The most recent recital of acts of shameful savagery was telegraphed from San Francisco by the Associated Press, August 7, and purports to be the story told by Mrs. E. B. Drew, wife of the British commissioner of customs at Tien-Tsin, who arrived from the Orient on the transport Logan. She says:

"During the bombardment we lived most of the time in the cellar of our house, which was partially wrecked by big shells. Sleep was out of the question most of the time, and so unstrung were we that little food satisfied us. There was ever present the haunting fear of the Chinese triumphing and slaughtering every foreigner and convert.

"Some, probably all, of the women were prepared to act in case the Chinese effected an entrance. But it appears the allied officers were prepared to act. I did not know it at the time, but I understood that ten or twenty men had been detailed to kill all the foreign women in case the Chinese were the victors."

"Mrs. Drew, with much indignation," says the dispatch, "then spoke of atrocities committed by Russian troops, saying:

"They pillaged, looted, tortured and murdered right and left. There were many infants and children killed by bayonet thrusts. And many were tossed from bayonet points, only to be caught and again tossed time and again. There is ample evidence of these occurrences.

"And about the Chinese women. They were mistreated and murdered in house after house. It seemed as if nothing could stay the mad frenzy of these Russians.

"Out from Tien-Tsin, along the Peiho and Yellow rivers, are numerous little villages. The Russians swept through the villages, destroying life and property. In these places they also tossed infants and older children in the air from bayonets. And every time this child-tossing tragedy was enacted the dead body of a mother, father or both would be hard by. The Russians also drove women and children into the Peiho and Yellow rivers, where they were drowned.

"After shooting and murdering to their hearts' content the Russians would pillage, loot and burn every house that caught their eyes. There was no attempt at concealing all of the remarkably barbarous conduct. I do not pretend to say how many women and children were butchered by the Russians. I never heard the number estimated, save that a great many had been bayoneted and some shot.

"In view of what they had been guilty of in and around Tien-Tsin, none of us were surprised to hear of a murderous act by the Russians at Taku. It is generally accepted as true at Tien-Tsin that the Chinese commander of the Taku forts was murdered by the Russians when he was in the act of surrendering his sword."

## Tien-Tsin Looted by Allies.

"Prof. O. D. Clifford of the Imperial University of Tien-Tsin, who was one of the last to leave the besieged city, says:

"Looting by the allied forces began as soon as they got the upper hand. The Russians led in this and went to extremes. They are naturally cruel, and expecting no mercy, they showed none. I was an eye-witness to eight cold-blooded murders by them. The victims were old and infirm Chinese. The Russians stole everything in sight, looting the houses in the settlement, as the Chinese would have done."

"The tales of Russian brutality are said to be confirmed by the Rev. Frank Haynes, a Methodist missionary."

## Heart-Sickening.

Such recitals are heart-sickening. With the great British Empire crushing out the life of two republics in South Africa; with the United States troops hunting down and shooting Filipinos simply because, after being sold by Spain like so many cattle, they refuse to recognize their new owners; with the Russians practicing the most horrible barbarities in China, and the Emperor William sending forth his soldiers with instructions to give no quarter, it seems almost impossible to regard civilization as other than a failure.
