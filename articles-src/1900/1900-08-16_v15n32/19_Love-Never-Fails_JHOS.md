CHURCH and state are separate organizations and are controlled by different agencies. The state is defended by the sword, the church by love. If our treaty with China has been violated and our ministers have suffered we must compel the empire to respect its honorable contract. But if our missionaries have been persecuted they cannot appeal to the temporal power for defense. The Author of Christianity suffered death and triumphed. The missionary who welcomes the musket as an aid to the extension of missions has no faith which will overcome the world. The church is humbled when her ministers advocate the musket as a civilizing agency. It may punish, it cannot civilize. The strenuous life of the nation and the church will not be manifested in battle, but in peace. China has been a peaceful nation, but if China's millions were drilled in soldiery as they have been in peace there would be no more talk of dividing the empire than there is of dividing America among the European powers.

Christianity must civilize heathen nations. This appeal to Caesar indicates a lack of the heroic love which sacrificed all for the kingdom of Christ. Missions founded and carried on with no other motive but love must dispel the darkness. Love never fails. Hate is the ally of decline and final fall.—Rev. J. H. O. Smith, pastor Union Christian Church, Chicago.
