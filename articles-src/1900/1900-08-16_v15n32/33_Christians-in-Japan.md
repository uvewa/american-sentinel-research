"There are in Japan," says the New York Independent, "120,963 enrolled Christians, of whom 53,924 are Roman Catholics, 41,808 Protestants and 25,231 Greek Catholics. If we include their unenrolled children and other dependents, this would give about 225,000 souls, or about one-half of one per cent. of the population of Japan outside of Formosa."

According to the logic of some people in the country, the Japanese Christians, being in such small minority, have no rights that anybody is bound to respect.

But very fortunately rights attach to human beings and not to numbers. One man has just the same natural rights as a thousand men, and his rights are just as sacred and just as inalienable.
