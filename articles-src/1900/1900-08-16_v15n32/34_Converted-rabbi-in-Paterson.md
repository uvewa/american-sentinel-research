A Jewish paper says: "The Paterson Young Men's Christian Association have imported what they call a converted rabbi, and invite the public to come to their hall and hear him tell how he was converted. Of course he tells a lot of other stuff about the Hebrew church. Naturally, the Hebrews, who are numerous and successful in Patterson, object to this procedure."

We fail to see why the Hebrews should "object to this procedure." Certainly it is the privilege of any Jew, even though he be a rabbi, to become a Christian if he wants to; and, having become a Christain, it is not only his privilege, but his duty to tell the reasons that impelled him to make the change. The vindictiveness exhibited by many Jews toward those who become Christians is not becoming in men who demand liberty of conscience for themselves. A Jew does not forfeit his rights of conscience by becoming a Christian, neither does he cease to be a man.
