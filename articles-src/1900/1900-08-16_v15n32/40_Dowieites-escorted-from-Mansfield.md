LAST Sunday Mansfield, Ohio, was again visited by two representatives of Doctor Dowie's work. The previous Sunday they were not allowed to leave the cars. This time, as the daily papers tell the story, "they secured a rig, driving over in time for an early breakfast. Then they went to the house of one of the faithful, E. H. Leiby, to hold services. It was several hours before their advent was known. When Mayor Brown, Attorney J. P. Seward and three officers arrived at the Leiby residence they found a crowd of 200 persons, and the services in full swing. The mayor informed the elders that their presence was distasteful to Mansfield, might cause serious trouble, and that while no violence would be attempted, they would be escorted out of the city and placed on a train. The policemen showed the Dowieites to a carriage and drove them to Crestline, as per promises."

This seems almost incredible. These men were only doing what they had a perfect right to do. But the officers sworn to administer the law violated it by dispersing a peaceable assembly!
