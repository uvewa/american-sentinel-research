Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage, who has just returned from a trip to Russia, where he visited the Czar, says that he "found as much religious liberty in Russia as there is in New York or Washington." This is not at all complimentary to New York and Washington and America in general. If it is true, and Dr. Talmage ought to be a competent judge in the matter, it indicates a loss of liberty in the United States rather than a gain of liberty in Russia, for the rigorous persecution of dissenters in Russia, and the ruthless crushing out of every vestige of independence in Poland, proclaim the despotism of the Russian Empire to-day. Religious intolerance is a natural outgrowth from the roots of the Russian system of government, but the foundations of the American Republic gave a promise of better things. There is something radically wrong when as much despotism can be found in New York and Washington as in Russia, for that is what Dr. Talmage's words really mean.
