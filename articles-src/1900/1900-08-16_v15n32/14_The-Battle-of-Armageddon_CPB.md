A READER wants to know where in the Bible he can find mention of "the great battle of Armageddon."

The name "Armageddon" occurs but once in the Scriptures, namely, in Rev. 16: 16.

Armageddon, or "Megiddo," is the name applied to the hills overlooking the plain of Esdraelon, the place where Barak and Deborah destroyed Sisera's army (cir. B. C. 1296), and where nearly seven hundred years later (cir. B. C. 610), King Josiah was killed and his army defeated by the Egyptians under Pharaoh-Necho.

As used in Rev. 16: 16, it does not necessarily refer to locality, but may mean rather place of slaughter or defeat. Be this as it may, the unavoidable inference from the 16th chapter of Revelation is that the very last act in the tragedy of this world's history will be the gathering of the nations to battle just before the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The world at large has long anticipated a struggle involving all the European Powers over the settlement of the Eastern question, or, in other words, the apportioning among the Powers of the Turkish Empire. But until "manifest destiny" landed the United States in the Philippine islands, thus making this nation one of "the kings" or powers "of the East," it seemed impossible, from a human standpoint, that this Government could ever be drawn into the impending conflict. But now it seems just as impossible that the United States should not be involved in the settlement of the Eastern question, whether that settlement shall involve merely the driving of the Turk from Europe and the division of his territory, or whether it shall include also, as now seems probable, the partition of China.

In the light of the prophecy of Rev. 16: 13–16, it seems clear that the work of gathering the nations is now going forward. Already the whole world has been brought together by steam and electricity until peoples once widely separated not only by distance, but but by diversity of interests, are now brought as near together as, though separated only by brooks instead of oceans. Indeed the world is, so to speak, no larger now than was a single state a century ago. And not only so, but the unparalleled growth of colonization, commerce and general landhunger is surely and swiftly bringing face to face in the Orient the conflicting interests of the great world Powers. For years statesmen and soldiers have foreseen that a great conflict is only a question of time. Often it has seemed that the storm was about to burst; but each time civilization has shrunk back aghast at the prospect, and peace has been preserved. But the storm clouds, though stayed, have not been dissipated. On the contrary, they have continued to gather blackness until their pent-up forces are beyond human conception.

Intensity is seen everywhere. The nations are bending all their energies to be prepared for the conflict which is now seen to be inevitable. The lesson is not far to seek. This arming of the nations means, as do the strange things taking place in our own land—this sudden change from simple republicanism to military imperialism, this leaving the pursuits of peace for the arts of war, the training of armies, and the building of navies—it means that the end of all things is near. And in view of it all, God's word to all who will hear is, "Be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh."
