The Sentinel proposes to treat every man with the respect to which men are entitled because they are men. We must of necessity quote the sayings of men and must name individuals. But while doing this, and while making such comment as seems to us meet, we shall not intentionally speak disrespectfully or slightly of any man nor of any people. It is for this reason that we say Thomas Paine, not "Tom" Paine; Colonel Ingersoll, not "Bob" Ingersoll; Doctor Dowie, not "Dr." Dowie.

It is true that two of these men were unbelievers and the other does not believe as we do; but it is just as true that we do not believe as he does; and, inasmuch as he is several years older than any man connected with this paper, it is not improbable that he began to believe as he does before we began to believe as we do. Of course we would be glad to be able to convince him of what we firmly believe to be his error, but we must recognize the fact that before God he has just the same right to his faith that we have to ours.

We don't believe in the liberality that holds that it makes no difference what one believes. It does. Every man ought to believe the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. But while this is true, we do admire the liberality that can recognize the worth of manhood wherever it exists, and that while intolerant of error is never intolerant of men.

The late John Clark Ridpath was a Methodist and a delegate to the quadrennial conference of 1888; but such was Dr. Ridpath's nobility of mind and liberality of thought, that he and the late Colonel Ingersoll were warm personal friends. If there were more liberal-minded men like Dr. Ridpath would there not be fewer unbelieving men like Colonel Ingersoll?
