"Friction between the Vatican and Washington" is reported from London. The cause of the friction is that the Filipino demand "that the present Spanish clergy be expelled from the Philippines, and their property confiscated, has not been rejected with indignation" by the Washington authorities.

Doubtless this Government has an immense problem on hand in the settlement of the question of church property rights in the Philippines. There are vast possibilities in it, just as there were in the Edict of Milan ordering the restoration to "the whole body of Christians" of the church property confiscated by order of Diocletian.

That edict of Milan, just as it was, resulted in less than four years in the full official recognition by the Roman Empire of the Roman Catholic Church as the Christian church; and each step in the whole transaction from beginning to end seemed to be absolutely necessary.
