Not long since, after an engagement with American troops, the officer in command of the Filipino "savages" sent all the American wounded he had captured into the American lines, and with a statement that the prisoners he had taken would be well treated. Would it not be well to send this "savage chief of still more savage men" to Germany to secure the revocation of Emperor William's no-quarter order; and then to China to teach the science of "civilised warfare" to certain of the allies?
