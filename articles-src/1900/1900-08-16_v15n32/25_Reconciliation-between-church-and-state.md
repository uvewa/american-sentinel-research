A dispatch from Rome, under date of August 10, says:

"It is the subject of common conversation here that a reconciliation between church and state is one of the possibilities of the immediate future. Yesterday Prince Henry, the Kaiser's brother, had a long interview with the Dowager Queen Margherita, after which he paid a visit to the Pope, and through Cardinal Rampolla, delivered him a letter from the Emperor of Germany.

"It is believed that Prince Henry also conveyed to the Pope the dowager queen's ardent wishes for a reconciliation between the secular government and the Vatican. The plan, it is asserted, is supported by the Kaiser."
