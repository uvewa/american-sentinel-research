We are not opposed to the Sabbath, but we are opposed to Sabbath legislation.

We oppose no person's right to rest one day in seven, but we oppose the idea that any person should be compelled to rest whether he wishes to or not.

We do not oppose granting any person the privilege of resting on the day he believes to be the Sabbath, but we oppose making one man's privilege another man's duty.

We are opposed to compelling people to work when they ought to rest, but we are also opposed to compelling people to rest when they ought to work. There is no law in this country compelling any person to work when he does not want to, and there should be no law compelling anyone to rest when he wants to work.

We believe every person should obey the dictates of his conscience, but we are opposed to making the conscience of one person the rule of conduct for another.

We are not opposed to law, but we believe every statute should conform to the law of justice.

We are not opposed to any church nor to any state, but we are opposed to any union between church and state.

We oppose Sabbath legislation because the use of force in religion is contrary to the gospel, contrary to conscience, and against the welfare of both church and state.

We are opposed to no man or organization of men, but we are opposed to all principles, by whomsoever held, that work against man's natural and inalienable sights.

We believe in reform, but we believe moral reform must come not through legislation, but by the quickening of conscience.

We are opposed to attempts at reform by legislation because such efforts ignore and often override conscience, and because they set up the law of man in the place of the law of God. We are not opposed to law, but we are opposed to any act by which a man or set of men assume the prerogatives of God.

We oppose religious legislation not because we would set aside law, but because such legislation sets aside the law of God.

We oppose efforts to reform society by legislation not because we do not earnestly desire such a reform, but because we believe it can be accomplished only by a far higher power than any legislature can exercise.

We desire the reformation of society, but we say the appeal must be made not to law, but to conscience; not to the legislature, but to the throne of the Most High.
