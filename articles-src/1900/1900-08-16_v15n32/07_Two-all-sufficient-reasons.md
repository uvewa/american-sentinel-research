THERE are two all-sufficient reasons why there should be no law requiring anybody to observe Sunday by refraining from anything that might properly be done on any other day. The first is, all such legislation is wrong in principle. The second is, such laws foster a vital error in Christian doctrine, since Sunday is not the Bible Sabbath.
