The St. Louis Globe-Democrat had a cartoon recently which was quite significant in its way. This cartoon was entitled, "The Logical Champion of Christendom."

On the left of the picture was a sinister-faced human figure clad in armor and holding in his two hands a broken sword inscribed "Selfishness." Upon the breastplate of this figure appeared the name "Europe."

On the right was the figure of a muscular Chinese Boxer, with a torch in one hand and a huge broad-sword in the other, and a look of diabolical ferocity on his face.

In the center, confronting the Boxer, and a little in advance of "Europe," stands "Uncle Sam," with uplifted cross in one hand and a drawn sword in the other. Upon the sword appears the word "Justice."

The cartoon is misleading in several respects. In the first place, the Boxer uprising is not a movement against Christianity as such, but only to the extent that Christianity is identified in the Chinese mind with the greed and injustice that has driven China to desperation.

Again, if "Uncle Sam" keeps his place he will not pose in China as the champion of anything but the natural and treaty rights of American citizens. The United States now has in the Sulus a large number of Mohammedan subjects. It would be the duty of the Government to extend to these the same protection, in case of need, that is demanded for the missionaries and other Americans now in China. But who in such a case would think of depicting "Uncle Sam" with the crescent in one hand and the sword in the other?

The Government of the United States has no duty to protect anything but rights. The missionaries have claims upon the Government only as citizens.
