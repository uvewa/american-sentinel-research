Surprise is expressed in some quarters at the announcement from Washington that Cuban independence is to have not only "a string to it," but a five-fold cord, a sort of "cable-tow," as it were. But this need surprise nobody. In the very nature of things Cuba can never be independent. She may have a large measure of local self-government, but that is all; and The Sentinel professes no prophetic gift, either. It is "manifest destiny."
