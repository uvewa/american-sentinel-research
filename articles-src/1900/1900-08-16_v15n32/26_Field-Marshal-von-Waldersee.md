FIELD MARSHAL VON WALDERSEE, the German, chief of staff, has been appointed commander of the German troops in China. The news of this appointment had a depressing effect on the Wall Street and and other stock markets.

The only inference to be drawn from this appointment is that the German Emperor forsaw long-drawn-out trouble ahead in China. "Six weeks will elapse before he can reach the gulf of Pechili," says a most careful and ably edited daily paper. "That there is an ominous note in this appointment can not be denied, and it may mean that Germany intends to enlarge her Chinese empire to compensate for the murder of her ambassador."
