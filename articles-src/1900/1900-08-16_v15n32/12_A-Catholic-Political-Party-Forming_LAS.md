In the New York Sun of July 30, we note the following mention of a proposed "Catholic Federation" in the United States, which is to be "permanently organized soon:"

"The project for the federation of the societies of Catholic laymen throughout the United States that is now being agitated has received the strong approval of Mgr. Martinelli, the apostolic delegate at Washington. In a letter to John A. Kuster, of Columbus, Ohio, one of the most earnest advocates of the scheme, Mgr. Martinelli says:

"Believing, as I naturally and sincerely do, that Catholic interests are well worth protecting and promoting for the welfare both of religion and of the civil society, and knowing the value of united effort for the protection of any interest, I do not fail to appreciate the importance and desirability of such a movement as you tell me has been inaugurated. If, however, it is absolutely necessary that any and every Catholic society, however humble, in order to have the approval and encouragement of the church, should maintain relations of filial respect, submission and obedience to the legitimate ecclesiastical authority for a great confederation of Catholic societies, such relations become infinitely more important and necessary. I hope, therefore, that as the movement progresses and the Catholic societies grow strong in union they will ever remember that before numbers and before union the great source of Catholic strength is an ecclesiastical authority."

## The Object of the Proposed Federation.

Notice that this Catholic federation is to be formed to "protect" and "promote" Catholic interests, and that this is "for the welfare, both of religion and of the civil society." Readers of THE SENTINEL may remember that for a dozen years or more past, the National Reform Association and allied Protestant organizations have been almost continually before Congress with a scheme to "protect" and "promote" the observance of Sunday for the welfare both of religion and of the civil society, as they deem it. These Protestant organizations have for years been moving toward a position of political power and authority, with a view of exercising this power finally for the realization of their vision of the purification of politics and the establishment of righteous government. And now what else could be expected than that Rome, seeing all this, should imitate the example set here and also organize for the protection and welfare "of religion and of the civil society"? Protestants have deemed their organization necessary to the welfare of civil society, and now, behold, the Catholics deem their organization to be necessary to the same end. And who can say that the Catholics have not as much license to think the welfare of civil society depends on their united political action, as Protestants have to think the like thing of themselves? And who can say that the welfare of civil society will be more promoted by Protestant church activity in politics than by Catholic activity in the same sphere?

## Protestants Should Have Foreseen It.

The truth is that Protestants should have foreseen that their efforts to get Congress to legislate for the "protection" of Sunday and the "promotion" of the general interests of morality and Christianity, as they view them, would simply and inevitably result in drawing Catholics into the same field and adding another point to the rivalry between the Protestant and Catholic bodies. Protestants have put into the hands of Rome a cue and excuse for which she has long been seeking.

This Catholic federation has an endorsement which secures it against all opposition from Catholic sources, and a prospective strength which shows that politicians will not dare to ignore it. We quote again from the Sun:

## Has High Endorsement.

"Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia, Archbishop Elder of Cincinnati, and many other members of the Catholic hierarchy have warmly endorsed the project.

"It has been decided to keep up the agitation for a Catholic federation for some time yet and then hold a national congress to perfect a permanent organization. This congress may be held in this city. Catholic societies with a membership of 600,000 have already announced their intention to enter the federation. The objects of the federation have been officially announced as follows:

"To work for the general welfare of Catholic interests apart from the special object of each society—leaving each society with its own constitution, language, government, and officers, but establishing a central board for the purpose of better carrying out the principles advocated; to vindicate the rights of Catholic citizens; to support the Catholic press and diffuse Catholic principles and protest against all measures antagonizing them."

## Will Hold the Balance of Power.

We are informed, in conclusion, that "the federation will not be a Catholic political party, nor will it be affiliated with any political party." No, indeed! All it will do politically will be simply to boss all the parties by holding the balance of power between them, just as is done by the papacy in Germany, for example. The federation will not constitute a political party, but it will secure from the political parties what it demands for the advancement of Catholic interests in the United States.

This move on the part of the Catholics will almost certainly result in the formation of a Protestant counter-organization, and thus both Protestants and Catholics will be drawn into the vortex of politics, and religious controversies will be more and more transferred to the political arena; and all this will be against Protestantism and in favor of Rome; against republican government and in favor of despotism; against the new order of things represented by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and in conformity with the old order of things from which the Pilgrim fathers fled to the shores of the New World. The lover of liberty and just government should be admonished that he must seek them elsewhere than in this nation or in any of the political systems upon the earth. s.
