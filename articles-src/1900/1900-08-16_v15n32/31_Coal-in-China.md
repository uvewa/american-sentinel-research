Coal is said to be mined so easily in China as to cost only twenty-five cents per ton in some parts of the empire. Doubtless this fact will be duly considered by the Powers in arranging their "spheres of influence" "after the war is over." The end of England's coal supply is already in sight, and "black diamonds" are not abundant nor are they easily mined in some parts of the continent of Europe.
