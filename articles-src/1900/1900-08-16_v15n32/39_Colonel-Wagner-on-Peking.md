LIEUTENANT-COLONEL WAGNER, a German war expert, writes to the National Zeitung of Berlin in a rather discouraging tone of the situation in China. He says that "the defenses of Peking are not to be despised. The city can not be taken by storm, and, if determined resistance is offered, a small force, if able to enter, would be caught as a rat in a trap."

Referring to the campaign of 1860, he remarks that at that time "the allies started out with 20,000 men. For the final attack upon Peking they had only 8,000 left."

Colonel Wagner thinks that had the Chinese held out longer on that occasion, the allies would have been in a very bad way, and adds the warning: "To get out of Pekin may be more difficult than to get in."
