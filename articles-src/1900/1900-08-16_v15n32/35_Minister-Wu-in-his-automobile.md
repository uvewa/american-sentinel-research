"The little ray of humor," says the Springfield Republican, "that sometimes penetrates the most gloomy situation is furnished, in this time of anxiety over the great mystery in China, by the flight of Minister Wu in his automobile over the asphalt pavements of Washington, bearing the precious dispatch announcing the safety of the ministers. Imagine the representative of a nation barbarous enough to murder the ministers of other powers operating an automobile!"

In the same column and separated from it by only one note of seventeen lines, the Republican has this:

"The right jingo spirit breaks out in a letter to the London Morning Post from its South African correspondent, Mr. Stuart, who writes: 'Again I had the joy of seeing the smoke of a rebel's house ascending.' Unfortunately the colonel of the regiment interfered with his joy: 'Greatly to our sorrow, he forbade any more burnings.' Mr. Stuart was a guest of Sir Alfred Milner when he made his tour in the northern part of Cape Colony, and concludes that Sir Alfred 'strikes terror into the hearts of the Dutch.'"

Now why should it be thought any more strange that the representative of a nation capable of killing the envoys of other nations, should use an automobile than that the correspondent of a great London paper should deplore the fact that he and other highly "civilized" and even "Christianized" savages from a great "Christian nation" should not be permitted to burn houses over the heads of women and children?

After all Western civilization is not so very many "laps" ahead of Eastern civilization; or at least that type of it represented by the Post's correspondent is but slightly removed from savagery.
