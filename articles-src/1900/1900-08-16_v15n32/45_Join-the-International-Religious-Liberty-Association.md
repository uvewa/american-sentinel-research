Everywhere the advocates of "religion and the state," which is only another name for church and state, are active in promulgating their doctrines. The friends of liberty of conscience ought to be doubly active.

Every lover of soul-liberty ought to be a member of the INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION; but especially is this true of every reader of THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY.

"The object of the Association is to promulgate the principles of LIBERTY, Christian and Constitution." Certainly this is a work in which every Christian should cooperate. If you are not a member of the Association, will you not send one dollar at once to the secretary, H. E. Osborne, 324 Dearborn Street, Chicago, and ask him to enroll your name, and send you a certificate of membership? The Association needs your help, and you need the benefit of the Association.
