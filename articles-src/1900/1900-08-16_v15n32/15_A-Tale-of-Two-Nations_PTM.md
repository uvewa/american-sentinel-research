### The American Commonwealth.

The fathers of the United States announced her birth with sentences of truth which will live in eternity. The principles which they enunciated were heaven-born, not man-made. They said that the colonies assumed their separate and equal station among the powers of the earth "according to the laws of nature and of nature's God." They founded their Republic on eternal verities, not on human maxims and theories.

"We hold," said they, "these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal: that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED."

The great Alexander Hamilton truthfully said, "The Declaration of Independence is the fundamental constitution of every State." It is a declaration of great general principles, as well as a recital of certain specific grievances. It was never written to meet the exigencies of one particular time or people. No nation prior to this one had ever declared it as a principle good for all mankind that all men are created equal, or that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. None of the great nations of Europe ever taught or ever believed these principles.

Such doctrines as are contained in the Declaration of Independence had, practically speaking, been lost to earth since that unfortunate day when the hosts of Israel petitioned the prophet Samuel to make them a king to rule over them, that they might be like all the nations round about. These truths were born again; they were resurrected with a fresh and God-given life at the time when the American Republic came to its noble birth. They constituted her christening robe and her birthright, peculiarly her own, and the first infant cry of her national life.

## The Divinity of These Truths.

I desire to impress upon every heart the divinity of these truths. I desire to make plain to all that the forefathers and some of the great men who have lived since, considered them divine in the basic thoughts and nerve principles which they present.

Well has Charles Sumner said:

"The words that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed are sacred words, full of life-giving energy. Not simply national independence was here proclaimed, but also the primal rights of all mankind. Then and there appeared the angel of human liberation, speaking and acting at once with heaven-born STRENGTH, breaking bolts, unloosing bonds and opening prison doors; always ranging on its mighty errand, wherever there are any, no matter of what country or race, who struggle for rights denied; now cheering Garibaldi at Naples as it had cheered Washington at Valley Forge, and especially visiting all who are down-trodden, whispering that there is none so poor as to be without rights which every man is bound to respect, none so degraded as to be beneath its beneficent reach, none so lofty as to be above its restraining power, while before it depotism and oligarchy fall on their faces like the image of Dagon, and the people everywhere begin to govern themselves."

And again he says:

"The Declaration of Independence is the twofold promise, first, that all are equal in rights; and, secondly, that just government stands only on the consent of the governed, being the two great political commandments on which hang all laws and constitutions. Keep these truly and you keep all. Write them in your statutes; write them in your hearts. This is the great and only final settlement of all existing questions. To this sublime consecration of the Republic let us aspire."

In liberty, therefore, was the nation conceived. To these two propositions was it sacredly dedicated and solemnly sealed in the blood of its noblest sons. As the Bible declares that all men are equal before the Lord, i.e., that God is no respecter of persons, so the Declaration affirms that all men are equal before the law, and that this equality is their own inalienable and primal right. The Declaration does not mean that all men are equal in all respects. But it does mean and it does say that they are equal in their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And in this it recognizes the nobility of man as the creation of God, and makes no exception or distinction in favor of any human caste or lineage.

In summing up his views on America's greatest state paper, George Bancroft, the finest historian which this continent has yet produced, gave utterance to this beautiful tribute to the immortality of the great document:

"This immortal state paper, which for its composer was the aurora of enduring fame, was 'the genuine effusion of the soul of the country at that time,' the revelation of its mind, when, in its youth, its enthusiasm, its sublime confronting of danger, it rose to the highest creative powers of which man is capable. The bill of rights which it promulgates is of rights that are older than human institutions, and spring from the eternal justice that is anterior to the state."

## In the Providence of God.

It was God who brought the United States into existence. It was God who set her secure betwixt the twin oceans that she might work out and develop, untramelled by foreign precedent and precept, the great truths, the custody and advancement of which he had entrusted to her hands and heart.

The King of kings and Lord of lords set the commonwealth of the United States in the world just as verily as thousands of years before he had set the commonwealth of Israel, and moreover he set both in the world for one and the same purpose.

God set Israel in the world to give to all the nations of the earth the true principles of the Christian religion. This was the task assigned her in her capacity as a church. He also set Israel in the earth to give to all the nations the true principles of government among men. She was God's chosen instrument in the elder day to carry heaven's wondrous truths to a world which was suffering for the lack of them.

Likewise in the latter day God has set the commonwealth of the United States in the earth for a twofold purpose, and that twofold purpose is the same as was his purpose in the people of the Jews. The true principles of the Christian religion were designed of God to go forth from this land as from no other in these last days. He provided that this might be so. He ordained that all nations and kindreds and tongues and tribes and peoples should be benefitted and blessed thereby; and he also set this nation in her place, and gave to her a charge to carry the truth of government by the consent of the governed, and that all men are created equal, its twin sister, to every nation on the globe. In this the work of Israel and the work of the United States are one and the same. And who will rise and say that God has any less interest in the work of the one than of the other, or that the work of the latter is not as fully outlined in the sacred Scriptures as the work of the former?
