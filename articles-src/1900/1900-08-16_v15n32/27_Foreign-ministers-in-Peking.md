NOTWITHSTANDING all sensational reports to the contrary sent out some time since from Shanghai, it is now known that all the foreign ministers in Peking, with the exception of the German representative, were living only a few days ago.

All the foreigners in the city were besieged, however, in the British consulate by the regular Chinese troops. Notwithstanding this fact the Chinese government seems able to exercise some control over the situation, and offers to send the foreigners to Tien-Tsin under escort. Very naturally the ministers refused to trust themselves in the open to the keeping of those who have for weeks been endeavoring to murder them.

Nobody seems to fully understand the situation, and the efforts thus far made to reach Peking with adequate relief forces have failed. Up to the time of writing this note the Powers have not been able to agree on a commander-in-chief. So that the army operating for the relief of the foreigners in Peking is in reality five or six different armies, each absolutely independent of the others, so far as recognizing any central authority is concerned. All told, the allies do not number more than twenty-five or thirty thousand effective men. In view of these facts, and many others which we have not space to give, it is certainly not exaggeration to say that the situation in China is desperate, so far at least as the safety of the beleagured foreigners in the Chinese capital is concerned.
