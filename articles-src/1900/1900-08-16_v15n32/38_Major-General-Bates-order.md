MAJOR-GENERAL BATES, commanding the Department of Southern Luzon, recently issued the following order:

"Rumors having reached these headquarters that unjustifiably harsh measures have been employed in some instances to extort information from captured ladrones, officers of this command are reminded that general orders of the War Department provide ample and lawful methods for the treatment of prisoners, spies and other persons not entitled to the rights of recognized belligerents, and all departures from the provisions of said orders are strictly prohibited. While it is not believed that any officer of this command would, either openly or indirectly, sanction any unmerciful acts, and still less that he would deliberately order them, all persons in military service in this department are nevertheless warned that no end can be so desirable or important as to justify a departure from the recognized laws of war or a resort to any deliberate measures of cruelty."

This appears to substantiate in a measure the reports of cruelty practiced by the soldiers, but not the complicity of the general officers.
