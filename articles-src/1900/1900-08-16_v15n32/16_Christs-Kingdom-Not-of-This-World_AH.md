From "Religion and the State," by A. Hovey, D. D.

Although the general duty of subjection to "the powers that be," or the laws and rulers of the state, is very sacred it can not be urged as a valid excuse for disregarding the Lord's requirement to confess him before men. It was, therefore, the duty of the apostles to preach the good news of salvation through Christ, though forbidden to do this by "the highest human authority to which they could have felt that they owed allegiance," and even to say boldly in the presence of this great court. "It is right to obey God rather than men." And this fact of a higher law for the Christian, of a paramount duty on his part to be a loyal and obedient subject in the Kingdom of Christ, affords a strong presumption that, kept within their proper spheres and directed to the attainment of their distinctive ends, the authority of Christ and that of the state will never come into collision, and this is equivalent to saying that their spheres and aims and methods are very distinct; that the kingdom of Christ is on a different and higher plane than the state.

## They Looked for an Earthly King.

It was this fact that made it so hard for the Jews of our Saviour's time to see in him the promised Messiah, for they were expecting a restoration of the theocracy, a perfect and final union of church and state, religion being sustained by the civil power and the civil power sanctified by religion. They were looking for one to fill the vacant throne of their royal line who should unite the heroism of David with the wisdom of Solomon, and by an era of conquest usher in an age of peace; who, as the favorite of Jehovah and the pride of all the people, should bear, like the Pope in other days, two swords—the temporal and the spiritual—and lead the nation to victory over the Gentiles, as well as to holier worship in Zion. It is not, therefore, surprising that many welcomed the harbinger of Christ preaching repentance, and listened without offense, but not without wonder, to the sermon on the mount, but turned away from Jesus with contempt when he refused to wear an earthly crown. Nor is it altogether unaccountable that the chosen twelve, who were the daily companions of the Lord, expected until the very hour of his betrayal, that he would yet be a temporal prince, uniting divine authority with human, the sanctions of religion with the power of the sword, and making his kingdom one of this world. It was extremely difficult for them to receive the idea of a spiritual dominion resting on the power of grace and truth.

## On a High Plane.

But it was such a kingdom, on a plane far above that of any earthly authority, that Christ came to establish. It was such a kingdom that he professed to rule in his language to Pilate: "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight." "I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I may bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."

Pilot was convinced by the divine bearing and candor of Jesus that whatever might be his authority, whether real or imaginary, it pertained to religion and not to the state; it rested in no degree upon secular power, and contemplated in no case an appeal to the secular arm; and this testimony of Christ was in absolute harmony with the whole tenor of his life and teaching. He took no step to connect his cause with the state as such. He threw out no hint of its needing the support of the civil power. He provided for no statesmen or soldiers to carry on his work, but only for preachers and teachers. Had not the Jews been strangely tenacious of their belief and strangely blind to the spirit of Jesus they would have perceived much sooner than they did that his dominion over men must ever be spiritual, no imaginable state of affairs being likely to make him accept an earthly crown.

## Christ's Dominion Not Civil.

And his apostles came at last to understand this. By the death, the resurrection, and the ascension of Christ; by the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Penticost and the light of inspiration added to that of providence, they were made to know that their Lord's dominion was not civil and national, but spiritual and universal; not of this world and sustained by force, but from above, and supported by grace, and to comprehend the new and great fact that, though engaged in a fearful conflict, the weapons of their warfare were not carnal, but mighty through God to casting down strongholds, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. And one of them, writing to the Ephesian saints, utters, in view of their spiritual foes, this stirring cry:

"Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand," going on then to enumerate in terms of blessed confidence the parts of this divine panoply for the Christain. All of them may be embraced in four words—Christian character and Christain truth. Without the former his readers were sure to be betrayed by traitors within, and without the latter they were in danger of being put to shame by external foes. But armed with grace and truth from him who has infinite store of both they were able to repel every assault and win from seeming defeat real victory.

## The Simple Majesty of Truth.

The records of history justify this language, for the rage of paganism, fierce as a bear robbed of her whelps; the scorn of philosophy, falsely so-called; the sword of the state wielded by the fanaticism of a perverted church, and the pride of natural science soaring with untried wings into the heights of speculation, have been met one after another and put to shame by the simple majesty of Christian character and Christian truth.

Indeed, these are the only weapons with which they have ever been successfully met. They are weapons of celestial origin and temper, not made with hands, but given by the Lord of life, and therefore are they certain to prevail over those of grosser material fashioned by the skill of man.

The lesson from all this would seem to be that the kingdom of Christ is independent of the state, ruling in a higher sphere and with a view to higher interests, having laws and forces of its own that agree in character and work in harmony towards the same great end, and that any attempt to unite the two must be fraught with peril to the higher, if not to the lower.

Most manifest is it that the higher has no need of direct assistance from the lower in accomplishing the ends for which it was established among men, and that any admission of the lower into its proper domain and work will soil its purity and weaken its power.

God asks no man to administer his divine law.
