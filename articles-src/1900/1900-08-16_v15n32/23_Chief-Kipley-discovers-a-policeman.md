It is a matter of common rumor that Chief Kipley, of this city, has discovered on "the force" a policeman who, to use the chief's own words, "knew he could not make an arrest without a warrant," merely on the oral complaint of a citizen. "Doubtless," remarks the Daily News, "this man deserves to be promoted to a captaincy at least, but he will be worth a great deal more to American liberty if he is kept on a beat."
