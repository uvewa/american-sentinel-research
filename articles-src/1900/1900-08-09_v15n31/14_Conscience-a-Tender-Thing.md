THE Jewish Times and Observer says: "Conscience is a tender thing and tenderly to be regarded, and in the same proportion in which a man treasures his own moral integrity, so ought he to regard the conscience of every other man."

This is true. The man who sneers at the conscientious convictions of another testifies thereby that he is governed by policy and not principle.
