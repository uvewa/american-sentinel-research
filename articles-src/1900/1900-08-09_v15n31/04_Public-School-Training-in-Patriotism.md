## PUBLIC SCHOOL TRAINING IN PATRIOTISM.

As amusing but instructive article relating to this subject appears in *McClure's Magazine* for July. The author, Marion Hill, describes an investigation he was led to make into the nature of the instruction derived by young pupils in the public schools from various patriotic songs and exercises in which the children in the public schools are commonly drilled. The surprising results of this investigation, which may fairly be assumed to speak for the public schools in general upon this point, reveal a radical defect in a feature of public-school training usually regarded with pride by the school teacher, and from which much is hoped by patriotic elders impressed with the importance of inculcating patriotism in the young. There is evident in the minds of the generation into whose hands has fallen the control of public affairs in this country, a woeful lack of appreciation of American principles of free government; there is such a failure in this respect as is resulting in a transition from republic to empire, and who can tell how much might have been done to avert this dire result if the meaning of these shining principles of right and justice and the love of them had been earnestly taught in the public schools? But, as shown by the article to which we refer and from which we now quote, the mere empty forms of patriotism have been mistaken for the vital substance:

"A few nights ago, at a home dinner party, one gentleman present, having occasion to quote a few lines of 'America,' bungled amazingly, as is usual in such attempts, and had finally to desist through ignorance. Seeking for help among his fellows he found that they, too, knew but little more of the song than the opening lines. Amidst the comments aroused by this not unprecedented incident the host's ten-year-old daughter volunteered to help the big folks out, and did so by correctly reciting all the verses. In response to flattering questions, she said that she had been taught the song at school. With pardonable pride she added, 'I will write it for you, if you like.'

"Of course we liked, and we furnished her with quieting paper and pencil; and then straightway began to forget her in our vigorous volleys of praise anent the whole-heartedness of public-school education. But she again brought herself to notice by shortly presenting us with the following lines, very prettily written, and, as may be seen, intelligently titled and put into verse form:

### "America."

"My country, tissuf the
Sweet land of libaet tea,
Of thee I sing.
Land where my father died,
Land where the Pilgrims pried,
From ev'ry mountain side,
Let fridmen ring.

"My native country the
Land of the noble free,
Thy name I love.
I love thy rots and chills,
Thy woods and temper pills,
My heart with ratcher thrills
Like that above."

Mingled with our amusement was consternation, for this little girl was not only more than ordinarily intelligent, but was also a remarkably good speller, and when she wrote 'rots and chills' she most certainly meant nothing less than the indicated putrefactions and ague.

"In connection with what follows, this point of spelling is an important one to note. Had the child been stupid and backward, her rendering of 'My country' would have been no menace to patriotism, for when a little American bubbles over in hymns to liberty, and means liberty even while writing 'libaet tea,' the moral exaltation is not impaired in the least, but this child knew enough to spell liberty correctly had she wanted to use the word. It behooved us, then, to find out what on earth she did mean; so to that end we questioned her, and in giving her replies, we call attention to their unfailing intelligence and directness, even where she was most at fault.

"What is 'libaet tea'?"
"One of our imports, I guess, from China."
"And what is 'tissuf'?"
"I don't know."
"What do you think it is?"
"Maybe it is to fill out the line. Poetry has something that is called meter; maybe 'tissuf' makes the right meter."
"What do you mean by 'pried'?"
"Why, pry means to come where you are not asked to come." This with a tinge of pity for the ignorance that could ask such a question.

"Then the Pilgrims pried into America?"
"Yes; I think so. Nobody invited them."
"What is 'fridmen'?"
"I don't know. I have thought that over, and can't make any sense to it."
"Why do you love 'rots and chills'?"
"I don't."
"But you say here that you do."
"Oh, I don't say it; it's the poetry says that."

"Well, what does the poetry mean by it?"

"I think it means that we must forgive a great many unpleasant things about our country, and say we like them just out of politeness."

"What are "temper pills"?"

"Pills for temper, don't you think?"

"Did you ever see any such pills?"

"No. Did you? But I'd like to have some."

"Why?"

"No answer to this except a half-shy, half-wicked little smile toward her parents."

"What is "ratcher"?"

"I really don't know."

"Haven't you any idea?"

"Yes, it sounds like a disease."

"How so?"

"It says, "Like that above"—and there are chills a few lines above; and thrills are a sort of chills anyhow. I looked it up in my dictionary."

"This is truly wonderful!' we gasped; and as a reward for the tribute we were invited to attend her school on the morrow, because it would be 'patriotic Friday,' and we could hear them 'speak pieces, sing war songs, salute the flag, and talk patriotic things.'

"Her invitation was too rich in suggestion to resist entirely, and we did visit a school on the 'patriotic' morrow; but deciding that our little friend's school had already spoken for itself, we visited another.

"A class of about fifty clean, bright-eyed, wriggling boys and girls appeared perfectly charmed at being asked to perform their patriotic exercises, and executed them with a vim and thoroughness very creditable to themselves and to their teacher. They sang as many as a dozen patriotic songs; they knew more about Dewey, Sampson, Schley, and Hobson than those heroes know themselves; they recited more historical facts about George Washington than could be beguiled out of an ordinary man at the point of a pistol (one little girl essayed the life of Theodore Roosevelt, but being unable to keep the lightning-rod and electricity and a kite out of her narrative, sat down bathed in tears); they gave quotations in prose and poetry inculcating love of country; and, with especial ardor, they united in a pretty ceremony which they called 'S'lutin' the flag.' The teacher conducted this salute by successive taps of her hand-bell. Tap one, and a curly-haired lassie mounted the platform and unfurled Old Glory; tap two, and the entire class sprang to their feet as one child; tap three, and every hand made a military alute to the accompaniment of the rousing words, 'We give our heads and our hearts to our country. One country, one language, one flag!' At the final word every little right hand was raised, the forefinger pointing to the Stars and Stripes. This statuesque pose was sustained until a last tap relaxed the tense muscles and gave signal for the little ones to drop back into their seats. It brought a choke into the throat to see it.

"But the demon of investigation was abroad and refused to be throttled by sentiment. 'Children, this has been very interesting; so interesting that I want to ask you some questions about it. For instance, you say that you give your heads to your country. Now, will one of you tell me how you do that?'

"Not immediately. Smiles faded, and a pall settled over the community. At last one grimy paw waved tentatively.

"Well?"

"We could cut our heads off and give them that way."

"The gloom deepened when this answer turned out to be amiss, and all thought desperately. Another paw waved. 'What is your answer, little man?'

"We must keep our heads inside of a car window."

"This answer seemed so to satisfy the class that it was cruelty to disabuse them, but it had to be done. Another period of horrified reflection ensued, out of which ventured two guesses:

"I could give my head to my country by letting some one put a bullet into it."

"I give my head to my country by putting my hand to my head in the slut."

"The rejection of these advances created such a weakness among the children that total dissolution was threatened, but a big, handsome boy in the rear saved the day. He was a very big boy, the class dunce probably; one of those chaps who promote themselves in the course of years simply by outgrowing their desks, and who in manhood make fine strides toward success untrammeled by learning. This long, lazy youth * * * had been enjoying the exercises thus far as matters gotten up for his sole entertainment; but now, wishing a change of topic, he put an end to the present foolishness by rising suddenly unbidden and stating, with similing decision, 'We can't give our heads to our country. We only say so.'

"The children settled back in their seats with immense breaths of relief, and we felt to refuse an explanation so patently incontrovertible would be to lower our dignity; we therefore succumbed.

"The heart being a more mysterious organ than the head, which is apt to flourish in memory by being unlawfully tapped by rulers, the second clause in the 's'lute' was passed over by the examiner. So, picking out a dainty damsel, he made on her these easy demands:

"One country"—what country, little maid?"

"America, sir."

"Yes, indeed. And of course you know who discovered America?"

"Yes, sir. Columbia, sir."

"Well, nearly. Columbus—can you tell me his first name?"

"Yes, sir."

"What is it?"

"Hail."

"To offset this slip, the class was instructed to sing the song in mention, and their performance was beyond cavil, so hearty, so musical were their fresh young voices, and so inexhaustible were their memories—verse after verse rippling spontaneously forth, never a book in sight!"

"Do you like to sing patriotic songs?"

"YES SIR!" this in a thundering chorus.

"Better than other songs?"

"YES, SIR!"

"Why?"

"The chorus was silenced. After a pause a bullet-headed, philosophical young Teuton said, with the slowness characteristic of a deep thinker, 'For pecause dey makes de piggest noise.'

"What do you mean by patriotic, by patriotism?" was naturally the next question.

"Putting flags on your house when somebody dies."

"Getting a half holiday and going down town to holler at the soldiers as they go by."

"Patriotism's killin' Spaniards."

"These definitions were given by boys to the disgust of a tiny girl, who jumped up with an indignant pipe of, 'Patriotism is love of your country.'"

"The teacher, who, as might be expected, was not thoroughly enjoying herself, beamed approval at little miss; but the examiner felt an unshaken pride in his own sex, for the reason that the boys' answers published the fact that with them patriotism was synonymous with action."

"What has your country ever done for you that you should love it?" was the next question.

"Oddly enough, this simple query was a poser. A timid girl remarked that her country had given her an *exquisition*—something evidently very horrible, for she promptly put her head down upon her desk and howled with grief, utterly refusing to explain herself."

"The blank, not to say terrified, faces of the youngsters forced the teacher from the subordinate part of listener to controller, and rising majestically from her seat, she commanded, 'Children, mention five advantages you derive from being American citizens!'

"With immediate cordiality they chanted in chorus, 'Liberty, protection at home and abroad, self-government, free schools, and public libraries!'

"We couldn't have touched the right button. Encouraged at such unanimous knowledge, we probed it a little and elicited the facts that liberty meant being out of jail, that you got protection if you could find a policeman, and that self-government was doing as you pleased."

"We now asked our victims if they would write for us a verse or two of their favorite patriotic song, and they made no objection, appearing even to like the employment. * * * Before commenting upon the papers handed in to us, we wish to present a significant statistic or two: The average age of this class was ten years and one month; in their last spelling review they had taken a percentage of eighty-eight; and they were now allowed to write the song of their own choosing. 'The Star-Spangled Banner' seemed to be a general favorite, but certainly not through the merit of being understood; for, from the very beginning, where 'dawn's early light' varied from the harmless shibboleth of 'don selery eye' to the more sinister 'darn surly lie,' every line was garbled and twisted into some startling grotesqueness, the whole ending with an agonized appeal, 'Oh, say does the star spangled Banner get weighed? or the home of the free? or the land of the brave?' A simple line in the second stanza, 'blest with victory and peace,' appeared once 'less the fig trees and peas'; and another time, 'bless with big trees apiece'; while the stanza concluded by asking politely, 'Does the star Spangled Banner yet wade?'"

While it is natural that young children should fall into such mistakes as these more easily than older pupils, this can be no excuse for the system of training that allows such vital errors of thought to go undiscovered and uncorrected. Such training can never inculcate patriotism of a higher sort than that which is synonymous with mere parade and noise or with "killin' Spaniards." This is not the patriotism of the American Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. True patriotism, as embodied in these great documents, is the love of right principles, the love of justice and freedom for all men, the spirit of liberty holding aloft her beacon enlightening the world. True patriotism is respect for all the rights of our neighbors and of all other men in every place. To this cause the American nation was dedicated at its birth, and to it THE SENTINEL OF LIBERTY is devoted to-day.

The principles of this true patriotism are simple, self-evident truths, suited to the comprehension even of children. Let these principles—these self-evident truths set forth in the great Declaration—be taught to the children in the schools, and not some mere mpty forms and ceremonies which make the children neither better nor more intelligent than they were before. We trust this description in this popular magazine will do something to awaken educators to a sense of the useless and dangerous character of the system of patriotic training now in vogue in the public schools, and to inaugurate a much-needed reform in this respect.
