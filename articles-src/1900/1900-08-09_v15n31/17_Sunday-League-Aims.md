THE organ of the most prominent Sunday league in the country says of the organization that it "aims to defend and secure such legislation as will maintain a proper observance of the Lord's day and prevent the strong from oppressing the weak and the immoral from corrupting the young and inexperienced."

Of course, whatever is contrary to the prevailing religious sentiment is "immoral." Thus in Tennessee, for example, Sunday work, be it never so unobtrusive, has been declared by the courts of that State to be "immoral in tendency and of pernicious example." For this reason it is indictable as a nuisance, and in numerous instances earnest Christian men and conscientious observers of the seventh day have been imprisoned for "corrupting the young and inexperienced" by working on Sunday after religiously observing the very day specified in the fourth commandment of the decalogue.
