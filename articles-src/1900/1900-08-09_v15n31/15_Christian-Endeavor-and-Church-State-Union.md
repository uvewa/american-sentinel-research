REFERRING to the Christian Endeavor movement, the Philadelphia Bulletin says: "It had its origin in a small, obscure New England town, and its wonderful growth is added testimony to the wisdom of the principle of separation of church and state which has obtained this Republic." There is indeed abundant evidence in the history of this country of the wisdom of separation of church and state, but it is all lost upon the leaders of the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, for the association is being so manipulated and indoctrinated as to insure its becoming ere long one of the mightiest forces in the whole country in securing practical union of church and state in our land. It may be called only "religion and the state," or "Christain citizenship," or "civic reform," but "what's in a name!" No matter what it may be called it will have all the essential elements of church and state union. It will be a religious despotism, paying a high price for hypocrisy and filling all the popular churches with scheming politicians.
