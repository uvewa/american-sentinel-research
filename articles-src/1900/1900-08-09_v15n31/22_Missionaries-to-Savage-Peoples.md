"It is a great mistake to send missionaries to savage and barbarous peoples," says the American Israelite. "The wisest plan would be to civilize first and Christianize afterwards."

The Israelite is wrong. The mistake is not in sending missionaries to "savage and barbarous peoples," but in so identifying them with earthly powers that the peoples to whom they are sent fail to distinguish between the missionaries and the political power of the countries from which they are sent.
