Writing under date of June 12, a correspondent of the New York *World* says of the Philippines:

"Publicly we are granting amnesty to prisoners. Publicly we are most liberal. Instead of executing our bandits in public plazas in the presence of the people we execute them where they are caught. That keeps that fact quiet—keeps the truth away from the people of the United States—which is considered justifiable because they cannot understand the situation and its necessities. If many actual occurrences were told literally the people would refuse to believe that such barbarities take place under our flag. 'I don't want any more prisoners sent into Manila,' was a verbal order from the governor-general three months ago."
