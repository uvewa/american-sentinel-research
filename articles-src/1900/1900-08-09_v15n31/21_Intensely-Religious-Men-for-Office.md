## INTENSELY RELIGIOUS MEN FOR OFFICE.

"To deter men from voting for Judge Yates for governor of Illinois," say the Michigan Christian Advocate, "it is being circulated that he is 'intensely religious,' 'a total abstainer' and does not smoke.' Wouldn't it be dreadful to vote for such a man? What horror if he were elected! But that's the kind who, by and by, are going to be mayors, governors, legislators and judges."

It is certainly desirable to have good men for office, but should the time ever comes when it is generally understood that men must be "intensely religious" in order to eligible to office, candidates will be just as abundant as they are now, and no better at heart. No greater calamity could possibly happen to either church or state.
