## AN ATLAS

Is too expensive for many of our readers to possess, but no one is too poor to own that map of Asia, which has been mentioned in these columns. With it before you, the scenes of those events now transpiring in China are pictured to the eye as accurately and beautifully as in the most expensive atlas published. Remember the price is only 15 cents, post-paid. If you intend to purchase send in your order *at once*, for our supply is already nearly exhausted, and still the orders are coming as rapidly as ever.

Look at the label on your paper this week, and if your subscription is about to expire send us one dollar and we will extend your subscription to THE SENTINEL a full year and mail the triple map of Asia to you *post free*. Thus all our subscribers may secure this valuable map without cost. But remember how limited our stock is and *don't delay*.
