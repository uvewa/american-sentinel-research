## "RELIGION IN POLITICS IN THE FRENCH REPUBLIC."

THE following quoted paragraphs are from an instructive article by F. C. Conybeare in the July number of the National Review (London) on the subject, "The conspiracy against the French Republic." They are instructive and noteworthy in view of the fact that the same religious orders conspiring against the French Republic are at work in the American Republic with an aim identical with that of their co-religionists in France, however dissimilar their methods. They are further interesting in their portrayal of the religio-political system instituted in that country for controlling the elections for the furtherance of the kingdom of God on earth, in view of the manifest intention of religious organizations in the United States to control elections here for a like purpose. From such facts as these presented by Mr. Conybeare Americans may well take warning:

"In Italy it is the cue of the Vatican to hold aloof, at least in appearance, from politics, and in view of the general election at the beginning of this month of June the usual fiat went forth to all the faithful, in eletti ni elettori. The object of Pio Nono in imposing this rule was to boycott the Italian government, which he regarded, and wished others to regard, as one of usurpation and sacrilege. The result has been to prevent the formation in the Italian chamber of a Catholic party, though it has not hindered the priests from intriguing with the anarchists and fomenting discontent and a spirit of riot in the large industrial centers. In France the Vatican has played of late years a game different in form, but equally selfish in substance. Leo XIII. was persuaded ten years ago that the royalist cause was hopeless. * * * Accordingly the edict went forth to recognize and be faithful to the republic. Not a few honest republicans * * * welcomed this step on the part of the Vatican, because they believed it would lead to a change of spirit among the clergy, who, it was hoped, in becoming loyal to a republic which professes to base itself on the rights of man, would gradually be liberalized. The Vatican, however, had other ends in view. It merely wished to capture the republic and clericalize it, to embrace it in order the better to strangle and suffocate it; to purge it of what the priests everywhere denounce as Freemasonry, which is clerical slang for the spirit of religious tolerance, coupled with respect for civil rights and equality of all before the law, of Jews and Protestants, as well as of Catholics. They would substitute for this spirit the principles of the syllabus. A party of Railles was accordingly formed, consisting of old royalists who have nominally turned republicans, yet retain all the prejudices of the ancient regime. Concurrently, the French clerics redoubled their efforts to possess themselves of the army and of the schools. * * *

"To a much larger extent than anyone would suppose, who has not narrowly scanned the evidence adduced by the public prosecutor, M. Bulot, in their recent trial, the Assumptionist monks have conduced to this general reaction in France. The Pere Picard, the general superior of the congregation, when interrogated, defined its aims to be primarily of religious order, but accessorily political also, so far as politics depend on religion. 'Other questions,' he said, 'only come within our scope incidently, or anyhow as depending from the religious idea, because this latter dominates everything.' The notorious Pere Bailly, editor-in-chief of the many croix which circulate in France, made the same admission, though some of the other defendants * * * had not about them this minimum of honesty, and stoutly denied that their association pursued any but strictly religious aims. * * *

"It is well to draw a picture of the political and electoral activity of these innocent Assumptionist monks, most of whom profess to play a merely religious part. We are able to draw it from records of their own seized in their convents in November of last year by the French police, and read out in their public trial in the course of last January.

"In Italy, as I have said, it is the policy of the Vatican to hold aloof from political elections; but in France the Assumptionists have devised, at the instance of the Pope and his *curia*, an electoral organization which would put to shame the most expert American bosses. Their motto is *Adveniat regnum tuum* ["Thy kingdom come"], their professed aim the triumph on earth of the spirit of the crucified Jesus. Their methods, however, are painfully secular, and for the last twenty years they have merely centered around the polling booth. In 1880 they were dispersed as an unauthorized religious congregation, but in the same year they reformed their ranks, and in 1883 they founded the *Croix*, a daily journal, which has for its frontispiece a large wood-cut of Christ on the cross. There are, besides the Paris edition of the *Croix*, nearly one hundred provincial editions. They are all similar in form and sentiment, and differ chiefly in their local news. * * * To maintain uniformity among all these journals there is, besides the hundred odd provincial committees, a central committee, which edits a secret journal only distributed to members of the local committees. This journal is entitled the *Croix des Comites*. Its task is to keep the local editors in step with each other, unify and guide their policy. The use of the *Croix* in all its editions, as well as of some thirty other daily and weekly journals edited by the congregation, is to 'spread the light'—that is, to disseminate hatred of Jews and Protestants, distrust of modern science, a spirit of grovelling superstition and prostration before the priests, and, above all, a fanatical rejection of all liberal ideas of tolerance, of lay education. Another influential committee exists to translate into political action the spirit thus diffused among the people. * * *

"A document seized last year in a monk's cell at Moulins gives us a summary of the work carried on by the Assumptionists during the years 1897 and 1898 in Paris and the provinces. * * * Letters and circulars were scattered all over France, agitators sent down to stir up people, and permanent politico-religious caucuses formed in all the centers. The aim of these provincial caucuses was the same as in Paris, namely, to co-ordinate for a common effort all the motley groups, united by no bond save a common hatred of well-ordered liberty. * * * To use M. Laya's phrase, all the 'honest groups' have been united and their electoral program is defined to be the same as that of the *Croix*. It is the so-called program of Christian schools of the propaganda of the faith of St. Francois de Sales. It is the sum of all 'good' works promoted and sustained by Christian generosity for the glory of God, for the welfare of souls, and the salvation of the *Patrie*. It is, in short, applied Catholicism. Wherever there is voting these caucuses are to work for the return of 'good' Catholics. No election is beyond their scope, municipal, cantonal, legislative, presidential, and even elections of chambers of commerce, and of agriculture—all alike are to be watched and provided for. * * *

"The duties of the Assumptionist caucus are thus defined: It shall occupy itself with revision of the register of voters, shall study diligently the body of electors, their wants, and the currents of opinion which stir them. With every elector its members must be personally acquainted, so as to set him in one of the three classes, viz., good, bad, or doubtful. The 'good' electors must be reinforced, marshaled in battalions, encouraged to become apostles of the good cause. The doubtful ones and waverers must be won over. The bad ones had better be left alone, at least to begin with.

"Among the 'good', propagandism is to take the form of lectures, pamphlets, processions, and, when an election is at hand, of 'crusades of prayer.' The lists of candidates must be prepared, handbills printed and distributed. Every polling-booth must be watched, frauds and acts of personation followed up and punished by annulation of the elections at which they were employed; those polls, however, where by use of such means the vote of the faithful wins, must be held against the indictments of the enemy. * * * Silently and without flagging the committee of 'justice-equality' is to pursue in all elections the work so eminently desired by Leo XIII. and so necessary to France."
