God is the only master of conscience.

ONLY the individual can truly acknowledge God

ONLY false religions ever ask any favors from the state.

Truth does not ask or need the assistance of force in fighting its battles.

A person may be forced into the way of sin, but he cannot possibly be forced into the path of righteousness.

No man can answer for another at the bar of God, therefore no man has any right to dictate to another concerning his duty toward God.

THE gospel forces no person to do what he knows is right, and much less should any person be forced to do what some one else thinks is right.

HE who will not keep the Sabbath in obedience to the command of God will find no blessing in Sabbath observance at the command of the state.

The state cannot undertake to "protect" religion without denying the rights of that portion of its citizens which are opposed to the religion favored by the government.

THE very fact that an individual wants to force other people to conform to his standard of righteousness is conclusive proof that his standard is not the right one.

BECAUSE each religion is necessarily intolerant of every other religion in the land, it follows that the state cannot be religious without giving effect to religious intolerance by civil pains and penalties.
