# THE ONTARIO SUNDAY LAW.

Some items concerning the hearing that was given to the argument on the constitutionality of this law in Osgood Hall, Toronto, appeared recently in THE SENTINEL. A few more are added here.

It has been a very favorite argument of Sunday-law advocates that it was a very benevolent act toward the working man for the law to compel corporations, manufactories, etc., to cease from work on Sunday. This argument was naturally used at this hearing. The speaker said: The law says to the laboring man, If the corporation compels you to labor on Sunday we will fine that corporation. Then, pausing a little, he continued: Yes, and it says to him, We will fine you, too. How it would bring so much relief to the mind of the poor mechanic to be assured that the government would fine him if he were found working on Sunday is not very easy to discover. The idea is this: To make a good appearance before the people Sunday-law advocates pose as benefactors to the laboring classes in demanding that corporations and employees shall be prohibited from keeping men at work on Sunday. Very well, why not stop with that philanthropic proposal? Ah, that will not meet the desired end at all. Suppose the poor laboring man finds it desirable or necessary to do some work of his own on Sunday, who is oppressing him then? No one. Why not let him alone then? That will not do. His would-be benefactors must come around now and oppress him for using his own God-given right and volition in working on the day just as surely as the corporations would oppress him for not working on that day. Why fine the laboring man in such a case? The only reply that can be given is: Because Sunday is a religious institution which it is proposed to protect by civil law. Hence the governmet must say to the laboring man: "Yes, and we will fine you, too." The demands of Sunday would not be met at all without that. It was even made to appear that the law is at present more strict toward the laboring man than toward the corporation, for corporations could go ahead in certain lines of work without being interfered with, but those in their employ could be made to pay a fine. Upon this statement being made the chief justice remarked: "If the master is not prohibited why shoud the servant be?" That is certainly a point well taken. It will do to ponder over for time to come. Who is the Master or Lord of the Sabbath any way? Christ announced himself to be such. Was he ever prohibited from work on the first day of the week? Indeed not. That was the very day on which he began his work 6,000 years ago, and he has never given us an example of resting on that day to the present time. Then, if the Master himself was not prohibited from work on the first day of the week, why should his servants be? And if the Master himself never prohibited his servants from laboring on that day, then why should his representatives propose to usurp the authority to prohibit his servants from working on that day?

Some of the peculiarities of Sunday laws were brought out in the explanation of the lawyers that the law, in prohibiting a man from following his "ordinary calling" on Sunday, did not prevent his working at what was not his ordinary calling. For instance, the farmer might make a pair of boots on that day if he were making them for himself and not to sell. The carpenter might shoe a horse, the merchant might split rails, etc., providing all was being done for the person himself and not for trade or traffic. It is very doubtful if these arguments would hold good in an actual case of Sunday prosecution, but they go to show the caprice upon which Sunday laws and all religious laws enacted by civil government rest. What difference could it make with society whether a man were working for himself at his usual occupation or in some other way on the first day of the week?

An item in regard to the alleged infallibility of supreme court decisions was brought to light in the reference made by one of the speakers to the fact that on a certain occasion the supreme court gave two adverse decisions in one day. The court decided a certain matter, and that same day a change was made by placing a new member on the bench, whose opinion on the question at issue was opposite to that of the judge whose place he took, and so, after taking his seat, the matter was brought up again, and his opinion made the majority of the court of the opposite opinion from what it was before, and so a decision directly opposed to the one already given was rendered the same day. The question of loyalty to supreme court decisions has been quite a live issue in political circles at times. This transaction shows the judges to be but men, and when a question of right and wrong comes up our criterion should be the word of God rather than that of man "We ought to obey God rather than men," Acts 5:29. The question at issue on the occasion mentioned, it seems, was that of local option.
