FOUR "Zionist" elders who went from this city to Mansfield, Ohio, to hold services last Sunday were met at the train by "officers of the law" and were not allowed to leave the cars. Owing to the action of the authorities they were unable to reach Mansfield; and thus by overriding law and order the peace was preserved.
