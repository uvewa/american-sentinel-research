In addition to the other troubles which are distracting the great world powers, the German Empire is threatened with dissolution. Prince Ludwig, son of the prince-regent, and likely soon to become king of Bavaria, has again expressed his opposition to the empire.

"Germany," says the Deutsche Tages-Zeitung, "is a union of states, it will always remain so, and the empir would fall to pieces if the rights and liberties of the states were interfered with."

Prince Ludwig is said to be displeased because the emperor, in announcing the presence of the torpedo flotilla upon the Rhine, spoke of it as "my torpedo division."

Nor is Prince Ludwig alone in this feeling. The Strassburger Post, voicing the feeling of Alsace as one of the component parts of the empire, says:

"The navy is the empire's navy, not the emperor's. Even the expression Seiner Majestat schiff (His Majesty's ships) is not correct. The emperor's advisers should see to it that the correct forms of speech are not infringed. On the other hand, the Bavarians have no right to complain, for they are specially petted by Prussia in the matter of their particularist pride."

Other papers express similar views, while others of course favor the maintenance of the empire. The Independence Belge, of Brussels, thinks disintegration impossible. The French press of course encourages the discontent.
