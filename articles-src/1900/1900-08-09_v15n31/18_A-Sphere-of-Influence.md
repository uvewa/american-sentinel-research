## A "SPHERE OF INFLUENCE."

In reading of the relation of the European powers to the Chinese Empire we observe frequent mention of spheres claimed by these nations. Probably all the readers of THE SENTINEL know that "sphere" used in this connection applies to territory claimed by the governments of Europe as their field of action in China. But who can locate these spheres? Our colored map of Asia indicates them plainly. This is only one item of information conveyed by these maps, but this one alone is worth all the map will cost you. See our offer, page 496.
