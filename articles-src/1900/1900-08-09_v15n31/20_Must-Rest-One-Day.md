## MUST REST ONE DAY.

"We will not persecute those who choose to observe the seventh day for rest," says Rev. Joseph Cook in a pamphlet treating on "new defenses of the Lord's day." "They may work on Sunday, as the law of Massachusetts allows them to do, without being arrested, provided they can show that they rest one day in seven."

All persons who cannot show that they rest one day in seven will therefore, in the opinion of the Rev. Mr. Cook, be proper subjects for persecution.

The person who works on Sunday and yet rests one day in seven, does so at the dictates of conscience. Only his religion would prompt him to rest on a day when all people around him are at work. He escapes persecution therefore because of his religion. He is required to be religious, under the penalty of the law demanding Sunday rest. It is commonly supposed that in this country everybody is free to profess what religion he may choose, or none at all, but it is plain that so far as the influence of Rev. Joseph Cook extends, a person will be liable to persecution unless he is religious enough to keep Sunday or some other day of the week.

In the light of this fact, it is evident that the Sunday law is a religious law, and not merely a civil regulation, as is frequently claimed for it. For as applied to those who rest on some other day than Sunday, no one will deny that the law operates purely on religious grounds. Only religion could move an individual to incur the disadvantage of being at variance with all society around him in the matter of Sabbath observance; and a law which requires an individual to be religious in order to be exempt from its penalties, must be a religious law.

If the Rev. Mr. Cook spoke only for himself in his implied threat of persecution for such as would not come under his exemption, the case would not be so bad; but he speaks as the representative of numerous and powerful organizations who look up to him as a leader in the work they have undertaken of reforming society and politics. It is plain that the success of their plans, under the guidance of the spirit breathed forth in this utterance of the Rev. Mr. Cook, will bring a revival of intolerance and religious persecution. Such a calamity is seriously threatened, as many indications show, and the American people should spare no pains to avert it.
