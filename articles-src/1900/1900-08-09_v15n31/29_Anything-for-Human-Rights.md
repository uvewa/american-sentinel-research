"Any thing for human rights," said Charles Sumner, "is constitutional. No learning in books, no skill acquired in courts, no sharpness of forensic dialect, no cutting and splitting hairs, can impair the vigor thereof. This is the supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."

And this is true. Not the Constitution of the United States, but the Declaration of Independence is the fundamental law of the land; and back of that even, and higher than that, are the everlasting principles, of which the Declaration is only the verbal expression.

But since the days of Sumner a change has taken place. The Constitution is by many disregarded; the Declaration of Independence is scoffed at; the principles which it enunciates are trampled into the dust; and law, both constitutional and statutory, is held to be for the protection, not of men, but of things.
