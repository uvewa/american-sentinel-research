Among the reasons assigned for the development of the "Boxer" uprising which is proving so terrible in China, is the statement that railways were being projected by Europeans in some thickly-settled parts of the country in complete disregard of the feelings and natural rights and established customs of the natives. An injudicious policy on the part of European railway builders, in treating the people of the country as unworthy of serious consideration, would naturally rouse the feelings of the latter to a high pitch. An illustration upon this point is given by Mr. D. L. Sheffield, in the July *Forum*, as follows:

"The good fortune of a [Chinese] family is vitally related to the proper location of the family tomb; and to propitious external conditions. A wealthy China-man in extreme distress of mind once called upon the writer, prostrating himself to offer his supplications, explaining that the survey for the road of the "firewheel cart" passed near the tombs of his ancestors, and that the rumbling and screaming of the carts would disturb their slumbers, and so bring misfortune on the living. Fortunately his mind was set at ease, as the line of the road was changed before construction."
