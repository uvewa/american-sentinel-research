A call for a "national liberty congress" has been issued by the American Anti-Imperialist League, to meet in Indianapolis August 15. The call states that the congress "is to be composed only of those who deny the power of Congress and the President to rule vast territories and millions of men outside and in disregard of the Constitution."
