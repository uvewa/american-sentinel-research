## IMPERIALISM AN EVIL PRINCIPLE.

Imperialism is not simply a policy; it is a principle. Nor is it confined to any one county. The spirit of Imperialism is world-wide; and just now it is experiencing a wonderful revival. Under the heading, "Imperial Protestantism," the English Churchman and St. James Chronicle (London), says:

"The spirit of Imperialism which, since the celebration of the Victorian Jubilee, has actuated almost all departments of English corporate life—in a degree altogether unprecedented—is now unmistakably asserting itself in association with the maintenance of the nation's religion—the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law.' The purity of the faith and worship of the people is a constitutional consideration, for which paramountcy must be claimed, inasmuch as it lies at the foundation of all our Imperial institutions, it inspires and regulates our national politics, and it insures righteousness and justice among all classes of the subjects of the Crown, at home and abroad. Decay in the allegiance of the nation to that Scriptural faith with which the fabulous growth of the British Empire for the past three and a half centuries has been intimately connected, would be the certain harbinger of disaster and overthrow. On the other hand, a deep-seated determination on the part of the people to cleanse the national church, and to reform its practical abuses, furnishes an augury pregnant with hope and promise for the Empire."

Imperialism is to save the English Church! The Church is part and parcel of the Empire and must be preserved for the sake of the Empire! This differs from the Papal view only in this that the Papacy puts the church first. The truth separates them entirely and leaves each to work out its own salvation independent of the other.
