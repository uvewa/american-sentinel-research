ONLY a few days after the assassination of King Humbert, of Italy, an attempt was made in Paris upon the life of the Shah of Persia. Bressi, the murderer of Humbert, has declared that "it will be the Czar's turn next." It is now believed that there is a far-reaching plot "to assassinate all the rulers who have rigorously tried to stamp out anarchism."
