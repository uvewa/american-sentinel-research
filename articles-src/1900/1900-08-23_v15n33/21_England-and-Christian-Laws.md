REV. CHARLES M. SHELDON, the gentleman who wrote "In His Steps," or "What Would Jesus Do?" and who ran the Topeka Capital for one week as he thought Jesus would have done, visited England and Scotland recently and was much alarmed at some things he saw.

"If England goes to destruction in the next century," says Mr. Sheldon, "it will not be because of outside war or dangers from other nations, but because she has drunk herself into destruction."

But let us see; is not England a "Christian" nation with "Christian" laws, and especially a strict Sunday law rigidly enforced? The query that naturally arises in view of what Mr. Sheldon saw is this: If governmental recognition of the Creator, and the legal enforcement of Sunday does no better than this for England, will like measures do any more for the United States?
