A Freethought journal complains that at a meeting of the Young Men's Progressive League, a liberal organization, on July 3, one of the speakers, Mr. George Ohnstein, was arrested. "The league at once issued a circular setting forth the facts of the matter, and 50,000 copies were circulated. On Mr. Ohnstein being put upon trial, July 13, the case was dismissed, and that night the accused addressed a large audience without molestation. The technical charge was obstructing the streets, but as street preaching is permitted in Cincinnati the members of the league are satisfied that this was only a pretext for suppressing free speech."

Such occurrences do not benefit anybody. They most certainly injure the cause of Christianity.
