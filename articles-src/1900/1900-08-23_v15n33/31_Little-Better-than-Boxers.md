## LITTLE BETTER THAN "BOXERS."

We can hardly blame the Boxer if he scouts the professedly philanthropic motives of the civilized Powers. We can plainly see that he may shout "tu quoque" at the Caucasian and proceed to kill every white man in sight, justifying himself by the Caucasian's own acts.

When the Russians, like so many wild beasts, scoured the streets of Tien-Tsin, stabbing, shooting, bayoneting and slashing old men, women and infants in arms they destroyed any confidence which may have lingered in the minds of the neutral Chinese. Hereafter when the allied Powers make professions of humanity and philanthropy the Chinese will point to the massacre of Tien-Tsin and that argument will silence all pretensions. It is unanswerable.

Nor will it do to make the Russian contingent a scapegoat—to allege that the Muscovites are more bloodthirsty than other white men. It is but a few days since the German Emperor declared that no quarter should be given the Chinese—declared it in cold blood and without the impelling excitement of a battle.

If civilized rulers profess such sentiments what is to be expected of soldiers in the field? Are they likely, once the animal is aroused, to display any less savage ferocity than the Russians? Will not the Tien-Tsin episode be repeated by other troops if the opportunity arises?

Civilization is only skin deep and the veneer comes off very quickly when civilized man engages in war. Opposition enrages him. The sight of blood infuriates him. Met with obstinate resistance, he celebrates his victory, as the Russians did, by massacre and loot. He reverts to the animal with a facility which is at once surprising and terrifying.

The Russians did what might have been done by the troops of any other nationality if they were given license. Not given it, they are likely to take it. There is little difference among men once they smell blood.—Chicago Chronicle.
