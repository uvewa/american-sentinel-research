## BRYAN ON THE LOVE OF MONEY.

In a recent newspaper article Colonel Bryan quotes this resolution adopted last year by the General Synod of the Reformed Church, at Tiffin, Ohio:

"The danger to be apprehended from certain agencies, which are slowly but surely revolutionizing the entire social fabric by the absorption of the wealth of the country in the hands of a few, the steady enlargement of the poor classes of people and the gradual diminution of a prosperous and happy middle class, the hope of every thriving State; the rapid increase and intensification of all those social and industrial agencies which tend to make human life a burden of despair to the many and a material paradise to the few—all these things cannot but exert a baleful influence upon and prove a constant hindrance to the progress of the kingdom of Christ upon earth."

Colonel Bryan's comment upon the resolution is that it "might with propriety have concluded with the familiar quotation from Timothy: 'But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which, while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.'"

Would not James 5:1-9, R. V., have been still more appropriate? It reads thus:

"Go to now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath. Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter. * * * Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged; behold, the Judge standeth before the doors."
