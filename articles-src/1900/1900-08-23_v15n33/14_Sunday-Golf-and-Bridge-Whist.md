"SUNDAY golf," remarks the Springfield Republican, "and the favorite diversion among the summer colony of bridge whist for stakes, were denounced, and the fashionable folk who play them were severely arraigned by Rev. Dr. Braddin Hamilton, of New York, in his sermon at All Saints' chapel in Newport" on a recent Sunday. It would seem from the Republican's report that the chief count in the Doctor's indictment of the game was that it keeps people from church. The speaker said:

"Show the people of this country that the boastful, vulgar, brainless spendthrift is not the ideal citizen of this country. There are a good many people who might be excused if they spend Sunday in recreation and amusements, but the people of Newport have no such excuse, and the young man or young woman who will desert church on Sunday morning and go and play golf have very little respect for themselves and far less for the community which they are leading in the wrong."

Mr. Hamilton seems to feel about Sunday golf much as the bishops did in the fourth century about the circus. Then the people resorted to the circus and allowed the hour of worship to go by unheeded. Now the people read the Sunday papers, play golf, etc. Of course this is bad, but the remedy generally proposed, namely, more rigid Sunday laws and stricter enforcement of such laws, will not work any better now than it did then.
