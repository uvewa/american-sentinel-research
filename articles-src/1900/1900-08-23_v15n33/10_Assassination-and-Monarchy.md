The man who shot King Humbert, of Italy, is reported to have said, "I did not shoot Humbert; I killed the King."

But this is just what he did not do. The instant Humbert was dead another became King by the law of succession. Humbert died but the King lived. And Bressi's foolish and wicked act only riveted the fetters of monarchy the more firmly upon the wrists of Italy. Assassination may possibly "temper despotism," but it never made any people free. A Brutus may kill a Cæsar, but an Antony stands ready to take his place.

The true Christian never mistakes the voice of Cæsar for that of the Good Shepherd.
