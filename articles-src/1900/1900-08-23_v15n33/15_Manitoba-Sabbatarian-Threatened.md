A SABBATARIAN at Oak River, Manitoba, recently received through the mails a threatening letter warning him to cease "distributing" his "most damnable doctrine."

This "most damnable doctrine" is the doctrine that Sunday is not the Sabbath, and that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."

That which makes this doctrine so "damnable" is the fact that those who hold and teach it can prove it by so many plain texts of Scripture.

Doubtless if the writer of the letter referred to had been able to produce a "thus saith the Lord" for his belief and practice touching a weekly day of rest, instead of writing an anonymous letter he would have gone to the Sabbatarian brother, would have asked him to open his Bible, and then and there he would have shown him the text which says that the seventh day has ceased to be the Sabbath and that the first day has now taken its place.

But conscious of his weakness, of his inability to meet the arguments of the Sabbatarian, he attempts to frighten him into silence by covert threats of personal violence. Such methods are unworthy of a man, to say nothing of a Christian.
