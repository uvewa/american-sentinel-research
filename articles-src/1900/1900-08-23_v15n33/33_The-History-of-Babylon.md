## THE HISTORY OF BABYLON.

"We may soon be in a position," remarks the *Literary Digest*, "to study the lost history of Babylon as we can now study that of Greece and Rome. In a recent lecture at the Industrial Art Museum at Berlin, Professor Delitzch, the celebrated Orientalist and explorer, stated his hope, says Biblia (June), 'that in a short time it will be possible to reconstitute the history of Babylon from its monuments. Contemporary inscriptions on monuments show that the excavators are unearthing the relics of a prehistoric epoch antecedent to the period to which we assign Abraham. The list of kings will furnish an excellent foundation for the historical reconstruction of the epoch.'

"This has been made possible by the discoveries of the expedition sent out by the German Oriental Society under the direction of Koldewey. Nebuchadnezzar's favorite temple has already been explored, and the excavators are now attacking 'the edifice proper in which Cyrus signed the edict authorizing the return of the Jews to their own land, and in which Alexander died.'"
