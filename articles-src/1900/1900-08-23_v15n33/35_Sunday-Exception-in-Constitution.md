The claim that the national Constitution recognizes Sunday by the words "Sundays excepted," where it provides that the President shall have ten days in which to return bills passed by Congress, is a claim that is made much of, but nevertheless it amounts to nothing. The Constitution does not recognize Sunday. It does not recognize the day, it recognizes a right—the right of the President to abstain from business on the day he believes in and observes as sacred. The Constitution says that ten days shall be allotted the President to consider a bill that comes to him from Congress for his signature or veto before such bill shall become a law of its own force. Unless Sundays were excepted from these ten days, either the President would be obliged to work as usual on Sunday or a less number of days would be allotted to the consideration of the bill. This is why the Constitution contains the words in question. The object of the phrase is to secure ten days for the consideration of bills by the President without obliging him to work on Sunday. It recognizes his right to observe the day, but does not recognize the day itself at all any more than legislation exempting the Turkish ambassador from official business on Friday would be a recognition of that day in the character claimed for it by Mohammedans. The Constitution is wholly a secular document.
