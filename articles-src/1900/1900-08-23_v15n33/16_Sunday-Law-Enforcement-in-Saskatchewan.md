OUR readers will remember that several weeks ago mention was made in these columns of the threatened religious persecution in Sas Katchewan, Canada. A woman, who is a Sabbatarian, whose husband was away from home, did some work on a wheat-field fence on Sunday. A few days later her husband, having returned home, was visited by a member of the Dominion police force, who gave him a copy of the Sunday law, intimating that any further breach of the law would probably result unpleasantly, even if the offender was a woman.

By inquiry we have learned that this woman thus threatened by the majesty of a religious law, lives in a rural community seventy-five miles from a railroad. It is a new settlement and while the people are nearly all church members, they are far from being strict Sunday-keepers. Many of them spend the day "rounding up" their cattle, etc. Practically everybody does more or less work on Sunday. Why then was this one woman singled out and warned to cease Sunday work? Simply because her Sunday work, following as it does the religious observance of the seventh day, emphasizes her dissent from the prevailing religion of the neighborhood. When she rests on Saturday, the seventh day of the week, and works on Sunday, the first day of the week, she says thereby, "The seventh day is the Sabbath, and Sunday is only one of the six working days." Her faithfulness to her faith is a rebuke to others, even though she says not a word.

It is only fair, however, to say that most of the people in the community referred to, are not in sympathy with the idea of singling out this lone Sabbatarian upon whom to visit the penalty of the Sunday law. They are too fair-minded for that sort of thing. But so long as the law remains any one who desires to do so may set it in operation. As Thomas Jefferson said of religious laws in this country, "A single zealot may commence persecution and better men be his victims."
