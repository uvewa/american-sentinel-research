SUNDAY afternoon, July 29, Rev. Thomas Marshall, field secretary of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions and a Chinese missionary of wide experience and more than national fame, delivered an address before the Moody Bible Institute in this city, in which he charged that European nations, especially England, Germany and France, are responsible for all the trouble typified in the national uprising against foreigners in China. "The missionaries are not to blame," he asserted, "at least not the American missionaries. The 'robber' nations of Europe, when caught in the act of despoiling the Chinese of their territory and desecrating the Chinese graves by running railroads through them, are trying to make scapegoats of the innocent missionaries and are using the Christian evangelizing forces for political and selfish ends." He ended by declaring that when the European "land grabbers" are driven out of China the Chinese may be in a mood to listen to the Christian gospel.

"Who are the Boxers?" said Mr. Marshall. "They are simply the patriots of China. They are the same kind of patriots that grand old Andrew Jackson was—that the American hosts who followed Jackson to repel foreign invasion proved themselves to be. Suppose the French government should come and take New Orleans, the English New York and Washington and the Germans Boston. What would we see? Why, the American cowboy would leave his herds on the plains, the farmer would leave his plow and the students of this Bible institute would leave their missionary labors, and all would take up arms to drive the invaders and the robbers from our shores."
