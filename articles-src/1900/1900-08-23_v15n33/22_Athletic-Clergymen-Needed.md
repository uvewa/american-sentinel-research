A RECENT London dispatch says that "only athletic clergymen need apply for pastorates in rural English districts. One country curate has received his order of removal, not because of any objection to his theology, but because he is a poor cricket player. The vicar declared: 'What the parish needs is a good, fast bowler, with a break from the off.'

"The vicar evidently considers that the doctrine expounded by a clergyman capable of winning the county championship is irresistible to the average village lad."
