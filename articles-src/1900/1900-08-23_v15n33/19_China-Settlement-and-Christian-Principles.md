The Independent (N. Y.) says that the partition of Chinese territory by Russia, Germany and France "is more than we can agree to." The German Emperor has been talking of revenge; but, says, the Independent, "Christian principle should control the relation between nations as well as individuals; and the language of the German Emperor has not been Christian." "In a campaign of this sort [to avenge the murder of the German envoy] we can take no part." "It is not our desire to break up the Chinese Empire; we only wish to make it safe for Americans to live and pursue their callings in that country."

Unfortunately for this mild program, other nations than the United States must be consulted in the settlement of the Chinese question. The United States, we are told, would like to withdraw and leave only an "open door" for trade, but unfortunately, Russia and Germany intend to remain and occupy the chief Chinese centers, and "this is more than we can agree to." Yet "it would be a very serious task to try to defend China against Germany and France; almost an impossible one, even for Great Britain, Japan, and the United States, if Russia should join Germany and France. This," the Independent adds, "will call for a great congress of the Powers, backed by all the moral force which Christianity and the principles enunciated at The Hague can offer."

Yes; it will call for all this, and a good deal more; for, looking back from this date at The Hague congress which was to do so much for peace through the "moral force" of Christian principles, it is certainly a very optimistic, not to say credulous, person who would have any confidence in such a "backing" to restrain two powerful nations bent on enriching themselves by the seizure of territory. It will call for some far more material backing than the mere enunciation of principles by the remaining Powers.

The United States may have gone into China with the best of intentions, but unfortunately good intentions will play very little part in deciding the question of withdrawal. It is very desirable to have an "open door" into China, but unfortunately Russia and Germany persist in slamming the door shut. What is the United States to do in the face of such bad conduct from her Asiatic neighbors? If the integrity of China is not to be maintained, and the territory of the empire must needs be partitioned, must not this country have a hand in the distribution of the "slices"? And will not that be justifiable under the circumstances? Thus leads the pathway to empire.
