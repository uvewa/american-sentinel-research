## SUNDAY OBSERVANCE IN PARIS.

Despite the Exposition, or rather, as some Parisians believe, because of it, the movement against keeping shops open on Sunday in Paris has recently gained considerable encouragement, writes a correspondent in the New York Times. A few weeks ago M. Millerand, minister of commerce, and M. Mougeot, under secretary of state for postal and telegraph matters, issued a circular inviting an expression of opinion from the chambers of commerce as to the advisability of closing post offices and stopping the work of postal employees at noon on Sundays, provided that the telegraph offices always remained open, and that arrangements were made for the sale of stamps and postal cards at telegraph counters. The chambers of commerce strongly supported the proposal of the ministers, and adopted a resolution in favor of the entire plan. The Times correspondent thinks the proposed arrangement will soon be put into execution, thus stopping the afternoon deliveries. "The scheme finds favor among business houses generally, as they consider that the present system is no longer justified by the requirements of business, and when once the rule has been put into force, those stores which still keep open on Sundays will be forced to close." Those familiar with Paris know that most of the houses of any importance already close on Sundays, and among the smaller tradespeople even the grocers close at noon. The postal service, however, has held out until the present time, closing at four in the afternoon.—The Outlook.
