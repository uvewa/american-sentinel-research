"The United States is [are] the great armed neutral of the world," says Senator Davis, of Minnesota. "It will have peace, not as the boon of a suppliant non-combatant, but as the right of a peace-loving, armored, puissant nation whose rights are secured by its manifest ability to cause other nations to respect them."

This is only another way of saying that this nation will have peace even if it has to fight for it, and this position is one that always calls for plenty of fighting.
