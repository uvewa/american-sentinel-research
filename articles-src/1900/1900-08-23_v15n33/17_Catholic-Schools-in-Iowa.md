A correspondent of the *Sabbath Recorder*, writing from Garvin, Ia., says of the growth of the papacy in that section:

"Under the supervision of an archbishop, many, many country schools in Jackson and Dubuque counties have been put into the hands of Rome, and the Roman Catholic religion is now a part of the school course."

And these schools, remember, are public schools. Do such incidents, reader, furnish you any food for thought?
