When a cat hates a dog the cat is excusable. In the first place, a cat can't think accurately, and in the second place, it has seen dogs tear up kittens.

But when a Jew hates a Christian, when a Christian hates a Jew, when a Protestant hates a Catholic or a Catholic hates a Protestant, the one that does the hating is sure to be a dull, stupid kind of a human being.—Chicago American.
