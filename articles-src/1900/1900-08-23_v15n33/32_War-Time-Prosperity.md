## WAR-TIME "PROSPERITY."

It is said that war makes money plentiful. Temporarily, just as it does for a man who owns a fine house and slaps a mortgage on it. He can revel in the luxuries for a season, but when the time to pay it, plus interest, rolls along—well, that's different.

Fool is he who imagines that the wanton and enormous destruction of property and young men tends to enrich the world. Reason repudiates the frightful fallacy.—Troy (N. Y.) Times.
