## VANDALISM IN CHINA.

In his speech at the Jewish Chautauqua, Governor Roosevelt insisted strongly on the right of every man to worship according to his conscience, and that right being respected. Now, the Chinese worship their ancestors, and we laugh at their superstition. The English in China are not content with laughing; they insult. To their constant outrages against Chinese sentiment are largely due the Boxer troubles. Listen to this confession from Black and White:*

"It is probably the knowledge of this fact" [ancestor worship] "that led 'the foreign devil' to build his railways across graveyards in the Celestial Empire. Knowing that a strong prejudice already existed against the introduction of the Iron Horse, it was but natural, and in characteristic good taste, that the European should choose the shortest cut into the heart of the yellow man, with the result, among others, that certain gentlemen rejoicing in the name of 'Boxers' are to-day exceedingly anxious to offer the retort courteous and a-ching some of our countrymen. Again, some zealous 'sportsmen' lately enjoyed themselves immensely at Singapore by playing a local golf match over a Chinese graveyard. 'The links were very sporty, the tombs serving for bunkers,' writes one of the players. 'The tombs are being slowly hacked to pieces by the wild efforts of the players to get the balls out of the crevices in the bricks.'"

The Vandals, too, must have been civilized people.
