"In a political sense Christendom is to-day the world," says H. K. Carroll, D. D., L. L. D., in the *Homiletic Review*. "If we take a map of the globe and mark upon it the possessions and spheres of influence of the Christian Powers there will be little or nothing left to the independent control of non-Christian governments. The islands of the sea are all appropriated. The Western Continent is wholly under Christian rule."

CHRISTIANITY should never be confounded with civilization, as is done in these words of Dr. Carroll. If we mark upon this map of the globe the amount of territory that has been stolen by the "Christian" Powers, that has been appropriated by them in deliberate violation of the fundamental precepts of Christianity, we shall see that the earth is still far from being under Christian control. Civilization is in itself but a thin veneer over savagery. Christianity is a change from the savage nature to the divine nature. There are Christian "savages" and savage "Christians," and the former are infinitely preferable to the latter. Christianity blesses the inferior races of mankind, but mere civilization scorches and blasts them. This is the testimony of all experience. The weaker races of the earth can not copy the white man's virtues and can not resist the white man's vices. Without Christianity civilization only brings to the savage other unclean spirits to keep company with his own, and his last state is worse than the first. The wickedest places of the earth are not in heathen territory, but in so-called Christian lands.

Politically, Christianity is not represented on the earth at all.
