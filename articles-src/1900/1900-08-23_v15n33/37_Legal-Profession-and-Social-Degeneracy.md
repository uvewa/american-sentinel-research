The Boston Herald calls attention to the extraordinary financial successes of the legal profession of the day in corporation practice, and then notes the fact mentioned by Tacitus, that the Roman lawyers in many cases acquired great fortunes at a time when the methods by which they were secured "were slowly but surely bringing about the degeneracy of society, the paralyzation of industry, the complete loss of political liberty and the partial extinguishment of civilization." The inference is not far to seek.
