A PROMINENT London paper suggests the desecration of the graves of the ancestors of the imperial family at Peking, as a wholesome lesson in civilization. Should this not be sufficient to impress the Orientals with the superiority of Western manners, probably they could be fully convinced by shooting a few score of poor wretches from the cannon's mouth, as was done in India half a century ago. Let the reputation of the great "Christian nations" be maintained at all hazards.
