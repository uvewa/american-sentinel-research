BISHOP CRANSTON is reported as saying: "A very rich Chinaman, whose business relations with foreigners are valuable and extensive, said to one of them in the frankness of friendly conversation: 'I am worth to-day ten millions, but I would give my fortune gladly to see China rid of every foreigner and the country back where it was before your people came. You have brought insatiable ambitions, and the discontent and unrest which led you to leave your own country for ours. Our people were happy in their patriarchal government and simple life. You foreigners are breaking down the old order and making them as unhappy as yourselves. Even your women are never satisfied with their condition.'"
