THE Social Forum for August has a paper on "The State and the Children." The first third of the article abounds in references to the Scriptures, especially to the teachings of our Saviour. "With such a lesson from Christ," says the Forum, "it is not hard to see the duty of the state to the child. The child's first teachers and guardians, especially in infancy, are its parents, but the state must see that no child be neglected, that all have proper care and training and instruction." And again: "Compulsory education it is the duty of the state to enforce."

Of course, since the Social Forum goes to the teachings of Christ to learn the duty of the state to the children, it must include his teachings in "the proper" "training and instruction" that "it is the duty of the state to enforce." The Social Forum is certainly entitled to a front seat at all so-called National Reform functions.
