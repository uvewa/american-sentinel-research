## SOME ERRORS OF "APPLIED CHRISTIANITY."

The following quotations are taken from an article on "Religion and Politics," which appears on the editorial page of a leading Chicago daily (the Chicago American, Sunday edition):

"I see nothing strange or unreasonable about the proposal to make the mind of Christ the mind of our legislation and organizations. * * * It does not seem mystical to me to believe that the mind of Christ shall become the creative spirit of political action and express itself in the statutes of the state."

"Not only must government become Christian, but Christianity must become political. Christianity needs the state for its realization as much as the state needs Christianity for its redemption and perfection. There can be no adequate actualization of Christianity in the world except it actualize itself in the political life of the nation. The people can never be wholly Christian until the state becomes the organized Christianity of the people. The Christian state will be the political realization of Christ's quality of right."

These are the utterances of Rev. George D. Herron, D. D., lately professor of "applied Christianity" in Iowa State College. As an exponent of this subject Prof. Herron has not been taken very seriously thus far by the American people, but it would be a mistake to suppose that his ideas are producing no impression. That they are accorded space and prominence in a leading newspaper, is proof to the contrary. Prof. Herron has persevered in reiterating them before the public, and is now finding a hearing which, from his standpoint, must be encouraging. The prospect is, indeed, that his conceptions of the relation of Christianity to politics and civil government will be received with increasing favor by the people. For such a result the times are propitious. Men have become drunken with the wine of false doctrine, until they no longer view things in the light of sober common sense and of the old and tried principles of right, but see the truth through a mental haze which distorts it into every shape of falsehood. It is a time favorable to the rise of new doctrines. Agitation, intensity, are characteristic features of this time. People are on the watch to see and to hear some new thing, but not from a love of the truth. The times portend a famine of truth, with an abundant harvest of error.

Prof. Herron tells us that he sees "in our land the beginnings of a great political movement, inspired for the purpose of translating the righteousness of Christ into the legislation of the nation and the making of His mind the national political sense of this country." Upon this point he no doubt sees clearly. The beginnings of such a "great political movement" are apparent to him who will pause and observe what is taking place. Its purpose is no doubt, that "of translating the righteousness of Christ into the legislation of the nation;" but such a purpose can never be attained. The righteousness of Christ is of God, for the salvation of man, whom it reaches only through faith. This righteousness came not by any law nor can it be put into the form of law. But it does not need to be "translated" into any law, even if this were possible. It is perfectly adapted to every need of the human family just as it is. Only just as it is will it do any person any good. In thinking to translate this righteousness into legislation, men will only put something of their own devising in the place of that righteousness and put their trust in that which has no salvation. That is the trouble with every scheme which would join Christianity with politics; it only shuts away from salvation those who trust in it. God's plan of salvation is not through politics, but through faith and love.

Prof. Herron is doubtless sincere, but he is following the leading of a great and dangerous error. Nor is he following it alone.
