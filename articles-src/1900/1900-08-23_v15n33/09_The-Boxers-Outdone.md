# THE BOXERS OUTDONE.

The damnable doings of the New Orleans mob, which are enough to shut the mouth of every American citizen against the Chinese Boxers, found a fitting climax in the burning of the Lafon school building and the fine negro residences round about. This building was as handsome as any white school building in the city. It was named after Thomy Lafon, a negro, who accumulated a fortune of some $600,000 and left it all to charity, part going to the building of this school, part to a charity hospital and part to two homes for aged people, one for the colored race and one for the white; and simply because the school building was devoted to the education of colored people, this hellish white mob fired it! Talk about the devilish Chinese Boxers! It is said that as the flames enveloped the building, placing it beyond hope of saving, an aged colored preacher in the crowd raised his hands aloft and cried, "God has indeed deserted us," and, turning, he ran away as fast as he could go in the energy of his despair. The shame and the damnation of it are upon the whole American people.—Springfield (Mass.) Republican.
