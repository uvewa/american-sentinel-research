A CORRESPONDENT of the Catholic Standard and Times, writing from Havana under date of July 21, describes a "monster parade" in that city upon the occasion of the installation of the newly-elected municipal officers. "It is estimated," says the correspondent, "that over 30,000 persons took part in the inaugural parade, and it was quite different from any parade that I have ever witnessed in the city. As usual, there were civic, political and military organizations in line, men on horseback wearing the uniform of the Cuban army. * * *. Every previous parade since the American occupation has given a prominence to the American flag, the flag being carried alongside of the Cuban colors; but if there was one American flag in that great popular demonstration I have yet to meet the person who saw it. I mention this circumstance as significant of the inner mind of the Cubans. The significance of the absence of the Stars and Stripes was emphasized by the presence of the Spanish colors, particularly as it is only a few months since the Spanish flag was torn down by some hotheaded Cuban and an order was issued by Mayor Lacoste forbidding it to be raised in Havana. Another fact of a kindred nature was the appearance in the line of the Spanish band, this being the first time it has appeared in public for about a year."
