## WHY WE OPPOSE SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

We oppose Sunday legislation because we oppose Sabbath legislation. We oppose the enforcement of any weekly day of rest.

We oppose Sabbath legislation because the Sabbath is a religious institution, in the observance of which legal mandates can accomplish nothing, but only "faith which worketh by love," as declared in the Scriptures.

We oppose Sabbath legislation not because we do not want people to rest one day in seven, but because Sabbath rest ought not to be and can not be secured by civil enactments.

We oppose Sabbath legislation not because we have any sympathy with the course of greedy corporations or employers in "robbing" the workingmen of the day of rest, but because we oppose laws which rob people of their right to work upon any day they may choose, and of their liberty to choose for themselves whether they will keep the Sabbath or not.

We oppose Sabbath legislation not because we do not want people to be free to obey the dictates of conscience in regard to Sabbath rest, but because we want them to obey the dictates of conscience rather than the dictates of law. They can not do both; and just to the extent that Sabbath observance is dictated by law it fails to be dictated by conscience.

We are opposed to Sabbath legislation not because we want people to be robbed of their manhood, but because we want them to have manhood enough to do right from the love of right, to act from principle rather than from policy. The more a person leans on the law to help him do right the more will he fail to develop moral backbone.

We oppose Sabbath legislation, in short, because compulsion is opposed to freedom in the service of God; because it is opposed to natural rights; because it usurps the place of conscience and weakens moral independence; because it is against the rights both of man and of God, to whom all forced service is abomination; because, in a word, it is against the highest welfare of man and contrary to the ordinances of God.
