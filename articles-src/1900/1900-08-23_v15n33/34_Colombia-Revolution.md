It is a forcible commentary on the world's condition to-day that, as the Springfield Republican remarks, "the revolution in Colombia does not attract the slightest attention from the world," although "the word comes that 2,700 men have been killed in fifteen days, a mortality which, in ordinary times, would seem sensational enough." The Republican advises that "the combatants would do well to put off their fighting till they can have a chance to get some military glory out of it." And still would-be prophets of the day are crying "peace and safety."
