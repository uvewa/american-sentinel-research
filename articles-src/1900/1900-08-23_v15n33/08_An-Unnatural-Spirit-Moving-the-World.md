# AN UNNATURAL SPIRIT MOVING THE WORLD.

The occurrence of a race riot in the staid metropolis of the United States, in this time of domestic peace, is startling and significant. Yet it is not greatly surprising in view of the general character of the times upon which we have fallen. It is not out of harmony with the spirit of agitation, strife, and war that is so generally prevalent throughout the world.

There is usually some sort of reason that may be cited as accounting for if not excusing tragedies of this kind. In New Orleans a race riot is the natural outcome of conditions that have long prevailed throughout the South. But what reason can be alleged for a race riot of serious magnitude in New York City?

Verily he is blind or asleep who has not discovered that "the times are out of joint"—that a spirit is taking possession of the hearts of men which proceeds without reason or sober thought, and is leading them to act like men without mental equipoise—a spirit which intoxicates men with a thirst for blood. Not merely the low element of the population is thus affected, but men of respectability, who would never be thought of as participants in a street riot. Such persons were noticed as leading in the New York riot, and even the uniformed officials of the city whose special duty is to preserve the peace, seemed rather to join with the rioters than to make a stand against them. The spirit which inspires such actions is an unnatural one; it is against reason, against peace, against law and civilization.

And it is not confined to one locality. The whole world seems to have become intoxicated with it. From a bird's eye view of all lands, could one be taken, the impression might be gained that the world had become an arena of general strife and commotion. This condition of things is not noted alone by the Bible student who believes that we have reached the stormy scenes of earth's last days; it is remarked by thoughtful people everywhere. "What in the world is the matter with the world?" was the recent exclamation of a secular journal. There is something the matter, surely.

It is not a time of security for any one. Like the subterranean forces generated in the bowels of the earth, the spirit that is moving the world from beneath is active under the surface everywhere, and no one can tell where the earthquake may break forth. It is possible only to guard against this spirit in one's own heart. If our own spirit is an opposite spirit to this, we shall not be gathered in with the forces that fill the earth with war and tumult.

Armageddon is ahead. There is a spirit to go forth in the earth to gather the nations to battle—to a scene of final strife and slaughter. Are not all things ready for such a gathering—are not men ready everywhere to fall in with such a movement? Is this spirit not already beginning its fateful work? s.
