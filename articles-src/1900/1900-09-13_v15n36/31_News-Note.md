A PAMPHLET purporting to set forth the "Religious Life of President McKinley," published by three Methodist clergymen, is being circulated through the country, seemingly as a sort of campaign document. The Catholic Mirror well observes that "the dragging of religion into politics in this manner can have no effect except to cheapen the dignity of the former."
