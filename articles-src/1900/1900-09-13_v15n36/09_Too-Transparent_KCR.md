An order has been issued from the Boston police headquarters to the captains of the various divisions giving explicit instructions concerning the Sunday law, quoting from the public statutes and urging them to see that the law is not violated, commencing with August the 26th ult.

The notice sent out was in part as follows:

"Acts of 1895, chapter 434, section 2, provide a penalty for 'whoever, on the Lord's day, keeps open his shop, warehouse or workhouse, or does any manner of labor, business or work, except works of necessity and charity.' . . .

"'Whoever conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, shall not be liable to the penalties of this section for performing secular business and labor on the Lord's day if he disturbs no other person.'

"Although upon a hasty reading it might not be apparent, this exception as to those who conscientiously believe that the seventh day ought to be observed as the Sabbath, etc., is limited to the prohibition against labor, business and work, and does not apply to the prohibition against keeping open one's shop, workhouse or warehouse.

"See commonwealth vs. Starr, 144 Mass., 359; also commonwealth vs. Hass, 122 Mass., 40—'Even if one conscientiously believes that the seventh day ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day, he cannot on that account legally keep his shop open for business on Sunday.'"

It will be seen from the foregoing that Boston is holding her own on the question of enforcing the Sunday laws.

The point, however, that I wish to notice in this connection is that the exemption clauses which are held up by some Sunday-law advocates, are but little more than such in name, as will be seen from the above. It is said that there is no desire on the part of the Sunday-law crusaders to deprive any of their liberties, and in evidence of their sincerity they offer exemption clauses to those who observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Were the principle underlying Sunday laws and the offering of exemption clauses for those observing the seventh day a right one, it could even then be seen how transparent these exemptions are by examining the one here referred to in the Massachusetts Sunday law, for it specifies those who "actually" refrain from secular business and labor on the seventh day, and says further that such an individual can labor on Sunday only on condition that "he disturbs no other person." I once heard of a person who was disturbed because another person was setting type in an upper room several squares away on Sunday. It can be seen from this illustration that such exemptions only render a person a helpless prey to the prejudices of any who may not agree with him religiously.

But you will observe that this Massachusetts Sunday law has been found, on technical examination, to forbid even the "exempted" Seventh-day observer the right to keep open his shop, workhouse or warehouse on Sunday. We can but conclude that such exemptions are but a thin veil to cover up the real object of the Sunday law movement until the sentiment in its favor becomes so universal that there will be no policy in having exemptions for any, even in name.
