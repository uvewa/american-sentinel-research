An exchange says: "There is now a general feeling, which can be referred to no particular facts nor explained on any rational theory, that we are approaching a period of greater combats (than those of the preceding century), a world struggle, in which tremendous machinery which has been organized for war is to be put to a full test between the rival Powers who are grasping at the earth or all of it that remains unattached to the great empires. There has certainly been no period in the past when the ambitions for conquest were so keen and so widespread as at present; when so many powers armed to the teeth were watching with jealously every movement of their neighbors, and looking about with so little scruple for compensations."
