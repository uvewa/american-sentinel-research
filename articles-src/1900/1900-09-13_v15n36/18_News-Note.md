The fifteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, conferring the elective franchise upon the negro, came as the result of the Civil War. The war was caused by negro slavery, and the elevation of the negro to political equality with the whites was the political expression of the truth that the negro was no longer a slave, but was like other men endowed with certain unalienable rights. Being such a man, the negro was naturally entitled to participate in the Government. The fifteenth amendment was a necessary outcome of the war. It only put into words the truth for which the war had been fought.

Now we are told that this amendment is the "most colossal political mistake" the nation ever made. How can this be true if the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency on the slavery issue, and the war which followed, were not also colossal political mistakes?

The fifteenth amendment is a part of the Constitution, and the language quoted is an open attack on the Constitution. And how much longer will there remain in such quarters even a pretence of regard for the Constitution as it now stands?
