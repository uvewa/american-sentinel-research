The English Churchman and St. James Chronicle cites the fact that there are, or were quite recently, 170 French Jesuits laboring in China, and then says:

"Wherever the Jesuits go they stir up strife and quarrelling, not only between Romanists and Protestants, but also between Romanists and Romanists. Pope Clement XIV., in his bull suppressing the Jesuit Order, declared that several Roman Catholic kings had previously been compelled to expel the Jesuits in order to prevent the Roman Catholics rising in the very bosom of their church and murdering one another."
