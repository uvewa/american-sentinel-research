At a recent church fair in a small city the receipts aggregated over four thousand dollars, which were mostly gained in unfair competition with the town merchants. A dealer who succumbed to solicitations to give five pairs of shoes saw them marked at less than cost, and affirms that he was afterward twitted over his own counter because he charged more than the bazaar saleswoman. There are several sides to church fairs, and all are bad.—Youth's Companion.
