The leading medical journals of Great Britain are printing with some reserve statistics accounting for the decay of the personnel of the army.

Its failure of leadership along the highest line of command is matched by the inability of seasoned troops to endure prolonged marches and show fighting power after exhaustion. These two conditions place the British army of to-day in humiliating contrast to the British armies of the past before the frontiers of empire had been firmly established or long maintained in tropical countries. Seasoned troops are now described as the feeblest element of the imperial forces.

The reason is disclosed in the medical history of regiments taken with the reports of their assignments for garrison and protracted camp duty. Vice unchecked, and apparently inseparable from their physical and social environment, has accomplished more victories over the fighting power of Great Britain than her semi-savage and conquered hordes.

Africa alone is not the "white man's graveyard." The British soldier has carried in his poisoned blood home from every quarter of the British empire outside Europe a legacy whose curse the humanitarian science of England shudders at.

As the boundaries of the British empire have been expanded its manhood has decayed.

Official reports of American hospitals to which our sick soldiers have been numerously sent carefully hold back for only official eyes a story whose shocking truth must ultimately become general. War is not without inevitable consequences to make mankind halt before entering on it.
