WE owe an apology to the city of Toronto, Ont., for having recently published the statement that street cars were not allowed to run there on Sundays. This was true of Toronto until within recent times, but about two years ago the city threw off the yoke of allegiance to a system which prohibited Sunday travel by public conveyance, and since then its citizens have been as well favored as any people elsewhere in this respect. Probably there are few, if any, large cities, also, where the prohibition of Sunday travel would be attended with less discomfort to the people than in Toronto.
