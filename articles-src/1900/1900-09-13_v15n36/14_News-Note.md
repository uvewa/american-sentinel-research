A PLAN has been set on foot by the secretary of the Indiana State W. C. T. U., which has for its object the defeat of President McKinley at the polls next November, because of his attitude on the question of the abolition of the army canteen. The nature of the plan appears from the following pledge, which is being sent out broadcast from Indianapolis to the members of the organization:

"Whereas, President William McKinley has shown that he prefers the favor of the liquor men of the nation to that of the millions of the Christian people who petitioned him to blot out the canteen scourge from the army; therefore I pledge myself as follows:

"1. I pledge myself that I will, until election day, make it a special subject of prayer to my heavenly Father that he will give to the United States a better man for President for the next four years, one who will keep wine off the White House table, one who will be a total obstainer himself, and who will do what he can to overthrow the liquor traffic.

"2. I furthermore pledge myself to make at least two copies of this letter, and mail one copy to some sister in the State in which I reside, and the other copy to some sister in some other State."

And now some other W. C. T. U. members who desire Mr. McKinley to be retained in office have, it is said, started a counter chain-prayer movement to prevent the first one from having its designed effect upon the Deity! Are we to take this as an illustration of the utility of woman in politics?
