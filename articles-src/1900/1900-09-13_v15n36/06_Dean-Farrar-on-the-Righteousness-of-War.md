In the North American Review for September the well-known English clergyman, F. W. Farrar, argues in support of the idea that war is not incompatible with Christianity on the ground that "the suppression of all appeals to the decision of war would involve the certain and absolute triumph of robbery, oppression, greed, and injustice." The conclusion reached is that "war waged in the cause of truth and right . . . still continues to be at times a necessary duty, even for the most Christian nation." The influence of his words is likely to be widely felt in confirming the public mind in this belief.

But what is "the decision of war"? The appeal to war is an appeal to might. The decision of war is the decision of might; and to say that that decision is right is only to affirm that might makes right. The view that the appeal to war is a necessity dictated by Christianity, demands also that the decision of war should not be from blind chance, but guided by Heaven, and to be taken as registering the divine will. But the view that the divine will is indicated by the outcome of an ordeal through which the parties concerned are obliged to pass, is too distinctly characteristic of paganism to be worthy of belief by Christians.

We may well inquire, again, Which cause is "the cause of truth and right?" If it be granted that war in such a cause is Christian, this question still remains to be decided, and no judgment that can be rendered will be infallible. Was it the Boer cause or the British cause that was just and right in the contest now being concluded in South Africa? Was either cause, indeed, that of "truth and right?" What is the cause of truth and right? Must it not be the cause that is untainted with selfishness—that seeks no aggression upon any? And who dare affirm that either Boer or Briton has been fighting for such a cause? And what of Christianity,—is not the cause of Christianity the one real cause of truth and right? Must Christianity then at times have recourse to war to extend its sway upon the earth? We find no affirmation of it in the gospel commission given by the Master to His disciples.

No; the only proper business of force in this world is to maintain that which all men instinctively recognize as just and right—a cause concerning the justice of which there is no dispute—namely, the cause of human rights. The cause of truth and right will be vindicated in character without any appeal to might. It will triumph by the inherent power of divine truth; and even the exercise of force that is necessary in civil governments for the protection of rights does not represent Christianity, for Christianity is not a government of force, and forces no one, but only appeals to all by love. Men readily believe that the cause of their country is the "cause of truth and right," and the idea that war in such a cause is a Christian necessity is only calculated to extend the ghastly work of war throughout the earth.
