BARON RUSSELL, of Killowen, late Lord Chief Justice of England, in an address to the American Bar Association in 1896, defined "civilization in its true, its highest sense," thus: "Its true signs are thought for the poor and suffering, chivalrous regard and respect for woman, the frank recognition of human brotherhood, irrespective of race or color or nation or religion, the love of ordered freedom, abhorrence of what is mean and cruel and vile, ceaseless devotion to the claims of justice." This is true Christian civilization, and not that civilization which is but a thin veneer over barbarism.
