SPEAKING of how to employ Sunday, the Defender (Sunday-law organ), quoting the Congregationalist, says that "to fritter away the whole day in idle talk on hotel piazzas," or "to indulge in loafing until it becomes wearisome," is not such a use of the day "as ought to satisfy the aspiring soul."

True; and this is just the reason why we object to the Sunday laws, which, when enforced, compel a person to spend Sunday in just this way. Honest work or innocent sport is better than mere loafing on any day. God did not make men loafers, and we may be sure he frowns upon any contrivance of man that produces such a result, "You shall not work," says the Sunday law, "neither shall you play. You must go to church or loaf."

The Sabbath is a religious institution, designed for those who would appreciate its religious benefits—a day for religious activity. For the loafer it profits nothing.
