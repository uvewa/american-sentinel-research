DESCRIBING another race riot that took place last week in New York City, the Sun says that not a dozen men in the mob of a thousand persons who were hunting negroes "knew what the trouble was about, nor why they wanted to assault negroes; but fight is in the air," and only the activity of the police prevented probable murder.

"Fight is in the air"—that is the right phrase for the situation; and the reason that "fight is in the air" is that we are being drawn into the climax of the age-long contest between the principles of right and of wrong, of justice and of despotism. And with the climax comes the end.
