THE opening up of China by the forces of civilization is likely to result in a great outflow of Chinese into surrounding parts of the world. Already vast numbers of Chinese are going north into Russian territory by means of the new railway system Russia has extended into Chinese territory, and the Russian authorities are considering what can be done to stop them. There are probably no people on earth that can compete as laborers with the Chinese.
