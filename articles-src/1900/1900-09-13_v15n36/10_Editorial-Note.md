The whole tendency of the times is to make us act by the standard of what others do. We throw over the wall of our character the tangled plumb line of other lives and reject the infallible test which Amos saw. The question for me should not be what you think is right, but what God thinks is right. This perpetual reference to the behavior of others as though it decided anything but human fallibility is a mistake as wide as the world. There are ten thousand pumb lines in use, but only one is exact, and that is the line of God's eternal right. There is a mighty attempt being made to reconstruct and fix up the Ten Commandments. To many they seem too rigid. My friends, we must have a standard; shall it be God's or man's?—Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage.
