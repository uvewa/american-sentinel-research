IN justification of the movement for a federation of Catholic societies in America, our Catholic friends say that their rights are not safeguarded by the state, citing as an illustration that "the Catholics are obliged to bear the double expense of maintaining the parochial schools which their children attend, and the public schools, from which they derive no benefit." This of course is no more than any denomination might say which maintains denominational schools. No individual—Catholic or Protestant—has any reason to object to the payment of taxes for the support of the civil government, even though some of its institutions may be of no direct benefit to him. And in the blessings which the public school system confers upon society, the Catholic parent is indirectly benefitted, although his own children may all be sent to the parochial school.
