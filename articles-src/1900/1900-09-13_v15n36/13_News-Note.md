"The first duty of the hour in China," says the N. Y. Tribune (which more perhaps than any other journal speaks for the Administration), "is to investigate these charges [of looting, arson, rape, murder, etc., by the allied forces] and stop the orgy of outlawry if its prevalence is established. The question of remaining in or withdrawing from Peking is an important one, but it shrinks into insignificance by the side of this. If the Powers can not do better in China than to loot and to ravish and to murder they would best get out in short order, and pray that the world may some day forget that they ever went in."

Unfortunately it is not clear how one of the Powers—the United States, for example—is to stop another of the Powers, such as Russia or France, from carrying on the orgy, without coming to blows with that Power. The nation must keep in bad company and bear the stigma of it if it remains in China. The "first duty of the hour" seems destined to remain unperformed.
