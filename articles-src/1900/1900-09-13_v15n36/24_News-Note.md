The following notice appeared recently in the Mount Vernon (Ky.) Signal:

"The colored people will have a rally at the Court House the fourth Sunday in this month for the purpose of raising money to build a Baptist church. Two ladies, who will be No. 1 and 2, will run a medal race. Everybody is asked to contribute to this cause."

Suppose the rally had been for some "secular" purpose, just think what would have happened!
