THE liberty-loving man wants state protection only for himself and his fellows; the bigot wants protection for his religion.

TRUTH can protect itself against error without the aid of civil government. Hence a religion asking for state aid thereby acknowledges itself to be false and spurious.

RELIGIOUS legislation may properly be looked upon as an attempt to establish a fashion in religion, something to which all must conform, without regard to belief or conscience. But uniformity so secured is but a counterfeit of Christian unity.

THE Creator never gave mankind a law demanding idleness, and when men enact such a law they need not flatter themselves that they are meeting the mind of the Deity. Nature, as God made it, abhors idleness as it does a vacuum. No sanction of idleness in nature can be discovered by microscope or telescope. A compulsory-idleness law is out of harmony with nature and with nature's God; and because a Sunday law can secure nothing but idleness it stands condemned. It has no rightful place in legislation.

THE Creator settles no question of right or wrong by physical force, although He is acknowledged to be ommiscient; and since He will not settle such questions by arbitrary decree backed up by His almighty power, it is plain that such questions can not be settled by force, and civil governments have properly nothing to do with their consideration. Only when the principles of right and of wrong, of truth and of error, have fought out the battle, and the right decision is clear to all, does force properly come into play to carry the decision into effect; only for the preservation of natural rights, the possession of which by men is a self-evident truth, can the force of civil governments be properly exercised.
