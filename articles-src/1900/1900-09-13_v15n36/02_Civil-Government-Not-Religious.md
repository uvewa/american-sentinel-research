Civil government can not be Christian and it ought not to be anti-Christian. It should simply be devoid of religious character—that is, it ought to be civil.

The Scriptures plainly declare that God is not only the great moral Governor, but that he is the only one to whom moral accountability is due. "Every one of us shall give account of himself to God," says the apostle; and again the Lord, by the same instrument, issues this challenge to every usurper of the divine prerogative: "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant?"

The civil law does not undertake to punish *sin*, but only to punish *crime*. Sin is the offense against God; crime is the offense against our fellowmen. *All sin* is against God. "Whosoever committeth sin," says the apostle, "transgresseth also the law, for sin is the transgression of the law." This is said of the divine law. Again in the fifty-first Psalm we find that David, in confessing to God the wrong done to Uriah, says: "Against thee, thee only have I sinned." The wrong was against man, the sin was against God, whose law was violated.

The violation of all just human law is not only crime, but it is also sin, because violative of the law of God as well as of the law of men. But human government deals *only with the crime*. God punishes the sin; "so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God," both for our sins against God and for our wrongs against our fellowmen, for "God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil."

God made man a social, moral being, and as such endowed him with "certain unalienable rights." These rights are conserved by just civil government.

To disregard civil rights or to trample upon them is to *wrong* our fellowmen and to *sin* against God, who commands every man to love his neighbor as himself. The sin, if not repented of and forgiven, God will punish in his own good time. The wrong may be dealt with by our fellowmen in their organized capacity as a state. And it is this latter fact that restrains from deeds of violence and injustice many who have not the fear of God before them.

This safeguard to natural rights the God who "sendeth his rain upon the just and the unjust" has given to *man*. Its benefits accrue alike to the righteous and to the wicked. Hence civil government is not in any sense Christian; it is simply humanitarian—that is, it is given, like marriage, for the good of the race, given to all men regardless of religious beliefs.

The church of Rome insists that marriage belongs to the church; that it is one of the "seven sacraments" of religion. This the Protestant denies. Of course the object of this claim is that the church may control marriage; and in Roman Catholic countries we generally find that only religious marriages are recognized by law. For a similar reason it is claimed by many that civil government, existing as it does by the ordinance of God, should be controlled by the people of God. Thus the Papacy has claimed the right to depose kings and to set up kings, and to hand over whole peoples to the rule of a prince not of their own choice. But the claim is without any substantial basis. Civil government was ordained of God in the very nature of man, and belongs not to a part of the race, but to *all men*. And the veriest pagans have just the same divine warrant for organizing civil government and thus securing this natural rights that the most enlightened and devout Christians have.
