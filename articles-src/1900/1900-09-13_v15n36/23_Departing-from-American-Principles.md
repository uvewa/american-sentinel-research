## What Prominent Americans Are Saying.

A REGRETFUL glance backward is permissible, but the American people have crossed the Rubicon of imperial responsibility.—Demetrios C. Boulger, in North American Review.

The statement found in the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal" is not true. The statement that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed is not true, and never has been.—William D. Foulke, of Indiana.

The truth is, the fifteenth amendment [to the Constitution] is the most colossal political mistake ever made in the United States. In the States where the negroes are numerous it is now practically nullified. Experience has shown the nullification to be necessary. It is nothing less than a hideous doctrine that all persons have an equal right to participate in government on equal terms, or that 'self-government' or 'consent of the governed' requires the acceptance or application of this doctrine. Our people have practically changed their opinions on this subject since the fifteenth amendment was adopted; for, throughout the Northern States scarcely a voice is now lifted against this wholesale disfranchisement of the negroes in the South.—Portland Oregonian.

CONSIDERABLY more than a century ago a certain notable declaration was made in this country to the effect that all men ought to be free and independent. This is merely a generalization of the French school of Voltaire and the encyclopedists. It is a dictum absolutely lacking foundation in history and incapable of syllogistic justification. It was, however, a handy phrase for us to employ when asserting our right to break away from the mother country; it suited the exigencies of our situation in 1776 admirably, though in itself but a bit of sublimated demagogism. The declaration was a serviceable means to the end that was at that time desired. To bring forward this declaration in this year, 1900, in connection with our treatment of the Filipinos and Cubans, is as gross an absurdity as ever was practiced.—United States Investors' Review, Boston.
