The Diario de Porto Rico tells a melancholy tale of the political condition of the natives of that island.

Without knowing whether all of the Diario's statements are fact, it may be said that there is no reason for doubting them. They read like facts, at least. Porto Rico, it says, enjoys less of civil liberty now than it had under Spanish rule. Formerly Porto Ricans elected three senators and sixteen representatives to the congress of Spain, now they have one delegate in Washington without a vote. Formerly they had a council of secretaries, whose resolutions were always sanctioned by the governor, now they have an executive council, chiefly composed of persons who were not born in the island, and enjoy no standing whatever in it, and who will naturally interest themselves more for the country appointing them than for the region meeting their salaries.

Spite of the heavy taxes exacted by Spain the island always had a surplus revenue, now it faces a deficit of a million dollars, due largely, no doubt, to the effects of the hurricane. Yet Congress voted more than two millions to the island when the tariff bill was pending. "We have been granted nothing of what we were promised," says the Diario, which, making all allowance for exaggeration, is uncomfortably close to the facts. The grievances of the Porto Ricans are set forth as a reason why they abstained from joining in the celebration of the anniversary of the union with the United States.
