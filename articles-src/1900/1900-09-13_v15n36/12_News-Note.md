The Catholic Standard and Times speaks of "the astounding impudence of the Protestant sects in sending missionaries of creedless disunion and hopeless disagreement among a Catholic people infinitely superior to those missionaries in their religious beliefs and daily lives." And this is said with reference to the sending of missionaries to the Philippine islands.
