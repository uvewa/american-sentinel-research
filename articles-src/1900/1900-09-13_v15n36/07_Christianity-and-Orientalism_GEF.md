It is hoped that the battle Christianity was compelled to fight with Judaism and paganism has been made plain, in so far as it was possible to do so in the space allotted to these papers. Imagine, if you can, the apostles of Jesus Christ—the tent-maker or the fisherman—entering as strangers into one of the splendid cities of Syria, Asia Minor, or Greece. As they pass along they survey the strength of the established religion, which it is their avowed purpose to overthrow. Everywhere they behold temples on which the utmost extravagance of expenditure has been lavished by succeeding generations; idols of the most exquisite workmanship, to which the people are strongly attached, not only by the religious feeling, but also by patriotism, pride, and national and local vanity. "They meet processions in which the idle find perpetual occupation, the young excitement, the voluptuous a continual stimulant to their passions. They behold a priesthood, numerous, sometimes wealthy; nor are these alone wedded by interest to the established faith. Many of the trades, like those of the makers of silver shrines at Ephesus, are pledged to the support of that to which they owe their maintenance. . . ."

"They meet philosophers, frequently itinerants like themselves, or teachers of new religions, priests of Isis and Serapis, who have brought into equal discredit what might otherwise appeared a proof of philanthropy, the performing of laborious journeys at the sacrifice of ease and comfort for the moral and religious improvement of mankind. . . ."

"There are also teachers of the different mysteries which would engross the anxiety of the inquisitive, perhaps exite, even if they did not satisfy, the hopes of the more pure and lofty-minded. Such the overpowering difficulties which met and confronted them wherever they went." (Milman's Hist. Christ., vol. I, p. 441, note.)

## The Deadly Miasma of the East.

All this Christianity met and conquered gloriously in the might of the Lord of Hosts; but even these were not the worst foes of the early church. If "the conflict of Christianity with Judaism was a civil war, and that with paganism the invasion and conquest of a foreign territory," the conflict of Christianity with the oriental philosophy or gnosticism was a guerilla warfare. It was fighting an unknown and a lurking foe. It was worse even than this. It was the infant church exposed to a deadly miasma which she inhaled with every breath, and which only the power of the life within could eliminate and exclude.

We need not be surprised, then, when Milman tells us that "Asiatic influences have worked more completely into the body and essence of Christianity than any other foreign elements," and that "it is by no means improbable that tenets, which had their origin in India, have for centuries predominated in or materially affected the Christianity of the whole Western world." "From the banks of the Ganges, probably from the shores of the Yellow Sea and the coasts of farther India to the Phoenician borders of the Mediterranean and the undefined limits of Phrygia in Asia Minor there was that connection and similitude; that community of certain elementary principles; that tendency to certain combinations of physical and moral ideas, which may be expressed by the term Orientalism." (Milman's Hist. of Christ., vol. II., pp. 35, 36.) The Jews came in contact with this philosophy during their captivity in Babylon, and, blending with their religion, it produced their mystic Cabala, and influenced many of the teachings of the Essenes and Pharisees.

It colored Plato's teachings, and was an essential part of the New Platonism which had its origin at Alexandria. Its foundation principle was the Persian Dualism—the idea that there were two supreme deities, one the creator of light and pure spirit, and the other of darkness and malignant matter. In all the oriental sects this primary principle of the malignity of matter haunted the imagination.

"Many of the oriental specialists, as soon as Christianity began to develop, hailed it as the completion of their own wild theories, and forced it into accordance with their universal tenet of distinct intelligences eminating from the primal Being. Thus Christ, who to the vulgar Jew was to be a temporal king, to the Cabalist, or to the Chaldean, or to men of kindred opinions, became a Sephiroth, an Aeon, an emanation from the one Supreme. While the author of the religion was still on earth, and while the religion was still in its infancy, Jesus was in danger of being degraded into a king of the Jews; his gospel of becoming the code of a new religious republic. Directly it got beyond the borders of Palestine, and the name of Christ had acquired sanctity and veneration in the Eastern cities, he became a kind of metaphysical impersonation, while the religion lost its purely moral cast, and assumed the character of a speculative theology. . . . It was not till the second century that the combination of Orientalism with Christianity was matured into the more perfect Gnosticism. This was perhaps at its height from the year 120 to 140 A. D. In all the great cities of the East in which Christianity had established its most flourishing communities, sprang up this rival, which aspired to a still higher degree of knowledge than was revealed in the Gospels, and boasted that it soared almost as much above the vulgar Christianity as above the vulgar paganism." (Milman's Hist. Christ., vol. II, pp. 56, 61.)

## Gnosticism and Its Speculations.

It is almost impossible in the space allotted to one of these papers to give any adequate conception of the many theories, and of the wonderfully imaginative speculations of this Gnosticism, which took its name from its professing to restore the "gnosis" or the lost knowledge of the true God. As all matter was innately malignant and evil, so God, who was good, was necessarily immaterial. It was not thinkable that such a god would form this material world, far less that he would create malignant matter itself. So some believed in the eternity of matter, assigning to it not a creator, but an architect merely. Others believed in the Persian dualistic theory, that there was a malignant god, opposed to the god of spirits, and that he had created matter. As Jehovah, the God of the Jews, was the creator of this material world, so he could not be the Supreme God. The Supreme God had existed from eternity a' being full of goodness and wisdom and of the other virtues, and of him no mortal could form a complete conception. He was a being who is the purest light, and he is diffused through the boundless space to which they gave the Greek appellation of "pleroma." This eternal being, after existing alone in absolute repose for countless ages, produced out of himself two spirits of different sexes, and both perfect resemblances of their parent. From the marriage of these two spirits, others of similar nature originated, and successive generations ensued, and thus in the process of time a celestial family was formed in the pleroma. This divine progeny, being immortal and unchangeable in their nature, these philosophers called Aeons, a term which signified eternal and beyond the vicissitudes of time.
