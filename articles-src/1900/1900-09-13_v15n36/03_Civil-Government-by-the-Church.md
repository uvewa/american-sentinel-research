The idea that the pious people of the earth are by reason of their zeal for God the best fitted of all people to administer the affairs of civil government is one that has for centuries back been powerful in the church. Being superior to all other organizations on the earth in her standards and aims for mankind, the thought that the church ought to be at the head of earthly affairs seems warranted by weighty facts. Inspired prophecy, moreover, seems also to justify it, by predictions that the dominion of earth is to be given to "the people of the saints of the Most High." To effect such a change in the political ascendency as will place the church in the seat of governmental authority will be therefore only to fulfill the purpose of the divine Sovereign. Such is the view held by many good people to-day. The facts, just as clearly set forth by inspiration, that the reign of the saints on the earth is to be realized only at an appointed time and through the work of appointed spiritual agencies, and that first the judgments of God must sweep the earth, are not taken into account.

This idea that the highest welfare of both state and church is to be attained by placing the reins of civil authority in the hands of the saints has borne fruit on several occasions in the past, from the records of which a very valuable lesson may be drawn for the present hour. It is the purpose of this article to refer to one such occasion in the history of Anglo-Saxon government, an occasion which belongs to one of the greatest periods of English history—the times of Oliver Cromwell. In magazine articles particular attention is just now being called to Cromwell and the historic drama in which he was the central figure, which is certainly well, considering the tendency of the history of his day to repeat itself in the imperialistic and church-and-state movements of the present time. We quote the following on the point to which we wish to call particular attention from an article in the *Century Magazine*, which is one of a series on the life of Comwell from the pen of Mr. John Morley:

## The "Reign of the Saints."

"After the rude dispersion of the Long Parliament next came the Reign of the Saints. No experiment could have worked worse. Here is Cromwell's rueful admission: 'Truly I will come now and tell you a story of my own weakness and folly; and yet it was done in my simplicity, I dare avow it. It was thought then that men of our judgment, who had fought in the wars and were all of a piece on that account, surely these men will hit it, and these men will do it to the purpose, whatever can be desired; and truly we did think, and I did think so, the more blame to me; and such a company of men were chosen and did proceed to action. And this was the naked truth, that the issue was not answerable to the simplicity and honesty of the design.' Such was Oliver's own tale, related four years afterwards. The discovery that the vast and complex task of human government needs more than spiritual enthusiasm, that to have 'very Scriptural notions' is not enough for the reform of stubborn earthly things, marks yet another stage in Cromwell's progress. He was no idealist turned cynic, that mournful spectacle, but a warrior called by heaven to save civil order and religious freedom; and it was with this duty heavy on his soul that he watched the working of the scheme that Harrison had pressed upon him. . . .

"The company of men so chosen constituted what stands in history as the Little Parliament, or, parodied from the name of one of its members, Barebones' Parliament. They were nominated by Cromwell and his council of officers at their own will and pleasure, helped by the local knowledge of the Congregational churches in the country. The writ of summons, reciting how it was necessary to provide for the peace, safety, and good government of the Commonwealth by committing the trust of such weighty affairs to men with good assurance of love and courage for the interest of God's cause, was issued in the name of Oliver Cromwell, captain-general and commander-in-chief. One hundred and thirty-nine of these summonses went out, and presently five other persons were invited by the convention itself to join, including Cromwell, Lambert and Harrison. . . .

"Though so irregular in their source the nominees of the officers were undoubtedly, for the most part, men of worth, substance, and standing. Inspired by the enthusiastic Harrison, their whole existence is the high-water mark of the biblical politics of the times, of Puritanism applying itself to legislation, political construction, and social regeneration. It hardly deserves to be described as the greatest attempt ever made in history to found a civil society on the literal words of Scripture, but it was certainly the greatest failure of such an attempt.

"To the council chamber at Whitehall the chosen notables repaired on the 4th of July (1653), a day destined a century and more later to be the date of higher things in the annals of free government. They seated themselves round the table, and the lord general stood by the window, near the middle of it. The room was crowded with officers. Cromwell in his speech made no attempt to hide the military character of the revolution that had brought them together. The indenture, he told them, by which they were constituted the supreme authority had been drawn up by the advice of the principal officers of the army; it was himself and his fellow-members who had vainly tried to stir up the parliament; he had been their mouthpiece to offer their sense for them; it was the army to whom the people had looked, in their dissatisfaction at the breakdown of parliamentary performance. . . . Now, God had called this new supreme authority to do his work, which had come to them by wise Providence through weak hands. . . .

"Meanwhile Oliver freely surrendered himself to the spiritual raptures of the hour. 'I confess I never looked to see such a day as this, when Jesus Christ should be so owned as he is this day in this work. God manifests this to be the day of the power of Christ, having through so much blood and so much trial as hath been upon these nations, made this to be one of the great issues thereof to have his people called to the supreme authority.' Text upon text is quoted in lyric excitement from prophets, psalmist, and apostles; Old Testament dispensation and New; appeals to the examples of Moses and of Paul, who could wish themselves blotted out of God's book for the sake of the whole people; the verses from James about wisdom from above being pure and peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits; and then at last the sixty-eighth Psalm, with its triumphs so exceeding high and great.

## The Dissipation of the Dream.

"A few weeks began the dissipation of the dream. They were all sincere and zealous, but the most zealous were the worst simpletons. . . . The impatience that had grown so bitter against the old parliament soon revived against the new convention. Just as it is the nature of courts of law to amplify the jurisdiction, so it is the nature of every political assembly to extend its powers. The moderate or conservative element seems to have had a small majority in the usual balance of parties, but the forward men made up for inferiority in numbers by warmth and assiduity. The fervor of the forward party in the Parliament was stimulated by fanaticism out of doors; by cries that their gold had become dim, the ways of Zion filled with mourning, and a dry wind, but neither to fan nor to cleanse, upon the land; above all, by the assurances of the preachers that the four monarchies of Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, of Alexander and Rome, had each of them passed away, and that the day had come for the Fifth and final Monarchy, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ upon the earth; and this no mere reign set up in men's hearts, but a scheme for governing nations and giving laws for settling liberty, property, and the foundations of a commonwealth.

"The fidelity of the convention to Cromwell was shown by the unanimous vote that placed him on the council of state; but the great dictator kept himself in the background, and in good faith hoping against hope, he let things take their course. 'I am more troubled now,' he said, 'with the fool than with the knave.' The new men at once and without leave took to themselves the name of Parliament. Instead of carrying on their special business of a constituent assembly they set to work with a will at legislation; and legislation, moreover, in the high temper of root-and-branch, for cursed is he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently. A bill was run through all its stages in a single sitting for the erection of a high court of justice in cases where a jury could not be trusted to convict. . . . Before they had been a month in session they passed a resolution that the Court of Chancery should be wholly taken away and abolished; and after three bills had been brought in and dropped for carrying this resolution into act they read a second time a fourth bill for summarily deciding cases then pending, and arranging that for the future the ordinary suits in chancery should be promptly dispatched at a cost of from twenty to forty shillings. They set a committee without a lawyer upon it to work on the reduction of the formless mass of laws, cases, and precedents to a code that should be of no greater bigness than a pocket-book. The power of patrons to present to livings was taken away, though patronage was as much property as land. More vital aspects of the church question followed. A committee reported in favor of the appointment of a body of state commissioners with power to eject unfit ministers and fill vacant livings, and what was a more burning issue, in favor of the maintenance of tithe as of legal obligation. By a majority of two the House disagreed with the report, and so indicated their intention to abolish tithe and the endowment of ministers of religion by the state.

## The Crisis.

"This led to the crisis. The effect of proceedings so singularly devised for the settlement of the nation was to irritate and alarm all the nation's most powerful elements. The army, the lawyers, the clergy, the holders of property, all felt themselves attacked; and the lord general himself perceived, in his own words afterward, that the issue of his assembly would have been the subversion of the laws and of all the liberties of their nation—in short, the confusion of all things; and instead of order to set up the judicial law of Moses in abrogation of all our administrations. The design that shone so radiantly five months before had sunken aways in clouds and vain chimera. . . .

"The narrow division on the abolition of tithe convinced everybody that the ship was water-logged. Sunday, December 11, was passed in the concoction of devices for bringing the life of the notables to an end. On Monday the speaker took the chair at an early hour, and a motion was promptly made that the sitting of the Parliament was no longer for the public good, and that therefore they should deliver up to the lord general the powers they had received from him. An attempt to debate was made, but as no time was to be lost, in case of members arriving in numbers sufficient to carry a hostile motion, the speaker rose from his chair, told the sergeant to shoulder the mace, and, followed by some forty members in the secret, set forth in solemn procession to Whitehall. A minority kept their seats until a couple of colonels with a file of soldiers came to turn them out. According to a Royalist story, one of the colonels asked them what they were doing. 'We are seeking the Lord,' was the answer. 'Then you should go elsewhere,' the colonel replied, 'for to my certain knowledge the Lord has not been here these twelve years past.' . . . Oliver received the speaker and his retinue with genuine or feigned surprise but accepted the burden of power that the abdication of the Parliament had once more laid upon him."

The utter failure of this attempt of the religious leaders of Cromwell's day to run the government for the good of the commonwealth was not due to any lack of piety, zeal, or sincerity on their part. They were as well qualified for such a task as are the church leaders of to-day. But, as is pointed out by Mr. Morley, "the vast and complex task of human government needs more than spiritual enthusiasm," and "to have 'very Scriptural notions' is not enough for the reform of stubborn earthly things." The kingdom of God and the kingdoms of earth are essentially different, and the rules of government of the former will not apply in the latter. Earthly governments can be successfully administered only on a purely secular basis.
