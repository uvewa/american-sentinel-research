THE Salem Baptist Association of Jefferson County, Ill., in session at Mount Vernon, Ill., September 1, made an attack upon the State Normal schools because of their secular character, and adopted resolutions declaring these institutions to be un-American, and that they ought to be turned into insane asylums and orphans' homes.

Well, suppose religious teaching were introduced in these State schools, what religion should it be? Which sects should be given the preference? How could religious teaching be introduced without bringing in sectarian controversy? and how would such a state of things make the schools Christian? Christianity is something quite different from religious controversy.

The State schools are secular, but not un-American. Secular does not mean opposed to Christianity. It means non-religious, but not anti-religious. Make the State schools religious and immediately they become anti-religious as regards other religions than that favored by them. If Protestant, they become anti-Catholic, and *vice versa*, and children not conforming to the religious views adopted must be excluded. How would this make the State schools more American than they are when they admit children of every religious connection and exclude none?

State schools are for the public, and have no right to exclude any class of pupils from their privileges. If they do, they at once become un-American.
