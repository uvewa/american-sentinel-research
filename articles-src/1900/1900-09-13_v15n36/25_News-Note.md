When somebody commits a crime, which possibly results in the loss of a human life, the proper course to pursue is to gather the residents of the neighborhood and take immediate vengeance upon him, at the cost of several more lives taken in assaulting his place of refuge or confinement. This is the wisdom (!) of the mob spirit.
