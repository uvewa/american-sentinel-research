Only a short time since a man and a woman were convicted in Nashville, Tenn., of arson upon the evidence of a boy who under hypnotic influence related very circumspectly just how the crime was committed, and by whom the deed was done. The judge in setting aside the verdict said: "To my mind the witness is nothing more than the wall from which the echo of the clairvoyant is thrown into the case. If such doctrines as these were once recognized by the courts of the country in their dealings with life and liberty, it would be alarming to contemplate the injustice and oppression possible and probable to result in the very name of justice itself, against which human reason and knowledge would be utterly powerless to defend itself."

Of course the accused persons may have been guilty, but better a thousand times that the crime go unpunished than that our courts adopt the policy of admitting such evidence. The Tennessee judge did right in setting aside a verdict secured on such evidence.
