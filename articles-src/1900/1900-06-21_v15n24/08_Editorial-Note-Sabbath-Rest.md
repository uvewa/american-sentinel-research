The state has no right to enforce the right of Sabbath rest, or any other right of the people, upon the people. When the state attempts to enforce rights, it fails to preserve them. To preserve a right is not to compel an individual to exercise that right, but to compel other persons to refrain from interfering with the individual touching the exercise of that right; and the state has no more right to interfere than have the people whom it restrains in this respect.
