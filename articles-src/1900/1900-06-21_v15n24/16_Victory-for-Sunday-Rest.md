(Chicago Chronicle, May 24.)

It is gratifying to note that the city council of Miles City, Mont., shares in the enlightened belief that the toiler should have one day in seven in which to recruit his exhausted energies, to indulge in harmless recreation or to attend devotional services. The Miles City council believes that Sunday should be a day of rest, even though the cessation of labor on that day should involve some inconvenience to the community at large. The council is a humane body.

For, the saloon-keepers of Miles City, having petitioned the council for permission to close their places of business on Sunday—alleging brain fag as the result of overwork—the council granted the request after due deliberation.

The concession was no small one. As is well known, the wet goods business is the foremost industry of Miles City and it was no light matter thus to sanction its entire suspension one day in seven.

As one member of the council pointed out, it was not only possible but probable that citizens would feel the need of a drink on Sunday. "What will they do?" he demanded—answering his own question with the gloomy and ominous prediction: "They will go to neighboring towns to get it," thus diverting commerce to rival municipalities and seriously disturbing the balance of trade.

But philanthropy and humanity prevailed over mere sordid considerations. The debate was animated, but in the end Sunday rest triumphed. The overworked saloon-keepers are to have one day in which to recuperate for the arduous labors of the other six.

In the meantime let us hope that the humane councilmen will not be allowed to suffer as the result of their generous action.

The Christian church being the body of Christ, as scripturally defined, it no more needs the support of the state than does Christ himself; and to advocate its support by the state is to advocate an alliance between the world and God.
