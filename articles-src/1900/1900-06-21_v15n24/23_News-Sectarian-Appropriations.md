March 3, 1897, Congress enacted the following general law touching sectarian appropriations:

"It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Government of the United States to make no appropriation of money or property for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding by payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church or religious denomination, or any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control; and it is hereby enacted that, from and after the 30th day of June, 1898, no money appropriated for charitable purposes in the District of Columbia shall be paid to any church or religious denomination, or to any institution or society which is under sectarian or ecclesiastical control."

June 4, 1900, the House of Representatives had under consideration an appropriation for the support of St. Joseph's Asylum, a Roman Catholic institution in the District of Columbia. On the strength of the action taken in 1897, Representative Bingham of Pennsylvania opposed the proposed appropriation. Mr. Fitzgerald of Massachusetts spoke in favor of making the appropriation notwithstanding the general law, and "predicted the rise of a Catholic party if the persecution of the Catholic sectarian institutions continued."

It seems rather strange that any one should term an effort to make a church support its own charities "persecution." The prediction of a "Catholic party" may be realized, but it would seem that in order to hope for any success it would need something more substantial and more just in the way of an issue than the fact of opposition to the support of church institutions out of the public treasury.
