To take possession of Pekin, depose the empress of China, and proclaim an international protectorate over the empire, is now advocated as the only course open to the "powers," including the United States, in view of the reign of terror that has been inaugurated over a vast section of China by the "Boxers." The latter of course will have to be put down, and as they are now said to number several millions, it may be that a war of considerable dimensions will soon be in progress in that section of Asia. The attempt to establish an international protectorate over China, should the powers decide on such a step, can hardly fail to intensify the rivalry of the powers over the prize of Chinese territory and trade; and thus with tremendous rapidity the world is being hastened toward momentous events to be revealed in connection with the breaking up of the oldest empire upon the earth.
