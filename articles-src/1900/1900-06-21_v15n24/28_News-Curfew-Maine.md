The curfew ordinance for lessening crime in the cities has not proved a success in the State of Maine. So we are informed by the Springfield Republican (Mass.), which says that in Maine cities which adopted the ordinance it was found that "an increased police force was needed to enforce it, and rather than pay the cost of a larger force, the law has become more or less of a dead letter." The Republican adds that "the popular attitude toward the prohibition law in that State appears to be much the same."
