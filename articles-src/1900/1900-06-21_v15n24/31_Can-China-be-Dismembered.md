"It has apparently been taken for granted since the Japanese-Chinese war that China is to be partitioned among the European powers", says the Evening News of the 14th inst. "Every step since taken, every aggression or concession, has pointed to this ultimate solution of the Chinese question. Scarcely has any one questioned whether this is possible. The only problem seemed to be as to how this partition of the most populous empire of the world could be satisfactorily accomplished.

"But events in China the last few weeks have already suggested to more than one thoughtful European observer the difficulties that lie in the way of the execution of this scheme. The Paris Soleil, for instance, as quoted in the special cable to The Daily News yesterday says: 'France has every reason to defend China's integrity. The idea of the dismemberment of China is one of the most extravagant notions that ever entered the human brain.'

"Is the notion extravagant? Think it over a few minutes and reflect what Japan, a pygmy nation compared with China, has been able to do within the past quarter of a century, and then think of what China might do, once it, like Japan, should be thoroughly wakened up. Its swarming millions could overrun the world once they were imbued with modern progress and the desire of conquest. Those who assume that China will submit like another India may be basing their conclusions upon false premises. The question as to what China may do if it awakes is a legitimate one and may soon disturb diplomats now dreaming of its dismemberment."

It seems to be improbable that the Chinese themselves will be able to offer any very serious resistance to the partition of the empire; but it is doubtful if the Powers can agree among themselves as to just how it shall be divided.
