In an address to the Knights Templars of the District of Columbia, May 27, Rev. Dr. Williams of Washington is reported to have said:

"I look forward to the time when we shall have to draw swords against religious intolerance and oppression, just as our ancestors enlisted under the banner of the cross for the relief of their suffering fellow Christians in the far East. The conditions which aroused their enthusiasm and added fuel to the flames of their ardor even now exist in the East, where profession of Christianity is attended with great dangers and the holy places of our faith are in the possession of the unspeakable Turk, the arch-conspirator, whom, for motives of policy, Christian Europe dare not expel to the wastes of Asia, whence he came."

Upon which an editor, not having the fear of National Reform and "righteousness" by act of state and national legislatures before his eyes, remarks that "it would be more consistent for Christians to defer the assault on Islam until equal rights are made secure in all Christian countries."
