A "championship" game of baseball which was to have been played Sunday, June 10, at Youngstown, O., was stopped by an injunction issued by a judge of that place at the instance of a portion of the church element. A decision in the case is expected shortly. A recent decision in a similar case in Michigan condemned Sunday baseball on the ground of being a disturbance, but intimated that in itself the game is a lawful form of amusement on any day of the week.
