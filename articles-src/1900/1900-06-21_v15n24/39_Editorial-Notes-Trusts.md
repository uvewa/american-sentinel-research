The latest exhibition by the trust octopus is a cornering of freight traffic on the great lakes. The Standard Oil combine has purchased or rented nearly all the large vessels employed in the lake freight commerce and tied them up at the docks, in order to raise freight rates on ore and other commodities to an exhorbitant figure.
