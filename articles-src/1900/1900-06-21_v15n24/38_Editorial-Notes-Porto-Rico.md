A New York City court to which appeal was taken from the action of the New York board of appraisers in assessing a duty on tobacco from Porto Rico, has rendered a decision declaring that Porto Rico is a part of the United States so far as other countries are concerned, but a foreign country so far as the United States Constitution is concerned. This is simply to say that Porto Rico is a province under an imperial government, for how else could it occupy the peculiar position here affirmed of it? Thus it appears that the courts are beginning to fall into line with the other branches of the Government in supporting the imperial policy.
