A writer for the Sabbath Recorder says in a recent number of that paper: "I think that it is quite generally conceded that the Sunday desecration so much talked about and so much lamented, is due very largely to a loss of conviction in regard to the sacredness of the Sunday. I lament very much this spirit, not because thereby the Sunday is desecrated, but because it indicates, as I fear, a general tendency to hold the Bible and religious beliefs lightly; it indicates, as I have said, the want of a deep, strong conviction in reference to the religious life."

It is certainly true in large measure that Sunday desecration is due "to loss of conviction in regard to Sunday sacredness." But this would not result in "a general tendency to hold the Bible and religious beliefs lightly" were it not for the fact that in attempting to foist upon the world a false Sabbath, religious teachers have been compelled to discredit in a measure the Bible, which teaches something quite different. It is little wonder that when the ministers themselves trample upon the Bible Sabbath, the people generally pay but little regard to the substitute.
