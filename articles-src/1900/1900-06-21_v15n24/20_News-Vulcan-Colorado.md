The Vulcan (Colo.) Times wants to know "by what constitutional right do states pass Sunday laws at the behest of a combination of preachers?"

There can be but one answer to this question: there is no such right. The Times truly says: "As far as constitutional right is concerned, a man has a civil right to worship how and when he pleases, and to labor whenever it pleases him to do so."

"But," continues the Times, "even in Colorado there is a law on the statute books which imposes a fine of fifty dollars for working on Sunday, and the combined church element is at work manufacturing a public sentiment that will enable them to enforce it, it being only a 'concealed weapon' at present. If the above element succeed, and they will, then farewell to the boasted religious liberty of America, and give greeting to the faggot and the dungeon."
