COMPTROLLER COLER of New York very truly says: "All of our bad citizens are not among the uneducated classes; in fact, the most dangerous person in the community is the highly educated man of great ability who uses his talents not for the good of the community as a whole, but to advance the private interests of himself and those he represents at the cost of the public rights of the people."

This is right in line with the conclusion reached by Dr. Wines and President Gates in their papers on "Dangerous Classes in a Republic," read before the New York State Conference of Religion.
