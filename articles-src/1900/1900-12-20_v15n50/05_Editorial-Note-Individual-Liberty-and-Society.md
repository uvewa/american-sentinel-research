It has been said that "the liberty of the individual ceases where the rights of society begin." But this is an error. Rights never come in conflict. Governments are for the preservation, not for the deprivation, of rights. It is for this very purpose that governments are instituted. The rights of society do not conflict with the liberty of the individual. The liberty of the individual does not cease where the rights of society begin. The liberty of the individual ceases only where the rights of society are invaded.
