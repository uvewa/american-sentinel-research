In a recent article in the Independent (New York), Hon. John W. Foster, ex-Secretary of State, says some very significant things. Referring to the "necessity to find new and enlarged markets for our agricultural and manufactured products," Mr. Foster says:

"It is this condition of affairs which has secured the general support of the country to Secretary Hay's statesmanlike policy of 'the open door' in China. The same sentiment has operated, although possibly in a subordinate degree, to vindicate the unprecedented act of our Executive in sending a considerable army into a country with which we were nominally at peace, without the constitutional warrant of legislation by Congress, and aiding in taking possession by force of that nation's capital. And upon this sentiment more than any other the President must rely for support for his act of breaking with all the precedents of our foreign relations in joining a concert of European nations to arbitrarily determine the destiny of a great empire with which we have heretofore maintained the most friendly relations. I do not write this to criticise the conduct of our Government in the Orient. Far from it. Its conduct up to the present in Chinese affairs has been wise and prudent, and has commanded the approval of all good citizens. My object is to emphasize the fact that the public sentiment of the country is prepared to indorse such extreme and even violent measures to keep the markets of the world open to our farmers and manufacturers."

It should be borne in mind that these are not the words of a critic of the administration, but quite the contrary. The circumstances, in Mr. Foster's view, fully justified the President in "sending a considerable army into a country with which we were nominally at peace, without the constitutional warrant of legislation by Congress, and aiding in taking possession by force of that nation's capital."

In so saying Mr. Foster does not of course intend to question either the constitutional right or the bounden duty of the President to rescue if possible the members of the United States legation; but there his ordinary power under the Constitution ended, and his extraordinary power under "public sentiment" began. True, the President had power to call Congress together, but he did not, so all the proceedings of this Government in China since the rescue of Minister Conger, have been extra-constitutional, that is, outside of and beyond the Constitution.

It matters not, so far as the principle is concerned, that, as Mr. Foster says, the action of the Government "up to the present in Chinese affairs has been wise and prudent." The fact remains, as Mr. Foster also states, that it is upon "public sentiment" rather than upon the Constitution that "the President must rely for support for his act of breaking with all precedents of our foreign relations in joining a concert of European nations to arbitrarily determine the destiny of a great empire with which we have heretofore maintained the most friendly relations."

And what is the source of the "public sentiment" that is back of these extra-constitutional measures? The same thing exactly that is back of the sentiment which sustains the English government in its war upon the South African republics; namely, the commercial spirit. "My object," says Mr. Foster, "is to emphasize the fact that the public sentiment of the country is prepared to indorse such extreme and even violent measures to keep the markets of the world open to our farmers and manufacturers."

There was a time when the American people were too jealous of their liberties to brook any departure from the strict letter of the Constitution; but times have changed, and now "public sentiment" will not suffer so trifling a thing as the Constitution to stand in the way of "material progress."

Like Mr. Foster, we have no disposition "to criticise the Government." The President and his advisers have only done what the people demanded that they should do. It is the people who have estimated the relative value of money and of liberty, and they have put the dollar above the man. In harmony with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution was framed to safeguard human rights. In harmony with the spirit of commercialism, "public sentiment" demands that the Government shall safeguard first of all the avenues of trade and the dollars that circulate therein. The times are upon us foretold by Jefferson when of the people he said: "They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money."
