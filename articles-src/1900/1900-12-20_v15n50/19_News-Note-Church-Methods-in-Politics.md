SPEAKING of the impractical methods of the church in politics, Bird S. Coler says:

"The politician begins down among the people, in a barroom or the open air, and works up to a club. The church too often begins with a club and works down to a failure."

But this is only because the church is not commissioned to do political work. The work of the church is to make good men, not to exploit them in the field of politics after they are made. The preacher who carries the vote of his church in his vest pocket is not less dangerous, nor is he probably much better, than the ward "boss." To state it as mildly as possible, he is out of his place and on dangerous ground.
