The News, of Salt Lake City, has this to say about attacks recently made upon the Roman Catholic Church by leading Methodists:

"There is no need of us [sic] taking up the defense of the Roman Catholic Church. That body is strong enough to fight its own battles. But the principle of religious liberty is involved, and an assault upon that principle should not go without rebuke. Those who would deny others the privilege of worshiping God according to the dictates of their conscience, are ignorant of one of the fundamental principles that has attained recognition through long contests and many sacrifices on the part of the noblest men and women the world ever saw. Their agitation may become a menace to free institutions.

When religious liberty is broken down there is no barrier between political liberty and its assailants. One will perish with the other."

We do not understand fully the nature of the "assault" referred to, but if it consists only in attacking by voice and pen the dogmas and practices of the Catholic Church, or of any other church, it is certainly not in violation of religious liberty.
