A PORTION at least of the Roman Catholic press of the country has taken alarm at one passage in the President's message. The Monitor says:

"President McKinley, in his message to Congress, speaks of a thorough investigation into the subject of the property holdings of the religious orders in the Philippines. This is a needless and unwarranted reflection on the religious organizations in question. There is vastly more property owned by the Catholic Church in this country, in proportion to the number of its adherents, than in the Philippines. The property in both cases has been acquired and accumulated in substantially the same way.

"Suppose bigots here should set up a hue and cry anent the 'wealth' of the Church in America and impute its ownership to dishonest methods? Would the administration deem it expedient to investigate such charges? Under the terms of the Paris treaty the property rights of the Church in the Philippines stand precisely on the same basis as those in the United States. The Government treads on dangerous ground when it oversteps the conditions of its own compact, which, in common with all treaties, becomes the fundamental law of the land."

We do not pretend to know the facts relative to this property. It would seem that under the Paris treaty the laws under which the property is held by "the church" must settle the question. If the property was acquired by "due process of law," however unjust that law may have been, the Government will find itself powerless to touch it under the treaty which is a part of "the supreme law of the land." Rome foresaw the difficulty and provided for it in the treaty.
