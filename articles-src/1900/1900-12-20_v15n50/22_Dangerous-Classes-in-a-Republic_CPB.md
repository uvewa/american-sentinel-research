This is one of the subjects considered at the New York State Conference of Religion, and papers were read upon it by Dr. Fred. Howard Wines, of the Census Office, Washington, D. C., and President George A. Gates, D. D., of Iowa College.

Such was the agreement between these papers that the second gentleman felt called upon to remark that Dr. Wines' paper rendered some portions of his unnecessary, but that each had written without any knowledge of the views of the other. In view of this fact the agreement was certainly remarkable.

The gentlemen agreed that the dangerous classes were not the poor, the unemployed; not the paupers, nor even the "criminal classes," but the moneyed and landed aristocracy that is rapidly gathering to itself the great bulk of the wealth of the country. Not only immensely wealthy men, but gigantic corporations are pooling their issues until well-nigh every industrial and commercial interest is controlled by them, and not only the people, but even the laws are exploited in the interests of the trusts.

The result is first discontent, and then contempt and even hatred of law. So that at the doors of the wealthy must be laid the responsibility for the unrest, the spirit of lawlessness, and for much of the crime of to-day; and to find the dangerous classes we must go not to our asylums, our jails, our State's prisons, but to Wall Street, to the stock exchange, to the board of trade, to the chamber of commerce, etc. The dangerous classes are the men who exploit the people for gain.
