"At a meeting of ministers representing three different denominations—Congregational, Methodist and Baptist—held recently in the Y. M. A. lecture-room," says a daily paper, "it was decided to hold three Sunday afternoon mass-meetings to rouse the city to the importance of making provision for the unfortunates who are affected by the recent order of the mayor, which closes dens and basement dives in response to the crusade for purity." This action speaks well for the ministers concerned. Many of the poor creatures driven from the dives are more unfortunate than vicious, and to simply drive them to the streets will do neither them nor the city any good. If Christian people will only extend to them a helping hand they will be doing real reform work.
