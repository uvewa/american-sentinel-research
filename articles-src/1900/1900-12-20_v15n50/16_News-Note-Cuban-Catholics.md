A ROMAN CATHOLIC paper says that "those 'prominent' Cubans who have put themselves on record as not approving of Mgr. Sbarretti, as Bishop of Havana, belong to a class which is constitutionally averse to all bishops, priests, and to religion itself." This may be true, but it is well to remember that it has long been the habit of Rome to brand as "infidels" all those who oppose "the church."
