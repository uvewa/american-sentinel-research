In connection with a Methodist revival effort at Titusville, Pa., a move is being made to close all business places in that city on Sunday. It is declared to be the intention of the leaders in this move to enforce the Sunday law upon all classes of Sunday desecrators. This is taken to mean trouble for some people living there who observe the seventh day, as the Sunday law of Pennsylvania makes no exception in such cases.

It strikes us that the arresting and locking up of people in jail is a curious proceeding to accompany a revival of Christianity. In all Christian revivals that we know of there has never been manifest any such thing as this. There has been no spirit to demand such a thing. On the contrary, the spirit that took possession of the people at such times has been one of gentleness and love, as was the spirit manifested by Him from whom Christianity takes its name. The effort was not to cast men into physical bondage, but to set them free from spiritual bondage—not to give them less liberty, but more liberty. And if we know anything of the spirit of Christianity, it is the spirit of the fullest liberty, always.

We fear there is something wrong with a revival effort which calls upon the civil power to supplement its work by inflicting legal penalties upon those regarded as sinners. A true revival seeks not to condemn men, but to save them.
