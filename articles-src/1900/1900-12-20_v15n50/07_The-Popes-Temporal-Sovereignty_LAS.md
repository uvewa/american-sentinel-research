In a recent discourse in Washington, D. C., Archbishop Ireland touched on the subject of the temporal sovereignty of the Pope, which he predicted would soon be restored by "the Italian people and Christendom at large."

In attempting to show the necessity of temporal sovereignty for the Roman pontiff, the Archbishop said:

"If the Pope is a civil subject of an authority outside of himself he has not the necessary freedom. The ruler or government would interfere, make laws impairing his freedom of action, or strive to impose methods more serviceable to the state than the church. The Pontiff's words must bear no possible suspicion that they were imposed by men who have no authority in things moral and spiritual. If the sovereign Pontiff be the subject of the King of Italy what guarantee is there for other peoples and other rulers that, whether through fear or favor, Italian influences have not penetrated into the Vatican, and that Italian interests are not to be served? The peril of national jealousies would be the greater were the foreign countries at the time warring with the King of Italy. We, in America, are willing indeed to hearken to the words of Peter, but it must be plain that they are not the words of a foreign ruler, whose sole purpose is the interest of a foreign nationality, not of the church.

"The dependence of a bishop upon the civil ruler severs him from union with Christians in other countries, reduces his church to the condition of a national church, and disrupts the oneness of the universal church. Other churches than the Catholic do not demand civil independence and temporal power for their chieftains because no other church than the Catholic is a world church."

From the assumption that the Pope is the head of the church, and is its infallible guide in faith and morals, all this that the Archbishop says follows naturally enough. The assumption of the Pope to be the spiritual leader of the church demands that he be also a temporal sovereign, for the reasons here stated. He who supports the papal system is logically bound to advocate the restoration of the temporal sovereignty.

No man in the Protestant church claims to be the church's head and spiritual guide; hence the Protestant system of religion calls for no temporal sovereign and has no occasion to contend for sovereignty with earthly powers. The head of the Protestant church is Jesus Christ, whose liberty is untrammeled by earthly sovereigns, and whose action is altogether above any suspicion of being influenced not only by fear or favor, but by the ignorance and prejudice which are more or less characteristic of every human mind. s.
