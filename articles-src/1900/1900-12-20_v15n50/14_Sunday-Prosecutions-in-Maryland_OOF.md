The spirit of religious liberty does not seem to have wholly triumphed in the State of Maryland yet. On the twenty-seventh day of November, Mr. J. H. Rhodes and Mr. Harry Curlett (Seventh-day Adventists) were summoned to appear before a magistrate to answer the charge of working on Sunday. These men were residents of Winchester, Md. But as the local magistrate was a brother-in-law to Mr. Rhodes, he requested that the men be tried before the magistrate in Queenstown.

When the time came for trial the defendants presented a request that their cases be waived for trial at the county court next May. This the magistrate granted, but in so doing said that in order to do this the costs must be paid. This they did, and the cases were carried over. It is probable that the cases will never be called up again, for the law of Maryland states that charges for Sunday labor shall be tried before a magistrate.

These prosecutions were started by opposing religious factions. A minister of the Methodist Protestant Church told his members that if they did not take steps to stop this Sunday work he would have to take it up himself. And so spies went to work and soon found Mr. Rhodes, who is the elder of the Seventh-day Adventist church in Winchester, or Ford's Store, and who had sacredly kept the seventh day, at work painting on his house, and making no more noise than the swish of his paint brush, and they immediately hastened off to the constable and led him around to where he could see with his own eyes that Sunday was being desecrated.

But how to sustain a charge against Mr. Curlett was a puzzle till a man stepped forth who said he did not want any thing to do with the case, but he could not lie, and he could witness to having seen Mr. Curlett assisting Mr. Rhodes. "All right," said the magistrate, "I summon you as a witness."

So these men, honest in their conviction of duty to fulfil the command of God, "Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work," are now under bonds to answer to the county court for having faithfully followed the command of God. No one was disturbed, for no noise was heard. So that religious intolerance is at the foundation of the whole thing. When will professed Christians learn to show the spirit of the Author of Christianity, who said, "If any man hear my word and believe not, I judge him not"? Again the same divine Spirit asks the question, "Who art thou that judgment another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth."
