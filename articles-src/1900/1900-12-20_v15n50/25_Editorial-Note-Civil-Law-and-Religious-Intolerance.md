Civil injustice and religious intolerance have ever intrenched themselves behind mere statutes, misnaming them laws. "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die," said the Jews when accusing the Saviour of men. It was civil "law" that cast the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace, that consigned Daniel to the lion's den, that put to death the apostles, that gave to the wild beasts the early Christians, that clothed with authority the Inquisition and carried out its cruel decrees, that burned Huss and Jerome, and tortured and put to death millions of martyrs in the Dark Ages, that whipped, banished, and hanged Quakers and Baptists in New England and Virginia, and that even to-day fines and imprisons in various places honest, God-fearing men for practical dissent from the prevailing practice touching proper Sabbath observance.
