(Concluded.)

As already stated, it was natural that the Quakers, proscribed in all the other colonies, and persecuted to the death in Massachusetts, should rendezvous in Rhode Island. The records say: "The number of Quakers in Rhode Island constantly increased. Horace Gardner, who was flogged and imprisoned by the authorities at Boston in May, 1658, was an inhabitant of Newport in Rhode Island. Thomas Harris, who was imprisoned and repeatedly flogged the following month, had moved from Barbadoes to Rhode Island. Catherine Scot, who was imprisoned for two weeks and publicly flogged in the autumn of the same year, was the wife of Richard Scot of Providence. William Robinson, the first Quaker put to death, had been 'moved by the Lord to go from Rhode Island to bear witness in Massachusetts.' His companion at the gallows, Marmaduke Stevenson, came by way of Rhode Island from Barbadoes. Mary Dyer, the only woman put to death, was wife of William Dyer, secretary of Providence plantation."—Page 8, Introduction to "George Fox Digged out of His Burrows." Under these circumstances, we might expect some protest would come to Rhode Island from Massachusetts. It came in the form of a "Letter from the Commissioners of the United Colonies to Rhode Island, concerning the Quakers." We will give it complete in its quaint spelling and punctuation.

## Letter of the Massachusetts Commissioners.

"The Commissioners being informed that divers Quakers are arrived this summer at Rode Island, and entertained there, which may prove dangerous to the Colonies, thought meet to manifest their minds to the Governor there as followeth:

"Gent: We suppose you have understood that the last years a company of Quakers arrived at Boston upon no other account than to disperse their pernicious opinions had they not been prevented by the prudent care of the government, whose by that experience they had of them, being sensible of the danger that might befall the Christian Religion here professed by suffering such to be received or continued in the country, presented the same unto the Commissioners at their meeting in Plymouth, whose upon that occasion commended it unto the General Courts of the United Colonies, that all Quakers, Ranters, and such noted heretiques might be prohibited coming among us; and that if such should arise from among ourselves, speedy care bee taken to remove them (and as we are informed), the several jurisdictions have made provision accordingly. But it is by experience found that means will fall short without further care by reason of your admission and receiving of such, from whence they may have opportunity to creep in among us, or means to infuse and spread the accused tenets to the great trouble of the colonies if not to the subversion of the laws professed in them.

"Notwithstanding our care which hath hitherto taken to prevent the same, whereof wee can not but bee very sensible, and think noe eare too great to preserve us from such a pest, the contageon whereof (if received) within your Collonie were dangerous, &c., to be difused to the other by meanse of the intercourse especially to the place of trade amongst us. Wee therefore make it a request that you as well as the rest of the colonies take such order herein that your neighbors be free from that danger; and that you remove those Quakers that have been received, and for the future prohibit them coming amongst you; whereunto the rule of charity to yourselves and to us (we conceave) doth oblige you, wherein if you should, we hope you will not bee found wantinge; yet wee could not but signifie this oure desire; and further declare that we apprehend that it will bee oure duty seriously to consider what further provisions God may call us to make to prevent the aforesaid mischief. And for oure further guidance and direction herein, wee desire you to impart your mind and resolution to the General Court of Massachusetts which assembleth the 14th of October next; wee have not further to trouble you att present, but to assure you wee desire to continue your loving friends and neighbours, the Commissioners of the United Colonies, Boston, September 12, 1657.

"SIMON BRADSTREET, President."

## Points of Interest in the Letter.

This letter is of interest, not only because of its quaintness, but also because it betrays their genuine anxiety, and their absolute ignorance of the fact that the truth itself has power to defend itself against error. Incidentally it reveals the fact that the spiritual truths which the Quakers taught did have power in contrast with the stiff formality of the old New England worship. The letter contains a covert threat of friendship withheld and the privilege of trade denied if the request was refused. It makes plain the fact that Roger Williams, hating the Quakers as he did, and earnestly desiring the trade and friendly relations of all the colonies, had his principles of liberty put to the strongest possible test.

To this letter the government of the Colony of Rhode Island replied in a quite lengthy epistle. First they stated their desire to live on terms of peace and loving correspondence with all the colonies, and "to return to the other colonies such as fly from the hands of justice for matters of crime done or committed against you." "And as concerning these Quakers which are among us, we have no laws whereby to punish any for only declaring by words, &c., theire minds and understandings concerning the things and ways of God, as to salvation and eternal conditions. And we moreover finde that in those places where these people aforesaid in this colonie are most of all suffered to declare themselves freely, and are only opposed by arguments in discourse, there they least of all desire to come. * * * And yet we conceive that their doctrines tend to very absolute cutting downe and overturninge relations and civil governments among men, if generally received." Then follows a statement of their intentions of bringing the matter to the attention of the General Assembly of the colony to meet the next March.

## Rhode Island's Reply.

This letter, in contrast to the one from Massachusetts, shows plainly the belief of Roger Williams and his associates in the fact that truth itself is king in the realm of thought, and that it can conquer all opponents. The General Assembly of Rhode Island considered the matter, and here is their reply:

"Honoured Gentlemen: There hath been presented to our view by our Honoured President, a letter bearing date of September 12th last, subscribed by the Honoured Gentlemen Commissioners of the United Colloneys concerninge a companie of people (lately arrived in these parts of the world) commonly known as Quakers, who are generally conceived pernicious, either intentionally, or at leastwise in effect, even to the corrupting of good manners and disturbing the common peace and society of the place where they arise or resort unto, &c.

"Now, whereas, freedom of different consciences to be protected from enforcement was the principal ground of our Charter, both with respect to our humble suit for it, as also to the true intent of the Honourable and renowned Parliament of England in granting of the same unto us; which freedom we still prize as the greatest happiness man can possess in this world. Therefore we shall, for the preservation of our civil peace and order, the more seriously take notice that these people and any others that are here, or shall come amongst us, be impartially required, and to our utmost constrayned to perform all duties requisite toward the mainetaineinge the right of his Highness, and of the government of that most renowned Parliament of England in this Colony, which is most happily included under the same dominion, and graciously taken unto the protection thereof. And in case they, the sayd Quakers which are here, or who shall arise or come amongst us, doe refuse to subject themselves to all duties aforesaid, as trayninge, watchinge, and such other engagements, as other members of civil societys for the preservation of the same in justice and peace; then we determine, yea, and we resolve to take and make use of the first opportunity to inform our agents residing in England that we may humbly present the matter unto the supreme authority in England, humbly craving their advice and order how to carry ourselves in any further respect toward this people so that therewithal there may be no damage or infringement of that chief principle in our Charter concerning freedom of conscience; and we also are so much the more encouraged to make our address unto the Lord Protector his Highness and government aforesaid; for that we understand there are or have been many of the foresayed people suffered to live in England, yea even in the heart of the nation. And thus with our truly thankful acknowledgements of the honourable care of the honoured gentlemen, Commissioners of the United Colonies, for the peace and welfare of the whole country, as is expressed in their most friendly letter, we shall at present take leave and rest. Yours, most affectionately desirous of your honour and welfare.

JOHN SAFFORD, Clerk of the Assembly."

They Needed No Government.

This letter is a masterpiece of diplomacy. It boldly declares their determination that all things shall be done so as to maintain, and not to infringe their chief and dearest principle of liberty of conscience. It admits that the problem is a grave one, and asserts the intention of falling back for advice upon the mother country, of which, at that time, Massachusetts was tacitly asserting its independence.

There is no record that the Quakers were ever "constrayned to take part in the trayninges and watchinges." At one time when a number of the commissioners of Rhode Island Colony were at Providence, in the house of Thomas Olney, Roger Williams propounded to them the following question: "We have a people here amongst us who will not act in our government with us: What course shall we take with them?" Then George Cartwright, one of the commissioners, asked him what manner of persons they were? 'Do they live quietly and peaceably amongst you?' This they could not deny. Then he made this answer: 'If they can govern themselves they have no need of your government.' This is a true indication of the attitude of Williams towards the Quakers. Though they became so numerous that in 1661, when the General Meeting was established in Rhode Island, in Massachusetts grave apprehensions were aroused "that the Quakers were gathering together to kill the people and fire the town of Boston," yet, though hating them as he did, Williams never invoked against them the civil power.

Williams Debates with the Quakers.

When George Fox was in Providence, Williams did not attempt to meet him, for on a previous occasion he had gone into the Quaker meeting to speak against their teachings, and one of the Quakers was "moved by the Spirit to sing, and another to pray, and a third to dismiss the meeting," and so Williams had no opportunity. After Fox had gone to Newport, Williams sent him a challenge to debate, and he paddled his own canoe the thirty miles to meet the champion of Quakerism. But Fox had gone before the challenge arrived. The debate was held, however, with others of the chief men among the Quakers, and, as is usual in such cases, both sides claimed the victory. Williams published an account of the discussion under the somewhat humorous title, "George Fox Digged out of His Burrows." One reason given by Williams for this debate was his desire to vindicate the colony from the charge of being in alliance with the Quakers—a charge which would naturally be made by Massachusetts, because so many of the Quakers resided in Rhode Island undisturbed. Still, when William Harris, who was a prominent lawyer, and one of the original settlers, sided with the Quakers, and taught that the logical outcome of Williams' doctrine, and also the teaching of the Scripture, was that a Christian could have no part whatever in civil governments, Mr. Williams considered this teaching thus saddled on to him and presented by one of so much influence, as subversive of all authority, and anarchistical in the extreme. So Williams had Harris indicted for high treason, and committed to jail.

## Why Harris Was Indicted.

Here is Williams' own account of it. "William Harris, for politic reasons, turns Generalist, and writes against all Magistrates, Laws, Courts, Charters, Prisons, and Rates, &c., pretending himself and his Saints to be the Higher Powers, and in public writings he stirred up the people most seditiously, and most desperately, threatening to begin at Massachusetts and to cry out no Lords, no Magistrates. This cost myself and the colony much trouble. Myself by speech and writing opposed him, and he was committed for writing against his Magestie's Honor, Prerogative, and Authority. He lay for some time in prison until the General Assembly, where the Quakers (by his wicked, ungodly, and disloyal plots) prevailing, he by their means gets loose, and leaves open a door for any man to challenge the King's Magesty."

This, it is admitted by all authorities, is an unfair statement of the case. Williams evidently misunderstood Mr. Harris. Harris was a man of undoubted probity, and was often trusted with responsibility in the colony. Williams often spoke of the king's charter granting them liberty of conscience. William Harris, with that higher idea of Christian liberty which he got from the Quaker doctrine of the "inner light," wrote against this, and declared that no king could grant liberty of conscience by his laws. His dealings with William Harris brought upon Williams much adverse criticism, and this is the origin of the charge first made by George Fox, himself, that Williams denied his principles, and justified the persecution of the Quakers. The descendants of William Harris, of the seventh generation, still live here in Providence, and are personally known to the writer. They still reiterate this charge, and this led to this investigation. Williams was passionate sometimes, and partial. He had his share of the usual faults of great men, but, though his principles were tested to the utmost, unless this be an exception, he ever remained true to the doctrine of absolute liberty of conscience.
