Hon. Bird S. Coler, Comptroller of New York City, read a paper at the recent New York State Conference of Religion on "The Unused Power of the Churches in Politics." Among other things Mr. Coler said:

"There is a place for the church in politics and public affairs. That fact will not be denied except by those politicians who fear that good influences would crowd them out before they could reform. In my opinion the place for the church as an organized force in temporal affairs is not in the ward meeting, the political convention, or the party council. Its influence should be exerted beneath and beyond those partizan and factional units in our political system.

"When conditions become unbearable we have in the past followed the simple rule of turning out one party and putting in another. This method has never reformed a party or a politician, and it never will produce permanent good government in city, nation, or State. When our political conditions are bad and our public service corrupt or incompetent, the real fault lies beyond partizan policy or factional organization, deep-rooted in untaught and misguided public sentiment. In that broad, neglected field of public opinion, perverted by false teaching, or its moral sense blunted by precept and example—there is the place for church influence in politics.

"To improve civic and political conditions the church must reach the masses, and reach them in the guise of a patient, practical agency for material improvement. I intend no disrespect or levity when I say that I do not believe you can win one vote for good government by telling a man his chances of going to heaven will be improved if he votes a certain ticket on election day. But you can in time win unlimited thousands of votes when you convince the masses of the people that honest and intelligent city government means better material conditions for them."

In brief, Mr. Coler's idea is that the church has no place "in politics" as the term is generally understood. And in this the Comptroller is unquestionably right. The appropriate work of the church is to make good, clean men—men who will be honest in all the walks of life; in the home, in private business and in public office. And this is only incidental; it comes not as the *end*, but as an adjunct of character-building.

The real work of the church is to bring men into harmony with God; to restore in the human soul the image of God. The primary object is to prepare citizens for the everlasting kingdom of God. Of course the more good men there are in any community, the higher will be the moral tone of that community, and thus the church necessarily and inevitably exerts "political" influence; but a church in politics in any other sense than this is a church outside its legitimate domain, acting outside of the gospel commission, and consequently without divine warrant.
