For several years the *Times-Herald* of this city has been collecting criminal statistics, and has just published a table showing the average number of murders committed in each State and Territory in the Union during the last ten years.

The awful total of recorded murders for the decade is 98,790, an annual average of 9,879, or 27.04 (plus) per day, which is more than one murder for each hour of the twenty-four during the entire year, or, in other words, 98,790 murders in 87,660 hours.

Texas heads this horrible list with an annual average of 1,021 murders, or nearly three per day; while Vermont occupies the place of honor, in this instance, the foot of the column, with an annual average of only six homicides.

Nor do these figures tell the whole sad story of the taking of human life. There are doubtless very many murders in the country each year that are never reported as such. It costs money to investigate the cause of death, and for this reason it is frequently not done. The individual dies. Some accommodating physician gives a death certificate based on a description of the "symptoms"; the body is buried, and there the matter ends. Not infrequently "murdered" ought to be written into the space where appears the name of some disease. In many country places a physician's certificate of the cause of death is not even required, and heart failure, apoplexy, acute gastritis, and kindred "diseases," carry off their victims and no questions are asked, and very often there is not even suspicion.

But the known facts are bad enough, to say nothing of what a more rigid system of supervision would almost certainly disclose. Human life is held far too cheaply. The crime of murder has ceased to be regarded with that horror with which it was viewed half a century ago. As one contemplates such an array of figures as that presented by the *Times-Herald* statistical table, one instinctively couples together the Saviour's prediction: "As the days of Noah were, so shall the coming of the Son of man be" (Matt. 24: 37), and the statement of Gen. 6: 13, that in the days of Noah the earth was "filled with violence."

The world is looking for an era of peace, when all men will be converted. The Scriptures tell of "perilous times." 2 Tim. 3: 1–5. The "nations" are talking of a time when "they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks," but the Lord says of that same time: "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. * * * Let the heathen be awakened, and come up to the valley of Jehosh-aphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about." Joel 3: 9, 10, 12.

"A prudent man seeth the evil and hideth him-self; but the simple pass on and suffer for it."
