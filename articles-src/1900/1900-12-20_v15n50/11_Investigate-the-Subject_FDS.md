Among the resolutions passed at the annual meeting of the Lord's Day Alliance, recently held in Toronto, Canada, was one in reference to the people known as Seventh-day Adventists.

It was recommended that earnest efforts be made by the clergy to warn the people against the teachings of this denomination, and that ministers themselves study the subject of the Scriptural and historical basis of Sunday observance more thoroughly.

The latter part of this recommendation is certainly right to the point. In this a great many persons among the laity as well as the clergy are very remiss. Investigation of the subject has led many to the clear conviction that there is no Scriptural proof whatever for the observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath, and history shows clearly that the change from the observance of the seventh day to that of the first was made by human authority. This subject seriously needs investigation on the part of the people in general. It is to be hoped that the resolution will be heeded in this respect.

It is somewhat noteworthy that among all the religious organizations in the land, Seventh-day Adventists should be the only one thus prominently mentioned. Why should this be? It must be because it is recognized that this denomination stands by itself in calling the attention of the people to this important subject with the purpose of getting all the people to investigate the question.

Will not the matter bear investigation by the laity or common people? Have the clergy jurisdiction over the literature of the people? The remark was made that the common people could not stand it to read the literature of the denomination in question, that they are not competent to do this, and ministers are at fault who allow their members to read this literature. This savors too much of papal interference with personal rights. We have more confidence in the intelligence of the people than that. Let all read up on this subject.
