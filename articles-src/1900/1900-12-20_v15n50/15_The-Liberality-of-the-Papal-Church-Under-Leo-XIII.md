Doctor Burt in Christian Advocate.

An approved biography of Leo XIII contains the following statement: "It is an old and barefaced accusation, which the enemies of the church have continually repeated, that she does not give sufficient attention to education, and that even her priests are ignorant. But the reign of Leo XIII has given a positive denial to all such assertions." The author, however, attempts to prove his statement by simply showing that the Pope has caused to be published a fine edition of the works of Thomas Aquinas, has erected a statue to him in the Vatican, and has made the study of this learned philosopher to be introduced into all the universities, colleges, seminaries, and schools in the Roman Catholic world. But do these facts constitute Leo XIII a leader among educators?

It is well known that Leo XIII has always been one of the most zealous disciples of Thomas Aquinas. While he was bishop of Perugia he founded an academy for the special study of the "angelic doctor." In 1875, as cardinal, he presented to Pius IX a request that Thomas Aquinas might be proclaimed universal patron of all studies in the universities, academies, and seminaries of the world.

In harmony with his views as bishop he issued an encyclical August 4, 1879, recommending the teaching of the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas in all the schools and seminaries. This he confirmed by another letter written October 15, 1879.

On January 18, 1880, the Pope placed at the disposal of his editors sixty thousand dollars for the publication of a new edition of Thomas Aquinas, and again, on November 21, 1880, another sum of forty thousand dollars. On August 4, 1880, Leo XIII declared his favorite philosopher to be the patron saint of all Roman Catholic universities, colleges, and seminaries throughout the world. The Pope then recommended a thorough education for those whose special duty it might be to confute the doctrines of the Reformation, "which education can be obtained only in the philosophy and scientific theology of which Thomas Aquinas was master." * * *

Every book and pamphlet written by Roman Catholics during the reign of Leo XIII which has contained a line or word expressing the right of free thought or of private judgment has been immediately placed on the "Index," while the writers have been compelled to choose between retraction and absolute submission or excommunication. Some time ago the bishop of Cremona and others were called to account for a certain liberal tendency in their writings. The Pope gave them to understand that they were to believe and hold all that Thomas Aquinas taught and nothing else. Their letters of retraction were as follows: "I deplore what your holiness deplores. I desire what you desire and condemn what you condemn. I recognize no party but the Roman Church, and no father but the head of that church."

In a letter to the vicar-general of Rome, dated June 26, 1878, the Pope says: "In the midst of many reasons for rejoicing we have much sorrow because of the general condition of the church, especially here in Rome, the center of Catholicism and the seat of the vicar of Christ. Here there is no restriction on the press; here Protestant churches are built even in the most populous streets, as if to insult us."

Again, on July 12, 1878, he wrote another letter to the vicar-general, complaining of the liberty given to Protestants to build churches and open schools, by which means they "spread the poison of their errors." Then he issued the following decree: "The supreme excommunication, reserved as a special prerogative of the Pope, is hereby pronounced against all those who give their names to the heretical sects, of whatever denomination, who take part in their religious services or listen to their preachers, who print the invitation to these services or the subject of the discourses. They commit mortal sin who go to sing or play in Protestant churches, the publishers who print Protestant books, and the architects, contractors, masons, and laborers who work in the construction, repairs, or decoration of any Protestant church. Parish priests are hereby instructed to see that no one will work for Protestants." This is not a document of the Middle Ages, but one that emanated from Leo XIII. * * *

In his encyclical to the bishops of Hungary, August 20, 1886, which is really a political program for the Catholics of Hungary, the Pope speaks of the "modern sects as being more terribly fatal than the ancient Moslem." With the modern Moslem the Papacy seems to be in most cordial relations. * * *

The authorized biographer of the Pope says: "In his glorious pontificate Leo XIII has given special attention to the religious orders, has encouraged them, and helped them to rise up into their former position and power in the church." On September 17, 1882, he recommended the cult of St. Francis of Assisi, and on May 30, 1883, he constituted the third order of Franciscans. He himself wished to be known as the protector of Franciscans, but the Jesuits have been specially favored by him. He was at first their pet disciple, and then became their willing servant. In his brief of July 13, 1886, the Pope pronounced a eulogy on the Jesuits, whom he declared to be worthy of great honor in the Catholic Church, and he abrogated the brief of his predecessor, Clement XIV., giving back to the Jesuits all the privileges and immunities which they once enjoyed.

On October 12, 1892, Leo XIII. addressed a letter to the new general of the Jesuits, in which he greatly praised the order, and on July 30, 1895, he gave into the care of the order the direction of all the colleges and schools in Egypt.

It is a contradiction of terms to speak of Leo XIII. as liberal and the friend of free institutions, whether they be ecclesiastical or civil, when by his every act he has proved himself to be the friend of the Jesuits. By restoring them to power he struck a dagger into the heart of liberty. This institution, born in Spain, soon spread over all nations, but because of its political intrigues, its immoral teachings, and its crimes, Clement XIV. was obliged to abolish the order. But a secret society of that kind, proportions, and power could not be destroyed by a papal decree, and hence the Jesuits, casting off for a time their distinctive garb, remained the same in heart and intent. They lived for a time in the dark until they got rid of the Pope who had decreed their death, and then came forth more heinous than before. After the death of Clement XIV. the Jesuits returned to enjoy many of their rights and privileges. They became the confessors and counselors at courts and the favored educators of the aristocracy of the nations of Europe, but it was reserved to Leo XIII. to recognize them officially and place them in power. Now the Pope remains prisoner, and the Jesuits are directing affairs as they please.

The Jesuits hate our Constitution and our free institutions, and secretly seek to undermine the Republic. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."

Let me conclude by quoting another line from the Pope's authorized biographer: "Leo XIII. has absolutely continued the work of Pius IX. and faithfully sustained his principles since he is verily his successor."
