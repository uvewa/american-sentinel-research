SPEAKING for Sunday closing of the Pan-American Exposition, a Buffalo clergyman says:

"We have but to allow our great expositions and other special features to lead the way, and all other money-making institutions will fall into line."

If this is true, as we believe it is, it constitutes a good reason why the Pan-American Exposition should not lead the way in the matter of Sunday closing by law. The people of this country should not be educated to believe that Sunday observance by decree of the civil power is in keeping with the principles of republican government.

As regards Sunday, let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind whether or not it is his duty to observe the day, and act accordingly. If this is done, the question of opening the Exposition will take care of itself.
