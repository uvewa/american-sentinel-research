In speaking before the New York State Conference of Religion on "The Unused Power of the Churches in Politics," Rev. Alfred W. Wishart of Trenton, N. J., made this statement:

"Our warfare is not against political candidates, but against a low state of social and political morals expressed in a corrupt political system. The overthrow of Croker in New York and of Ashbridge in Philadelphia will be followed by the rise of other bosses just as bad, if that is possible, unless we go to the root of the difficulty.

"For the churches to mistake the vital issue by taking sides in the quarrels of bosses for political patronage and power, is to invite confusion, distrust, and a positive loss of influence. In some respects, in the cities at least, there are not two great parties. There is only one—'The American Masquerading Party.' This party is composed of so-called good citizens, blinded by partizanship and marching shoulder to shoulder with the most vulgar rascals in the community."

Mr. Wishart's thought is the true one. He believes that the work of the church is educational. Good men will be good citizens and good citizens make clean politics. This is the theory; the practice is that the really good men are so hopelessly in the minority that the rascals generally get the offices, or a large share of them. The fact is that just as some diseases in the individual must be treated by toning up the whole system of the patient, rather than by trying to remove the disease by treating the symptoms, so the diseases of the body politic must be treated, for the most part, by raising the moral tone of the community.

This work of moral reform properly belongs to the church, but the church must not engage in it for political purposes. The work of the church is to save men, to fit them for eternal life. This is the purpose of the gospel, and to use it for anything short of this is to prostitute it, and to fail of the very object for which it was given. The object the minister and the church should always have in view, is the salvation of men from the guilt and power of sin. This accomplished, such men will be honest wherever they may be placed in the providence of God; and not only so, but they will exert a saving influence. In this way the church not only can, but must necessarily, exert an influence not alone in politics, but in all human affairs. But this is not what is generally meant by the church in politics. Too often the church undertakes by political methods to "turn the rascals out," and generally succeeds only in installing another set of rascals no better than the first. It is well that Mr. Wishart has called attention to this fact and to the failure due to it, and has suggested a better way. B.
