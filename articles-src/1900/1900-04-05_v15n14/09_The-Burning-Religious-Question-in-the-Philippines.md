"Springfield Republican."

Archbishop Chapelle, who was sent by President McKinley to the Philippines on some mission connected with the spiritual affairs of the islands, visited early in January the convent of the Dominican friars at Manila, the Dominicans being one of the religious orders against which such severe charges have been preferred by the natives and by travelers in the archipelago. An account of the visit, together with a report of what the archbishop said to the provincial father of the order, was quickly sent to a Madrid paper by its Manila correspondent who claimed to have received his information from the provincial father himself. This report was copied in the Manila papers, but first of all by Progreso, the Spanish organ, and on January 15 by the Manila Times. The publication caused much excitement in the Philippines, and is said by the Manila correspondent of the New York Post to have "added fuel to the flame of Filipino bitterness against the Americans."

The excitement was due to the language Archbishop Chapelle is alleged to have used in his talk with the provincial father of the Dominicans. Words are put in his mouth which assure to the friars the continuance of their past privileges and functions under the rule of the United States. The following is from the Manila Times's translation of the Spanish paper's account:—

"'Father McKinnon has given four public lectures in America,' said the delegate to the provincial, 'and his apostolic zeal is the cause of my presence now in Manila. His four public lectures caused President McKinley to realize the necessity for the monastic orders remaining in the Philippines, and I was, at the request of the holy see, appointed to the commission, which was endeavoring at Washington to settle the religious question of these islands. I exerted myself in this matter, and stated my project for the settlement of the Catholic Church in the Philippines. My views were approved by both President McKinley and the pope, and I was intrusted with the mission by his holiness, who amplified my powers for the purpose. I therefore come to Manila with ample authority for everything. The arrangements and reorganizations which I intend to make will be completed in a short time. I rely on the support of the monastic orders.'

"Mgr. Chapelle referred slightly to several subjects connected with his mission, but he did not openly explain any. He said, however, that the friars of the Philippines have alarmed themselves without any reason. 'I know their importance in this country, and am openly predisposed in their favor. Would the friars accept salary from the American Government supposing the latter was willing to employ them in its service? I regard it as an act of true weakness that Father Nozaleda should leave the archipelago. If it depends upon me, he will not do so. I would go so far as to impose upon him my authority, as I am sure that in less than six months he will be the most important prelate in the Orient.'

"Asked by the provincial if the friars would be guaranteed against any vengeance in the event of their again occupying the parishes by virtue of the new arrangements, the prelate replied: 'If the friars occupy the parishes they will be considered as elements of order, and, therefore, as American agents.' Continuing, the delegate said that 'as America is thoroughly convinced of the necessity for the retention of the friars in the Philippines, the monastic orders will be given the necessary prestige, which will be much greater than it was during the Spanish regime. Father McKinnon, who will be appointed to a high position in the archipelago, will protect the friars and be the mediator between them and the American authorities here.'"

These alleged statements by Archbishop Chapelle are, if reported with substantial truth, of the most extraordinary nature. They are scarcely credible. President McKinley and the American people are represented as being convinced that the monastic orders should be undisturbed in their old privileges, property rights and spiritual functions, while the archbishop himself is declared to be openly predisposed in their favor. The suggestion that the friars be placed on salary by the United States Government would, if carried out, involve the establishment and maintenance of a religion by the United States, something altogether out of harmony with American institutions, and in defiance of the Constitution, although the constitutional objection could have no force with those of our people who accept the imperialist theory that the Constitution has no application to territory of the United States.

The repudiation of these newspaper reports by the archbishop and by his staff assistant, Chaplin McKinnon, of the United States army, are very welcome, and every one would be glad to accept them as final. But Mr. Robinson, the excellent Manila correspondent of the New York Post, now comes forward and states, after special study of the situation, that, in spite of any denials, he is convinced that "the weight of evidence strongly indicates that Archbishop Chapelle has spoken indiscreetly." Mr. Robinson observes that the original report has not been adequately controverted, and what is of more significance to his mind: "No steps have been taken against the paper Progreso, which first published those statements, and nothing has been said or done to other papers which copied them. For infinitely less venal offenses—for this was slanderous, if it was untrue—local papers have been cautioned and threatened by the American authorities. The immunity of the present case is, therefore, suggestive." Mr. Robinson's own belief is that "some document exists, or did exist, in which statements were made of the nature of those reported, and that this document fell into the hands of those who were neither supposed nor expected to see it. Through such a channel it probably obtained publication, and that nothing has been done about it is probably due to the fact that Senor Editor holds a royal straight flush." It is certainly a very singular circumstance that, if the report printed was a mere fabrication, the editors of the Manila papers have not been remonstrated with by the military authorities.

For the publication of the report aroused great excitement among the Filipinos, and, undoubtedly, it supplied just the ammunition the insurgent printing presses were most hungry for. The deep and abiding hostility of the people to the monastic orders immediately flamed up. The archbishop has received a petition from Roman Catholic merchants, proprietors, physicians, and other leading citizens of the Santa Cruz district of Manila, praying that the friars be compelled to leave the islands and that the parishes be presided over by a Philippine secular clergy. The Manila Freedom, on January 19, said: "No more emphatic demonstrations by a Catholic people against religious corporations could be made than those that are daily pouring in from the different sections of the country." La Patria, of Manila, said, on January 16: "A river of blood flows between the Filipino people and the monastic orders. It is inconceivable that they should be enthroned once more on their former heights of power to control the affairs of the people."

There seems to be a general agreement among those who have studied most closely the Philippine question that the religious phase of it is one of great difficulty. . . . The great mass of the Filipinos bitterly hate the friars and the monastic orders, and this is a fact of the largest import, whether or not that hatred is well-founded. Unless the United States clips the wings of the religious corporations the war may go on indefinitely. On the other hand, does the administration dare to expel the friars and confiscate their estates, as the Filipinos of all classes desire? In his recent speech in the Senate Mr. Lodge hinted strongly at such a confiscation when he said: "The land, which belongs to the people, and of which they have been robbed in the past, should be returned to them and their titles made secure." But Mr. McKinley's Paris treaty contains clauses which seem to insure to the orders the permanent possession of their great landed properties, through possessory titles if through no other. . . . The final outcome, therefore, is in utter darkness, but the prospect is that war in some form will continue so long as the United States seems to the natives to be protecting the religious orders in their old position of spiritual and economic power.
