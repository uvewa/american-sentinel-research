An interesting indication of the reform movement in Russia is contained in the news that the czar is about to decree the abandonment of the Julian calendar in favor of the Gregorian system of reckoning time. The innovation, which will be promulgated in the course of a few months, was opposed with vigor by the more conservative elements in the empire; and its adoption will be a clear concession to the business men, the manufacturers, and others who come into intimate touch with Western Europe, which universally recognizes the Gregorian calendar. The nations of the Greco-Catholic confession have a deep-rooted attachment for the Julian reckoning (the so-called "old style" calendar), which they have regarded as one of the indications of the independence of the Eastern Church from Rome. As the head of the Holy Orthodox Church, the czar of Russia has the authority to sanction the change of calendar which is desired by the advanced men of Russia. Great pressure was brought to bear upon the czar, however, by the ecclesiastics, who regarded, or affected to regard, the question of a system of time-reckoning for the empire as affecting the authority of the orthodox church, with an important moral bearing upon the solidarity of the Slavonic world, which, with the exception of Poland and Bohemia, has adhered tenaciously to the Julian reckoning with much of race pride and religious feeling as well." Now that Russia is about to adopt the Gregorian Calendar, a similar step may be taken by the other Slavonic nations of the orthodox faith.—Christian Register.
