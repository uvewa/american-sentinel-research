It is reported that "the natives of the Samoan island of Tutuila, which has fallen to the United States in the partition with Germany, are all said to be devout Christians. When visited by the American ships, not one of them would be induced to come on board on Sunday, but all went to church." A religious journal thinks that "they might well send missionaries to America to teach the people Sabbath observance."

Their strict regard for Sunday, however, indicates that their Christianity rests more on the word of the missionaries than on the Word of God.
