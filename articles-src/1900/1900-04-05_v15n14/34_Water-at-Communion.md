THE South Congregational Church, Boston, has substituted water for wine at its communion service. The venerable pastor, Rev. Edward Everett Hale, D. D., explained to his congregation that it was in accordance with his long standing desire that the officers of the church had decided to make the change.

"It is a mere matter of detail," he said. "The use of wine is in no way essential to the communion. At the great national conferences of the Unitarian Church I administered communion with water. Christ in his life on earth took the cup and drank the wine of the country. In every land it is customary to use in the communion service the beverage of the country, and, thank God, water has now come to be the beverage of America."—Union Signal.

Water is nature's beverage, made by the Creator, for America and all the world, though we cannot see in what sense it has now become the beverage of this country any more than it was formerly. But it is not a symbol of the blood of Christ, and for that reason is wholly inappropriate for a communion service.

It is better, of course, to use water, even at communion, than any intoxicating drink; but why the church could not use unfermented "wine," which is no more intoxicating than water, does not appear from any facts known to us, or which we can imagine as existing anywhere. Even a zeal for temperance may be carried to extremes.
