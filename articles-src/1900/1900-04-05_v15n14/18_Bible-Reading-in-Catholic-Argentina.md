Roman Catholics object to the reading of the Bible in the public schools, because the Bible is in itself against the Catholic religion. They would not object to it if the readings were from the Douay (Catholic) version, and accompanied by the "interpretations" and "explanations" made by Catholic theologians. The introduction of simple Bible reading in the schools of Catholic Argentina is therefore an improvement over the old system of Catholic education, though it is of course an injustice to Catholics and others to give the Protestant religion the support of the government. State education, like the state itself, can properly be only secular.
