We publish on another page the official correspondence between the American Sabbath Union and the State Department at Washington, relative to Sunday closing of the American exhibit at the Paris Exposition. In this connection we call attention to the fact, as bearing upon the claim made for this Government in the matter of regard for Sunday, that just recently, on the Government transport Sedgwick, thirteen men, for refusing to work on Sunday, were imprisoned in irons, and put on a diet of bread and water.
