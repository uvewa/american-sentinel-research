A book has been published in Leipsic entitled, "The Golden Book of the German People at the Turn of the Century." To it the kaiser has contributed this sentiment:—

"From God's grace comes the king, therefore he is responsible to the Lord alone. He must choose his way and his action from this standpoint alone. This awful, heavy responsibility, which the king bears for his people, gives him also a right to loyal coöperation on the part of his subjects. Therefore, everyone among the people must be filled with the conviction that he is personally responsible with him for the welfare of the fatherland."

The New York Sun sees in this an evidence that the theory "Me and God" will hold good in Germany during the twentieth century; but the New York Christian Advocate defends the kaiser's sentiment, and quotes this scripture as supporting it:—

"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. . . . Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing."—Rom. 13: 1-6.

"In the same way" it adds, "this republic is ordained of God, and its president is by the grace of God. Nor does that mean that revolution is never right; for when governments by force overthrow the righteous and exalt the wicked, cease to be a terror to evil works and become a terror to good works, then the people are justified in 'obeying God rather than man' and setting up a true government."

To avoid error on this subject it must be kept in mind that the Scripture says, "The powers that be are ordained of God," and not that the persons in power are so ordained. Civil government is ordained of God, but not the caprices and ambitions of a despot. All men are at all times and in all places responsible to God for their actions; but it is a well-established truth that a sense of responsibility to the people is the most effective safeguard against misgovernment on the part of those in power. Nor does the ruler's sense of "awful, heavy responsibility" before God make government by a single mind a wiser and safer system than that in which governmental power is exercised by the wisdom and authority of many.

Civil government is not instituted to secure obedience to God, but to preserve rights. But when the one in power feels that he holds his office by divine right, and is responsible to God alone, he very easily arrives at the conclusion that he is appointed to direct his subjects in spiritual affairs as well as in secular matters. The ruler's "sense of responsibility to God" is very sure to be more a theory than a fact, and a cloak for a more real sense of responsibility only to himself. There is no safety for the rights of the people outside of "government of the people, by the people."
