ACCORDING to the following published in the Union Signal, we conclude that the week of prayer appointed in April is to be turned mostly into an occasion for pushing the work of "Sabbath reform":—

"A call has been issued for a week of prayer, to be observed April 22-29. The young people's societies of the various churches, the W. C. T. U., the Y. M. C. A. and all other organizations interested in the preservation of the Sabbath are urged to use the week for prayer, public meetings, and the distribution of Sabbath literature, and especially for a voluntary closing movement, by which all business houses shall be induced to join in Sabbath closing, including the cessation of advertising in the press. The call is signed by the heads of all the prominent reform and Sabbath observance organizations."
