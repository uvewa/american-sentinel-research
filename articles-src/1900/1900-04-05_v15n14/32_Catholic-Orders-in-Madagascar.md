The despotic power of the Catholic religious orders in Madagascar, which was exercised against Protestant missionary work in the island at the establishment of French supremacy, seems to be on the wane, and a brighter day for liberty-loving people in that country is anticipated. We note the following on this point in the Missionary Review of the World:—

"The Rev. P. G. Peake reports an enthusiastic welcome on his return to Isoavina, Madagascar.

"We have had the most demonstrative reception we have ever received from the natives. The first week was almost occupied in receiving parties with the usual presents of fowls, rice, eggs, etc. The freedom with which the people come to us indicates that the nightmare of terrorism and persecution has passed away. Most of them, if not all, realize that they now really have religious liberty and tolerance. On Wednesday we had a visit from Governor-General Pennequin. He was very pleasant and seemed pleased with his visit, for he made a present of fifty francs to be distributed among the children.'

"Similar good news comes from the Rev. J. Pearse, who reports the reinstatement (through the influence of Madame Pennequin) of Rajaofera, one of our evangelists, who was banished last year on false charges."
