Religious liberty is steadily gaining ground in Argentina. News from that once priest-ridden country says that "a recent army order releases soldiers from the obligation of attending Roman Catholic worship. The minister of education has proposed the reading of the Bible in public schools. A public educator of considerable distinction has boldly recommended attendance at Protestant services. Religious gatherings in the open air are now permitted on the principal squares of the capital."
