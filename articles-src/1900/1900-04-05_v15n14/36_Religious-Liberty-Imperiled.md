THE Religious Herald (Richmond, Va.) discerns the fact that religious liberty is imperiled by the careless thought of the age regarding it, and says:—

"The time is ripe for a reaffirmation of the principle of religious liberty. Since that principle was discovered and incorporated in the fundamental law of the Republic it has suffered many violations, and to-day it is held very loosely and very obscurely by a great many of our people. The only safe rule is entire separation of church and state. The only safe policy is to resist the beginnings. As an illustration of the indifference of the public to the violation of this principle, we may mention the fact that the city of Richmond continues to make, against the repeated protests of a large number of her citizens and taxpayers, appropriations of public money to institutions under sectarian control. It is high time for those who cherish the doctrine to teach it without faltering and without apology."
