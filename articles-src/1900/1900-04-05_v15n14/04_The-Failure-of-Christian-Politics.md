The idea that society can be reformed and the moral evils that afflict it eradicated by putting good men—that is, righteous men—into political office, is shown up as a delusion by an Australian journal, the Bible Echo, as follows:—

"There are many who propose reforming society and making the world religious by law. The modus operandi that they propose is, 'Get Christian men in Parliament; then let them make Christian laws, and when these laws are enforced the evil will be restricted, men will be prohibited from sinning, society will become religious, and the world prepared for the millennium.'

"To begin with, we do not believe that the truly Christian man will go to parliament. True Christianity neither covets place nor power. Christ never put up for parliament, and if he had designed his followers should take up that kind of work he would have left some directions on the matter.

"Again: When Christian men do go to parliament their Christianity seems to be the first thing that gives way. The following paragraphs, bearing out this point, we quote from the New Voice [New York City], of December 14, 1899:—

"'Besides, it is impossible to find out the "good man." Any man that wants office will prevaricate and, as a rule, lie. And the "good man's" party friends will not believe or even consider the truth.

"'Indiana elected a Christian governor, a leader in the Presbyterian Church and soon to enter its ministry. Mr. Mount was not only a nominal Christian, but, according to all the testimony, a "good man," but he turns out to be an emphatic license man, and, all things considered, the saloons' best friend in Indiana.

"'Missouri elected a "good man" in high standing in the Methodist Church, and he turned out not only a friend of the saloon, but an "all round" dirty politician, whose power for evil was only circumscribed by the small horizon of his mind.

"'Iowa elected a "good man" governor—perhaps the most prominent member of the Christian Church—and he shambled down from his Christian profession at the first fire of the politicians, and threw the door of the State wide open to the liquor traffic.'

"This is just about how the matter stands. 'Any man who wants office will prevaricate,' says the *New Voice*, and we believe it is true. Then what good will be accomplished by putting such good (?) men in office?

"The simple fact is, goodness does not come by legislation. Righteousness is the gift of God. The law may keep a man from committing murder because he fears the penalty, but if he has a desire that would lead to the injury of life, God regards him as a murderer already.

"Church membership and religious profession add nothing to the politician. This is true not only in individual life, but in city life as well. The following statement taken from the *Signs of the Times* will give evidence on this point:—

"'One of the most "Christian" cities of this land is the "City of Brotherly Love;" but this is what Hon. John Wanamaker says, in the New York World, concerning it: "In Philadelphia we have not had an honest election for many years, and the debauchery of the ballot has acquired the system and precision of a science. . . . This has not been the growth of a day or year, but has been perfected by a steady, systematic development of the most minute details of original ingenuity. The machine has educated its followers in election crime, rewarded them according to their perfection in fraudulent arts, and extolled and honored the leadership which best knew how to devise and avail itself of corrupt practices and protect and promote its debased fools and disciples." Is Philadelphia alone in this respect.'

"Christian politics is very largely a mistaken idea. The true Christian will do right apart from all earthly laws. He is bound by a higher law than any earthly legislature can proclaim—even the law of his God.

"God has ordained earthly rulers to judge between man and man, to see that the weak are not swallowed up by the strong. But he has never entrusted to Caesar the work of converting men, or preparing them for heaven.

"The Christian will walk humbly with his God in this world. The struggle for place and power does not disturb his peace, for God has promised that in the future (not now) he shall have power over the nations. Till then the child of God can safely leave his affairs in the hand of the divine Ruler who puts up and sets down whomsoever he will.

Is the day school the place for instruction in the primary truths of the Bible? Is not this in the Christian home, first of all, and then in Sabbath schools provided by the churches? In proportion as this solemn duty is given over to a teacher in the day school will the responsibility be transferred from them to whom it naturally belongs, and the result cannot, in the long run, be good. In Germany the Bible is a text-book in the common schools, and it has not added to the reverence for the Book of Books to have it numbered with Grammar, Arithmetic, etc. Keep the teaching of the Bible in the hands of those who regard its truths as higher and grander than all others.—Canadian Baptist.
