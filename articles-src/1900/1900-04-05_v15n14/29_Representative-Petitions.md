SPEAKING of the evils of this now common system of presenting petitions to Congress and other legislative bodies, a writer in the *Signs of the Times* says:—

"It is true that legislators, and others to whom public petitions usually go, are coming to give more weight to petitions that purport to represent churches, fraternities, etc., than to those bearing the signatures of individuals without additional representation. This is due to the fact that organizations are supposed to hold their membership together in certain contingencies and therefore are able to wield more political power than the same number of individuals without organization.

"It is the knowledge of this influence upon public officials dependent on voters for their positions, that has given rise to the system of representative petitions. And it is one of the most deceptive devices that ever came into play in the political arena. It is particularly noticeable that petitions to municipal boards, to legislatures, and to Congress, are more and more partaking of this character. The design on the part of petition manipulators seems to be to impress the authority petitioned with a sense of the political influence of the petitioners. And the idea is continually growing stronger that rights inure, or, rather, that favors ought to be granted, in proportion to influence at the polls.

"All this accounts for the numerous petitions coming before Congress in the name of churches, praying for this, that, and the other measure of legislation. The churches are not alone in this kind of politics, but it is more significant from that standpoint because it shows a growing disposition on the part of the church to influence the world by a show of political power, rather than by the power and consequent fruits of the Spirit.

"It is claimed by nearly all classes in this country that the separation of church and state is the true principle of government, and such is the nominal character of this Government; therefore to see long arrays of petitions from the churches as such in our halls of legislation, for the purpose of controlling the action of the Government, or praying to the Government for favors, shows a disposition to close up the supposed gap between the church and the state. Moreover, it shows a growing lack of trust in the Spirit of God to supply all the power that the church needs for its work in the earth.

"Furthermore, to see churches in the far East, or North, or West, or South, petitioning Congress to enact some local measure for the District of Columbia, as though the people of that locality were in some way incapacitated for self-government, shows a spirit of political meddling entirely foreign to the spirit of the gospel. It shows an ambition for worldly power and influence utterly incompatible with the spirit of the 'meek and lowly' One, who 'made himself of no reputation,' and went about doing good. In matters pertaining to the cause and kingdom of Christ, 'no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.' 2 Tim. 2:4."
