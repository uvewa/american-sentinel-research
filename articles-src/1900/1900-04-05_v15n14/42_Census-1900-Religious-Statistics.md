The census of 1900, as planned by the officials having it in charge, will make no provision for religious statistics, and the volume embodying the report will be less bulky and more quickly prepared for that reason than was the case in the last national census. Some religious journals express dissatisfaction, but the doubtful value of religious statistics in point of reliability, and the doubtful propriety of governmental inquiry into religious matters, ought to settle the question in favor of the course the Government has adopted.
