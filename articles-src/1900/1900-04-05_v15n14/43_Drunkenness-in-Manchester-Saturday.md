The chief constable of Manchester, England, says a London paper, in making a report on the increase of drunkenness in Manchester during 1899, said that nearly a third of all the arrests for drunkenness were made on Saturday. Yet a great effort is being made by English churches to secure Sunday closing of the public houses as a temperance measure. It would seem that in Manchester at least the effort should be turned to the closing of such houses on Saturday, if temperance is really its aim. But we shall never expect to hear of any movement for Saturday closing of saloons.
