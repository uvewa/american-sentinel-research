The anti-canteen law passed some time ago by Congress having failed of its purpose, it is proposed now to introduce this bill into Congress and put the question of the canteen beyond possibility of mistake:—

"To prevent the selling or dealing in beer, wine, or any intoxicating drinks in any post exchange or canteen, or transport, or upon any premises used for military purposes by the United States.

"Be it enacted, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

"That the sale of or the dealing in beer, wine, or any intoxicating drinks as a beverage by any person, in any post exchange or canteen, or transport, or upon any premises used for military purposes by the United States is hereby prohibited.

"SECTION 2. That the penalty for any violation of this act shall be not less than one hundred dollars and not more than five hundred dollars for each offense."
