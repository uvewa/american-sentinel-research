News has recently come of a renewed attack by the czar's government upon the Lutheran churches in Finland and in the Baltic provinces. The pretext for this attack is that the Lutheran clergy in Finland and Livonia are favoring the spread of pan-Germanic sentiments. A number of recent conversions from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Protestant faith have inspired a cry of alarm in the clerical and reactionary press. As a result, the Lutheran theological seminaries, which a few years ago had been allowed to be open in St. Petersburg, have now been closed.—Missionary Review.
