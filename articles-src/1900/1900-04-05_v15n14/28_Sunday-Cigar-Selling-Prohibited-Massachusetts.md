*New York "Sun."*

BOSTON, March 20.—As the result of a Supreme Court decision, more than 1,500 stores in this city holding victualler's licenses cannot sell cigars on Sunday, the new rule going into effect on next Sunday. Chairman Clarke of the Police Commission said to-day that the law would be enforced, which means that no more cigars can be bought from any but a drug store on Sunday. The hotel-keepers and inn-keepers have been thrown into excitement, for lawyers say they may be compelled to stop selling cigars on Sunday. The law in the case of inn-holders is similar to that for common victuallers, and until a court shall decide otherwise it is believed that the inn-holders and hotel men will have to lock up their cigar cases on Sunday.

A ruling was handed down by the Supreme Court yesterday to the effect that a common victualler's license does not allow the holder to sell cigars on Sunday. The case was that of the Commonwealth against Catharine Graham, of Revere, the proprietor of a restaurant in that town.
