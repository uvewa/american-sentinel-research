An exchange announces that "Mayor Parkinson of Moundsville, W. Va., has given out the information that he will soon adopt the Sheldon idea for municipal government, and run the city 'as Jesus would.'" There is a difference between trying to edit a newspaper upon this principle and trying to run a city government by it, which will be discovered if the mayor carries his idea into effect.
