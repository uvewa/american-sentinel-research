Speaking of the religious school question in Japan, over which Protestant missionaries have for some time been in conflict with the civil authorities, the leading Methodist journal in the United States says that "If the schools would consent to make chapel attendance upon Bible classes voluntary, there would be little obstruction to other proceedings. It is to be hoped that by this time the Minister has made an open statement, allowing religious freedom. If not, since the matter is not merely a school question, but has assumed the character of a constitutional question, it is probable that the schools will feel called upon to cut off all connection with the government. We see that the law for controlling religion, as recently submitted to the government for the Diet's approval, has been defeated by a vote of 121 to 100." It adds that the failure of the law to pass was a "disappointment to the entire Christian body."

Christian schools certainly need no "connection with the government" in Japan or elsewhere; the connection which they do need is with a spiritual rather than a political source of power.
