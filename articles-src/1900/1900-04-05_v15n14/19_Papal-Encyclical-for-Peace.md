The pope is about to issue another encyclical, the theme of which will be a plea for general peace throughout the world. What the czar's conference has thus far so signally failed to do, the pope will endeavor to accomplish through his personal influence and that of his church in all lands. The Catholic Mirror says of it: "The encyclical will deal with the prospects of peace held out by the Hague conference, and the disappointments that followed on the South African war. It will contain an appeal to all governments, whether Roman Catholic or not, to join in fresh endeavors to avert war. It will also direct Catholic archbishops and bishops to contribute with all their power to the diffusion of the principles of peace and arbitration."

Does this mean that the Roman pontiff is prepared to make peace with the Italian government? If not, and the quarrel over the temporal power is to be continued, it seems to us that the pope's effort will be largely nullified by the influence of a bad example.
