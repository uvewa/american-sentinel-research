The Rev. N. D. Hillis, pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in a recent sermon denounced the Presbyterian doctrines of predestination and eternal torment, as being utterly repugnant to the Christian conception of God. Dr. Hillis being a member of the Chicago presbytery, his attack upon Presbyterian doctrine has caused much stir and comment in Presbyterian and other religious circles; and it is stated that unless Dr. Hillis promptly withdraws from the Presbyterian communion, as he is said to contemplate doing, he will be subjected to discipline by that church.

It is becoming more and more evident that the present age is not suited to the progress of Presbyterianism. The influences which give character to these times are antagonistic to the teachings of Calvin and Knox, and to the spirit of their times. The boundaries fixed by the creeds and traditions of former times are breaking up, and in the effort to adhere to them the Presbyterian and other Protestant churches find themselves involved in a dilemma. They may ignore these medieval doctrines of their "confession of faith," as their clergy mostly do; but the doctrines are there, and when they are attacked the churches feel bound to defend them; yet their adherence to the same raises an insuperable obstacle in the way of their growth and prosperity. The more hard and rigid and unmerciful the boundary lines of the creed, the more do the people of this day revolt at the idea of intellectual confinement within them.

The church of Rome alone maintains both her adherence to dogma and tradition and her accustomed hold upon the people; and this is because the papal religion is, far more than any other, the religion of human nature. The papal church will flourish while human nature remains what it is and has been since the fall of man.
