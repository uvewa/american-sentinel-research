THE New York World, of March 30, printed the following, which is confirmed by reports in other papers:—

"The transport 'Sedgwick,' formerly the 'Chester,' of the International Navigation Company, arrived from Cuba yesterday with thirteen able-bodied seamen in irons for mutiny.

"Last Sunday the transport lay off Gibara and the bo'sun piped all hands to discharge three lighters loaded with clothing.

"Edward Tammesen, a well seasoned salt, made this surprising speech:—

"'We all know as how it is agin the regulations on every well-regulated American ship for to perform any kind of unnecessary work on the Lord's day, the same being a day of rest. Aboard this ship that's a plenty of work every week day. Now the hands don't propose to do a turn towards unloading them lighters unless we gets extra pay for a-violatin' of the Sabbath.'

"Tammesen's shipmates applauded and said they would stand by him, but Captain Hendricks clapped thirteen of them into irons, and put them on a diet of bread and water. The remainder of the crew turned to and unloaded the lighters.

"The mutinous thirteen were still in irons aboard the transport last night."

This transport is a Government ship, engaged in the business of the Government; and it is strange that such regulations should be put into effect and such treatment accorded these men, if the Government observes Sunday as the secretary of the New York Sabbath Committee affirms in his letter to the Secretary of State which we print on another page. The men would, if that were true, have an easy means of redress in an appeal to the Washington authorities.

The conscientious objections of these sailors against "violating the Sabbath," are no doubt quite similar to those held by many workingmen in all occupations,— they do not want to violate the "Sabbath" unless they can have extra pay for doing it.
