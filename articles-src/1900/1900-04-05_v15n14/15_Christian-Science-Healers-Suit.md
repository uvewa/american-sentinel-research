A suit against Christian Science "healers" has been instituted in Baltimore, by a man whom their treatment failed to heal of a diseased leg. The victim wants $20,000 damages. An exchange which mentions the case appropriately remarks that "if a man is satisfied with absent treatment, he ought not to complain if the cure is absent also."
