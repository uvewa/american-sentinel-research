### OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE ON THE SUBJECT BETWEEN THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

RECENTLY we mentioned the fact that the American exhibit at the Paris World's Fair would, by order of the Government, at the solicitation of the American Sabbath Union, be closed on Sundays. Since then the official correspondence on the subject has been given to the press by permission of the Secretary of State; and, naturally, it is found to be of an interesting nature. The following is the letter of the American Sabbath Union:—

"31 Bible House, New York, Feb. 7, 1900.

"To the Hon. JOHN HAY, Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

"Sir: In behalf of large numbers of our fellow-citizens, we respectfully ask that the representatives of our Government at the Paris Exposition this year be instructed, in their official capacity, to pay that respect to the Sunday observance which is paid by our National and State Governments and which is in accordance with the laws and customs of the American people, by the closing of their bureaux and the suspension of official business on Sunday.

"For precedents in the action thus asked, permit us to refer to the instructions given by the Department of State to the representatives of this country at the International Expositions at Paris in 1889, in 1881, and in 1878.

"The question of Sunday rest, especially in its industrial and social aspects, has claimed greatly increased attention on the continent of Europe within recent years, and by legislation and by the influence of public sentiment, large numbers of wage-earners have already been released from the slavery of uninterrupted toil.

"This movement has been promoted by the example of this country. It is surely right that the action of our representatives abroad should be such as to give emphasis to this example.

"By order of the committee,

"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

"Wm. W. Hoppin, Chairman.

"W. W. Atterbury, Secretaries."

"Wm. S. Hubbell,

To this the following reply was received:—

"Department of State, Washington, Feb. 17, 1900.

"Wm. W. Hoppin, Esq., Chairman, New York Sabbath Committee, No. 31 Bible House, New York City.

"Sir: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant asking that, in accordance with the precedents set in 1878, 1881, and 1889, the representatives of this Government at the Paris Exposition this year be instructed, in their official capacity, to pay that respect to the observance of the Sabbath which is paid by our National and State Governments, and which is in accordance with the laws and customs of the American people, by the closing of their bureaux and the suspension of official business on Sunday.

"The subject has received the Department's attention, and I am pleased to inform you that the Commissioner-General of the United States to the Exposition and the United States Ambassador at Paris have been instructed to co-operate, as far as possible, with the American exhibitors in procuring united action to induce the suspension of the running of machinery and the performance of manual labor in connection with American exhibits on Sunday. They have further been instructed regarding their official observance of the day, and their report will be awaited as to what it is practicable for the United States to do in its official representative capacity.

"I am, sir,

"Your obedient servant,

"JOHN HAY."

The representatives of the Government, it will be noted, are to observe Sunday in their official capacity, which will constitute an observance of Sunday by the American Government. But the American Government does not observe Sunday here at home; for there is no national law for Sunday observance in any department of the Government, and in fact each of the departments transacts business on Sunday when necessity seems to require it; while the Constitution, which is the highest law of the land, prohibits the enactment of any national law "respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Congress did enact a law closing the Chicago World's Fair on Sunday, and thus the Government did recognize the claims of Sunday as a religious institution; but it acted wholly without authority in the matter, as it does now in closing the American exhibit at Paris.

In recognizing Sunday as a religious institution the Government gives its support to a religion. It takes sides in a religious controversy; for opposing religions contend over this very question of acknowledging Sunday as a sacred day. Why should the Government do this? And if the Government can do this of right, why may it not of right take sides in any other matter of religious controversy? Why may it not, and why should it not, support religion to the full extent of a complete union of church and state? How can the Government favor a religion in the matter of Sunday observance, without thereby establishing the full principle of church and state union?
