A New England journal says:—

"Our trade with the Philippines has been itemized for the seven months to February 1 in a late report of the treasury bureau of statistics, and from a commercial standpoint it must be admitted that the results are highly encouraging, particularly in the case of malt and spirituous liquors. Exports from the United States to the islands in that period were: Of malt liquors, $101,781; of brandy, $21,714; of whisky, $65,138; of wine, $3,914; total malt and spirituous liquors and wine, $192,547, or at the rate of $330,000 a year. And yet, prior to the American occupation, our annual export of all goods to the islands was little more than $100,000. Thus in the one item of intoxicating liquors we have created by conquest a trade over three times as large as our whole export trade in all commodities formerly amounted to. Here is striking evidence of progress in civilization from our career of conquest—in one direction, at least."
