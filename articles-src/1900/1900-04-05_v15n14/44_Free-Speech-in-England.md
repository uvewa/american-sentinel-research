When mob assaults on free speech were made in France in connection with the Dreyfus trial, the Anglo-Saxon nations lifted their hands in an attitude of horror, and dwelt upon the decadent state of liberty in France, in contrast with that presented in their own domains. But now, in one of those nations which is conducting a war in Africa, meetings called to advocate the cessation of the war are attacked and broken up, and the advocates of peace are subjected to almost every form of violence and insult; so that the right of free speech is now exercised there only at the risk of one's life. What a difference it makes whether the matter is one that touches our own interests, or only those of our neighbor!
