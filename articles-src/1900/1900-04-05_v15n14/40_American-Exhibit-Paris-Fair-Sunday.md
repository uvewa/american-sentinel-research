The American Exhibit at the Paris Fair, it now appears, may not be closed on Sunday after all. The French authorities object to such action because Sunday will be the most popular visiting day, and the closing of one of the chief exhibits on that day would seriously detract from the success of the exposition. So the American commissioner general in Paris is said to be much perplexed over the matter, and has not yet decided what to do.
