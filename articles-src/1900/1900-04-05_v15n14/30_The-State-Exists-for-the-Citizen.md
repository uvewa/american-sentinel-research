The following truthful observations touching the relation of the state to the citizen, as involved in the question of the right of control over the education of children, are taken from the *Catholic Mirror*, which credits them to Rev. T. J. Gasson, S. J., of Boston College, Mass.:—

"The vexed question as to whom the right of the education of the child belongs can easily be solved philosophically by considering that far more general problem, viz., does the state exist for the citizen or the citizen for the state? The various theories upon this all-important subject can be divided into two classes, viz., into the class of philosophers who maintain that the object of the state is to secure the citizen in the enjoyment of his life and property, and into the class of philosophers who teach that the citizen exists for the state.

"This latter view is the leading thought in the legislation of Lycurgus, and it was this peculiarity that gave Sparta her marked character, and distinguished her in so striking a manner from all the other states of Greece. Lycurgus was resolved that the Spartans should be a nation of soldiers. To accomplish this result he placed the complete training of the boys under the control of the state and introduced a system of state fatherhood that overthrew entirely all parental rights over the young. Every child after birth was subjected to a public examination of its physical condition. The weakly and the cripples were exposed on Mount Taygetus. In his seventh year the boy was taken from his mother's care and given over to the state teachers or trainers, who taught the youthful Spartans all the gymnastic games, exercises and movements that were calculated to harden the body and to strengthen the muscles. They were forced to wear the same garments winter and summer, and to bear the privations of hunger and thirst. Literature, eloquence and philosophy were to be despised, although the boys were permitted to sing martial airs.

"A Spartan was allowed to marry when he had completed his thirtieth year, but even then he was still under public discipline, and was not permitted to take his meals with his wife. The men messed together and slept at night in the public barracks. Not until he had reached his sixtieth year was the Spartan released from public training and from military service. The individual in this system was nothing, the state everything. The individual existed solely for the state.

"The Christian theory of statehood is at utter variance with the Spartan view. According to Christian philosophy the state exists for the safeguard of the individual and for the protection of inalienable private rights. The rights of domestic society are not derived from civil society, for the individuals composing a state must necessarily exist before the state can have existence. The individuals and the family are certainly prior to the state, and hence it is impossible that the rights of the family should be derived from the state. Now, no society can lawfully claim to control or modify rights which it did not originate.

"Bearing this in mind, the question of education resolves itself into this, viz.: To whom does the child primarily belong? If to the state, then the state should have complete control of education. If to the parents, then to them belongs the sacred right of giving the child that well-proportioned development of his faculties which will enable him to secure by legitimate effort his well-being in this life and its happiness in the life to come. The state has its province, and that province is not to go beyond its own limits, and to usurp inalienable private rights, but to protect the citizen in his home and in his sphere of action."
