We print this week a communication from a Baptist clergyman of Cleveland, Ohio, in defense of Sunday laws. We are glad to hear from our friends who believe in Sunday enforcement, and we invite representatives of organizations working for the same to make use of the SENTINEL in presenting their views upon the subject. Its columns are open to them at any time.
