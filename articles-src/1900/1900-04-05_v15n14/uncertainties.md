# Uncertainties — v15n14 (1900-04-05)

## General Notes

This issue was processed from Mistral OCR output. The following uncertainties were noted:

### Page 1 — Masthead note
- **Transcribed as:** "has know that it is sent by some friend"
- **Confidence:** LOW — the phrase "has know" appears to be a corruption of "has known" or possibly "may know." The original OCR reads "has know," which is grammatically incorrect. However, per project rules, the OCR text was preserved as transcribed rather than silently corrected.
- **Second pass:** Yes — the awkward phrasing may reflect a damaged or obscured word in the original scan.

### Page 4 — "The Failure of Christian Politics" article
- The article blends content from Bible Echo (reprint), New Voice quotations, Signs of the Times quotations, and a final paragraph from Canadian Baptist. The Canadian Baptist paragraph appears after the main Bible Echo block and discusses Bible teaching in day schools vs. Sabbath schools. It was preserved as part of the same article unit as it appears to be editorially appended rather than a separate article.
- **Attribution:** Set as `reprint` with `original_publication: "Bible Echo"` since the bulk of the article is the Bible Echo reprint. The Canadian Baptist excerpt is embedded without a separate article heading.

### Page 9 — Russian Calendar article
- **Issue:** The closing quotation mark after "religious feeling as well." appears to have been placed mid-sentence in the OCR, suggesting the quoted passage may have run longer in the original. The transcription follows the OCR punctuation as given.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

### Multiple short items (pages 8-9, 16)
- The short editorial notes on pages 8-9 and the editorial paragraph items on page 16 are without explicit titles in the original. Titles assigned are editorial constructions based on the content, following project conventions.

### Advertisements
- Pages 13-15 contain advertisements (Two Books for the Housewife, The Desire of Ages, Imported German Bibles, Post Fountain Pen, Publications at 50% Discount, Signs of the Times subscription, Christian Patriotism booklet). These were not transcribed as article files per project instructions to skip advertisements.
