THE Porto Rican tariff question brings us to the parting of the ways, where the people must decide whether expansion means the use of national power to exploit governed communities for our benefit, or the use of national power to extend over governed communities the privileges which freedom has given us. In this issue there can be no compromise. Shall conscience or commercialism rule? That is the question.—The Outlook.
