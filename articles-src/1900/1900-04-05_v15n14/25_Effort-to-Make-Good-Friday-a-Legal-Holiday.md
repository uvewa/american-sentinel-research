RECENTLY a bill was introduced in the legislature of Massachusetts providing for the observance of Good Friday in that State as a legal holiday. We have not learned the result of the effort, but the following religious reasons given in its favor by the Boston Pilot (Catholic), which rest wholly upon the assumptions of the Catholic belief, indicate plainly the unwarrantable ground upon which such legislation is sought:—

"It is difficult to see any ground of objection to this bill, the provisions of which are approved by many Protestant bodies as well as by all the Catholics of the Commonwealth.

"All who believe in the divine Christ and his atonement for the sins of men on the cross of Calvary should rejoice to see the anniversary of that Supreme Sacrifice marked by abstention from worldly business, and general opportunity for attendance at devout exercises in the churches. As the closing of liquor saloons is compulsory on legal holidays in Massachusetts, it would be a further satisfaction to right-minded Christians that the chance to desecrate Good Friday by the vice most repugnant to its spirit, should be reduced to the minimum."
