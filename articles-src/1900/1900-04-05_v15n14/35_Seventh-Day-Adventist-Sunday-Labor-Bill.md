A LEADING atheist journal published in this city makes this note of a bill now before the State legislature relating to Sunday observance:—

"It is proposed to tinker the Sunday law of New York State by providing that any person who regards and observes another day than the first day of the week as the Sabbath may engage in business or labor on Sunday. Assemblyman Weekes has introduced a bill to this purpose. Such a measure ought to be rejected for several reasons. It is religious legislation, abandoning civil ground and making religious belief and practise a test of the right to do Sunday labor. This permitting a Jew or a Seventh-day Adventist to do on Sunday what a Freethinker, a Protestant, or a Catholic is prohibited from doing is a total denial of religious equality. As a matter of fact, whether a citizen regards and observes one day or another, or no day at all, as the Sabbath, is not a legitimate occasion for legal inquiry. Justice lies in one direction only—namely, to repeal every Sunday law on the statute books and accord to the citizen the personal liberty of choosing his own holy days and holidays. These statutes are a fruitful source of injustice which could not possibly exist without them, and if the observance of any or no day were left to the choice of the individual. No thorough believer in justice between man and man can for a moment defend such legislation, enacted and maintained as it is for the purpose of enforcing conformity to a rule of the church."
