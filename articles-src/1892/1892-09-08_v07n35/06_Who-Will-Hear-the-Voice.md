# Who Will Hear the Voice?

A CORRESPONDENT from the city of the World's Fair, Rev. O. T. Lanphear, of our State, quotes the last paragraph of an article in the same issue, in which the final sentence is, "Where is the voice that will sound the truth so loud and so well that it will rattle in the ears of every man?" and says:

If you want to realize in the full race the cloud which overshadowed the mountain where Peter and James and John and the Master were at prayer, was the voice of God. The eternal God—the immortal God—the eternity of a Father. "Let my beloved Son," was his dictation. God had spoken to men often since that time as he had spoken before to prophets; "but when Adam and Eve hid themselves; but they had fallen and stopped their ears from hearing the voice of God."

Hear ye Son! "Christ the Son of God who gave himself a ransom for all." The good-will to all, the gospel of salvation to all are in and through Him; and "every one that is of the truth," hears the voice of the voice, is to him who is of God. "He that hath ears, let him hear the voice of the Spirit."

Again, again, in this afternoon of the world's history, the voice of God calls to his Son, hide and they stop their ears. Let it then be in terms any one that they can stand the truth in the ears of many that can sound the truth in the ears of every man, the Voice of the Almighty will do the work, until that day when the Almighty himself breaks from every soul with a voice, and every eye shall see him and every ear shall hear.
