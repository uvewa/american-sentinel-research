# Uncertainties Log

## Issue: v07n35 (1892-09-08)

### General Notes
- OCR source: Mistral OCR transcription
- The OCR quality was generally good with clear text throughout

### Specific Uncertainties

**Page 1, line 9:**
- **Transcribed as:** "Equal and Exact Justice to all Men, of Whatever State or Purgation, Religious or Political."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** The word "Purgation" appears unusual in this context. Expected "Persuasion" based on typical Jeffersonian language, but the OCR clearly shows "Purgation." This may be an OCR error or archaic usage. Retained as shown pending verification against original.

**Page 3, line 112:**
- **Transcribed as:** "Henry Counyf, Tenn."
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** The OCR shows "Counyf" but this is almost certainly "County" with OCR error. However, retained as shown per transcription rules. The reference should be to "Henry County, Tennessee."

**Page 7, line 386:**
- **Transcribed as:** "CHARLES B. WATTE"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The OCR shows "WATTE" but this is likely "WAITE" (Charles B. Waite was a known figure in the American Secular Union). Retained as shown in OCR.

### Author Attribution Notes
- All author initials were clearly marked in the OCR
- Editorial unsigned pieces marked as `attribution: "editorial"`
- Reprints properly identified with source publications noted
