# Editorial Notes

CONCERNING the demand for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, the Spokane, Wash., *Chronicle* says:—

It is the old fight of the hyper pious upon opening theaters, art galleries, plays and gardens on Sunday. It is nothing more of civil restraint, and is the next encroachment, because the Christian religion is not combative.

And it is in this assumption that the danger to liberty of conscience lurks. If an arrogant and aggressive minority can dictate to the majority in this matter, what may we not expect when by reason of this they shall be able to turn the tables on those who are always to be found on the winning side, if they can only find out which side it is, and so shall have become the majority. Will not their intolerance increase with their numbers and power?

There is nothing more dangerous to religious liberty than the assumption by powerful organizations of a divine right to rule their fellow men. It is for this reason that the National Reform Association, and the American Sabbath Union are a most serious menace to freedom of conscience in this country. They assume to be the divinely authorized interpreters of God's law and they aspire to be its administrators. They are simply imitating Rome. And do not doubt the liberties will be trodden through. By the Supreme Court's decision of February, 1892, and by the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, the Government has already been pledged to these organizations the support of the civil power. But such a use of civil power is a degradation, and will be opposed by all who are not prepared to surrender their soul-liberty.

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL does not believe in anarchy. It is a patriotic and religious duty to yield cheerful obedience to civil rulers in civil things. By the very act of making men social beings, mutually dependent upon one another, and under mutual obligations each to respect the equal rights of the other, God ordains civil government, that the weak might be protected against the aggressions of the strong, that unlawful greed and avarice might be restrained, and that civil order might be maintained. But the ordinance of civil government gives it no authority in spiritual things.

It is evident that inasmuch as civil government can not by any possibility free any man from the obligations which God has laid upon him, and can absolve nothing from the penalty of the divine law, it can rightfully exercise no authority whatever over any man touching his duty toward his Creator. Let government once invade the domain of conscience and it will surely dominate it, thus setting God aside and usurping his authority. Indeed the mere assumption by any set of men or by a body of men of the right to dictate in matters of religious faith or practice is a denial of the moral sovereignty of the Creator.

CHRISTIANS of all creeds and of all ages have claimed for themselves religious liberty; but not by very many has the right to be followers of Christ been accompanied by a willingness that others should enjoy equal freedom, while more than a few Christians have clearly seen and fully recognized the principle that the moral sovereignty of the Creator renders absolutely essential the free moral agency of the creature. No man ever stated this principle more clearly than did the deist, Thomas Paine; and his clear vision on this subject ought to put to shame those who are afraid to trust God with the administration of his own moral government. Paine said:

> There is a single idea which, if it strikes rightly upon the mind, either in a legal or a religious sense, will prevent any man, or any body of men, or any government, from going wrong on the subject of religion; which is that before any human institutions of government were known in the world, there existed, if I may so express it, a compact between God and man, from the beginning of time; and that as the relation and condition which man in his individual person stands in toward his Maker can not be changed by any human law or human authority, that religious devotion, which is a part of this compact, can not so much as be made a subject of human laws.

PAINE was a sinner, and his name is cast out as evil because of his denial of Christ's deity; but it must nevertheless be fully recognized that he clearly saw and fully recognized the moral sovereignty of God. What then should be thought of those who, while claiming to be Christians, deny that sovereignty which Paine acknowledged and which is the very basis of Christianity? Are they better than Paine? Are they not worse? for do they not by their intolerance so misrepresent Christianity as to turn men away from it and cause them to become infidels? Before the Christianity of Christ, ever so faintly seen, humanity bows in awe, and admires even though it does not embrace. But in the presence of the miserable counterfeit that would force itself on all that does not consent, to rebel is the duty of the faithful. Where is the temptation? and whose the final retribution?

THE true infidelity is that which is wrought against God by those who, professing to receive our Lord in the character of his friends, that under the guise of friendship misrepresent his teachings, and in his name seize power which he himself refused, and which he never authorized his followers to exercise in his behalf. Christ drove out of, hides himself from those who, instead of crowning him sovereign to rule in our hearts, and introducing his others as "his children by creation" would take him by force and make him king, in order that by putting him on an earthly throne, they may compass their own aggrandizement.

Christ's word to his followers is, "Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." And the only commission or authority he has given us is to "go into all the world, and preach the gospel."

"My kingdom is not of this world;" and to every one of his professed followers who have aspired to temporal power in his name, and presumably for the furtherance of his gospel of love, has come the inevitable rebuke. Is it any wonder that judging Christianity by its self-appointed agents, many have rejected it as no better than Mohammedanism, the religion that was spread by fire and sword?
