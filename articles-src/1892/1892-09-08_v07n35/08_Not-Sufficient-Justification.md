# Not "Sufficient Justification"

THE Pittsburg *Commercial Gazette* of August 4, referring to memorial against the gross voting of the closing of the World's Fair says:—

Patriotism and fealty to their official oaths and their respect for the first article of the Constitution, as amendments in favor of the bill, were sufficient justification for those who voted against the measure.

Whatever or whomever else might be the legal character of what may be styled the legislation was, we take it, was sufficient justification for the few senators who voted against the bill. "This is to do," "fidelity to their official oaths," was sufficient justification for those who voted from voting in favor of any such measure. We fail to see how it can be otherwise, for, according to Section 3 of Article VI. of the Constitution of the United States, every senator and representative, of Congress and all the several State

legislatures, is "bound by oath of affirmation to support this Constitution, . . . the First Amendment of which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." It has never been sufficient justification for every one of them to have been to lay aside all misgiving whatever to do with the Sunday-closing measure, and every one who voted against it would have won commendation for his fidelity to their official oaths. If they chose to do this in refusal. But because they chose to violate the Constitution by legislation they thought it not wise statesmanship to refuse to do it. The Constitution and so passed the measure, and thus committed the Government of the United States to a course of religious legislation, the logical outcome of which is precisely what the Roman Empire, national and State, has always been.
