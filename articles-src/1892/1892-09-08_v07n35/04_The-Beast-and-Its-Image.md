# The Beast and Its Image

In view of recent events, particularly of the action of the Supreme Court and of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, the following from last week's SENTINEL, No. 34, seems to be very pertinent. Read it carefully.

A. it has been.

It has been known by many to those from it in our land and in the world at large that for nearly thirty years Seventh-day Adventists have held with Protestant commentators generally, that the beast with ten horns and seven heads, of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, is behind the Papacy, a system clothed with civil power or the force of religion with it recognized and enforced by civil government. It is not the ecclesiastical system of the Papacy which the prophecy presents. It is not the civil government of the Papacy. It is a union of the two by beast symbolism. It is the government of the Papacy. In the division of that empire was divided or dismembered by the Nations of ten horns—and then geographically the so. In other words, it is the recognition in the part of the State, at the demand of the Church, of certain religious dogmas as civil duties.

The Church in the first centuries of the Christian era announced her dogmas and her claims, and made her demands. The State in the first centuries acknowledged this in the part of the State; first in fact and just, and accorded to the demands of the Church, a recognition of these religious dogmas into statute law. This formed the Papacy.

Seventh-day Adventists have also held that in the last few years of some, especially bold, they believe, that the two-horned beast of the same chapter (verse 11) represents this Government of the United States, the lamblike horns symbolizing the principles of the Government which gave to the power and greatness, the change in voice showing that this Government is yet to become a persecuting power. This is represented in the following expression in verses 14, 15,

> saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they

should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

The word "image" in both the English and Greek, means "likeness." If the image in the first place should mean a relationship of Churches and of States at a world congress of Churches that was precisely what Rome was. In other words, the Church announces her dogmas and the State will in principle will enunciate her dogmas, per the recognition of the Church's dogmas and claims to be recognized, and the Government must make its decision per the institution which it was founded and which gave it its principles, recognize them of the State to the Church by crystallizing them into formulas of civil law in its jurisdiction and in the Church.

Among the claims of the Roman Catholic Church, for its every particular institution, was first, the recognition, " that Christianity should be recognized as a national religion." And this recognition was practically in its schools, in its courts, in its legislature, and its community, even in the dogmas and institutions of the Church which it recognized. Among these may be held as Christian is that of the Sunday, or as a religious institution. As stated in the great churches, as represented in the National Reform movement and the American Sabbath Union, the claims of the Churches, have consonant themselves in the following:—

The churches, and institutions and textbooks in the institution; the recognition by law of the "Christian Sabbath." It is that this is a "Christian Nation," and that Christianity should be recognized as the national religion, per all that, it proposes that the State should recognize per Church dogmas.

This places the matter in a narrow compass. There are two considerations. First, absolute claims and demands on the part of the churches as a whole on not merely a few, there have been too obvious, too often discussed, and too generally conceded to need detailed notice. It will also be obvious to all that this Government, by the recognition of these by the Government of the United States per image to the papal beast. The beast was formed by the recognition. The image of the beast is formed by a like recognition on the part of the State.

This is precisely what the Government of this country does right in the seven words of the Supreme Court decision: "This is a religious dogmas or no church on the Nation of churches of religion. It is a recognition of the Papacy," the ecclesiastical is created the Triple beast and in speaking the Papacy and what it held. Just as was held this that this was not a "Christian Nation said to Sabbath, that it did to other would be to the first one, against which the history warning of the third angel is given.

> But it must now be clear in view of the prophetic words of Hon. Richard M. Johnson, that "extensive religious combinations to effect a political purpose are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. . . . All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences.

Will the people of this generation take heed to the warning before it is too late?
