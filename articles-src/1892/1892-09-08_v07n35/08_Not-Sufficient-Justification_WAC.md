The Pittsburg Commercial Gazette of August 11, referring to members of Congress voting for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, says:—

Patriotism and fidelity to their official obligations, no less than a desire to fully represent the popular will, were sufficient justification for those who voted in favor of Sunday closing.

Whatever an obsequious cringing to the loud clamors of what may be styled "the popular will" may have led our national legislators to do, "fidelity to their official obligations" would most surely have prevented them from voting in favor of any measure to enforce Sunday observance; for, according to Section 3 of Article VI of the Constitution of the United States, every senator and representative, both of Congress and of the several State legislatures, is "bound by oath of affirmation to support this Constitution," the First Amendment of which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This would have been sufficient justification for every one of them to have refused to have anything whatever to do with the Sunday-closing measure, and fidelity to their "official obligations" would have compelled them to thus refuse. But because of the popular clamor for religious legislation they thought it not wise statesmanship to refuse the demand of the churches, and so passed the measure, and thus committed the United States Government to a course of religious legislation, the end of which will be, as was the like course of the Roman Empire, national ruin.
