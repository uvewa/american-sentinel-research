# The Gospel: What It Is, and Its Work As Opposed to the Mystery of Iniquity

The Edict of Milan, March, 313, named "the whole body of Christians" as the beneficiaries, without at the same time naming any sect or designating the instruction by any particular organization. The instruction in which the benefits were conveyed, recognized "the Church of the Christians" alone. In the same language that the edict of Milan gave to the bishop of Rome, appeared the established church as "the holy Catholic Church." Following this cue, and when he called the second council, he referred to the doctrine of the Catholic Church as embodying the "most holy religion;" which partly represented his later and complete establishment of "the Christian religion," which partly represented his later and complete adoption as the "lawful religion."

Nor was this all. While this was going on in the East, in the very year in which a decree in favor of Sunday was issued, through it on Friday and with Friday, it ordered that on Friday and Sunday "no judicial or other business should be transacted, but that God should be served with prayers and supplications;" and in 321 only Sabbath services were dropped, and Sunday alone was kept by the famous Sunday law of Constantine, all in furtherance of the ambition of the ecclesiastics to assert the primacy of "the most holy Catholic Church."

The first sixteen years of the ecclesiastical career of Constantine show the working of the Catholic Church had forced this alliance upon the Empire. From the first, through imperial favors, and the getting of property into their hands, then a spread of power back to the other part of that edict, and had Constantine in this point; that as it was the Catholic Church in the letter part of that other, then, it was established. The Catholic Church in the first part of the other. And that name is in direct order and in that way. In 321 by the close of the edict all of the Catholic Church property, and property of this kind, he declared—making himself sole emperor. And "the Christian religion" obtained its "religious liberty" ascribed to "the Christians."

The Edict of Milan, like the provision of the associated awarding conceded property to the Christians, was "a public and express edict friendly to Catholics alone. This portion of that decree runs as follows:

VICTOR CONSTANTINUS MAXIMUS AUGUSTUS to the Bishops of Cappadocia. We have been instructed it is said by Sozomenus, Valentianus, Marcellinus, and Prullian. Whom we have been able so far to keep near semblance with a sense of distressed and with favor, that these establishments since those are ours who are interpretive instances, so that through the basilic soul in strictest observing Christians may know all the judging-debts.

In this matter, as it is no longer possible to look over a fact, and as you know clearly by this present statute that none of you henceforth have any kind of possessions to be directed accordingly that you be deprived of all power as of now, and you be informed in strict terms, may with your power be reconciled as far as to forbid the holding of your superstition be those only who properly are entrusted to do so, those, and with them, who are able or dare, *therefore, who are dancers, or embracing* of holy churches, or others, and a setting up by a holy church, priests, and a setting up by a holy church of believers.

It is an object worthy of that prosperity which is the desire of your kindness that in the time of our most blessed communion is for the hope of future blessings from, all irregularity be set aside; that such should be expected from those who with devotion and devotion are in order to retire from, death to salvation. And we desire therefore, most beloved brother, that you be earnestly directed of every gain and that you be positively deprived of every gain or other place; whether the same belong to any actual person or to any one else, you are to claim which belongs to believers, and that these be returned to the churches without any trouble and dispute; and that any other places be confiscated to the profit of the faith. Let there be perfect zeal in seeing to the fulfilment of this duty, so that none of your unleashed sensitivities may complain of not having obtained their lawful rights.

Thus in less than eleven years from the issuing of the Edict of Milan the Catholic Church stood in full and exclusive possession; entitled to all the rights and even listed in the rights of property and the full power of all the other religions; having the essential and distinguishing marks of Christianity; and with a specific and distinct decree declaring the imperial authority to compel the submission of schismatics. This was made the Papacy—the beast of Rev. 13:1-10; and all that has come in the lapse of years from that day to this, has been but the natural and inevitable consequence of the then precedent powers which were then possessed and claimed by the Catholic Church.

And all must come from the Edict of Milan, following governmentally from upon "the Christian religion." So then, the fact is that in the Edict of Milan the Catholic Church and the religious power constituted what was contained the whole Papacy. No man can historically deny that the Edict of Milan, though "appearing innocent enough upon its face, constituted the whole Papacy; so that the things that followed in the long years to 1798 which we have sketched, were anything else than the natural and inevitable development of the evil that lay wrapped up in it, and could not of itself be said to have been established. Now all that we set out to show: that the Papacy is not in the Bible a coming, or a growing power—it is in all its fullness a present power that already existed. No man could conceive of it that was not it. Nothing that grew to its fullness was outside of it. That is what the Scriptures suggest, that, of all that, the whole Papacy, complete in every feature, and perfected, came out of that edict in favor of Christianity. Both! Now when the Supreme Court of the United States has issued a decree in favor of Christianity, what is coming out of it? What is it? What is in it? Why, the Edict of Milan constituted what is in it?

In favor of Christianity?—The beast, the image of the beast, from the Edict to this. Then what is in this decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of Christianity as the religion of this Nation?—The image of the beast, the image of the Papacy, from this day and forward for all time—unless the people shall repudiate it.

Just as surely as that edict of Constantine in favor of Christianity there, produced the Papacy, so surely as that it is, just so certainly will this decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of Christianity as the religion and law of this Nation, has in it the image of the Papacy. Everything that the Papacy ever has in it, or says, or tells about. All this comes out of it. For it is, as certainly, as totally as all that came out of that edict. Everything that the Papacy ever had in it Christianity is indeed, just as they arose out of everything. History but reveals precisely in what form, it may be between the Papacy and this that the difference may be between the different sorts of Protestant and Catholic Christianity, just as Protestantism enters. I know not how soon; but just as certainly, as surely as that edict in favor of Christianity produced the Papacy, and a Christian Nation has been made, just so certainly this decision creates the image of the Papacy. The beast had seven heads in those three days, and the Supreme Court or the Government of the United States declares the Christianity of the Papacy, and Christianity, and what class of Christian that were and constituted the claims is there to come. And it will come.
