Not content with sending "the five leading members of the Springville Adventist Church" to jail for doing honest work on Sunday, some of the officers of Henry Counyf, Tenn., would like to make paupers of them by stripping them of their property to pay unjust fines and costs. Article 11, Section 11, of the Constitution of Tennessee provides that:—

A homestead, in the possession of each head of a family, and the improvements thereon, to the value of, in all, one thousand dollars, shall be exempt from sale under legal process during the life of such head of a family, to inure to the benefit of the widow, and shall be exempt during the minority of their children occupying the same.

In addition to the real estate exempted by this article of the Constitution, the Legislature has by law exempted certain articles of personal property, necessary farming implements, etc., and that the specified property "shall be exempt from seizure in criminal as well as in civil cases." (See code of Tennessee, chapter 4, article 1, section 3,933.) But these exemptions do not extend to property levied upon for the payment of taxes. Anything that a man has can be taken for taxes, except what he has upon his person.

The position taken by some of the officers of Henry Counyf in the Adventist cases is that the portion of costs accruing to the State is in reality a State tax, and that any property can be taken to pay it. This was the position taken by the deputy sheriff who assured the imprisoned men that he could if so disposed take anything that he could find to pay the "State tax," as he called it. It is doubtful, however, if he believed it himself, for while he searched diligently for chattels out of which he could make the costs, he seized only one piece of property, a spring wagon, an article not exempted by the statute. But whatever the deputy's view of the law may be, it is certain that State costs are not in any sense a State tax. "Taxes," says Judge Cooley, "are burdens or charges imposed by the Legislature upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes." But the Constitution of the State of Tennessee provides that,—

All property shall be taxed according to its value, that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature shall direct, so that taxes shall be equal and uniform throughout the State. No one species of property from which tax may be collected shall be taxed any higher than any other species of property of the same value.

The Legislature has provided that all taxation shall be by assessment of the property taxed. It is evident, therefore, both by the Constitution and by the statute law of Tennessee, that State costs are not in the nature of a State tax, and can not be collected by distraining property exempt from execution. The Tennessee persecutors may imprison the Adventists under the wicked Sunday law which the courts of that State have made for that very purpose, but they can not rob them of their property and beggar them under the Constitution as it now stands; for it is incredible that any court would so stultify itself as to hold that State costs are in the nature of a State tax. Let the Adventists see to it that those who invoke the law against them, confine their persecutions to the law, and that neither the bigoted religionist, zealous for the dogmas of his sect, nor the avaricious official, greedy for fees, goes beyond the law which he invokes.
