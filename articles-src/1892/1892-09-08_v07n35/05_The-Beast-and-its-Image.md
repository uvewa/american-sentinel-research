[In view of recent events, particularly the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, and the act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, the following article from the Signs of the Times, a Seventh-day Adventist paper, of Oakland, Cal., is of interest.]

It has been known by many ten thousands in our land and in the world at large that for the last two score years Seventh-day Adventists have held with Protestant commentators generally that the beast with ten horns and seven heads, of the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, symbolized the Papacy, a system clothed with civil power, or the dogmas of which were recognized and enforced by civil government. It is not the ecclesiastical system of the Papacy which the prophecy presents. It is not the civil governments of the Roman Empire as such which the beast symbolizes. It is the governments (indicated by the ten horns) into which that empire was divided or dominated by the Papal Church that are portrayed so graphically before us. In other words, it is the recognition on the part of the State, at the demand of the Church, of certain religious dogmas and claims.

The Church in the first centuries of the Christian era enunciated her dogmas and her claims, and made her demands. The State in the first centuries acknowledged those dogmas as divine, those claims as just, and acceded to the demands of the Catholic Church by crystallizing those dogmas into statute law. This formed the beast.

Seventh-day Adventists have also held for the last two score of years, logically held, they believe, that the two-horned beast of the same chapter (verse 11) represents this Government of the United States, the lamblike horns symbolizing the principles of the Government which gave it its power and greatness, the dragon votes showing that this Government is yet to become a persecuting power. This is further shown in the following expression in verses 14, 15:—

Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword and did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

The word "image" in both the English and original means "likeness." An image to the first beast would mean such a combination of Church and State as would make this Government virtually what Rome was. In other words, the Church (whether one or many does not alter the principle) will enunciate her dogmas, put forth her claims, and demand that these claims be recognized, and the Government will, contrary to the principles on which it was founded and which gave it greatness, recognize these dogmas of the Church by crystallizing them into fundamental or statute law.

Among the claims of the churches of this country, put forth on every possible occasion, is that this is a "Christian Nation," and that Christianity should receive recognition by the Government, especially in its oaths, its schools, its courts, its offices, and its postal service. Among the dogmas and institutions which the churches, both Protestant and Catholic, hold as Christian is that of the Sunday, or so-called "Christian Sabbath." All the great churches, as represented in the American Sabbath Union, and in various other ways, have committed themselves to the Sunday institution and are united in demanding its recognition by law. Their demand is based on the claim that this is a "Christian Nation," and that Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath," and that, this being so, it is but logical, just, and proper that the State should recognize both of these claims.

This places the matter in a narrow compass and so plain that all can see. The above claims and demands on the part of the churches as a whole no one will deny; they have been too obvious, too often put forth, too strenuously insisted upon, to be denied. It will also be obvious to all that just as soon as these claims are recognized by the Government of the United States just so soon we have produced before us the image to the papal beast; for that beast was formed by the recognition of the claims and demands of the Church on the part of the State.

For one hundred years the Government of this country kept right on in the even tenor of its way, recognizing the claims or religious dogmas of no church or combination of churches. It expressly declared in the Tripoli treaty and in reports of both Houses of Congress in 1829 and 1830 that this was not a "Christian Nation," that it recognized no religion and no Sabbath, and that to do either would be the first step, against which the history of nations in the past stood like a beacon warning.

But recently a change has come. The prophetic words of Hon. Richard M. Johnson have proved true, that "extensive religious combinations to effect a political object are always dangerous," and that, if such combination becomes strong and persistent, this civil power, with all that it means, will eventually bend under it, and be controlled by it. (See article entitled "Warnings from the Past," in Signs of Aug. 8.) We now have the beginning of the sequel. On the 29th of last February the Supreme Court of the United States, through Justice Brewer, decided in so many words that

"THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION."

This decision seemed to be demanded, "because," in the language of the court, "this is a religious people," a statement which our readers all know to be without foundation. The decision then declares that "from the discovery of this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making this affirmation;" and it cites in proof of this the Roman Catholic commission of Ferdinand and Isabella to Columbus, the Episcopal grant of England's "Defender of the Faith," Queen Elizabeth, to Sir Walter Raleigh, the Puritan compact of the Pilgrims in the Mayflower, the grant to William Penn, the laws of Massachusetts for the support and maintenance of religion by public taxation, and the declaration of faith required by the Constitution of Delaware, in 1770. The decision then quotes from the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States the following:—

Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,—

an utterance in fundamental law which was designed to forever shut out from the fair land of America, the religious intolerance of the Old World governments, from which emanated all of the above utterances on which the decision was based. The religious declarations from Columbus down to the adoption of the Constitution are all diametrically opposed to and by the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Amendment is put there for the purpose of opposing the entering of any such sentiments into this Government. Yet in the face of all this this Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, declares:—

There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal language pervading them all, having one meaning: they affirm and reaffirm that this is a religious Nation. . . . They speak the voice of the entire people.

The decision then cites the declaration of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that "Christianity is, and always has been, part of the common law." This it accepts as authority, as it does also the decision of Chief Justice Kent, of New York, which "assumes that we are a Christian people." From this it proceeds to consider the form of oath prevailing, and from that to "the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath." "These," says the court, "and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that

"THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION."

Here is the decision of the highest branch of the Government that Christianity is the religion of this Nation, and this is just what the Constitution, the fundamental law of this Government, is made to mean. It matters not how the common mind may understand the Constitution, and the First Amendment thereto, designed by our forefathers as a safeguard against the encroachment of religion, the Supreme Court has decided the matter, and that settles it. Congress might pass a law to that effect. Congress and three-fourths of the State Legislatures might change the Constitution so that it would declare this to be a "Christian Nation," but we do not see how all that could make the matter any stronger than this decision of the Supreme Court, which, in the matter of law, is above both Congress and president.

We have, then, the claims of the Church that "this is a Christian Nation," and the demand that it be recognized by the Government. We have the decision of the Supreme Court, the highest branch of the Government, the final arbiter in the matter of law, recognizing the demand of the Church and crystallizing it into organic law; and with that decision sanctioning laws against blasphemy, and in favor of the support and maintenance of religion by public taxation, Sunday laws, etc. Is there anything more that is necessary to constitute an image to the beast? This Government has done just what the civil power of Rome did. From the recognition of the demands of the Church in the first centuries of the Christian era the beast was formed in the Old World. From the recognition of the demands of the Church by this Government,

THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST

was formed in this country when the Government recognized the demands of the Church by the Supreme Court decision, on February 29, 1892.

The next step in the prophecy is to give life to the image. This must be by the action of the law-making power of the Government. Has this step been taken?—It has, in the action of Congress August 5, 1892, in the recognition of the Sunday dogma of the Church by closing the World's Fair on that day. This was the logical step for the Government to take. If this is a "Christian Nation," and if Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath," it logically follows that the "Christian Nation" ought to enforce the "Christian Sabbath"—a dogma upon which the Christian Church as a whole, both Catholics and Protestants, agree.

This is logically the first step to follow the making of the image. It has been taken. Life has been given to the image. The next step is to enforce by oppressive laws and penalties what it has now recognized. The Government has now taken its stand, it has declared its position, and the clamors of a backshidden Church and the "honor" and "dignity" of the Nation will force the civil authorities to do just what the prophecy has said they would do. It has declared that Sunday is the Sabbath of this "Christian Nation," and its next step will logically be to see that its declarations are respected.

We no longer walk by faith in the fulfillment of the prophecy of Revelation 13. We are seeing its fulfillment before our very eyes, and louder than ever would we lift a warning voice to our fellow-countrymen, in the language of inspiration: "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation." Rev. 14:9,10. "Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come; and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." Verse 7.
