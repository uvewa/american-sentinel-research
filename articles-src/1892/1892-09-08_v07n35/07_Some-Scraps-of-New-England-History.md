# Some Scraps of New England History

SOME SUFFERING OF THE QUAKERS

In July, 1656, Mary Fisher and Anne Austin, two Quaker women, arrived in Boston. By some means, news of their coming had preceded them. Before they were suffered to come on shore from the vessel, the deputy-governor, Governor Bellingham, sent officers to search them. He said, "searched the trunks and chests, and took away their books, then detained, and carried them ashore, after awhile kept prisoners ashore; and the said books kept prisoners ashore; and the said books were, by the warrant of the above-said deputy, sent to be burned. The women were kept prisoners ashore; and the said books were, by the warrant of the magistrates, made the market-place by the hangman. The women were then stripped naked, however, and once 'what' on plea to prison; their persons were strictly searched for tokens of witchcraft. Having been kept five weeks in prison, during which time no person was allowed to come to them, not permitted to have any candles, they were sent away."

They were not provided with victuals, except by purchase. Nicholas Upsal, one who lived in Boston, and was a member of the church there, bought of the jailer, for five shillings a week, the privileges of furnishing them with food. . . . Another order was issued to the jailer, commanding him to search or allow to be seen, no more boxes, chests, and things of the Quakers furnishing and bringing to the custody, for pen, ink, papers and books, and to take care those from them.

"After having been driven from about a vessel, was barred to one hundred pounds bond, to carry them back, and not suffer any to converse with them,—the wind being contrary, they were forced to stay on board; and the jailer kept their charge for the journey, notwithstanding the fees." During the imprisonment they were frequently examined by the magistrates with a view to getting some hold on them by which they might be dealt with for the heresy of schism, or some such crime, but all to no effect. As it regards the two women that they happened to be sent away as they came together, they afterward followed a different route, and was not a little displeased. Bellingham was a most dogmatic governor, for dealing so strictly with these people, declaring that if he had been consulted, he would have had them whipped," although as yet the colony had no law against the Quakers.

These two women had not been long out of the jurisdiction, before eight Quakers arrived in Boston. They were subjected to the same treatment, but with less vigor, for fear they had been made to come, and there, it was two had been. In the same month of September, the authorities of the Plymouth Colonies met at Plymouth, and the Bostonian Colony to Plymouth Colony to vigilance, especially against the Quakers,

Having heard some time since that our English nation, to beguile and spread its faith, is in great part seems to be wanting to themselves in preventing the spreading and promoting of the mastery of the gospel; as so many prize lovers have readily put forth their efforts to secure themselves against this common plague. Such an action may be taken, as that a pious orthodox care is had for the preserving of religion in its truth and purity. We therefore have its resolution received. Have hath arrived amongst us several persons professing themselves to be Quakers; who are to propagate the kingdom of Satan, the forwarding of these to places far from home, as may appear by the enclosed from which we may receive plain from whence they came.

From this it proceeded naturally, not to say accordingly; but Bradford, who was governor of Plymouth, would not authorize any such steps. After his death, however, October 14, 1656, the general court passed a law against the colonial welcoming.

Whereas there is an accrued sect of fanatics lately risen up in the world, which are commonly called Quakers, who take upon them to be inspired, and take upon themselves to be immediate from the Spirit, to speak and write.

And elsewhere the same order of the court: "upon the conviction of such persons, which to distinguish were disgusting separating and reviling magistrate powers, by fine and imprisonment as the court judges meet." This court taking into consideration the premises. This court also took into consideration the premises. It is thought needful that some course should be taken, in which in this court it is ordered and so enacted, as followeth: That no Quaker, ranters, or any such corrupt persons shall be admitted, and such as come shall be committed to the house of corrections, and at their being sent, pink, or catch, shall henceforth bring into any harbor of this jurisdiction, any known Quaker or Quakers, or other blasphemous heretic, shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fine of one hundred pounds to this treasury of the country, or sent to prison till the fine is complied with, or at their own being such, and in that case he be banished either to some country by his own cost either
