"Paganism Surviving in Christianity." By Abram Herbert Lewis, D.D., author of "Biblical Teachings Concerning the Sabbath and the Sunday." "A Critical History of the Sabbath and the Sunday in the Christian Church," "A Critical History of Sunday Legislation," etc., etc., 12 mo., gilt top, $1.75: G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London.

THIS, the latest of Dr. Lewis' works, is in some respects at least, the ablest that he has yet given to the public. The book is a perfect mine of well-arranged facts told in a most happy, interesting, and forcible manner. The aim of the book is to throw light upon the history of the first four centuries of the Christian Church; and to the average reader, at least, the work seems to leave little to be desired in this particular line of research. The author does not profess that his work is exhaustive, but it is certainly thorough and satisfactory.

In the outset Dr. Lewis warns the reader that—

He who judges the first century by the nineteenth will fall into countless errors. He who thinks that the Christianity of the fourth century was identical with that of the New Testament period, will go widely astray. He who does not look carefully into the history of religions before the time of Christ, and into the pagan influences which surrounded infant Christianity, can not understand its subsequent history. He who can not rise above denominational limitations and credul restrictions can not become a successful student of church history, nor of its present tendencies, nor future developments.

We have italicised the concluding sentence in this quotation from the author's preface, to call special attention to a most important truth clearly expressed, and yet, we think, not fully comprehended even by our author.

The book deals less in the theoretical and speculative than in the practical and demonstrable. It shows that in corrupting Christianity paganism struck at its very root by applying to the sacred Scriptures that system of Oriental philosophy in which were the seeds of what in later times came to be known as gnosticism. "This claimed to hold within itself," says our author, "the knowledge of God and of man, of the being and the providence of the former, and of the creation and destiny of the latter." "In Oriental religions all external phenomena expressed a hidden meaning. Applying this doctrine to the Scriptures, the Jewish Gnostics taught that a hidden meaning was to be found in all the laws, ceremonies and rituals. They invented the theory that a secret tradition had been handed down from the time of Moses; the interpretation of the Jewish Scriptures had been greatly perverted in this way."

It was by this means that much of paganism was very early injected into Christianity. It was in this way that pagan water-worship corrupted Christian baptism, that pagan sun-worship and holidayism well sigh supplanted Christian Sabbath observance, and that Church and State union—a system of pagan origin—came to be regarded as essential to the highest development of national and social life.

Chapters nine, ten, and eleven are devoted to a discussion of the relations which have existed between Church and State, and to those relations which should exist. The two are very different. These chapters are especially valuable.

Our author ruthlessly tears the mask from the Sunday institution and shows that it has no just claim to be regarded other than as a pagan holiday; and that if the tide of modern "holidayism" is to be stayed, if the evils of the "Continental Sunday" are to be averted, it must be by a return to the Sabbath of the Bible, and to voluntary Christian Sabbath observance instead of compulsory Sunday keeping, which always has, and ever will, result in vicious idleness rather than in hallowed rest.

That such a return, not only to the true Sabbath and its voluntary observance, but also to the primitive simplicity of the gospel will yet be made, our author believes, "In that better day," says the doctor, "the civil law will give all religion full protection and full freedom, without regard to majorities or creeds. It will neither oppress by persecution, nor control under the name of protection." It is here that our author violates the principle which he himself so clearly lays down, namely, that he who would become a successful student of church history so as to be able to judge both of present tendencies and of future developments, must rise above denominational limitations and credul restrictions. There is a "better day" coming, but history gives us no reason to expect it. Quite the contrary. History repeats itself; and already signs are not wanting which indicate that modern civilization is about to crumble under its own magnificence, even as Rome crumbled a millennium and a half ago. And the Scriptures plainly declare that instead of growing better, "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse," that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution," and that until destroyed by the brightness of Christ's second coming, the "mystery of iniquity," the "man of sin," the Papacy, that great corrupter of true religion, that seducer of the people of God, shall continue his wicked work and sustain his blasphemous pretensions. "That better day" will come, but it will be ushered in not by human reform, but by the coming of our Lord, by the dashing in pieces of all earthly powers, and by the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God.

However, on the whole, "Paganism Surviving in Christianity" is one of the best books with which we are acquainted, and we wish that everybody would read it.
