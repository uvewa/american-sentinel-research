# How a Friday Holiday Became a First-Day Sabbath

How can Sunday be such a day as is claimed by those who observe it? In the Bible, when those very Scriptures above were written, there were no particular passages of Scripture showing any such change. In fact it is just the opposite—all Scriptures to show that Sunday was a common working day. The material for examination could be multiplied, if need be, and the difficulty of getting information from the biblical to the historical conditions of the centuries following into the hands of theologians is a very fruitful inquiry. The history of Sunday is a fiddle on which any tune can be played.

But to the question. Sunday was named by any biblical writer nor by any writer before the fourth century as a Sabbath or holy day. It was simply the day after the Sabbath. It was made sacred, using that word in a restricted sense, by the resurrection. There is no historical or scriptural statement of this change.

It was on Friday of March 15, A.D. 29, in the city of Jerusalem, on the cross of the crucifixion, that "he bowed his head" and died, commanding there be no disorder, and pronouncing "It is finished" upon the cross. This edict continued as a holiday to the Jewish community from that era, comprising the largest portion to this day of Israel that were promised. And that day was the day of preparation, the last day of the week. It was the day before the Sabbath. And it continued to be observed by Christian communities as such by some. Being already in the habit of keeping Friday, the Christians who were obliged to abstain from ordinary secular employment and from certain food, on the Sabbath or sacred day, observed with all the strictness of a Sabbath, the weekly religious day of Sunday.

The custom is that it was a pagan institution. Again to be dealt with simply as a warning. Yet it must stop somewhere for paganism. Years afterward, when in a persecution the Puritans of England charged inconsistency on the part of the Episcopalians because the Claiming for that Sun set, at spirals, yet observed without the ancient warrant; the boldness of the Church of Rome, and the Puritan was met with the consequences of similar force in consistency because they observed Sunday, second to none, for its clearly ecclesiastical institution of pagan origin, with as little in Scripture as the enforcement of rest on Saint's days and holy days of the Papacy. To extricate themselves from the difficulty of defending from historical facts given for their practice. Necessity, which is the mother of invention, and more often of deception, found a way out of the embarrassment by fabricating the theory that Sunday had rightly taken the place of the Sabbath, basing its history on false and unsupported ground. In the process of time additional supposed arguments were added to this, among which was the one Jesus was in his disciples after the resurrection on the first day of the week in honor of the event, and a tradition thereafter that day became the day of Christian assembly and worship. One of these appearances took place after the disciples had fallen; and it of night and night; another took place during the second division of the day, was the night of the event. All Jesus's historical conversations and actions point to the claim to be fact. Not until certain authorities told them to cast their nets into the sea again, and which, according to the story, they raised a pull of fish that with difficulty only the small boat could retain. In time a few irrelevant scriptural texts were perverted and pressed into the service, and what should seem to have a Bible basis.

The institution of Sunday marked the origin of its very name of Sunday marked, and shows what a shaky institution it is for us to make so much ado over in the way of legislation and on its behalf are as much a disgrace to our civilization as a blot upon the very face of the Constitution and subversive of the principle of equality before the law.

All those who are determined against those who favor of the Sabbath be observed. First, teaching such the first of the pages further "Constantine," has to deal in a very particular way. And if he be able, the power of this world experience; in the time Laws were not cast entirely in the way of even the strictest observance, and without it there should be nothing of this day any particular day according to the necessary direction. Now to direct the course of their civil work and never, in any way, interfere with that other man's rights or another man's property.

The moral natures of both the former and of Sunday laws are improved by their existence, the former because they must invest all; some of hypocritical pretense and shame for their enforcement and continuance, and the latter because they are also constantly planning devices by which to evade them.
