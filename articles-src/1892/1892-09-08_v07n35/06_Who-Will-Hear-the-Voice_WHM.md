A CORRESPONDENT from the city of the World's Fair, who has read THE SENTINEL, quotes the last paragraph of an article in a late issue, in which the final sentence is, "Where is the voice that will sound the truth so loud that it will ring in the ears of every man?" and says: "If you need wisdom to find the voice you have called for you can find it in St. Luke, 9:35." The voice that spoke from the cloud which overshadowed the mountain where Peter and James and John and the Master were at prayer, was the voice of God. The utterance was a command of God—the entreaty of a Father. "This is my beloved Son: hear him." God had spoken to men often since that afternoon in Eden when at the sound of his voice Adam and Eve hid themselves; but they had hidden and stopped their ears, now he both pleads and commands, "Hear my Son!" Christ the Son of God preached to man the gospel of peace and good-will to all, the gospel of salvation from sin—the hope of eternal life. The cry of this voice is, to him who hath ears, let him hear, and whosoever will, let him come. Again, in this afternoon of the world, as the voice of God is heard, by his Son, they hide and they stop their ears. If this be true is there any voice that can sound the truth in the ears of every man, however loud it may speak, until that day when the Lord himself descends from heaven with a shout, and every eye shall see him and every ear hear him?
