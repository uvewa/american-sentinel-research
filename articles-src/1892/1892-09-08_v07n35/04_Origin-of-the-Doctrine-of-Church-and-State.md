Some there be, who, while asking from the Government a recognition of the Christian religion in a national Sunday law, at the same time deny that such a law would be a union of Church and State, and even claim to be opposed to such a union. Yet it is simply nothing else. Any recognition of religion (on the part of the State), or religious institutions, is nothing short of such union. Let the Nation, through Congress, enact such a law, and all the authority and power of the Nation would be invoked to enforce it; and this would be persecution for conscience' sake. Paganism is the greatest system of false worship that was ever invented. And we find it is religion and the State united. In every nation or tribe, the laws written or unwritten, have been made in the interest of religion; indeed, had it not been for the religion of the people, the laws would never have been made. The chiefs, rulers, or heads of the nation, have been the guardians of the religion of the people. There was a time when Rome was a republic. But with wealth came the gratification of every lust. Laws were made against these things, only to be broken. Caesar, who was guilty of almost every crime, was made "the guardian of the public morals."

Constantine the Great is regarded as a Christian emperor; but history testifies that, even after his professed conversion he waded through seas of blood, putting to death his nearest relatives, decreeing the death of some while on his death bed. Being a pagan by birth and education, and following in the steps of his predecessors as a "guardian of the public morals," what more natural than that after adopting, as a matter of policy, the Christian religion, he should at once become its protector, and self-constituted guardian, and make it the religion of the people. This he did, and from that time the cross was the banner that led his armies, as whole nations were made Christians (?) by the power of the sword. Soon, instead of the emperors, it was the popes that ruled the nations. There, with increased powers, and a more relentless rule, were the self-constituted "guardians of the public morals." All history furnishes abundance of proof that whole nations were converted to the Catholic Church, by the force of arms; or in case of a refusal, were only food for her armies, and their wealth made to fill the coffers of Rome. Thus we see that the idea that the State is, in any way, to be the conservator of "public morals," and the power of the State to be wielded in the interests of the Church, is of pagan origin and of papal culture. And so it is, that the Protestants in this country are following unwittingly in the steps of paganism and papalism, in that they are seeking the aid of the State in making this a Christian Nation and securing a recognition of the Christian religion. And Justice Brewer, in his late decision, has, unwittingly perhaps, made the Supreme Court the "guardian of the public morals."
