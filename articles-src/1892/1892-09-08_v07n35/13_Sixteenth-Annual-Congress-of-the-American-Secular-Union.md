THE Sixteenth Annual Congress of the American Secular Union will be held at Chicago, October 23, 24 and 25.

This society was organized in Philadelphia, July 4, 1876, to oppose the encroachments of the National Reform Association upon religious liberty.

The action of Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sundays, at the dictation of a Christian minority, demonstrates that the existence of an active, secular society is a necessity. It also shows how much may be done by thorough organization.

That the Exposition has been ordered closed in accordance with the demand of the people, no one pretends. It has been done by an inferior faction in spite of the people's protest. It is a legend in this Republic that "government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed."

This principle underlies the very existence of the Republic. Through its practical acceptance the United States of America has become the ideal of the world. It represents no king, no priest, no religion, but the people only. The National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Association, the Prohibition party, combining with other less prominent organizations, have ignored the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States by declaring that God, and not the people, is the immediate source of all political power, thus indorsing the fundamental principle of a theocracy.

With this claim they have succeeded in securing governmental recognition of what they claim as "God's day."

Not only have they captured the executive, but the judiciary. The Supreme Court has been seduced to decide in favor of the proposed theocracy, by declaring that "this is a Christian Nation."

Accordingly, people who are not acting in accordance with the Christianity which is recognized by the authorities, are fined and imprisoned, their property confiscated, and although the vast majority believe in freedom of speech and press, and in religious liberty, yet so undisciplined are the loyal forces that no combined resistance is made to this unconstitutional invasion of individual rights.

We hope that every Secularist who can do so, whether liberal or Christian, will attend the Congress, October 23. We desire especially that the lecturers should be present.

At the coming convention the advisability of holding an International Congress in 1892 will be considered. The Board is merely representative, and can go no farther than the members of the organization enable it to go. It is the members, then, and not the Board, that must decide this question.

As the dedication of the Columbian Exposition immediately precedes the Congress, the reduced rates on the railroads at that time will enable liberals throughout the country to attend. Trusting that advantage will be taken of this opportunity, we extend to you, one and all, a cordial invitation to be present, and aid us with your wisdom and advice in outlining the future work and policy of the organization.

CHARLES B. WATTE,
President Am Secular Union.

Chicago, Aug. 22, 1892.
