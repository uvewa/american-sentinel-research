THE Baptist Church and the Young Men's Christian Association of Englewood, a suburb of Chicago, have determined that the managers of the Marlowe theater, of Englewood, shall give no Sunday night entertainments. This suburb has recently been annexed to the city of Chicago, and the theater has paid its license to the city, and claims to be subject to the ordinances of the city to which it pays license; but the church people of Englewood are determined to enforce upon the theater the Sunday closing laws which existed before the annexation. The Baptist church is next door to the theater, although it is claimed that the construction is such that neither is a disturbance to the other. Services or entertainments in progress in one can not be heard in the interior of the other building. Sunday, August 31, the church faction secured the co-operation of the police, and succeeded in so intimidating the actors that they refused to go upon the stage, and the considerable audience which had gathered was disappointed. The theater management returned all admission fees, and prepared to contest the question both by civil injunction against the local authorities and by public argument. On the evening of Sunday, August 28, the theater was thrown open for the discussion of the Sunday closing question. The advocates of Sunday closing by law apparently preferred, however, to carry on their agitation where they could not hear the voices of opponents, or meet with any dissenting views or arguments uncomfortably difficult to answer. They, therefore, gave out their forenoon services that there would be no mass-meeting at the theater in the evening, as there would be no speakers present, and appointed a union meeting of the churches in a more godly place.

Despite this misrepresentation, the theater was crowded to hear the principles of civil liberty in religious matters presented. The auditorium which seats fifteen hundred was filled and the aisles and lobbies packed to the doors. A series of resolutions was adopted protesting against Sunday closing by authority of law, and also this in reference to the World's Fair:—

A mass-meeting of the citizens of Englewood, bearing in mind the policy of the American Republic that there shall be a perpetual separation of Church and State, look with alarm upon the tendency of the times in seeking legislation to advance merely religious interests; therefore be it

Resolved, That we protest against the act of Congress providing for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and we urge that such act in so far as it relates to Sunday be repealed.

The Chicago Times, reporting the meeting, says:

The first speaker was A. T. Ballenger, secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association. He had been sent to Englewood under the information that the Marlowe theatre managers were persecuting the Baptist Church. When he looked over the ground he found the shoe was upon the wrong foot. He said he had never witnessed a more flagrant example of church bigotry and intolerance than is being manifested in Englewood and backed up by a mayor and chief of police who were too cowardly to close Garfield park race track. [cheers.] It was the old, old story of religious bigotry which compassed the crucifixion of Christ, which stoned Stephen, which cast the early martyrs to the wild beasts, which maintained the Inquisition, which caused a Protestant judge to sentence Michael Servetus to be burned at the stake, which prompted the Boston magistrates in Gov. Endicott's time to hang three "heretics" and sentenced two Quaker women to be publicly whipped and driven from the colony. It was the same religious bigotry that burned the Salem witches. It was the same religious intolerance which drove Roger Williams from home in the dead of winter to take shelter with Massacot, the Indian chief, and caused that red "heretic" to exclaim: "What a God have the English that they persecute each other so!" It was the same kind of religious bigotry which sent four honest farmers of Tennessee to jail a few weeks ago for observing the seventh day of the week as a day of rest and working on Sunday. It was the same religious but unchristian bigotry which threatens to close the World's Fair on Sunday. It was time to rise and repel such tyranny. [Cheers.]

COMPULSION NOT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST.

It is this bigotry and intolerance that the National Religious Liberty Association is fighting. It is an attempted union of Church and State. "I am a Christian," concluded the Rev. Mr. Ballenger, "but not the kind of a Christian that invokes a policeman's club to his assistance in converting the world. Compulsion is not the spirit of Christ. It is the result of the union of Church and State. Matters are approaching a grave crisis when a church can dominate the civil power, and call out a platoon of police to enforce the edicts of the so-called Christians. If the Baptist church in Englewood can close up this place it can close up your place, and it would be just as consistent if they would call out the police and close up all other churches and compel everybody in Englewood to worship at the Baptist church. It would come to pass that the church having the strongest pull with the police department would have the biggest congregation. I tell you, my hearers, that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." [Prolonged cheers.]

The chairman then introduced the Rev. A. T. Jones, editor of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, New York. Mr. Jones talks as emphatically as a pile-thiver, and every time he came down the audience applauded. He said the question was simply whether the civil power should be dominated by the religious power. The question concerned not only Englewood, but the whole people of the United States. The speaker read extracts from the Constitutions of the United States and the various States showing that the cornerstone of republican institutions was complete religious liberty.

"The action of the Englewood fanatics," he continued, "is indorsed by neither civil nor divine law. Jesus Christ was the author of free thought and religious liberty. It was the Master who said: 'If any man hear my words and believe not I condemn him not.' If Christ had been fashioned after the Englewood fanatics, he would have called for a squad of police and clubbed his enemies into subjection." [Cheers.]

Mr. Jones spoke nearly two hours.

AFTER THE OTHER THEATERS.

It appears that the Young Men's Christian Association of Englewood, puffed up by its recent victory, is going to close all the Sunday night theaters in Chicago. The Englewood Eye, the organ of the closing faction, says:—

Secretary P. P. Day, of the Englewood Young Men's Christian Association is organizing a movement which is being entered into by the churches and Young Men's Christian Associations all over the city to close every Sunday theatre in Chicago. He days in the week is enough for business and play-house employees and actors ought to have a rest one day in seven the same as other folks.

The Englewood Call contains the following, which is given as the sentiment of the closing faction:—

From the agitation of the question of opening the Marlowe theatre Sunday evenings will spring a movement for the suppression of Sunday theatrical performances and all of the city. The plans are already laid and many prominent people are enlisted in the cause. It will be inaugurated by the emphatically expressed sentiment of all the churches, and a united and systematic movement will then be carried on.

The church people of Englewood are thoroughly determined to close all theatres and places of amusement on Sunday. They have appointed a committee of five to employ counsel and take measures to attain this end.
