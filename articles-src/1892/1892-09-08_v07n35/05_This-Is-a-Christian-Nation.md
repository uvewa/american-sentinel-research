"THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION."

This decision seemed to be demanded, "because," in the language of the court, "a volume of unofficial declarations" which our readers all know to be without legal force; so that the court made this "from the discovery of this constitutional right," the church have a single voice making this affirmation;" and this is also a decree in proof of the Roman Catholic commission of Ferdinand and Isabella to Columbus, the Episcopal grant of all of England's "Defender of the Faith," Queen Elizabeth, to Sir Walter Raleigh, the Puritan compact of the Pilgrims in the Mayflower, the "fundamental orders" of Connecticut establishing the government upon the laws of Massachusetts for the support of Christian ministers and the compulsory taxation, and the declaration of faith, signed by the Constitution of Delaware requiring an oath of faith from every voter, the First Amendment to the Constitution to be a bar to any such general control of religion.

Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.

Church cannot make no law respecting an utterance in fundamental law which was designed to forever shut and from the faith and the religious and the civil infernos of the Old World government, from which emanated all of the utterances in the attention in which the decision was based. The religious declaration from Colonies to the States, from which these declarations are all diametrically opposed to and by the very spirit and letter of the National Government, every one of them. Yet the Amendment is put there for the purpose of oppositely excluding all of these sentiments into this Government. Yet in spite of all this the Supreme Court decision of February 11, 1892, declares in its famous words "this is a Christian Nation." There is a universal language pervading these declarations, and by a universal language the Court can have no other meaning but in the sense of the nations.

Beyond these cities the Constitutions of the State of Pennsylvania, New York, of Delaware, etc., and every State has been, past of the common law. "This is a Christian Nation." It is said by the decision of Chief Justice Kent, of New York, which "assumes that we are a Christian people. From this it proceeds to consider the law of Christianity, and from that to "the law respecting the observance of the Sabbath." "There," says the court, "and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that

"THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION."

Here is the decision, the highest branch of the Government that Christianity is the religion of the Nation, and this is just what the Constitution, the fundamental law of Government, is made to renounce. It matters not how the common mind and understand the Constitution, and the First Amendment thereof, designed by their Grandfathers as a safeguard against the enthronement of religion, the Supreme Court has decided the matter, and that settles it. Congress might refuse to abide by the decision; Congress might change the Constitution so that it shall directly say, "This is a Christian Nation;" but we do not see how all that could make the matter any stronger than this decision of the Supreme Court, which in the matter of it, is above both Congress and president.

We have, then, the claims of the Church that "this is a Christian Nation," and the national claim is the recognition of the Government. We have the decision of the Supreme Court, the highest branch of the Government, the first arbiter in the matter of law, recognizing the demand of the Church and crystallizing it into organic law and this decision is sanctioning laws against blasphemy, and in favor of the payment and maintenance of religion by public taxation. Sunday laws, is there anything more that is necessary to constitute an image to the beast?

This Government has done just what the Roman Government did,—a complete recognition of the demands of the Church in full,—and as in the Old World this formed the beast was formed in the Old World. From this proceeds recognition of these by this Church by this Government.

THIS IMAGE OF THE BEAST was formed in this country when the Government recognized the demands of the Church by the Supreme Court decision, on February 29th, 1892.

The next step in the prophecy is to give it life to the image. This must be by the authority of the law-making power of the Government. But this step has been taken—it has, in its action of Congress at the last session. Congress having recognized the legal dogma of the Church by closing the World's Fair on Sunday, the first and the logical step for the Government to take. Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath," it logically follows that its "Christianity" ought to enforce the "Christian Sabbath," and Congress does this; the Christian Church as a whole, both Catholic and Protestant agrees.

This is logically the first step to follow the making of the image. It has been taken. And will it stop here? Never! The next step is to enforce by oppressive penalties the observance of the day sustained. The Government has now taken the first step in national legislation, and in the claims of a backsliding Church and "the beast of religion." "A Church Nation will force the civil authorities to enforce all such the prophetic theory and word would do. It has declared that Sunday is the Sabbath or "the Christian day of rest," and its next step will logically be to see that the day is properly observed."

No we longer walk by faith in the fulfilment of the prophecy of Revelation 13. We walk by sight. Not "through a glass darkly," but face to face. We see with our very eyes, and louder than ever could we call upon all people to give heed to that message, of the language of inspiration. . . "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, he same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation." Rev. 14:9,10. "Fear God and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."
