# Origin of the Doctrine of Church and State

Some there be, who, asking from the Government a recognition of the Christian religion in a national Sunday law, at the same time deny that such a law would be a union of Church and State, and even claim to be opposed to it as such a union. Yet it is simply impossible. Any recognition of religion on the part of the State, is religion (and that is nothing short of such union. Let the State, through Congress, enact that the Nation would be involved to coerce consciences, and the result would be nothing less than a union of Church and State, and active and vigorous ecclesiastics' sakes. Paganism is the greatest religion in the world—there are more pagans in it. And we find it in religion and the Bible stated. Until at every point or turn, the laws written or unwritten, have been made in the interest of the established religion. Had it not been for the religion of the State, the laws would never have been made. The chiefs, rulers, or heads of the nations, have been the guardians of the established religion; and consequently, when Rome was a republic. But with Rome's first emperor, religious laws were first enacted. Laws were made against these crimes, and naturally, the established religion was guilty of almost every crime, was made "the guardian of the public morals."

Constantine the Great is regarded as a Christian. But history very clearly tells that, even after his professed conversion he waded through seas of blood, putting to death his nearest relatives, dooming the death of others who in his behalf. But being a pagan by birth and education, and following in the steps of his predecessors—who were both pagans and monarchs, "what more natural than that after adopting, as a matter of policy,

the Christian religion, should at once become its protector, and self-constituted guardian, and make it the religion of the State, and make the State the guardian of the religion?" And in every respect, as the cross was the banner that led his army, it was the State that established itself by the power of the sword. Soon, this united State and Church had in its power the army, and all other institutions that ruled the nations. There, with its temporal powers, and a more relationship were the self-constituted "guardians of the public morals." All history testifies in abundance of proof that whole nations were converted to Catholic Christianity, by the force of arms, or in case of a refusal, were only food for her armies, and their wealth made to fill the coffers of Rome. Then we see that the law that the State is, in saying, to be the servant of religion, could not be a servant of the people; that the only interests of the Church, of pagan origin was the State. And upon this origin, the Protestants in this country are following the same path of the Roman Churchmen and papalists, in that they are seeking the aid of the State to make this a Christian Nation and securing a recognition of the Christian religion. And Justice Brewer, in his late decision, has unwittingly made, and the Supreme Court the "guardian of the public morals." —*Public*, in the *Protest of Americans.*

statute. But whatever the deputy's view of the law may be, it is certain that State courts any not in any event a State tax. If a State court refuses to remit a question of charges imposed by the Legislature against the citizen, his property is taken for public purposes." But the Constitution of the United States provides that—

All property shall be taxed according to its value; that value to be ascertained in such manner as the Legislature shall direct, and taxes shall be levied upon such property which forms any one species of property from which tax may be levied in the State as a whole upon other species of property of the State.

The Legislature has provided that all taxation shall be by assessment of the property taxed. It is evident, therefore, both by the Constitution and by the statute that in Tennessee, Christians' real estate is not in the nature of a State tax, and cannot be collected as such. No property except that of a Seventh-day Adventist. No person from any occupation surprises the Adventists or defies the whole State upon the subject of taxation. The courts of that State have made for that matter of taxation purposes. Then, with the taking of their property and beggar them under the Constitution is a new statute. For it is incredible that any court would in actually finding itself to be held that State courts are in the nature of a State tax. Let the Adventists see to it that those who invoke the law against them, confine themselves to the law, and that zealous, intolerant bigoted, zealous for the dignity of law and not, for the indulgence of a greedy for fees, goes beyond the law and the truth, the Adventist rights are upheld.
