A CORRESPONDENT for the Daily News, of Moorhead, Minn., speaking of the organized effort to secure religious legislation in this country, says:—

"We might console ourselves with the idea that these were only a few misguided individuals, and therefore no harm could come of it, did we not know that the Association is legally incorporated, having a publishing house and its own literature, a president and one hundred and twenty vice-presidents, representing thirty States, with our country divided into districts, over which presides a district secretary; that among these may be found some of the leading men of the land, including college professors and doctors of divinity; and that allied with them are some of the strongest and most influential organizations in the country. In fact, they form one of the most potent religious combinations, and that for a political purpose. They are aiming at nothing less than the control of the civil arm for the furtherance of the interests of the Church. Now is there danger in such a combination? From the Senate Report, 1929, we read: 'Extensive religious combinations, to effect a political object are, in the opinion of the committee, always dangerous. . . . All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when that influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it, and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences.

"Will the people of this generation take heed to the warning before it is too late?"
