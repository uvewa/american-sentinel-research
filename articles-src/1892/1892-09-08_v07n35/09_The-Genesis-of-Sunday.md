HOW A PAGAN HOLIDAY BECAME A PART OF OUR CIVILIZATION.

How can Sunday be such a day as is claimed in our times by believers in the Bible, when those very Scriptures show that in the apostles' age it was put to secular uses? The arguments taken from Scripture to show that Sunday was a secular day and the instances of its secularization could be multiplied, if need be, but the reader is asked to pass at once from the biblical to the historical consideration of the subject, since the Bible in the hands of theologians is a very flexible book, being, as some one has said, "A fiddle on which any tune can be played." Sunday was never declared to be sacred by any biblical writer nor by any writer for several centuries after the apostolical period. It was made sacred, using that word in a narrow sense, by civil law and custom. There is no historical proof in controversies. On the 7th of March, 331, Constantine issued his famous Sunday edict, commanding that there be no labor, except in the fields, on the venerable day of the sun. This edict contained no allusion to any Christian sentiment. With the pagans comprising the largest portion of the empire, Sunday was already the chief day of the week. It was the day they had consecrated to the worship of the sun. Being already in the habit of abstaining from labor on that day, they were obliged to abstain from secular pursuits on their conversion to Christianity on the Sabbath or sacred day, which the newly adopted religion brought with it. But as the pagan converts became more numerous than the Jewish, and finding the abstinence from labor on two days—the Sabbath of the Bible and Sunday of pagandom—irksome, they amalgamated the two, and thus Sunday became the sacred day.

Again, to blend as far as possible into one harmonious whole the discordant systems of paganism and Christianity was the height of Constantine's ambition. As a result, it is charged by Protestants that Christianity was corrupted, and all history and candid scholarship sustains the charge. In order to unite the young and rising faith with the old and waning one, compromises were effected, but theologians are loath to face the fact, and, often being in possession of it, are loath to make it known, that one of these compromises resulted in the overthrow of the Sabbath of the Bible in favor of the Sunday of pagandum. Years afterward, when in a controversy the Puritans of England charged inconsistency on the part of the Episcopalians because they, claiming to be anti-papists, yet observed without scriptural warrant the holidays of the Roman Church, the Puritans were met with the countercharge of similar inconsistency because they observed Sunday, since it, too, was clearly an ecclesiastical institution of papal-pagan origin, with as little foundation in Scripture as the various saints' days and holy days of the Papacy. To extricate themselves from these straits, scriptural reasons had to be given for their practice. Necessity, which so often has proved to be the mother of invention, found a way out of the dilemma, and one Nicolaus Bound, promulgated the theory that Sunday had rightly taken the place of the Sabbath, basing his theory on false and unscriptural ground. In the process of time additional supposed arguments were added to this, among which the one that Jesus met his disciples after the resurrection on the first day of the week in honor of that event, and hence thereafter that day became the day of Christian assembly and worship. One of these appearances took place after the disciples had fished all night and caught nothing, which, according to the Jewish division of the day, was the night of the first day of the week, conceding the claim to be correct that it was that day. Jesus that morning himself commanded them to cast their nets into the sea again, which, according to the story, they raised so full of fish that with difficulty only could they lift them. In time a few irrelevant scriptural texts were perverted and pressed into service, so that Sunday might seem to have a Bible basis.

This is the history of Sunday sacredness, and shows what a shallow institution it is for us to make so much ado about in our day. The civil laws in its behalf are as much a disgrace to our civilization as they are contrary to our national Constitution and subversive of the principles Jesus of Nazareth taught, even if they were in favor of the Sabbath he observed. His teachings, until the time of the pagan butcher Constantine's "conversion," had no help from civil powers, yea, rather the powers of this world opposed the Nazarene. These laws not only breed crime and hypocrisy among the irreligious, but also engender intolerance and hypocrisy among the religious. By what principle of Americanism or Christianity is one man to be forced to observe any particular day according to the notions of another, so long as he does not interfere with that other man's rights?

The State's province is in things civil; let the churches look after the conduct of its own members in things religious. So far as religious organizations and individuals avail themselves of those relics of former and darker times, civil laws to enforce religious obligations and practices, so far do they confess to their own inability to do the work devolving upon them, and they proclaim to the world that religion can not stand on its own merits but must have the aid of civil powers.

The moral natures of both the friends and foes of Sunday laws are impaired by their existence; the former because they must invent all sorts of hypocritical pretenses and shame for their enforcement and continuance, and the latter because they are also constantly planning devices by which to evade them.

When the falsity of the claims for Sunday is shown, and that holy day is shown to be an unholy fraud, then its friends begin to whine about the poor laborer, in whose behalf they want the laws enforced. It is true that the laborer needs more rest. He ought to have more than he gets. But who is to determine when he is tired—he himself or the ministers, many of whom have six days of rest and one of labor? In justice, I have as much right to demand that one man shall work on Sunday as he has to demand that I shall rest on that particular day. If laws we must have to give men one day's rest in seven, let them be such laws as shall protect each in his day of rest, but not such as shall compel a man to rest against his will. But why should the efforts of Sunday law advocates be confined to rest on Sunday only? Is Sunday rest the only rest the laborer needs? Under the very eyes of the clergy car drivers work sixteen hours a day, shop girls toil through long, weary hours, seamstresses are, by midnight oil, pricking the blood from their fingers and tearing hope from their hearts. Let the clergy attend more to the amelioration of the condition of these and others like them, and more credit will be given them for sincerity.

It is to be hoped that soon the day will come when we shall have a separation of Church and State, when each will attend to its own business, and when every citizen will enjoy his own rights without interfering with another. This is American and Christian.
