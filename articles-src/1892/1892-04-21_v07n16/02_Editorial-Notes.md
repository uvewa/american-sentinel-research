IN their early history Baptists were persecuted on precisely the same grounds that seventh-day observers are now punished for refusing obedience to Sunday laws. Pedobaptist practices were intrenched in the civil laws, and it was not only heresy to practice otherwise but it was held to be destructive of social order as well, and so, not to be tolerated. The Baptists of those days were "anarchists" and "rebels" just as are those who now refuse to bow to the Sunday laws, which some Baptists advocate, and even help to make.
