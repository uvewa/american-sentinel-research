THE Ohio Legislature has passed a law prohibiting shaving on Sunday, and the penalty for its violation is very severe. During the debate on the bill, according to the correspondent of the Commercial Gazette:

Mr. Marshall excited much laughter by offering an amendment proposing to make it unlawful to shine shoes on Sunday. This, of course, was lost.

Why, "of course"? Shaving requires manual labor done for a consideration, and so does the work of the bootblack. A shave is as necessary to comfort and decency as polished shoes. Verily, let Legislatures be commended for fine spun distinctions where there is no difference!
