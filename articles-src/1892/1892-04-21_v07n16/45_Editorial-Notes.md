In the recent Pittsburg Sunday Convention, Mr. Crafts dramatized quite effectively, and greatly to the disadvantage of the butt of his ridicule, the boast that "the Sunday paper has come to stay." The incident suggested to the writer, who was present, another drama, in two scenes, thus:—

**SCENE I.**

Mr. Crafts on the "reform" lecture platform exhibiting an oriental saw, and saying: "It was such a saw as this that Christ laid down at the close of his week's work on Saturday evening, saying, 'The Sabbath was made for man.'"

**SCENE II.**

Mr. Crafts in the editorial chair of the Christian Statesman: "Reformers should be accurate."

Accurate in what? In statements of fact? or in counting the cash received for Sunday evening "reform" lectures? The editor of the Statesman has quite a reputation for accuracy in the latter particular. Scene I. is a sample of his performances in the other matter. This great apostle of compulsory Sunday-keeping would gladly have the people think that Christ worked on Saturday, the seventh day of the week, and rested on Sunday, the first day of the week, but he himself knows better; and, unfortunately for his cause, the people also know better. The oriental saw and the designedly careless statement are to that extent a failure. They are, however, valuable as a sample of "reform" methods as exemplified by the founder of the American Sabbath Union, its whilom Field Secretary, and now boomer-in-general of "the whole circle of reforms."
