# Why Should Not Baptists Protest?

The Washington correspondent of the *Examiner* (Baptist), takes occasion, in noting the late bearing on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, to say:

> In a former occasion, when the Sunday observance law was before our Committee and urged by many of our local pastors, the strongest kind of a protest against such legislation was made by men styling themselves Baptists.

And why should not Baptists protest against all such legislation? Why should a people who have for centuries resisted to the death every encroachment of the civil power upon the domain of conscience; a people that have become powerful and popular, depart from their ancient principles and yield their consciences into the hands of the Government? Why should they now acknowledge that which for centuries they have denied, namely, that the civil power has a right to require of them any measure of religious observance whatever?

In their early history Baptists were persecuted on precisely the same grounds that seventh-day observers are now punished for refusing obedience to Sunday laws. Publication practices were interfered with; in the civil laws, and it was not known by practice observance, but it was held to be destructive of social order and weal, and so, not to be tolerated. The Baptists of those days were "anarchists" and "rebels" just as are those who now refuse to bow to the Sunday whip, which some Baptists advocate, and even help to

At the late Pittsburg Sunday Convention a good deal of capital was attempted to be made out of a statement that the so-called "Blue Laws" of Connecticut never had any existence except in the imagination of a "renegade preacher" who being forced to leave the Colony returned to England, and there wrote a caricature of the colonial laws, styling them "Blue Laws." There is probably some truth in this statement; yet it does not alter the case materially.

This significant phrase, "Blue Laws," like "aliens nose," and other expressions derived from mythology, stands, not for an historical fact, but for an idea. And so far as the moral is concerned, it would make no difference if Connecticut, as well as the laws said to have governed it, were mythical. The term, "Blue Laws," stands for vile, partisan, bigoted government, for unwarranted interference with personal liberty, and for laws having a Church and State cast of countenance; and handed out as the expression may be to the whole Sunday-law fraternity, they can not avoid its force by explaining that the story of the Blue Laws was overdrawn.

The term, "Blue Laws," is very properly applied to statutes which interfere with the rights of citizens, and with legitimate personal liberty, whether in the matter of conscience or of body. All countries formerly had many such laws, and the American colonies were no exception. The Colony of New Haven adopted the Scriptures as their code of law and government, and this was the basis of the "Blue Laws." When we come to consider the sumptuary regulations and restrictions which grew up among the Jews under a similar system, it is not strange that New Haven soon had interpretations and decisions regulating the most common-place affairs of every day life.

Possibly they never had even in New Haven any regulation so silly as that, but they certainly had many just as unwarranted. They did banish Quakers under pain of death; they did forbid running or walking on Sunday except reverently to and from meeting; they did forbid the use of the Book of Common Prayer; they did prohibit hair-cutting and shaving on Sunday; they did make church membership prerequisite to residence in the Colony; they did forbid the giving of food or lodging to a Quaker or other heretic; and these things were even more wicked, though not before intimated, less silly, than any of the fabled "Blue Laws" of which we have been hearing.

The National Reformers may well wish to divert attention from their position to a discussion of unimportant facts; but as shown in the preceding notes, in this case the facts do not affect the principle. The fact of extreme partisanism is expressed in the term, "Blue Laws," and it is likewise inseparable from National Reform and Sunday-law theories. The Sunday-law forces may not popify "Blue Laws;" but they can not change the fact that they are wedded to the principles so aptly satirized by the "Blue Laws."
