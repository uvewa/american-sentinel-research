THE Idaho World says: "The preachers of Idaho have formed a combination and will circulate their petitions asking that the World's Fair be closed on Sundays." The World adds: "No true American citizen who has any conception of what kind of a link for a proposed long and strong chain he will be helping to forge by signing it, will put his name to such an un-American and unpatriotic request."
