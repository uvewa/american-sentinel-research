THE term, "Blue Laws," is very properly applied to statutes which interfere with the rights of conscience, and with legitimate personal liberty, whether in matters of conscience or not. All countries formerly had many such laws, and the American Colonies were no exception. The Colony of New Haven adopted the Scriptures as their code of law and government, and this was the basis of the "Blue Laws." When we come to consider the numerous regulations and restrictions which grew up among the Jews under a similar system, it is not strange that New Haven soon had interpretations and decisions regulating the most commonplace affairs of every day life.
