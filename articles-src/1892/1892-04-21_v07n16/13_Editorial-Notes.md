# Editorial Notes.

New York, April 21, 1892.

---

The Anti-Poverty Society of this city, about which so much was said some three or four years ago, still holds its meetings on Sunday evenings at Cooper Union.

---

A fee of ten cents is charged for admittance to the Anti-Poverty meetings, and it seems a really good real request with the additional fees. In this the Anti-Poverty Society is not singular; the entirely unique feature of these meetings is that, notwithstanding the charges made for a religious instruction, they have kept up in connection with the opening exercises.

---

Dr. McGlynn, the excommunicated, deposed priest, stands at the head of the Anti-Poverty Society, and at the regular Sunday evening, April 10, meeting, was on the iconography of taking a collection, and the collection was taken. He marked that the collection was the "con of the membership of the meetings" which exhibit the character of semi-religious gatherings, and justifies the holding them on the first day of the week.

---

Dr. McGlynn, on the occasion of the meeting referred to, was the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, which provides that no State shall—

> Use its property or credit, or any money raised by tax, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

The speaker did not confess himself very closely to his subject; but enough was said to make it clear that he was opposed to the proposed amendment, as it now stands; but only, he said, because it was not broad enough.

---

Dr. McGlynn said that he would propose an amendment to the amendment making it provide that no State shall "use the property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any

institution or undertaking not wholly under governmental control."

This wording would accomplish all, and more, the Doctor thought, than was claimed for the amendment as it has been proposed by the Association for the Protection of American Institutions. As it now reads, the speaker suggested, it has the appearance of hostility to all religion, while the true protection against the evil, so-called "unsectarian religious instruction," under Government patronage and support; and in the latter suggestion, Mr. McGlynn was clearly right. It is certainly not the design of the promoters of this proposed amendment to make any wider separation between Church and State than now we exist. On the contrary, the amendment is aimed at Roman Catholics, and is designed to exclude from the public crib all the institutions of that church, without in the least interfering with the giving of "unsectarian religious instruction" of a Protestant cast.

---

From this matter of "unsectarian religious instruction," the *Catholic Review* of the 10th inst., says:—

> Protestant Missionary Societies are well sustained. They send hymn books and copies of the Protestant version of the Bible for use. The text "non-sectarian" public schools which he has modeled for the Indian. Printer Van Gorg, a fact of 2, of Spokane, who is in Washington, D. C., the day ago, and he is reported to have said: "We Indians in the Northwest complain of the treatment the Indians receive, since the last uprising which cost the Government several million dollars, and as far as education is not so bright as could be wished, to the Jesuit Schools, almost the only institutions that have completely succeeded in converting the Indians to civilization. From the Indian Bureau, in spite of its discovery of so-called unsectarian, it seems to realize the necessity of some kind of religion to educate the educating of man, it is in the plain education an so-called "non-sectarian." Indian schools are Indian and Jesuit types. The educational institutions of the country in various types which meet their needs and lead to better of almost every circumstance. The educational methods as represented represent by the founder of the American Republic, to form an alliance of Government favoritism.

In the recent Pittsburg Sunday Convention, Mr. Crafts grandiosely quite the assertion that creation makes every seventh day of rest obligatory, and greatly to the disadvantage of both by the full of his religion, the head was, "the Sunday paper has been replaced." The implication suggested to the writer, who was present, another drama, in two scenes, namely:

**Scene I.** Dr. Crafts's letter plaintively describes his rejected and sent suggest: "It was against all the conscience you displayed; and yet while its close of his work's effect on Saturday evening, say certain items."

**Scene II.** *Dr. Crafts in the editorial chair of the Sunday newspaper.*

"Is that so in what? Is statement a fact? or is counting the cash received for standing evening 'reform' lectures? The editorial pen wields its best."

Dr. Crafts denied that he had quite a reputation for accuracy in the latter particular. Is it is simply a misunderstanding? Then the other matter. This great apostle of Sunday observance, who at the Pittsburg Sunday Convention, was seemingly glad to let the people think that Christ worked, "on some occasions Sabbath or not at all," and rested on Sunday, the first day of the week, has he himself knows better; and, unfortunately for the cause, the people also know better. The oriental new and antiquarian catholic statement not to exact stated a failure. They are, however, valuable for or valueless in "reformed" rhetoric, as suggested by the founder of the American Republic. To be upheld by the claim, Post Secretary, and now boomer-in-general of "the whole circle of reforms."
