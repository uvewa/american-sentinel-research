# The Christian Religion Not a Part of the Common Law of the Land.

The recent closing of the Kentucky exhibit at the World's Fair, by the Legislature of that State is based on a singular fact, and it does not seem to have occurred to the honorable legislators that this matter is one not within their province.

This writer would respectfully suggest that the Legislature of Kentucky could not, constitutionally, make any law upon any subject of a religious nature. The Constitution of the State declares that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious societies or modes of worship."

Now, the keeping of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath is a part of the mode of worship of certain Christian sects, and as to the modes of worship of the Jews, of the Mohammedans, or of certain other sects, is likewise their mode. Christianity, the Mohammedans, and the Chinese, each worship their God, or Gods, differently. Any law, therefore, made to enforce the keeping of the Christian Sabbath, is a law made to "give preference" to "the Christian mode of worship, and must of necessity be unconstitutional."

"But," says one, "the Christian religion is a part of the common law of the land," and by their decision we must abide.

We should certainly respect all law and should properly say any law is pleasant to those who cherish the power of any bodies for which should have for its purpose the changing of the view or the finding. But if any person, who had not been a student in the law, had taken the trouble to look a little into the matter, and consult one or two books, they would have found this claim was a delusion at best, and it rests upon the fact that the old English laws were enacted upon her Colonies, and that the common law of England remained the common law of most of the States until after the independence had been declared.

And Blackstone says also that the Christian religion is a part of the common law of England. "But Americans are not English. We do not live under a monarchy, nor have we an established church; but we have, instead, a Constitution, a Republic, and stability, and founded our Republic upon the express provision of freedom of worship and absolute separation of Church and State.

The contribution to the American Revolution was by the electric eloquence of Patrick Henry in his defense of the people of Virginia against the payment of the tax to support the clergy of the Church of England. And not only Henry, but Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Franklin, and every other patriotic American concerned in the formation of the American Government, demanded total separation of Church and State. And they left an unanswerable record, in their writings, evidence of the Constitution, and by the other instruments of their making, they say:

"No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."

And, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

And nearly every State in the Union has the same provision against religious legislation as has the State of Kentucky, and the Federal Constitution, in that respect.

Doubtless the reason the States failed to enact civil laws from their statute books, was, simply, that all laws in conflict with the Constitution of the several

States of the United States became null and void and of no effect, and it was never dreamed, that they could, a century later, be revived, and used as an engine of oppression for a few people. So dear, then, was liberty, it was supposed the American people would always cherish it and care for ever their territory.

If the learned judges addressed had been fair, or had consulted the histories, they would have found in the *Treaty* of Tripoli, made in 1796, when General Washington was President, and signed by him, this declaration:—

> The Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.

This shows plainly that the Christian religion was not then "a part of the common law of the land." And by what process it has since become so we would like to know.

If the learned judges had looked into the writings of Madison they would have found ample proof of republicanism of equal protection to all in matters of religion, and there is not a feature of civil or lay law in the remotest manner. Space and want of time forbid further argument, but if we look at the matter fairly and honestly, it is so striking it will be its own interpreter.

Now, what shall prevail; which is which? The preamble of Government of the State, as derived by our American foregoers, or the ruins of Church and State derived from the English monarchy where the Christian religion was "a part of the common law of the land," handed down through the ages from Constantine, who established it in the Roman Empire,—or, by giving up of their rightful Sabbath, Saturday—making it a common working day by naming it to the State—making religion a part of the law of the land, and founding the teachings of Jesus Christ, the first great expounder of secularism, of that which is God's from that which is Caesar's?

Shall General Washington or Constantine, the first emperor? Shall Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and the Constitution remain our authorities in this matter, or shall we go back to the fourth century, to the "learned judges," and meekly accept their dicta, as law, while every one of the old English monarchical laws as our rule and guide?

The truth is, religion is a matter of faith, law is a matter of reason and force, between man and his God, law is between men; and a man's religious persuasion, and belongs to the individual; law is a social obligation, and belongs to the community. Religion looks to the prevention of man's happiness in the next world, law looks to the prevention of injustice in this world. They are entirely separate and should be treated accordingly.

The Legislature has no right to make any law in respect to any religious observance. It is a matter of comparatively

small importance whether the exhibit be open or closed on Sunday! That right is left to the Commissioners to decide; but it is of paramount and vital importance that there should be no legislation at all whatever upon the subject, and if it there be not violated, codes of office not broken, no law is broken.

Those men who disregard, or are ignorant of, the plain provisions of the laws of their own country, are beling upon themselves a fearful responsibility in acting as legislators and framing laws that bring pain but aid in casting the sword of Damocles that hangs by a single thread, not upon the raging waves of fanatic opinion the winds have set in motion. For there is no tyranny like religious tyranny, and no tyranny can be so absolute, so controlled by law, or that is can control, so unsparing in its cruel vengeance. A tyranny of religion is given a law which gives a religion all of law its capacity, and giving law to it control the law.—"Kebiotzar."
