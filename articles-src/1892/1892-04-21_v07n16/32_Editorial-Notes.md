THE Christian Statesman thus welcomes an assistant in the advocacy of religion. "Do our subscribers think it square dealing for the former editor of the Christian Statesman, after signing a promise not to issue a rival paper, to bring one out, of almost the same name, in the same place, through his son? One of our mailing lists, a most valuable part of our property, was not turned over to us, being 'among the mining' when the transfer was made. If our subscribers are generally getting samples of the above or any other paper we ought to be so informed. The new paper is not authorized by the National Reform Association."

The management of the Christian Statesman seems to find it true, that uneasy lies the head that wears the editorial quill behind its ear.
