A FEE of ten cents is charged for admittance to the Anti-Poverty meetings, and to secure a really good seat requires an additional fifteen cents. In this the Anti-Poverty Society is not singular; the entirely unique feature of these meetings is, that, notwithstanding the charge made at the door, a collection is regularly taken up in connection with the opening exercises.
