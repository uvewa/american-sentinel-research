THE National Reformers may well wish to divert attention from their principles to a discussion of unimportant facts; but as shown in the preceding notes, in this case the facts do not affect the principle. The idea of extreme paternalism is expressed in the term, "Blue Laws;" and it is likewise inseparable from National Reform and Sunday-law theories. The Sunday-law forces may pooh-pooh "Blue Laws," but they can not escape from the fact that they are wedded to the principles so aptly caricatured by the "Blue Laws of Connecticut."
