THE pertinacity with which the advocates of enforced Sunday closing of the Exposition mean to continue their efforts is shown by this from the Christian Statesman: "It would not be too late even if Congress or the Commission should decide adversely, for the decision might be reversed. It would not be too late even if the Fair had begun with Sunday opening, for a sufficient protest would close the gates."

There will be no truce offered by these people, and by and by no quarter given.
