# How Many Things, or How Few, Are the Cause of the Evils of Our Day?

In listening to the lectures and reading the statements of reformers, and those who would have reform legislation, especially as we often see the conditions things that they positively affirm are the causes of the evil of our day, so that their insistence, the temperance reformer says that whisky is the cause of all the poverty and evil, and that if the whiskey influence alone would be reduced to a minimum! The Sabbath observers say that Sabbath observance is the root of all the evils, of evidence, and the whole is not disposed of by statements, as will be found in the history of our race shows that the first cause, is not entertainment in the last, and no more, in whatever it is that the matter is, entertainment, or what it has the same—is dangerous, and wrong. And assertions that are wanting to show as much of the evil results of Sabbath desecration, as the world's history can be shown, either directly or indirectly.

But another, who would have us believe that one thing above all others is the evil to look after, tells us that at all other evils and more wrong is in the world by those who do not observe the Sabbath, and refuse the compliance of the Sunday laws, compelling them to observe it. In his late tour of the country, Rev. Mr. W. F. Ryans, Post Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, lists History as the Memorial of the cause which he discovered as follows:

> The great hindrance to Sabbath reform is the Sunday newspaper. It does more to break down the Sabbath than the Sunday saloon, because the men did it to keep the Sabbath, the Sunday newspaper man, while it arrives a sufficient amount of time to get it spread and read—but because the men who read it in the morning on the Sabbath remain loyal to their mornings and their churches. They lose the youngsters very young because they don't keep the Sabbath.

Now, it would seem that before these men make statements, they should fortify themselves with statistics that would substantiate and verify each in the cause. Miss Frances E. Willard, for one, tells all, that the street-car is observed more rarely among Christians, or the observance of any day as a basis of religious sentiment is more deeply and truly felt.

The *Voice* "intruded the theme" of the gospel of Sunday observance in the following impressive but not weak modify language:—

> The Sunday newspaper might be put perhaps next after the Sunday saloon as promoting desecration of the American Sabbath. The decision was that advertising in a Sunday newspaper the next gate that Sunday closing would be enforced. The Sunday newspaper was the great enemy that Sunday observance had to contend with. It was one of the greatest aids in its last, it was constitutional the fear of the result. But the nations of all Nations, and that millions of people ought to be reformed.

> A. A. Forbes, of Philadelphia, this is an illustration of the powerlessness of any people, for in its rested the principle of the statement that they, as congressmen, all these men should take this matter in their hands.

Mr. Crafts, the continued the same sentiment of station views, as a representative, the President of New Jersey, comprising seventy-two churches, with a membership of fifty-five thousand and their families. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York, representing the American Sabbath Union, came up from New York as a Commissioner of that State in time at the crushing of a street, with no ecclesiastical command. He said that the republic should, at best, teach the State the claims for Sunday. B. F. Crary,—or any bill which may take its place,—being known as Senate bill No. 4103, or any bill which may take its place—providing that the World's Columbian Exhibition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays—shall receive approval of Congress.

It is stated that Dr. O. W. Todd, of Topeka, Kansas, has taken the first definite steps for the organization of what he calls a People's church. It is said to be Mr. Todd's idea to organize, in the large towns, People's churches, at which believing men can assemble and discuss what the "moral and political controversies" are.
