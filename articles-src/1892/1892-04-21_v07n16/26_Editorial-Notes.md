BAKERS' Union No. 90 has reported to the New York Federation of Labor that the bakers in one of Deutsch's coffee and cake saloons were compelled to attend prayers or pay fifty cents fine for each omission. Such things as this are but a natural outgrowth of the fast growing determination to enforce religious observance.
