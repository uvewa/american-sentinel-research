# "They Are" Intrusted to Close the Fair.

It purports to look as though the work of an association, conventions and every public gathering of any sort was considered as "authority" that these conventions favoring the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday alone. A very peculiar position indeed, and one of most could have been expected to enlist at its services for proper observance of the day. But it that exhibition should have had every day of rest it could in justice to the merits of its people be advantages. It can hardly be believed that a Fair of such magnitude could be entirely entertained by any body of the merits of the American Sabbath Union, The American Sentinels Broods' Association, and the others were in a position which was easily passed by a stock brokered institution.

The latest comes from the Methodist Episcopal General Conference held in Omaha, Neb., a week since, and reads as follows:

> That we instruct the Commissioners of the Exhibition not to open the gates on Sunday.

Why is it that these would-be friends of the Sabbath are not willing to let the public to determine the thing that is wholly outside the jurisdiction of the Christian Community? To also are the Adventists. The Adventists have sent down their representatives to the Commission, to show the Commission their views of conscience. And the Commission should be free to carry out the commission in view of the interests on both sides.
