A CORRESPONDENT from Marietta, Ga., writes that some trainmen on the Georgia Division of the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad, were delayed, owing to a break-down on their train, and did not reach Atlanta until 8 A. M., Sunday morning. The great zeal in Atlanta for Sunday that is now becoming quite famous, could not countenance breakdowns that would delay trains and cause them to come into their city on Sunday, and so the men were arrested, and the case is decided against them. The railroad officials are talking of carrying the case to the Supreme Court, to see if the decision will be sustained.

Some will say that such things as this can not be general; but arrests for the violation of Sunday laws quite as ridiculous are being made right along in Pennsylvania, and are being strongly urged in other portions of the country. These facts should open the eyes of those who are favoring legislation that makes it possible for such arrests to be made. A person does not need much discernment to see in this a repetition of what was seen in Scotland, and in the New England States in the early history of this country, when men were compelled to attend church and appear very religious on Sunday. People have the right to attend church and to observe Sunday strictly if they desire, and they should be protected in that right, but there the matter should end. They should not be allowed to compel others to submit to their ideas of religion, and observe their tenets of faith, whether they have any conviction in the matter or not. The history of the past should be sufficient to prove to every candid individual that the interests of religion and morality can not be advanced by such legislation that will thus enable a few hypocritical bigots to annoy citizens who do not agee with them in all of their ideas.
