# They Mistake It for Christianity.

The Son has received copies of the Chinese circulars, ridiculing European and Christian missionaries, which are now circulated in great quantities throughout China.

They are distributed freely among the people, as anti-foreign literature. These circulars, crude in their illustration of the European nations and associations, animated by a spirit of patriotism and intense hatred of strangers, are directed against the missionaries, but principally against serving the native rulers and makers and preserving them in their own independent attitude toward all European influences. A tolely vicious set of documents these so-called missionary immunity and the most half-heartedness of China in punishing the offenders, and the same remarkable because in their ignorance they do not distinguish between true Christianity and social conditions. But we can scarcely blame the Chinese for this. Such acts show, whose Christianity has been from the beginning, so-called, should accordingly not expect the distinction; nor is Chinese explainedness not only unchristianity, but a distinct hatred of Christianity, and this does not really explain itself.

On the contrary it does quite readily explain itself. These offended Chinamen know Christianity from the same point of view from which such men as Thomas Paine, Robert Ingersoll and the scientists see written for various infidel, substitute, and "free thought" journalist beliefs. Modeled as a system of philosophy appealing to the intellect and learning as is grossly irreproducible, but as a political system, that is, as American Christian, in proportion to the vigorous proselyting effort, and the investigations of those Chinamen. Not only do in all surroundings, but its discoveries, it would be surprising if just this is seen on surface of the terrible acts in the history of professed Christianity. The literature of the anti-Christian infidel, read, and sanctioned throughout the world, leads to just this conclusion. Is it a poor conclusion? Yes, but quite the contrary. The saddest, bitterest, most utterly hopeless fact about what is called "Christianity" in this world, is, that Christianity, so-called, the Christianity by which Christianity itself known to men, is in reality the Christianity of the popes and not the Christianity of the gospel pure and simple.
