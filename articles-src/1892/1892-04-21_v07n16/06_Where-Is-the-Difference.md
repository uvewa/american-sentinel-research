# Where Is the Difference?

The Ohio Legislature has passed a law prohibiting shaving on Sunday, and the penalty for its violation is very severe. During the debate on the bill, according to the correspondent of the *Correspondent*

"That excited much merriment by offering

an amendment proposing to make it unlawful to 'shave notes' on Sunday as well as faces." "What, of course?" Shaving requires physical exertion—it is labor; but so does note-shaving. And the same prohibition should also be extended to "shaving" in its commercial and financial sense. A law that prohibits one kind of shaving, and fails to prohibit the other, is rank class legislation, and as such is unconstitutional. As "note shaving" is labor, too, and as the work of the bootblack, the barber's labor should be regarded as odious as polished shoes. Verily, let it be remembered for this reason that the distinctions where there is no difference in things are apt to happen.
