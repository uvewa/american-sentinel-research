WHETHER men were actually forbidden by the "Blue Laws" to kiss their wives on Sunday or not, does not affect the principle. Possibly they never had even in New Haven any regulation so silly as that, but they certainly had many just as unwarranted. They did banish Quakers under pain of death; they did forbid running or walking on Sunday except reverently to and from meeting; they did forbid the use of the Book of Common Prayer; they did prohibit hair cutting and shaving on Sunday; they did make church membership prerequisite to residence in the Colony; they did forbid the giving of food or lodging to a Quaker or other heretic; and these things were even more wicked, though as before intimated, less silly, than any of the fabled "Blue Laws" of which we have ever heard.
