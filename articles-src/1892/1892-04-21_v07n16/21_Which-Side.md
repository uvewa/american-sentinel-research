The Voice "straddles the fence" on the question of Sunday newspapers in the following ingenious but not wholly uninteresting manner:—

The Sunday newspaper might be put to considerable inconvenience if the ruling of Judge Clark, of Atlanta, Ga., holds good throughout the courts. The decision was that advertising in a Sunday newspaper is not legal and contracts for it cannot be enforced. The Sunday newspaper lives on its advertising. Bareft of an income from this source, it would be snuffed out of existence too quick to preach its funeral sermon, or sing its requiem. But we don't believe that it is predestined to die that way. A ruling of this kind, if it prevails in the higher courts, would cause some inconvenience, and probably some loss, but newspaper publishers would probably meet the case by requiring cash in advance for all future advertising. It has always been a marvel to us, by the way, to see the enemies of the Sunday newspaper trying to starve it out by refusing to buy copies of it. The only way to starve it out would be by refusing to trade with those who advertise in Sunday newspapers. It would be an interesting thing to find out how many pillars of the Church such a boycott would hit! But if carried out on an extensive scale, how it would set the fires of indignation and apprehension to glowing in the offices of the daily newspapers!

It would be interesting to know just what the Voice thinks about laws that countenance dishonesty in the interests of Sunday sacredness; but the foregoing is all that it has to say upon the subject.
