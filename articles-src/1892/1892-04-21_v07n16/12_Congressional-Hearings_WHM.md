The World's Fair Committee of the House has lately granted three different hearings on the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. At the first hearing, on April 5, there were present eight members of the Committee; a delegation, representing the American Sabbath Union and National Reform Association, which desired to be heard in advocacy of some congressional action to secure the Sunday closing of the Exposition; and representatives of the National Religious Liberty Association, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, who asked the privilege of opposing any action by Congress looking to that end. The advocates of Sunday closing had a grievance to begin with in the presence of any opponents, and Elliott F. Shepard, who led the delegation, strenuously opposed the granting of any of the time of the Committee to the hearing of other views than those of himself and coadjutors. But, as Allen Moon, representing the National Religious Liberty Association, had previously arranged with the chairman of the Committee for an opportunity for the Association to be heard, Mr. Shepard's objection was overruled and the time was allotted to four speakers, three in favor of Sunday closing of the Exposition by some act of Congress, and one to oppose the recommendation of any such measure to Congress; fifteen minutes time was granted each speaker.

Mr. Shepard was displeased at the absence of some of the Committee, and so expressed himself, but Mr. Durborow, the chairman, reminded him that he was "addressing the whole country," and requested him to proceed. After introducing himself as representing the American Sabbath Union and dwelling upon the numbers and influence of that and kindred organizations, Mr. Shepard made a plea for Sunday observance in general, and its enforcement at the World's Fair in particular, on the ground that this is a "Christian Nation," and making extensive citations in support of this from the opinion of Mr. Justice Brewer, given in the case of the Rector, etc., of the Church of the Holy Trinity, New York, on the United States. Before Mr. Shepard seemed to have fairly begun, however, much to his apparent chagrin, time was called on him and he was obliged to give way to the next speaker.

Rev. Dr. Knowles, of New York City, followed, and while he disclaimed the intention of making a religious plea, and expressed himself as desiring to ask legislation upon civil grounds entirely, the only civil basis upon which he relied was the many precedents, which he quoted, of religious legislation by the civil authorities in different States, and the expression of a wish by so many petitioners that the same course should be continued by the Congress of the United States. He said that while Mr. Shepard had been emphasizing the religious side of the question it still had the side of the citizen, and that what they wanted was the maintenance of the American Sabbath as the enforcement of its observance is provided for in the laws of the country. He asked the Committee to favor such measures as would tend to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, because Sunday closing would be in harmony with the history in that regard of all previous expositions; also in harmony with our Sunday laws, and what he thought was the spirit of our Government from the beginning; also, because it would be in harmony with the world-wide movement now in progress to secure the enforcement of a rest day; and finally because it was in harmony with God's law.

Mr. Knowles spoke of having spent three weeks at Albany, in attendance upon the Legislature, and quoted the action taken there. In response to a query from Mr. Caruth, a member of the Committee, as to whether New York alone had directed the closing of its exhibit on Sunday, Mr. Knowles replied that while that was so, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and Ohio had passed resolutions favoring Sunday closing by the management. Out of seven Legislatures to which the question had been presented the past winter but one, that of Iowa, had refused to recommend Sunday closing. Mr. Knowles was asked if he thought the attaching of a provision conditioning an appropriation on Sunday closing would be sufficient to attain this end; he answered that he thought any expression from Congress favoring closing on Sunday would cause the gates to be closed.

G. E. Fifield, of Massachusetts, then addressed the Committee in behalf of the National Religious Liberty Association, and said that he did not appear before them either to affirm or to deny that exhibits at the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday, but to deny the right of Congress to touch this as a religious question. He then showed from the statements of Mr. Shepard and Mr. Knowles that it was a question of religion, and being so he claimed that it was outside the jurisdiction of Congress. The measure was uncivil and unchristian as well.

Rev. H. H. George followed in behalf of the American Sabbath Union. He reasoned that this country can not exist without a rest day, and as no petitions have been presented against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, therefore Congress must undertake to shut its gates on that day.

As the representatives of the American Sabbath Union felt that they had been unable to present their case, the Committee agreed to continue the hearing the following day. After the adjournment of the Committee meeting the American Sabbath Union held an impromptu executive session right there, and determined that they would not tolerate the presentation of any opposing views at the hearing of the next day.

At the assembling of the Committee, at the appointed hour on the following day, Mr. Shepard made a positive demand for the entire time. Mr. Moon, in behalf of the representatives of the National Religious Liberty Association, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, present, and wishing to be heard, said that he merely desired to insist upon an equal right to a hearing, but that when that should be granted was entirely at the discretion and convenience of the Committee. It was decided that still another hearing should be had on the following day, at which the views of those who opposed congressional action on this subject might be presented.

Rev. Mr. Ramsdell, of the District of Columbia, then continued for the Sabbath Union, and presented the following provision for insertion in the appropriating clause of the World's Fair Appropriation bill:

Provided, however, that no part of the sum appropriated by this section shall be paid until the corporation organized under the laws of the State of Illinois, known as "The World's Exposition of Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-two," and said World's Columbian Commission, shall stipulate in writing that the said Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays.

Mr. Ramsdell took the position that he, and some others, demanded that any exposition supported in the slightest degree from money taken from them by taxation should be closed on Sundays, forgetting that on no other plea than a religious conviction could such a stand as that be taken, and that therefore his own plea took the matter out of the jurisdiction of Congress.

The only other point presented by this gentleman was all that was asked in the case was the insertion of "Sundays excepted;" no more, no less, than in the Constitution. Forgetting again that "Sundays excepted" in the Constitution is a simple recognition of an inherent right of an individual, while the provision asked for is a positive prohibition of the exercise of inherent rights by many millions of individuals.

Rev. A. W. Pitzer, of Washington City, then poured the oil of a peaceful disposition on the troubled sea of discussion. He thought that controversy should be avoided. Whether the measure proposed was good or bad legislation, and whether it was constitutional the Committee could decide. But the petitions of ten millions of people ought to be respected.

Rev. T. A. Fernley, of Philadelphia, followed. He thought this the greatest question ever brought before the American people, for in it rested the protection of American institutions. He assured the Committee that they, as congressmen, were sent to represent Christianity in the councils of the Nation.

Rev. Dr. Atherton continued the presentation of similar views, as a representative of the Presbytery of Philadelphia, containing seventy-two churches, with a membership of thirty-two thousand communicants. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York, then occupied the remainder of the time in the reading of a brief, with occasional comment. Mr. Shepard's brief began with the statement that "The Christian sentiment of the country desires to have introduced into H. R. Bill No. 6593, or any bill which may take its place, the proviso that the Columbian Exhibition shall not be opened to the public on Sundays." The different points offered were "1. Such a proviso is constitutional. 2. It is expedient for Congress to adopt it. 3. It will contribute to the orderly conduct of the whole Exhibition, and to the health and morals of those attending. 4. It will aid to its financial success and bless the workingman. 5. It is demanded by the Christian and the patriotic sentiment of the country. 6. It will honor God and preserve the faith of the Nation. 7. It will teach visiting nations the way of happiness." These different positions were supported by quotations, mainly of religious precedents, opinions, and statistics.

AGAIN, the next day, the Committee came together to hear the views of those who denied the propriety of any legislation which should have for its purpose the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. The committee room was filled, though but one of the representatives of the affirmative was present. A larger number of congressmen were in attendance than on either of the previous days. Those who addressed the Committee were Allen Moon, of Chicago; W. H. McKee, of New York; G. E. Fifield, of Massachusetts, and Lewis Abrahams, a lawyer of the city of Washington. The points made, and the positions taken, either have been, or will be, so fully presented in THE SENTINEL that it is not necessary to make any statement of them here; it would be unavoidably imperfect because of the required brevity.

At the same hour in which this hearing was held, the same matter was under discussion in the meeting of the World's Columbian Commission, in session in the city of Chicago. At this meeting it was determined to lay aside the discussion and decision of this question until the second day of the next session of the National Commission, in October. The number of separate petitions received for Sunday closing was given as two thousand, seven hundred and twenty-five, but the number of individual petitioners was not stated. They came from every State in the Union. The Secretary was instructed to have printed, for distribution at the next session of the Commission, a list of the petitions, both for and against Sunday closing, with a statement of the number of petitions on each separate list, and the name of the organization from which the petition comes.

The evidences are that the settlement of this question will be left with the local management, where it properly belongs.
