# To Prevent Involuntary Servitude.

The title of the Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday," now before the House Committee, reads well to the friends of the non-slaveholable state of affairs in the District of Columbia. The impression also, is that, under the direct jurisdiction of the National Legislature, there could be no possible question of the bill's constitutionality within the view of the several States; nor unless there is nothing the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution is important, and human beings for which this bill proposes to mitigate are ones in the way each day. The situation is preposterous, and the whole bill is but one more protest in the Sunday-law campaign to which this title lends.

But the title is a misnomer; it should be, "A bill to secure and enforce by law the religious observance of Sunday for the people of the District of Columbia." The purpose of the measure, and there are judicial decisions enough to confirm it, is to promote religious observance of Sunday in the District of Columbia; the title which the bill should carry as an honest expression of its purpose. But the title and the body of the bill may be contrasted with each other. For, in the bill itself, there is no suggestion that any persons are forced to labor on Sunday, and the heinousness of the offense does not consist in the compulsion exercised by which some fellow-man or other person is "forced" on Sunday, nor in the matter. The bill virtually puts in the place of, performing labor on that day, as well as the master, be he ever so cruel, employer. The purpose of the bill is to punish the slave-master, but to punish the slave for being a slave. The title of the bill virtually recites that there are persons in the District of Columbia who are slaves, "forced to labor," and the bill then provides a penalty of from one to three hundred dollars to be laid upon the slave because of his slavery, and upon the conviction of such a condition of servitude. The bill, then, is inconsistent with its title. It does not propose to punish any person or corporation from a condition of servitude which exists in the statutes of the District, but to create a more worthy the professed character of those who are and would be the sincerest and best to promote its passage, and a slur upon the intelligence of the representative who introduced it. More than that, what cause its true design would be so apparent to those who can propose to the highest public body in the land, a measure by which Jewish or Mohammedan slave-master shall be suppressed to enforce a compulsory rest upon others in the District of Columbia. For any person, in fact, who conscientiously observes the Sabbath,— the Mohammedan, the Presbyterian, the Jew, the Baptist, the Greek Catholic, the Unitarian, or any denomination of religionists, or men of no creed—ought to be to its professes and practices the observance of some other day of the week than Sun-

day as a day of rest,—save, legally, without let or hindrance, express or implied. Yet men and corporations this condition of servitude which exists in the statutes of Canada, and go scot free, because the bill holds "that the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest."

Is it not human slavery which this act proposes to do away with? The enslavement of man by his fellow-man is criminal. It is not estimating which it is proposed shall be dealt with in this measure. For, if he would, would be moral legislation to make a man rest on a particular day, in default a certain price, for the commission of the felony of a so-called transgression of a heavy fine? That which is a crime between B and A, if not, is not a crime against all. And this is the reason why the whole bill, it deals with no crime whatever.

What, then, does it propose to deal with? Its purpose is to deal with that which some religionists consider to be a sin against God, an infraction of his moral law, in laboring upon the day of the week. Both being the case, by what authority does the Congress of the United States give an sanction to religious definitions of the duty of God? And that being answered, what right has any religion to demand that the Congress of the United States shall enforce the observance of any interpretation of the moral law of God?
