AT the Methodist Conference recently held at Chillicothe the following was passed regarding the World's Fair:—

Should said Exposition be opened on the Sabbath day, contrary to the solemn protest of the Christian citizens of this country, we pledge each other that we will not attend said Exposition on any day of the week, and will induce our people to follow our example in this regard.

That is to say if we can't have things our own way, we will resort to boycott. We wonder if Christ ever used any such methods in his work while upon earth? If not, then, is the boycott a method that it is proper for Christians to use? Of course it is the privilege of any one to stay away from the Fair, but why should Christians resolve so much about it? Why not depend on winning the world to Christ, relying upon his power for aid, and let the United States run its Fair to suit itself?
