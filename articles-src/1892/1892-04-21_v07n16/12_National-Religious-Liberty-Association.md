# National Religious Liberty Association.

## DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

The Des Moines, Iowa, Conference of the Evangelical Church, at its session just closed, passed a strong resolution against opening the World's Fair on Sunday.

The *Mail and Express* remarks that "all the States will undoubtedly sooner or later forbid the opening of the World's Fair exhibits be closed on Sunday;" and therefore the most the sentiment of the country.

Harris Union, No. 30 has reported to the New York Center of Labor that the bakers at Louis Dennett's coffee and cake saloons were compelled to attend prayer and pay tithes and to cook out of religious observance. Such things as this are but a natural outgrowth of the fact that the proprietors desire to enforce religious observance.

The *Lehigh World* says: "The preachers of Idaho should be content and will continue their petitions asking that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday." They also add: "We know Americans who may have exceptions of what kind of a Fair is a proposed living and doing than is will be obliged to forgo by signing it, will put its name on a petition."

---

The pertinacity with which the advocates of enforced Sunday closing of the Exposition insist on that continuous that effort is shown by this from the *Mail and Express:* Should the question present itself even if Congress or the Commission should decide against the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, would not, be less even if the Fair had begun its course. A persistent effort is being made to close the gates.

> Then true to trust, true offered by these people, and by aid by no quarter given.

Sam Small has been expressing himself in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. He threatens it with bankruptcy if it opens on Sunday, saying that if the Fair is opened on that day: "In its first convention in Chicago, closed in the first paragraph of its platform a recognition of Almighty God, by thanking him for what he had done for the country at present, and for

Republican Party is particular, and the 3,000,000 of people who voted our ticket voted for that clause as well as the rest. Submit the question whether or no this is a Christian people to a general vote and it will carry by an immense and overwhelming majority. At the Paris Exposition, Aberdeen, land, and Canada had their exhibits closed on Sunday, and had resolute stationed to enforce the national respect to God's law."

What can be expected from one who holds so peculiar a view of religious life truths as this!

Long Island City has opened its baseball season with a police act on the players who had gathered to the murder of several hundred, Sunday April 11, in the vacant lot between Astoria and Hunters Point. Sunday baseball is to receive special attention from the authorities of Long Island City this summer. It will soon be found throughout the whole country that profane police attention to the suppression of Sunday amusements of recreation and conceal the lack of enforcement of legislation against Sunday labor.

The Directors of the World's Fair have been memorialized on the Sunday closing question by the International Federation for the Observance of Sunday. The document begins:

> Mr. President and Gentlemen: Permit us to call your attention to the resolution passed by the Association which we represent and their endorsement. We acknowledge allegiance to the law

which is above all human law and also appealing to all above religious ground that enforced freedom from toil on one day in seven.

The Christian Statesman thus welcomes an act that it thinks is an alliance of religion to the interest or the advocacy of religion. "Do our subscribers who do not receive, remember that an editor of the *Christian Statesman,* after signing a subscription to the paper, wrote upon a separate of almost the same tenor, in the same place, and then returned both, saying that a very valuable part of our property, was not turned over to us, being discovered, but this subscription was made. If our subscribers are generally getting samples of the above we offer paper we ought to be informed. The new paper is not another paper from its former self. It still has a long row before its interests."

The management of the *Christian Statesman* seems to find it true, that many in the host that wants the editorial quill behind its ear.

At the Methodist Conference recently held at Charleston the following was passed regarding the World's Fair:

> That the World's Exposition be opened on the Sabbath is a proposal that we view with alarm. In the name of the citizens of this country, we pledge each other to observe the Sabbath as a sacred day of rest during the week and will induce our people to follow our example.

This is to say if we can't have things our own way, we won't play! We are reminded that when it was desired to boycott, we found ourselves with such, that however much we may in fairness earn? If act, then, is the boycott a method that it may not be safe for certain people to use, when the privilege of say one to stay away from the Fair, is the right to say no one else shall go either. Why not depend on winning the world to Christ in the orthodox way, instead of trying to keep the United States run its Fair to suit itself?

An additional $100 has been appropriated for the Association of National History on the condition that it be open to the public Sunday mornings. It is strange that this should awaken the interest of the religious press, for the purpose had been recognized.

The condition requiring the Museum to be kept open on Sunday afternoons is provision in keeping with the purpose and displaying of an institution for

public policy. The Sabbath of Columned Europe, with its fetes, its fairs, and operas, its parades and concerts, its public galleries and varied places of general entertainment, is a very different affair from the Sabbath consecrated and preserved under American institutions. Here it is a day of consecrated rest and worship. There is in it a day devoted to frivolity and display. It is an undoing of the inner liturgy for which its custodians generate and foster. Any step which tends to change the sacred character of the day with us is a step in the wrong direction. This condition was distinctly a step in the direction of that European Sabbath. It will eventually strike the Christian Sabbath, and it is to be deplored from every stand-point of patriotism. It would have been practicable to grant the appropriation of the money without attaching this condition. It has got to be, that Christian institutions will be represented in that fair because they were.

As a sequel to the hearings before the World's Fair committees, in the House and Senate, on the subject of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, an account of which is given in another column, there has been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Quay the following: *Providing that and advertisements of the provisions of Sec. Provided however, of Chicago of the city, and that the whole would be presented in two different forms of bills for the following.* This Section reads, "3. Johnson visits Washington by the Government Commission of the Fair, has insisted on the importance of united effort for the security of the management of the Fair in Congress to insure the declaration at the Columbian Exposition.

> This step will be remembered of the carefully studied deliberation of the Fair management, to an idea afterwards proved that she had actually gone there as a reporter, and was therefore refused.

> The fact which it didn't make any difference for their own attendance as to the rest. That great moral force of the Sunday and those of that matter was too great for that. This has found its parallel in the decision with regard to the Sunday opening of the Columbian Fair.

> You haven't any right, even in convention, to make your law the other man's law. You can't enact your Maker and the law's if you regulated the internal conscience of a man. . . . Each religious body has its own forms and objects and would require the jurisdiction of the Christian Community? So also are the Adventists. The Adventists have sent down their representatives to the Commission, to show the Commission their views of conscience. And the Commission should be free to carry out the commission in view of the interests on both sides.

Beyond this it is not more than half a step to that broader statement that the law has no concern with the morals and interests of the Church.
