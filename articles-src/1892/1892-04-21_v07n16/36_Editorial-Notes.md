THE story will be remembered of the careful father who flogged his son severely for profanity, but the son afterwards proved that he had actually said nothing at all, whereupon the father assured him that it didn't make any difference for he thought damn anyway and he ought to be whipped for that. This has found its parallel in the decision of a Washington Judge, as reported in the Post, Washington, D. C:—

You haven't any right, even in conversation, to repeat profanity. It is just as much an offense against your Maker and the law as if you originated the oath, said Judge Kimball yesterday in passing sentence upon William Lyddane. Mr. Lyddane endeavored to excuse himself for using certain words of profane nature on the ground that he was engaged in a religious discussion and had simply quoted them. He was fined $5.

Beyond this it is not more than half a step to that paternal oversight which would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.
