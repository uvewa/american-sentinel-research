AT the late Pittsburg Sunday Convention a good deal of capital was attempted to be made out of a statement that the so-called "Blue Laws" of Connecticut never had any existence except in the imagination of a "renegade preacher," who being forced to leave the Colony returned to England, and there wrote a caricature of the colonial laws, styling them "Blue Laws." There is probably some truth in this statement; yet it does not alter the case materially.
