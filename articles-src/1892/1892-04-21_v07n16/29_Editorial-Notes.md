SAM SMALL has been expressing himself, in Chicago, on the Sunday-closing of the World's Fair. He threatens it with bankruptcy if it opens on Sunday. He also said: "In 1908 the Republican Party, in its first convention in Chicago, placed in the first paragraph of its platform a recognition of Almighty God, by thanking him for what he had done for the country in general, and for the Republican Party in particular, and the 5,000,000 of people who voted that ticket voted for that clause as well as the rest. Submit the question whether or no this is a Christian people to a general vote and it will carry by an immense and overwhelming majority. At the Paris Exposition America, England, and Canada had their exhibits closed on Sunday, and had marines stationed to enforce the national respect to God's law."

What can be expected from one who holds as superficial a view of religious life and truth as this?
