THE *Christian Inquirer*, a local Baptist paper, published in this city, says: "The time has come when it must be affirmed that no public moneys can be used for sectarian purposes." But why does the *Inquirer* use the term, "sectarian," rather than the word, "religious"? Would it be willing to see public money used in the promulgation of what is popularly known as, "unsectarian religious instruction"? It certainly looks that way. But does it not know that from the standpoint of Roman Catholics and Jews, this so-called "unsectarian" religious instruction is most intensely sectarian? It is all well enough to denounce the efforts of Romanists to secure a share of the public funds to pay for teaching Romanism, but they are no more to blame for it than are Protestants for doing the same thing in the interests of Protestantism, and that is just what this "unsectarian" religious instruction is. The only consistent and tenable position is, that no public funds shall be used either directly or indirectly for giving any kind of religious instruction.
