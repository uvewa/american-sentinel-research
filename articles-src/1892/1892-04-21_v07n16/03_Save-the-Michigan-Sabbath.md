# Save the Michigan Sabbath!

## What Is the Proper Observance of the Sabbath?

The question is well asked by a Michigan paper, and the answer of that paper is of some great good to the people of that State.

Granted, and a blessing to all mankind, and other nations as well. But is it not a fact that a great many people think the matter of the Halfbreed can be of no practical use until they have settled the proper observance of the Sabbath. Is how the Sabbath "to be kept" in order to have it "rightly observed," and thus prove a blessing to him who observes it? Only he who made it and gave character to it can properly answer is answer the question; and this he has done. God said, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." "Only" when the Sabbath is thus kept, only when it is observed as a holy day, the day of the Lord, can it be "of any common use;" as a day "set apart for sacred things,—from what is common," that which is holy to mankind, to men,—is it rightly "observed"—"properly observed." It is, therefore to devote it to God and to his worship; these that of its proper observance is either proper or profitable Sabbath observance.

But this stamps both the institution and its proper observance as exclusively religious; wholly, for religion is "the recognition of God as object of worship," and not otherwise. Any law, therefore, looking toward the proper observance of the Sabbath, or the proper keeping of it, the foremost of it is the enforcement of a religious observance, it is the enforcement of a religious, religious law, and nothing else; and the enforcement of that in any form is simply an attempt to make men religious by law.

From considerations but trivially, all different, God to say that the right observance of the Sabbath is, and is such that the Sabbath can only thus be of benefit to the observer and accepted reading.

But, although no attempt be made to rest can not be made religion by law: religion is not only that it is not tried. The moral law can do toward making men righteous. It can beget self-examination and penitence, to teach outward conformity to certain outward forms of right.

And this is all that any Sunday or any effort to secure Sunday observance by law can amount to; and it can enforce Sunday observance in law ever accompishing.

And this is as good Sabbath observance as any Sunday law, or Law and Order League, or W.C.T.U. ever secured or ever can secure. Is it worth it? Is it proper that he be the fruit-maker? For the truthfulness of this fact themselves, having given "unmistakable signs of securing a predicament better enforced especially in presenting a better enforced Sunday law."

And this is as good Sabbath observance as any Sunday law, or Law and Order League ever obtained or ever can secure a Sunday observance. But this without the Sabbath is a hypocrite's? Its real condition demands it; so it ought to be that a thing made, a thing must worship him in spirit and in truth. A religious service which is not explainable to God, and no other form of observance, is really worship. But the religious observance of the day is Sabbath observance; and the only Sabbath observance as comes from the heart. And yet, it appears as if all the Pittsburg Law and Order League, and especially Sunday closing efforts, that if the best Sabbath-keeper, he's God's man, he can't be moved. It would be a bad thing to render it, for there is some reason to believe that the best Sabbath-keeper does not consider that he can do as much for the Sabbath more than for a hypocrite's Sabbath.
