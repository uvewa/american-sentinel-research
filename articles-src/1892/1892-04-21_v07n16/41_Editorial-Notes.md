DR. EDWARD McGLYNN, the excommunicated priest, stands at the head of the Anti-Poverty Society, and at the regular meeting Sunday evening, April 10, seeming to see the incongruity of taking a collection after charging for admittance, he remarked that the collection was the "one feature of the meetings which entitles them to the character of semi-religious gatherings, and justifies the holding of them on the holy day."
