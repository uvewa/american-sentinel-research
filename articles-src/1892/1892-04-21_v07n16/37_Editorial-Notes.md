A CORRESPONDENT in Vermont sends us the following:—

Rev. Mr. Bates, pastor of the Congregationalist church at Randolph, Vermont, after preaching a common on the "Sabbath question," April 3, 1892, made the following remarks in substance:—

"I have spoken upon this subject because I have been requested to, as also have the other ministers of our denomination throughout the land.

The object of bringing up the subject is to put before the people the importance of a day of rest, and the need of our exerting our influence in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. I am inclined to think that this is a needless precaution, as I do not believe that the people of this enlightened land will allow such an outrage. But if it is decided against us, next summer will witness one of the greatest revolutions which our country ever saw. We will have a new set of congressmen, and if need be, a ruler over them, as in ancient times, who will order and compel them to enact such laws as are for the interest of the people."

And this minister only expresses the general sentiment of the ministers of the leading churches. They are determined to rule or ruin. Possibly they will yet do both.
