THE Directors of the World's Fair have been memorialized on the Sunday-closing question by the International Federation for the Observance of Sunday. The document begins:—

To the Directors of the World's Exposition at Chicago:

Mr. President and Gentlemen: Permit us, Continental Europeans, to address you in the name of the Association which we represent and their numerous adherents, in favor of closing, on Sunday, the great Exposition which you are preparing for next year.

The memorial is quite long and takes the remarkable religious ground that enforced freedom from labor on Sunday is religious liberty.
