# A Greater (C'r) than Caesar.

The *Mail and Express,* of April 9, contains a sermon by Rev. Dr. D. Gregg, of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, from Ex. 31:13. "Six days thou shalt do all thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest," etc. In his personal comments the *Mail and Express* says of Dr. Gregg, "He is sermons always show that scholarship which is at once thorough and reliable;" and we may say that the Sabbath, which, soon as it is to be observed, or to-day, and so see need to

Sabbath, would soon win as to be a thing of the past.

The "dying cause" is on the other side of the question, from that which Mr. Ware would endeavor to make it appear.
