It begins to look as though the work of no association, convention or general public gathering of any sort was considered complete without a resolution favoring the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. About every possible reason that the mind of man could invent has been assigned as an excuse for the proposed step, even to the fact that the hogs on exhibition should have one day of rest in seven so that they may show to better advantage. It can hardly be believed that a resolution of this nature would be seriously entertained by any body of men. Yet such an one was actually passed by the American Swine Breeders' Association, and a similar one finds itself in company with others passed by a stock breeders' meeting in Illinois.

The latest comes from the Southeast Nebraska Teachers' Association, held at Tecumseh, Neb., a week since, and reads as follows:—

WHEREAS, We as educators should represent and reflect the highest moral sentiment of the country, and

WHEREAS, There exists a discussion relating to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair in 1893; therefore, be it Resolved, That we instruct the Commissioners to close the World's Fair on Sunday.

Why is it that these would-be legal guardians of Sunday sacredness do not know that what they ask is wholly outside the jurisdiction of the Columbian Commission and contrary to the spirit of the National Constitution? So also are the memorials from the various State Legislatures to the Commission to close the gates of the Exposition on Sunday, without jurisdiction. So clearly was this point brought out in the late hearing by Mr. Jones, before the Iowa Legislative Committee, that several who had been avowedly in favor of the memorial confessed their change of sentiment. But aside from the authority vested in the commission to act according to the various instructions, wherein is the Southeast Nebraska Teachers' Association clothed with power to "instruct the Commissioners to close the World's Fair on Sunday?" To say the least, the resolution displays a monumental exhibition of ignorance—an ignorance that clearly demonstrates that the "power behind the throne" is not the teachers themselves, but an outside influence that has led them to commit themselves to a question whose real nature they do not understand.

The question of closing the gates of the Fair on Sunday is a religious question. It is confessedly in the interests of religion; was first introduced by religionists, and its agitation is backed by religious people, who in their blind zeal can see nothing before our Republic but utter ruin unless it incorporates in the body of its Constitution a recognition of Christ as the ruler of nations.
