As a sequel to the hearings before the World's Fair committees, in the House and Senate, on the Sunday-closing of the Chicago Exposition, some account of which is given in another column, there appeared among the church notices of the Washington Evening Star an advertisement of the presence of Rev. Dr. Herrick Johnson, of Chicago, in the city, and that he would preach in two different churches on the following Sunday. The notice continued, "Dr. Johnson visits Washington by the request of the American Sabbath Union, to urge the importance of united effort for the sanctity of the Sabbath, especially in view of its threatened desecration at the Columbian Exposition."
