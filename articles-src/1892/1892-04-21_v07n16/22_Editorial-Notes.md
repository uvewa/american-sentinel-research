SUNDAY reformers are accustomed to say, that the keeping of any day in seven meets the demands of the divine law. Those who observe the seventh day meet all God's demands according to this logic. But these same Sunday reformers add that "the civil law can not recognize two days," and hence it must compel the minority to refrain from work on Sunday, and it can not protect them in observing the Sabbath. Such a position is inconsistent and un-Christlike. It measures the duty of the State by the choice of the majority.
