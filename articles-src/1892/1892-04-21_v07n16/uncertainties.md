# Uncertainties Log - v07n16 (1892-04-21)

## OCR Quality Notes

### Page 1, Line 9
- **Transcribed as:** "Perguation"
- **Likely intended:** "Persuasion"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error in the motto quote from Thomas Jefferson. The standard quote reads "persuasion" not "perguation."

### Page 4, Line 429
- **Transcribed as:** "NEW YORK, APRIL 31, 1892."
- **Likely intended:** "NEW YORK, APRIL 21, 1892."
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** April only has 30 days; this is clearly an OCR error. The issue number indicates this is the April 21, 1892 issue.

### Page 5, Line 310
- **Transcribed as:** "Lafayette Avenue Pre:byterian Church"
- **Likely intended:** "Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** OCR misread "s" as ":"

## General Notes

The OCR quality for this issue is generally good. Most articles are clearly legible and text flows naturally. The main errors appear to be typical OCR mistakes (colon for "s", misread letters in the masthead motto, impossible date).
