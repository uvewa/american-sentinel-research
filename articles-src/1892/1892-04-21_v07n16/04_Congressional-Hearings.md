# Congressional Hearings.

The World's Fair Committee of the House has lately granted three hearings on the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. At the first hearing, on Friday, April 8, about eight or ten of the Committee were present. The advocates of Sunday closing were representatives of the American Sabbath Union and National Reform Association, who declared that the hearing had been asked to show that there was necessity of some congressional action to secure the Sunday closing of the Fair; and that a representative of the National Religious Liberty Association, and two Seventh-day Adventists from Battle Creek, Michigan, A. F. Ballenger and A. O. Tait, desired to speak against Sunday closing. The Rev. Dr. Crafts asked the privilege of opposing any action by Congress to that end. The advocates of Sunday closing had a grievance to begin with, in the presence of any opponents, and Elliot F. Shepard, who led the delegation, objected openly to the proposition of having the opponents of the measure, or the opponents of the proposed Sunday closing, to share the hearing with its advocates and coadjutors. But, as Allen Moon, representing the National Religious Liberty Association, had previously arranged with the chairman of the Committee for an opportunity for the Association to be heard, Mr. Shepard's objection was overruled, and the time was allotted to four speakers, three in favor of Sunday closing of the Exposition by some act of Congress, and one to oppose the recommending of any such measure to Congress. Fifteen minutes time was granted each speaker.

When Mr. Shepard had been speaking for some time, one of the members of the Committee rose to inquire of the chairman, reminded him that he was a member of the Committee, and requested him to proceed. After introducing himself and representing the American Sabbath Union and dwelling upon the names and influence of that Union and that organization, Mr. Shepard made a plea for Sunday observance in general, and its enforcement at the World's Fair in particular, on the ground that it was religious. No, we are mistaken, he said that his citations in support of this from the opinions of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the State, of the Rector, etc., of the Church of England, who was also a citizen of the United States. Before Mr. Shepard seemed to have fairly begun, however, much to his apparent chagrin, time was called on him and he was obliged to give way to the next speaker.

Rev. Dr. Knowles, of New York City, followed, and while he disclaimed the intention of making a religious argument himself merely to seeking to ask legislation upon civil grounds; stating the only civil basis upon which he relied was the mere precedent, which he styled, of religious legislation by the civil authorities in different States, and the expression of a wish by so many petitioners that the same course should be continued by the Congress of the United States. He said that while Mr. Shepard had been stressing the religious side of the question it had but the mind of the citizens, and that what they wanted was the maintenance of the American Sabbath as the enforcement of the educational and the moral welfare of the country. He asked that Committee to consider as one practical argument for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, because Sunday ought to be in harmony with the history in that regard of all previous action in American history with our Sunday laws, and what that history of American work was, he would say from the beginning; also, because it would not be consistent for our Government now in progress to secure the enforcement of a rest day; and finally because the World's Fair was a national affair.

Mr. Knowles spoke of having spent much time looking up the "Blue Laws" in those Legislatures, and quoted the act setting apart Sunday as a day of rest from Mr. Couth, a member of the Committee, as to which law in New York also directed the closing of the exhibit on Sundays, and further pointed out that that was a New Jersey, Massachusetts, law having Sunday closing by the management of the State Legislatures to which the question had been presented the matter within that line, that of Iowa, is not supposed to recommend officially. Mr. Knowles was asked if he thought the refusal to make an appropriation for any appropriation on Sunday closing would be an expression on the subject? He said he thought any expression from Congress favoring closing on Sunday would cause the gate to be closed.

Dr. Hiscox, of Massachusetts, then addressed the Committee in behalf of the National Religious Liberty Association, and said that he did not appear before that either to affirm or deny, that the gates at the World's Fair should be opened on Sunday, but to deny the right of Congress to close them. The few points drawn from the statements shows quite clearly that this is a question of religion, and being so it will be clear that it was not within the jurisdiction of Congress. The measure was a purely religious one.

Rev. H. H. George followed in behalf of the American Sabbath Union. He reasoned that this country can not exist without a rest day, and as no petition has been presented against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, therefore Congress was undisturbed to take in the gate question.

At the next hearing, members of the American Sabbath Union felt that they had been snubbed by having opponents present. They agreed to continue the hearing on the following day. After the adjournment of the Committee meeting the American Sabbath Union held an impromptu association session right there, and determined that they would not tolerate the presentation of any opposing views at the hearing of the appointed hour on the following day.

Mr. Shepard made a motion, which was adopted, that they appoint a committee of three. Mr. Moon, in behalf of the representatives of the National Religious Liberty Association, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, presented a petition and was told by the chairman that the afternoon hearing would by limited to and for the advocacy of the bill or, to "this side" of the question, and board, and that he mostly desired to inquire of those who appear before the Committee that when that should be presented to be granted later was the privilege as well the action of the Committee. It was further said that still another hearing would be had on the following day, at which the views of those who opposed congressional action could be heard. A. O. T.

Rev. Mr. Ramsdale, of the District of Columbia, and representative of the American Sabbath Union, and presented the following resolution as showing the sentiment of the Methodist, Congregational, Baptist and other clergymen in Washington and vicinity, in relation to the World's Fair Exposition closing on Sunday.

The resolution expressed the desire of the ministers in the national capital, representing many denominations, and with due regard for the interests of all, that the World's Columbian Exposition should not be opened on Sunday, and stated the reasons therefor.

Rev. Mr. Ramsdale took the position that he, and some others, contended that any expense in connection with the appropriation by Congress in its highest degree was to shut out the gate on Sunday.

The only other point presented by this delegation was by Dr. Crafts. He stated that it was the intention of "Sundays of rest" legislation on an international basis at their conventions. Forgetting some things that Dr. Crafts discussed were "Bakers' Sunday," or the simple recognition of an interest right of the men who are employed to work on Sunday as a privilege of having two or more Sundays off per month.

A. W. Flew, of Washington, a colored attorney, next presented the disposition on the troubled was as follows, having a petition:

The Sunday newspaper might be put perhaps next after the Sunday saloon as promoting desecration of the American Sabbath. The decision was that advertising in a Sunday newspaper the next gate that Sunday closing would be enforced. The Sunday newspaper was the great enemy that Sunday observance had to contend with. It was one of the greatest aids to oppose in funeral service, or sing its requiem. He agreed with Mr. Crafts, that if the Sunday question was taken to the Supreme Court of the land, the higher courts, would come nearer according to the law, they must give the victory to Sunday. These people must meet the case by meeting each question as it came up, and they must put those Sunday laws that exist in thirty-one States in force.

At the close of the hearing it was suggested that the petitions of all churches and all who would stand together and who advertise in Sunday newspapers. The statement was made that the New York *Tribune* carries no advertising on Sunday matters of any churches.

It should be stated that Colonel Shepard, the publisher of the New York *Tribune,* was at the hearing. But if carried on on an extensive basis, how would that paper make up the difference in advertising revenue lost by not running religious advertising is glowing in the offices of the daily newspapers?

It would be interesting to know what the advocates of closing would have said about that if the matter had come up.

A COMMISSIONER, Mr. Massey, raised the disposition absolutely to the closing of the Sunday absolutely; but the foregoing is probably the correct account of the main features of the hearing.

Sunday reforms are accustomed to say, that the keeping of one day in seven is all God's demands; and that it is not all God's demands according to this logic.

The San Francisco *Examiner* says: "the civil law can not recognize two Sabbaths; and it is not needed, and is totally to refrain from work on Sunday, and it can not protect those who to observe an un-Christian, but a civil, not a religious enactment, made in the interest of the Sabbath. Such a position is inconsistent with Christianity and the enforcement of the duty of the State by the choice of the
