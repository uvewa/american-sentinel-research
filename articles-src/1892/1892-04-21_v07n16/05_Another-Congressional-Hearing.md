# Another Congressional Hearing.

On Tuesday, April 12, the House Committee, the military granted a hearing to representatives of the National League for the Prevention of American Institutions upon petitions and a memorial previously submitted, in behalf of the League, to the House, by Mr. Springer of Illinois. The petitioners pray "for the passage of a constitutional amendment forbidding the use of public money, or credit, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control." The constitutional amendment offered proposes to extend to each State further and stricter restriction as to laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, in the First Amendment, and to make such provision equally applicable to every State, territory and the District of Columbia.

States and applicable to Congress, comprising within its membership the Rev. J. M. King, Secretary of the League, first addressed the Committee. Mr. King discussed the standing of the League as comprising within its membership the teachers, wealth, and influence of the country, and said that it had already two hundred local secretaries throughout the United States. Twenty-one States, Mr. King said, have already shown in their Constitutions forbidding appropriations for sectarian purposes. It was claimed that the purpose of the League was to eliminate questions from political life, and to promote an absolute separation of Church and State; that it was neither pro-Catholic, nor pro-Protestant, nor anti-Judaic, but that these all were thus raised by a question. Mr. Couth, of the Commission, drew out that the great danger feared was opposed in the direction of the power of the Roman Catholics in New York and Minnesota.

Wm. Allen Butler, of the law committee of the League, followed Mr. King, and said that his was neither text nor a bigoted construction of the First Amendment to the Constitution applied to the States. The division between Church and State was one of the vital principles underlying the whole American Government. Yet he declared the appropriation of money for churches, and religious charities from general funds did not constitute a violation, not did it make appropriation every for church charities, charities in the District of Columbia, and for church schools among the Indians. In relation to the Indian appropriations, they declared them wrong; they did it was contrary to the First Amendment. This had already been acknowledged, but members were then asked tending to show members of the Committee looked toward accomplishment on, as far as being a subject to legislating a restrictive constitutional amendment. Each State ought to be governed only by the general amendment, without the right of any to establish its own special restrictions.

After the close of the hearing, Mr. King was asked that if the intent of the restriction of the First Amendment upon the Congress of the United States was extended to the States one way by the proposed amendment, the people would not the repeal of all laws bearing on religion, such as an acknowledgment of the belief in a God or a compulsion to testify as a witness, laws regarding blasphemy, and laws regarding Sunday observance. He replied that it was not so intended; they were aiming entirely upon the matter of the appropriation of public funds.

The purpose of this League is not the separation of Church and State but the accomplishment of the former so as to put it into a more complete union with the temporal power of the State and the elimination of disturbing elements.
