THE Washington correspondent of the *Examiner* (Baptist), takes occasion, in noticing the late hearing on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, to say, "On a former occasion, when the Sunday observance law was before our Commissioners and urged by many of our local pastors, the strongest kind of a protest against such legislation was made by men styling themselves Baptists."

And why should not Baptists protest against all such legislation? Why should a people who have for centuries resisted even to the death every encroachment of the civil power upon the domain of conscience, now that they have become powerful and popular, depart from their ancient principles and yield their consciences into the hands of the Government? Why should they now acknowledge that which for centuries they have denied, namely, that the civil power has a right to require of them any measure of religious observance whatever?
