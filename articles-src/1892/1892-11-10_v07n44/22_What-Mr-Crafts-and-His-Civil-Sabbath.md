WHAT are Mr. Crafts and his "civil Sabbath" companies going to do with the fact that vital statistics show that the death rate is lower among Jews than among Christians? It is confidently asserted by those "civil Sabbath" defenders that regular weekly rest is a physical necessity, and that it must rest or some excuse. The Jews are a living denial of this claim. So far as they rest regularly, it is upon Saturday, a day when all is bustle and activity around them, and very many of them observe no Sabbath at all. The "civil Sabbath" is a fraud.
