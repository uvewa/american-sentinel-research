THE Duluth Evening Herald criticises editorially the utterances of Rev. L. H. Morey, of Stillwater, Minn., at a late Presbyterian Synod, on the public school question, in which he referred especially to Archbishop Ireland and the so-called "Faribault plan." Mr. Morey characterized the plan as an attempt to Romanize the public schools, and asserted that the press of America is controlled by "Rome's hush power." Of this the Evening Herald says:

It is not the "hush power of Rome" nor the scheming of Catholic prelates that the Republic has most to fear from at the present time. It is the manner in which the principles of our Government are gradually, but surely being subverted by the very men who are loudest in denouncing the Roman prelates. It is a Protestant religio-political combination, at whose instance the Constitution is being over-ridden, which aspires to exceed in this country even the power and supremacy which Rome has had in some of the European and South American countries. This religious hierarchy has already made subservient tools of the judicial, the legislative and executive branches of the Government. It is seeking to establish a national religion and to compel all people within the borders of the Republic to obey laws which, in direct violation of the Federal Constitution, are framed in the interest of that religion. It is time that the people became alive to the dangerous character of this religious conspiracy which strikes at the very foundations of our Government.

Certainly it is not the Rome which these rabid anti-Romanists antagonize, which is now subverting those principles of free government that should be of the highest value to all the people, and the dearest prized by them and their legislators. It is the Rome which is within the professed anti-Romanists themselves. When they shall have fully Romanized themselves and this Government then there will no longer be antagonism but coalition. The Pope and the Roman prelates recognize this. Their provision shows them the necessary result of the working of the present forces. They know that the opposition of such organizations as the National League for the Preservation of American Institutions, and the numerous secret orders devoted to the establishment of a business, social, and political boycott against Roman Catholicism, is but ephemeral and superficial at most. They know that these organizations are at heart, although unconscious of it, their allies. They hold and actively propagate those dogmas of political religion upon which Catholicism is based, and through the success of which it will finally attain its short lived triumph before the eventual catastrophe to which this religio-political combination is hurrying the country. Rome could not well dispense with the services of these who are now publishing themselves so fiercely as her enemies. They are the sappers and miners who go before and prepare the way for her. When papal principles and papal methods have been accepted under the guise of Protestantism it will be but a simple thing to do away with the disguise. The truth is, that, but for the disguise which many clear eyes have already penetrated, false and popular Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are already virtually one.
