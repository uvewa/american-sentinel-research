PRESIDENT FAIRCHILD of Oberlin College has thus stated in his "Moral Philosophy," the relation of obedience of the Christian in their relations to civil government:—

Obedience is to be rendered to all human governments, in things civil, in the same spirit as to God, the great principle of benevolence, is at the bottom of obedience to human government, as it is of obedience to God. There is no conflict between human law and the divine, in any of their requirements for duties to man. In one class of duties between man and man,—

The first course will be found to include the duty to refuse obedience. In all times and in all lands men have found themselves in conflict with the law, and the result of this is that the duty to refuse obedience to civil law exists in all times and in all lands. If the law, and resist the government in its attempt to enforce the law, regardless of consequences. It may lead to the dungeon, to the rack, and to the scaffold; but when he bears it calmly, and at the same time, a recognition of civil authority. Law is an expression of the will of the people, and is to be sustained.

The second course will be found to include all situations in which the civil law undertakes to regulate the duties of man to God, as well as neighborliness, and, at the same time, a recognition of the rights of conscience. The state has no more to do with my duties to God than God has to do with my duties to the state.

In replying to the objection that the right of private judgment, as herein maintained, in reference to obedience to the laws of the land, would subvert government and introduce confusion and anarchy, President Fairchild says:—

Observations are not to be answered by forebodings, however plausible. True principles must be maintained. That they are fraught with danger, will sometimes be made to appear. They are strongest, and most suitable as weapons. The American Congress have always been the most true friend and supporter of the government who have been bold enough to assert his rights as a man, were real occasions. It is only when governments depart from the path of justice that they come in conflict with the conscientious man.

The principles thus copiously stated by one of our most eminent educators, can not fail to commend themselves to the minds of all reasonable men. And if they justify the course thus far pursued by the Tennessee Adventists, and their resistance to the civil authorities of the State. May God help them still to be true to their consciences, even as were the three faithful Hebrews: "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
