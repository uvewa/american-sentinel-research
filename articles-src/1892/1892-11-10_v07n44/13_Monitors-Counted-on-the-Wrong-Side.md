Mr. Hightshoeborn, President of the Methodist Social Union, of Brooklyn, and head of Trinity Methodist Church, was recently quoted as having said, at the Social Union, and Sunday evening in the World's Fair opened on Sunday, and made some telling remarks, argued for an open Fair. He is quoted as having said at the Methodist Social Union. Mr. J. D. Allen, of London, another Methodist, has recently declared for an open Sunday World's Fair. There, and all members of the Methodist Social Union, and other public men of equal point, have already been counted against Sunday on the roll of the Methodist General Conference and the Methodist Conference that most eagerly advocated Sunday closing.
