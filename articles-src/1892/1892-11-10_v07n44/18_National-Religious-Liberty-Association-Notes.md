The barbers of the State of Washington are reported to be agitating for a Sunday closing law to be presented to the next legislature for adoption.

An appealed case in which a German excursion club sued the Starln River and Harbor Transportation Company for damages for non-performance of a Sunday contract has just been decided in the General Term. The contract was held to be void and no recovery could be had.

The women of the Shaker settlement of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., protest against legislation closing the World's Fair on Sunday "in the name of true religion, genuine morality, and in justice to people of all religions." This protest has been sent to the women managers for New York, and is published in the New York World.

An auxiliary to the American Sabbath Union has been organized in Richmond, Virginia. The meeting at which the organization took place was held in the church of which Rev. Dr. Hoge is pastor, and was presided over by Governor McKinney. Resolutions were adopted approving the "action of Congress in directing that the World's Columbian Exposition be closed upon the Sabbath day."

The Mail and Express publishes an item denouncing the district attorney and city attorney at Niagara Falls for not enforcing the Sunday law against store keepers at that place. "Apparently," says the Mail and Express, "all the retail stores are open as well as the saloons, notwithstanding the provision of the code." This continual harping upon the "law" and its enforcement is having its effect already. What will the result be ultimately?
