THE article, "Christ's Kingdom Not of This World," published on another page of this paper, is worthy a careful perusal. It contains, however, one serious defect; namely, the countenance which it gives to the civil Sunday fraud. It is the Church and not organized labor that demands Sunday laws. This fact alone shows the reason for the demand to be religious and not civil. Baptists should not be deceived into giving their support to religious legislation because, forsooth, it masquerades under some other name.
