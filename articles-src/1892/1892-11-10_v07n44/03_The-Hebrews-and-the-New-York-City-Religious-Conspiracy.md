On Sunday, October 30, eighty-six employees of S. Levy & Co., cloak-makers, at No. 119 Prince Street of this city, were arrested charged with violation of the laws against Sunday work. The prisoners were all Hebrews. They were marched through the streets to the station, and from there to the Jefferson Market Police Court. There they were arraigned before Justice Ryan. After reading the Sunday law the Justice discharged sixteen and held all sixty-three men and twenty-three women.

It is probable that this was the expression of a personal animosity on the part of the person making the complaint. That it is also an attempt to show that the law had a political significance, as an attempt to secure votes for someone by initiating it. Whatever motive caused the act, however, does not reduce the injustice or the viciousness of the law, but that such motives as these are to be attributed should convince every reasonable person of the stupidity of the existence of a law which can, and is, used to such base purposes.

Section 264, of the penal code, which is involved, says:

It is a sufficient defense to a prosecution for servile labor on the first day of the week, that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as holy time, and does not labor on that day; and that the labor complained of was done in such manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as holy time.

All made the plea that they were acting within their rights, and were conforming to the terms of the code, if they had no other grounds such a defense, and yet they said, but that they regarded it as no offense, they would have been subject to the penalty of five to fifteen dollars or five to fifteen days in prison.

By what right could Justice Ryan in justice refuse the rightful pleas of defense of these Hebrews? The same person who brought the complaint declares that he intends to have similar complaints made before the justice on the same charge. Is it not well that the attention of all fair-minded persons to these cases on the correct principles of civil government?
