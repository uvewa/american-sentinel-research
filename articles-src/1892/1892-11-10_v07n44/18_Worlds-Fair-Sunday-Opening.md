Institutes and other entertainments. The discussion of the law of Sunday in Chicago before the World's Fair has called out a strong expression for a real Christianity. Among the names objected to the Sunday plan at the Dearth Hall were several fine Christians and men who now the contest appeared a year or two years ago against opening the exhibits of the World's Fair on Sunday.

This is the undeniable breadth of agitation in this question; that the just and true and honest hearted will see that converts in religious matters is not Christian. When Christians perceive their service is due to their Lord, in inviting the erring to a change of thought and action and become Christians indeed, after the pattern which the Master has set.

AMONG the rules adopted October 31, by the National Commission, for the government of the World's Fair, is the following regarding Sunday opening:

The Exposition shall be open for the admission of visitors during the six months, commencing May 1, 1893, every day of each week—subject to such regulations heretofore prescribed. The gates of the Fair will thereafter be closed on Sunday, and on said last mentioned day the said Exposition shall be closed.

The hesitation about touching this question, notwithstanding both by the commission, and the local directory, is an evidence that, it is felt to be an unwarranted assumption of Federal authority in general Government, and that the management does not care to touch it.

In the *Northwestern Christian Advocate*, of Chicago, of October 12, is the following:

Should churches or street shows would tend to scatter around the world next year and make the Fair a, or the world as well committed to this exhibit. A certain dignity if it can be assumed that the national millions are secured. Chicago is permitted to give the Fair an open Sunday.

By this the Advocate evidently means that a scarcity of sinners, or serves to to make the holding of the Fair an impossibility, would be preferable to an open Sunday.

And the Northwestern Christian Advocate of November 2 says:—

Such a scarcity of churches would cause human power, and it might compel men from desperate circumstances to repent and become good citizens. That is an alternative the advocates cheerfully accept. They would prefer a nation of savages to a free Christian's journal.

Such a scarcity would close the probation of many hundreds of thousands of human souls. Yet the Advocate is willing that this should be rather than their probation be prolonged with an open opportunity to visit an educational and Christian exposition.

Now the *Northwestern Christian Advocate* advocates a Christian prison?

It is made known this column, a few weeks ago, that the records of Congressman Hemphill both compelled and advanced the correct principles of legislative non interference in matters of religion, yet he urged upon the House during its last session the adoption of the bill prohibiting the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, in which it was laboriously decided that Sunday was the Sabbath.

A.S. his interrogator fell his passed the House. As he interrogated the past and the present. The records of the two men, in their connection with this law, are a fit commentary upon the question of religious legislation. It had been passed into a law. Those who have studied this case know that Congressman Hemphill both complained and advanced the correct principles of legislative non interference in matters of religion, yet he urged upon the House during its last session, the adoption of the bill prohibiting the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, in which it was laboriously decided that Sunday was the Sabbath.

Mayor Hemphill, of Atlanta, was recently arrested last August, by the religious press of his city for refusing the delivery of ice to his Sunday customers. If he had merely permitted Sunday delivery of ice cream, an investigation would have been compelled. Moreover Hemphill owns a controlling influence in the Atlanta *Constitution*, which publishes Sunday editions, and also has a large interest in the Sunday passenger list of Atlanta, which carries nearly five per cent more passengers on Sunday than on any other day of the week.

It would seem that public men, from the counsel chambers of the Nation to the chamber of the town council, whatever their individual opinions may be, and whatever their convictions may be as to citizens' rights and justice in these matters, will feel themselves bound to respect party policy above principle and exercise what Senator Blount has so aptly termed "official self-restraint."

—*Chicago Daily News of October 21.*

Friends of an open Sunday for the World's Fair do not yet seem to be satisfied that they are dead.

An association has been organized known as "World's Fair Sunday Opening Association." Upon its advisory committee are the following gentlemen: Col. James A. Sexton, Postmaster Washington, the Rev. Thomas James W. Scott, the Rev. Minot J. Savage, Prof. Forrest of Boston, the Hon. Frank Huston of Washington. Samuel Gompers of Labor Unions; Prof. Swing; Rev. Butler, Snydacker, of Peoria, Ill, and the Rev. Robert Collier of New York. Among the arrangements it is declared that its members, Cardinal Gibbons, the Right Rev. Bishop Potter of New York Mrs. John A. Logan, the Rev. H. W. Thomas, the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Houston of Dallas, Texas, and the Rev. J. T. Sunderland, of Ann Arbor, Mich.

This association, it is learned from an interview, has appointed Robert J. Thompson, secretary and Charles T. Root as the Washington representative. After Dec. 1, the headquarters will be the Willard Hotel, Washington, D. C.

"The object will be to devise all ways and means and to influence Congress to revise its action and to give the Fair an open Sunday. A circular letter has just been issued setting forth, the sense of the resolution and urging the people to have their representatives act early in the matter of fair and open Sunday closing clause."

A writer in the *February Forum*, of October, is referring to the works of Rev. F. M. Foster of the New York Presbytery, who recently recommended the action of the Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sundays, "that the ministers and ruling elders of the churches should go officially to Washington and formally present their views on the subject in a proper joint committee to speak for that," said this:—

Do you want an ecclesiastical "joint committee," to "go officially" before Congress to present the views of one denomination? No; and Christ was with no reference to any "joint committee" of churches who go to Washington, but he said that to you and define your duties toward him and your Government. It is as your personal representatives that your Senators go there, and in the exercise liberties live in their fancied security.

This is more significant than it may at first seem; when it is understood what Mr. Foster councils would be the authority of this ecclesiastical "joint committee," for in this very connection he said to those who wish Sunday closing:—

Mr. Foster's call for a joint committee is then for the appointment of an ecclesiastical council, which shall deliver to Congress and the people "authoritative," official "voice of God."
