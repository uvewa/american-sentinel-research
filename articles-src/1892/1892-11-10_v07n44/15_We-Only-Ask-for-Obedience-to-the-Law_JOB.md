The advocates of Sunday laws pose as the friends of law and order. They denounce anarchy as a heinous crime, and loudly assert that all they want is obedience to law.

That is perhaps all they want, in the matter of enforcing law; but with that they want the power to shape, according to their own notion, the laws that they ask to have enforced. That power they think they have already; and they expect to retain it. They profess to be followers of Christ; but they take for models, the arguments, methods, and plans of his enemies. When Christ stood before Pilate the enraged Jews cried out:—

We have a law, and by our law he ought to die. John 19:7.

And it was the same argument applied in a different manner that caused Pilate to sign the death warrant; for they said:—

If thou let this man go thou art not Cesar's friend, whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar. John 19:12.

That is, he would not be enforcing the Roman law against treason, and would, therefore, himself be chargeable with the same crime. Pilate understood this; and he also knew that the Jews would report it in just that shape to the Roman emperor, and that such a report would cost him his governorship; so he pronounced sentence of death upon the Son of God. There was also a law against introducing a strange religion into the Roman Empire. So, of course, when Christians went out preaching salvation through the name of Jesus alone, and denouncing the idolatry of the people, they were arrested and dragged before the magistrates. And their persecutors could say in vindication of themselves, "We only ask for obedience to the law." So, also, the Papacy only stretched on the rack, or burned at the stake, those who had been tried and condemned by due process of law. Indeed, they were so careful in that matter that, if the laws as they stood did not meet the requirements of the case, they would amend them or enact a new law that would meet the requirements; so they could still be consistent in asking only for obedience to the law. Now since, according to the Supreme Court, "this is a Christian Nation;" and "Christianity, general Christianity, is and always has been a part of the common law;" and, according to Judge Hammond's decision in the King case, August 1, 1891, "By a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom;" and since Rev. W. F. Crafts says: "The Christian people of this Nation can have [from Congress] what they want," it follows that when they say, "We only ask for obedience to law," they mean they only want power to enforce the doctrines of Christianity by law. What more could they want? What more could they have? What more did the Papacy have in the most flourishing age of the Inquisition? Not one iota more of power or privilege did it have than the privilege of making church dogmas into civil laws; and the power to enforce them as such. Then when they say, as Mr. Crafts did in a speech at Kansas City, Missouri, in September, "I have no fear that the Church will ever ask for anything that is not clearly within the domain of civil law," they speak only idle words, as a blind to cover up and conceal their true purpose.

For, if Christianity is a part of the common law of the land, as asserted by the Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania and Tennessee, and by United States District Judge Hammond, and confirmed by a unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court; if that be true there is not a doctrine of Christianity that is not clearly within the domain of civil law, and that may not be enforced as civil law, by civil (?) judges, with civil penalties. The next thing for them to do is to decide as to what particular dogmas they wish to so enforce, and then ask for the penalties to give them force. They have already agreed on the question of Sunday laws, and are demanding the penalties for the enforcement of the day. And no doubt they will soon have them; for have not even the senators, who are not elected by the people, admitted that "it is not wise statesmanship to antagonize the religious sentiment of the country"?

For exposing this image to the Papacy that they have set up, and to which they are demanding that all shall bow down, Seventh-day Adventists are denounced as anarchists. And one, in making the charge, facetiously added: "And they hang anarchists in Chicago."

Another man quite prominent in this movement wrote to a Seventh-day Adventist minister in Iowa:—

I am convinced that your folks will die hard. But we are helping Brother Crafts all the time to set the stakes, and get the ropes ready to scoop you all in. You will kick hard, of course, but we will make sure work.

And still another—Rev. Mr. Trefren at a ministerial convention in California, speaking of Seventh-day Adventist ministers, said:—

I predict for them a short race. What we want to law in this matter, good we will have it, too. And when we get the power in our hands, we will show these men what their end will be.

Yes, indeed, we only want obedience to the law, but the law must require whatever we demand. Is not that the spirit of the Papacy?—Yes, precisely; yet many more citations might be given from various sources in all parts of our country manifesting the same spirit. And the men who give utterance to these words are welcome co-laborers with those who learned that they "can have [from Congress] what they wish." From this and much other evidence that might be given, it is quite evident that these National Reformers (?) believe the time is close at hand when they must apply "their remedy." And, says the Christian Statesman:

Our remedy for all these malefic influences, is to have the Government simply set up the moral law and recognize God's authority behind it, and lay its hand on any religion that does not conform to it.

But, "all we ask is obedience to the law."
