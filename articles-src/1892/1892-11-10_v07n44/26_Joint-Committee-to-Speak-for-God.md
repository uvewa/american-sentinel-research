A WRITER for the Pittsburgh Press, of October 27, referring to the words of Rev. F. M. Foster at a meeting held in the city of New York, to ratify the action of Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sunday, where he said that the Christian churches should go officially to Washington and before Congress, and for this purpose "they should appoint a joint committee to speak for God," uses these words:

Do you want any ecclesiastical "joint committee" to pass judgment upon your rights and liberties, and utter the voice of God in the halls of Congress with reference to them?

Do you want any man or set of men to speak for God to you and define your duties toward him and then compel you to perform them? If not, there is no time to be lost. The greatest danger to American liberties lies in their fancied security.

These can not be considered the words of an alarmist when it is understood what Mr. Foster considers would be the authority of this "joint committee," for in this very connection he said, "The voice of God, authoritative, official, is through his Church."

Mr. Foster's call for a joint committee is then for the appointment of an ecclesiastical commission which shall deliver to Congress and the people the "authoritative, official" voice of God.
