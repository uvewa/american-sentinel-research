THE *Mail and Express* thinks that it is now some prospect that the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Central Park will again be closed to the public on Sundays. Way too closely tied to the push, because it is a museum that it is a mistress that it has never been entirely closed on Sunday. But when nominally closed, a favored few were admitted on Sunday, and employees were kept on duty for that purpose.

The way the *Mail and Express* puts the whole piece of news concerning the possible Sunday closing of the Museum, is this: "Vice-President Huntington tells us that the *Mail and Express* that the probability is that the Museum of Art will be altogether closed, on the day of Sunday rest." And the reason for it is thought to be the Museum's desire to practice economy. The trustees, finding their debt increasing to a formidable amount, the deficiency of being some $40,000. That is, the additional expense incurred by keeping open on Sunday has cost the trustees something more than the city furnished for the support of the Museum. For this reason, and for this alone, the trustees propose to close the institution, to the conduct of which we are obliged. But resuming on Sunday, keeping a smaller force of employees on duty is to outward to the fiscal test in place who are admitted on that day. And this, according to the *Mail and Express*, "the shutting will bring in order to be deserved."

But, according to the *Evening World*, the *Mail and Express* did not tell the whole story. It seems that the only thing seriously in consideration in the plan of a revision in accord with present legislation, is that the Museum of Art may be closed until the first of January, because there is no technically available way of securing the necessary funds to meet extra expense for Sunday opening until that time. The *Mail and Express* either. Thus also to incorporate a clause in the appropriation bill allowing a transfer from unexpected balances to meet the extra expenses of the year. In the case of the Museum of Natural History this was done, and there is consequently no question as to Sunday opening there. The appropriation for the next year carries with it the understanding that the Museum of Art shall be open on Sunday. It would seem that the *Mail and Express*, in its anxiety to shut the public out of the Museum on Sunday, has jumped at the wrong conclusion.
