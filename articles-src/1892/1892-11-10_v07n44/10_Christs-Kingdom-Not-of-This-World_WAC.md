AS BY an immense army could be raised to-day to defend Christianity against any attack that heathenism might dare to make against it as a religion. Not only those who profess personal faith in the Nazarene and yield willing obedience to his teachings, but a vastly larger number of those who lay no claim to membership in his kingdom, would rally to its defense in the crisis and would march willingly to the conflict for the faith they represent, but not by civil law and the use of carnal weapons. For conversion is the only acceptable method of winning heaven's kingdom. If the kingdom of Christ is won by repentance and faith. A call to arms is not a call to repentance. On the other hand, there are many who have such profound respect for the Bible and its institutions that they would be moved to the defense by the highest motives of which they are capable. As the Saviour declared that a mystical legion of the angels would come to his rescue, so myriads of men are ready to-day to devote their very lives in his behalf. The authorized uplifting of Peter's sword would be answered by an army of swords such as the world has never seen.

But the disciples are very tolerant of those who oppose him at the time. He told us, and we ought to have learned, that his kingdom is not of this world, and that there-

fore his servants are not asked to fight for him. And, as in many other cases his declaration looks further and makes more than surface impressions upon the question. It is not established by the same methods; it is not acquired by the same means; it is not secured by the same safeguards; it is not sustained by the same tactics; and it does not offer the same immunities and privileges. It is, at these points, not an institution of this kind. From the fact that we know it is nothing startling or taking strange; it is a membership of the spirit. Hence is its application. General principles, but wonderfully awakening and applicable.

The purpose of earthly governments is the protection of its persons and rights of the citizens. This protection looks no further than the end of this earthly life; at the grave civil law turns back from its subject and leaves it alone. It can reach no farther, and it can go no farther. The protection of Christ's kingdom has an insurance with respect to the life beyond the grave as well as this side. And in that may pronounce that. Lawyers, but only in rare instances, can represent the client; and clergy, does the civil law affect religious morals and yet—and yet—the Church, though powerfully, shapes the citizen's life, but to state the specific relation of civil questions of policy in our affairs of State, and still further than this, it is limited to conclusions which are reached. It allows no interference with the purely spiritual affairs of the kingdom of Christ in the support of the ministry, the building of churches, the installation of church officers and the enforcement of discipline, but it is in no sense more related to civil jurisdiction, and has not only nothing more to do than has the masonic order. If the State has no more right than this to participate in their management of those affairs which belong to the Church, it is which belong to them in their social relations. The Church's relations to the State also are limited. She has to do with educating the children; but it has no right to do this in any other way than that of moral suasion. She may inculcate the religious faith, no matter though it is the true faith, of her members, upon a wholly unwilling and non-believing community. And to attempt to do so would be no less an attempt to cover the natural right of private judgment with something more powerful than temporal and moral carnal. It no way violates any right whatever for churches to undertake to administer the spiritual affairs of the kingdom of Christ, no State to assume direction of spiritual matters or to enforce religious observances.

Even the enactment of Sunday laws by the civil powers must needs be placed on the ground that civil law based on and enfold, by a law of physical endurance, the laboring classes need periodic rest from contagion or oppression. People must rest for the sake of health. Compelling them to attend religious service violates the spirit of the Constitution. Bodies of Christians people may or may not accept any religious doctrine as their protection, and address them to proper instruction, but they have no right to demand only on the ground that the presence of religion be in the Constitution.

We do not think Heaven is particularly solicitous about getting God named in the Constitution, though each recognizing him in their everyday lives. Christ does not yearn for the enforcement of religion upon all the citizens of the State through its Constitution; but it must be willingly, not by force. The simple fact is that a physical call by all good citizens for temperance, justice and their enforcement in
