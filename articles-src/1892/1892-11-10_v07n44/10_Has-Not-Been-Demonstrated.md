On the occasion of the meeting of the American Board of Foreign Missions at Chicago, October 6, the president of the Board, Rev. Dr. Storrs said:—

We have demonstrated for the world to see it the power of the Church to take care of itself without any help or interference from the State government of the nation in which the church is planted. That is a lesson which the world will more and more take to its heart. It has been thought, of course, for ages that religious sentiment and religious doctrine could not be maintained among a people except by the aid of State authority.

We passed beyond that long ago, and we have shown how powerful religion is as a force in itself, without the least dependence upon State aid.

This sounds well, but is it true? Have we demonstrated the ability of the Church to get along without the least dependence upon the State?—Most decidedly not. It is indeed true that the Church not only can get along without State aid but that it gets on much better without it; but it has not been demonstrated in this country. There has been opportunity to demonstrate this fact in California since 1882, when the California Sunday law was repealed. But instead of going to work to demonstrate it, the churches have spent much of their strength and not a little means in an effort to secure State aid to the extent of a Sunday law, and a statute exempting church property from taxation. They have thus lost their opportunity to demonstrate the power of the Church, for in seeking the power of the State they necessarily overlooked and neglected the power of God and of his truth; and so lost that without gaining the other.

That the Church of to-day is in some measure dependent upon the State, is thus incidentally confessed by Mr. Crafts in his "Sabbath for Man," page 248, edition of 1885:—

It is the conviction of the majority that the Nation can not be preserved without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without laws.

This is only saying that religion cannot be preserved without civil laws for the protection of at least one of its institutions. It is not true; but its falsity has not been demonstrated by the popular churches in this country. It was demonstrated in the Roman Empire in the early history of the Christian era; and it has been demonstrated to some extent in later ages by dissenting sects which have grown and flourished not only without the aid of civil laws, but in spite of hostile statutes. But no church can ever demonstrate it while claiming exemption from equal taxation, and while claiming a legal monopoly of one seventh part of the time of all the people.
