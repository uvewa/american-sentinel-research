THE Chicago Herald, in the course of an editorial mention of an undertaking, which is well under way in Chicago, to establish a series of educational and other popular exercises in a public place to be called the "People's Hall," says:—

The noteworthy fact in the plan as announced is the standard adopted concerning Sunday. In the People's Hall university extension courses are to be given Sunday afternoons, while Sunday evenings are to be made prolific of good music, lectures and other entertainments. The discussion of the use of Sunday in Chicago during the World's Fair has directly affected the judgment of many Christians. Among the names subscribed to the Sunday plan at the People's Hall are several that appeared a year or two years ago against opening the exhibits of the World's Fair on Sunday.

This is the undeniable benefit of agitation in this question, that the just and true and honest-hearted will see that coercion in religious matters is unchristian. When Christians perceive their error in this, they will renounce the whole fallacious line of thought and action and become Christians indeed, after the pattern which the Master has set them.
