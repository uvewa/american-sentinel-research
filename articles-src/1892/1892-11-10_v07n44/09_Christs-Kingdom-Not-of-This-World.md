As immense army could be mustered to-day to defend Christianity against any attack that heathenism might dare to make against it as a religion. Not only those who profess personal faith in the Nazarene and yield willing obedience to his laws, but hundreds and thousands of those who lay no claim to membership in his kingdom, would rally to the standard of the cross and would march willingly to the conflict for the faith they respect. To some it might seem an easier and more acceptable method of winning heaven's favor and of securing eternal life, than by repentance and faith. A call to arms would please their fancy. On the other hand, there are many who have such profound regard for the Bible and its promises that they would be moved to its defense by the highest motives of which they are capable. As the Saviour declared that a myriad of angels waited to come to his rescue, so myriads of men are equally willing to take up the sword in his behalf. The authorized uplifting of Peter's sword would be answered by as brave responses as ever echoed to the nation's call.

But we have learned long ago, at least we ought to have learned, that his kingdom is not of this world, and that therefore his servants are not asked to fight for him. And, as in many other cases his declaration looks further and means more than the surface interpretation indicates. It is not established by the same methods; it is not ruled by the same principles; it is not secured by the same safeguards; it is not extended by the same tactics; and it does not offer the same immunities and privileges. On all these points, and on others, it is a something by itself. We know there is nothing startling or taking in this statement; but its decided significance is in its application. General principles are often tame in their statement, but wonderfully awakening in their application to details.

The purpose of earthly governments is the protection of the person and rights of the citizen. This protection looks no further than the end of this earthly life. At the grave civil law turns back from its ministry of good. It pledged itself to go no further, and it can go no further. The kingdom of Christ has its supreme significance with respect to the life beyond this, and it affects this life only that it may promote that. Largely, but only indirectly, does the civil law affect religious interests; while religion only incidentally, though powerfully, shapes the citizen life.

In the application of these principles to questions of policy in our affairs of State, no Christian might to shrink from the conclusions which are reached. It allows no union of Church and State. The support of the ministry, the building of churches, the filling of ecclesiastical offices and the enforcement of discipline, are matters with which the State has no more to do than has the masonic order. As citizens, the people may demand its protection in their management of these affairs, but only because these are rights which belong to them in their social relations. The State may educate, or provide for the co-operation of the people in educating the children; but it has no right to assume or direct the simplest lessons of religious faith, no matter though it be done under a covering that threatens no harm. To do so is to attempt to cover the eternal with what can never be more than temporal and carnal. It is no more violation as the general principle for churches to undertake to administer the functions of civil governments, than for the State to assume direction of spiritual matters.

Even the enactment of Sunday laws by the civil powers must be defended only on the ground that man and beast are entitled, by a law of physical endurance, to regular rest, just as we protect them from contagion or oppression. People must be left free from enactments compelling them to attend religious service and engage in ceremonies of worship. Bodies of Christian people may or may not embody their desire for Sunday protection, and address them to proper authorities, but they have right to their demand only on the ground that the preservation of health and of good order require it.

We do not think Heaven is particularly solicitous about getting God named in the Constitution, though such recognition might do good; but we are quite sure Heaven yearns for the enthronement of God in the heart of every subject of the Constitution; but it must be willingly, not by force. The unanimous and emphatic call by all good citizens for temperance laws and their enforcement is legitimate, because the protection of the helpless and innocent, to say nothing of the safety of life and property, require it. Here temporal interests are in jeopardy. But religion as a way of eternal salvation, as a conquest by love, as a spiritual power for redemption, has no such demand to make of earthly king or legislator. There is a sharp line where the province of one force must stop and leave the other alone.

The State is not the author of moral law; therefore it can neither punish violation nor forgive the penalty of transgression. If it assume the power to do one of these, it must assume to do all; and if Christians ask it to do one, they must allow it to do all. From a conclusion like this there is no escape. The great business of God's people is to bring men to Jesus as a Saviour. In doing this, the helpful blessings of citizenship in a good government, are not to be despised; but the power that helps comes from above. Every attempt to ally the earthly and the heavenly in the promotion of religion, has proven a failure. The kingdoms are unlike, composed of different subjects, ruled by different principles, organized for different ends, and they must be kept to their proper spheres.
