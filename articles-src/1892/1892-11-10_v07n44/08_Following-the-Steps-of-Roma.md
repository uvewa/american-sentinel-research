REV. D. S. S. MARTIN, pastor of Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, in the course of a recent sermon, said:

I believe that the Roman Catholic Church is growing rapidly in this land. And I believe the reason for it is that Protestantism is following in her steps and has lost her grip on the masses of the people. Rome increases because Protestantism is declining.
