It is an error to suppose that the majority has an unqualified right to rule. In civil things the majority has a right to rule, but the majority has no more right to invade the domain of conscience than has the single individual whom custom, fraud, or force has placed at the head of a government. Such power is illegitimate no matter by whom it may be exercised. Governments are instituted to secure natural right, and any government that fails to do this has no right to exist, whether it be a government by one, by the few, or by the many.
