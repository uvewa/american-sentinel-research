American Sabbath Union, and Rev. F. J. Stevenson, of the National Reform Association, did good service as Christian lobbyists.

The bishops of the Church in the fourth century saw to petitions to the Emperor with great praying that Sunday shows and like performances be transferred to some other day that the "faithful" might not be lured from divine service. The bishops of the Protestant churches have been at this for years been sending to their local Representatives and Senators for the same purpose and for the same reason. The American Sabbath Union last October 6, giving its reasons for holding that the World's Fair should be closed in the afternoons as well as in the forenoons of Sunday, says:

But is the afternoon free? True, there are no machines in motion, and no exhibitors at work there. They are just as legitimate, just as interesting and the buildings themselves are so seated as faithfully; seats are influential as offers, and attractions even if the whole purpose of the afternoon were to be as the closure of the Fair.

And that, We do herein pledge ourselves as neighbors, and as citizens, that we will each refuse to vote for or support for any office or position, any candidate of any party, who is in favor of opening the World's Fair to the public on Sunday in any form, or who will not openly oppose the Sunday opening of the World's Fair.

And Joseph Cook in the *Union Signal* indicates:

In Boston, the first question asked a stranger is, "How much money are you worth?" In New York it is "How smart are you worth?" in Chicago, "How much money have you got?" New York is apt to ask, "Who was his grandfather?" and in Philadelphia, "What are his views?" If those six thousand young people have converted Congress that this little combination is not to be despised or underrated by any of those.

And in this fight for religious legislation and the establishment and enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath by law these Christian openly advocate are known by the political arts as we know in the political world. The *Baptist*, a Baptist paper of New York, said:

The present is no time for jubilation, but as a matter of political wire-pulling and campaign methods is the use of money in carrying on dated measures. That this may be altogether unthought of by those Protestants themselves, and these indications of their determination to exalt and enforce their views must be well known to Joseph Cook in the *Union Signal* indicates:—

In none of the signs with which the right of persons is in the expression of the Congress of the United States so signally, so triumphantly, so earnest vigorously by the friends of Sunday observance among whom we are working since. As the facts are known the astonishment will grow. We sign ourselves as all points of the compass. The correspondents of the press at the time gave the impression that the extreme impulse for the Sunday closing came more from the press of the country simply have then shown more weight behind the churches and the responsible civic organizations by which it was accomplished.

From this it would appear that Mr. Stevens, the political advocate of "nationwide advocate of righteousness," has already advanced the claim for the churches to demonstrate the power of the Church, for in seeking the power of the State they necessarily overlooked and neglected the power of God and of his truth; and so lost that without gaining any of those.

That the Church to-day is in some measure dependent upon the State, is thus undeniably confirmed by Mr. Crafts in the "*Sabbath for Man*," page 518, 519:

It is the exception of the majority that the Sabbath will survive the divorce of the State and religion without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath without the State.

This is only saying that religion can not be preserved without civil laws for the protection of at least one of the institutions. It is not true, but its falsity has not been demonstrated by the popular churches in this country. It was illustrated in the Roman Empire in the early centuries of the Christian era, and it has been demonstrated to some extent in later years by dissenters who have had a proper and flourished and only without the aid of civil laws, but in spite of hostile statutes. But no church can ever demonstrate it while claiming exemption from unjust taxation, and wasting, in "legislative evangelism," one seventh part of the time of all her preachers.
