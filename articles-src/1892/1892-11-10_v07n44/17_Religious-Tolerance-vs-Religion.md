"RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE VS. RELIGION."

It is an error to suppose that the majority has an inalienable right. It is in itself unjust things the majority's right to rule, but the majority has no inalienable right to do evil, to invade the domain of conscience thus easily. The Government that has been set up by fraud, or force has placed at the head of a Government is a tyranny, no matter in what form and make no matter by whom it may be exercised. Governments are ordained to secure natural right, and any government that fails to do this has no right to exist, whether it be a government by one, by the few, or by the many.
