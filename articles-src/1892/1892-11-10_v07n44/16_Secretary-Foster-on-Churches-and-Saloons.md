SECRETARY CHARLES FOSTER having expressed the opinion previous to the election, that Mr. Harrison was then as good as elected, a political paper asked, "Has Mr. Foster been buying up the saloons or the church vote?" In explanation of this question the paper continued: "Mr. Foster recently said that a good deal of money goes to saloon keepers in exciting campaigns, and that he has been approached in almost every campaign by churches and asked to subscribe to their funds. He affirmed with brutal boodler candor, 'I don't see much difference between the saloon and the church in that.'" Has it indeed come to this that even the churches are for sale to the party paying the highest price?
