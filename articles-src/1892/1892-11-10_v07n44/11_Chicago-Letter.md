THE MARLOWE THEATER.

THE Marlowe Theater of Englewood is closed on Sundays, and was recently protected by an injunction restraining the city from interfering with it. It is to be remembered that when it undertook to open on Sunday in opposition to the Sunday police of the city and the wishes of a body of citizens, the ordinance and that it was effected between a church committee organized by a Sunday closing church sentiment, and the managers of the theater, by the terms of which the theater was to close Sunday nights in return for church patronage the other nights. This made any agreement that the church people should agree not claim that their part of their agreement, and they are, therefore, no longer bound to adhere to theirs.

In this matter of Sunday closing, as in this last turn of affairs, is that the Baptist church of that neighborhood was chiefly calling on the police to close its Sunday performances. This is an illustration of how Baptist principles and prayed for the conviction of the theater proprietor, a Sunday night patrons. Better late than never, but it would have been more in accord with the inspiration of the law that the Sunday theater patrons would not be troubled with the inspiration the appeal to the throne of grace was taken so eagerly by those who had several times refused a point of order.

LEADERS OF ROME.

Dr. Martin of Grace Methodist Church, certain ones and recently, by declaring that he would not attend the Inaugural exercises of the World's Fair under certain conditions of the World's Fair Association, recently held at the Auditorium, on the charge of the evening, and the only orator, was Archbishop Ireland. Many sympathized with Dr. Martin and remained away, and it was noticed that the meeting was largely made up of Catholics and Roman Catholics. When the Presbyterian Church opened the meeting in the evening the pastor of the University of Chicago, offered the prayer.

The Congress Auxiliary is held by Catholic organizations against and asserted, and Dr. Martin and others are jealous of the Catholic bosses of partially shut down. This jealousy, now that the State of Illinois Power of the Catholic Church has decided that "this is a Christian Nation," that its doctrine riper, into a demand that the Government decide which of the contending denominations is entitled to the name, the contest is becoming serious. If it furnish the orator on such State occasions, as inauguration, while the Presbyterians are made in favor of the Catholics, the Protestants will have to look out for themselves, and should take with stocial fortitude the consequences of their electioneering.
