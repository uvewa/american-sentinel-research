ONE of the evils of the day is the decadence of religious instruction in the family. Parents imagine that they can not interest their children in the Bible, and so trust that work very largely to the Sabbath school or Sunday school. This is a serious mistake. The study of the Bible can and should be made attractive to the little folks. But how can this be done?—By a judicious use of Bible picture books.

This thought is suggested by examining a copy of "The Children's Bible Hour," by Jenny B. Merrill, which has just come to our table. This book has 212 pages, 8 x 11 inches, with 68 full-page illustrations by Dore and others. All but one or two of the illustrations are really fine; many of them are new, at least to us; and all of them will interest the children, and set them to asking questions. Then the book will suggest topics to the mother, and often solve the problem of a quiet Sabbath afternoon when otherwise the children might be restless and fretful.

We discover in this book two statements which we look upon as errors in doctrine, though most of the so-called orthodox would not so regard them. For the most part the book is composed of simple Scripture narratives, and on the whole is to be commended for its fidelity to the facts as related in Holy Writ. Few books are wholly free from error, and the truth-loving mother will know how to fortify her children against false doctrines with which they must sooner or later become acquainted, and which they would perhaps better meet at the mother's knee than elsewhere.

This book is advertised on another page. It will not, we think, disappoint those who buy it.
