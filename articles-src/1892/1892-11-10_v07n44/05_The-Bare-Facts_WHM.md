AN active agitation of the question of the Bible in the public schools is now going on in the State of Washington. This has opened a discussion of the whole matter of the patronage and employment of the forms of religion by the State. The origin of this was in a clause in the State Constitution which precludes any public school or institution from receiving public moneys if religious exercises are made a part of their regular procedure. It may be that there will be an effort to change this clause in the Constitution.

The Seattle Post-Intelligencer credits members of the constitutional convention who voted for this at the adoption and presentation to the people of the State Constitution, as saying that "they understood it was simply to prevent State funds going to sectarian and parochial schools. Also that they considered its object was to defeat any attempt to secure State funds in supporting Roman Catholic institutions." That is, they understood that it was a measure discriminating in favor of one form of religion, by establishing in the fundamental law of the State what they understood to be discrimination against another form of religion.

What humbug, and what hypocrisy! Strip away the thin verbiage, and leave the bare facts! They intended to construct the Constitution of the State to the advantage of Protestantism which they nominally professed and from which they expected political support, and to the disadvantage of Roman Catholicism from which they expected nothing. The truth ought to be told. The truth should be understood. This country has entered upon an era of religious politics. The hypocrisy, corruption, animosity, in which it will result is beyond present comprehension, but, however different in development, it will not differ in kind or in degree from the manifestation of the same evil forces in past centuries.
