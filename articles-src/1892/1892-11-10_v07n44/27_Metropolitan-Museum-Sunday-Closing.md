THE Mail and Express thinks that there is now some prospect that the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Central Park will again be closed to the public on Sunday. We say closed to the public, because it is a notorious fact that it has never been entirely closed on Sunday. Even when nominally closed, a favored few were admitted on Sunday, and employees were kept on duty for that purpose.

THE way the Mail and Express puts this piece of news concerning the probable Sunday closing of the Museum, is this: "Vice-President Huntington tells a Mail and Expressman that the probabilities are that the Sabbath will no longer be desecrated." And the reason for it is that owing to Sunday opening there is a deficiency of some $10,000. That is, the additional expense incurred by keeping open on Sunday has cost the trustees $10,000 more than the city furnished for the support of the Museum. For this reason, and for this alone, the trustees propose to close the institution to the public on Sunday, keeping a smaller force of employees on duty to attend to the favored few who are admitted on that day. And thus, according to the Mail and Express, "the Sabbath will no longer be desecrated."

BUT, according to the Evening World, the Mail and Express does not tell the whole story. It seems that the only likelihood, and indeed, the only apparent possibility in accord with present legislation, is that the Museum of Art may be closed until the first of January, because there is no technically available way of securing the necessary funds to meet extra expenses for Sunday opening until that time. The whole difficulty arises from the failure to incorporate a clause in the appropriation bill allowing a transfer from unexpended balances to meet the extra expenses of the year. In the case of the Museum of Natural History this was done, and there is consequently no question as to Sunday opening there. The appropriation for the next year carries with it the understanding that the Museum of Art shall be open on Sundays. It would seem that the Mail and Express, in its anxiety to shut the public out of the Museum on Sundays, has jumped at the wrong conclusion.
