THE Dutch Reformed *Christian Intelligencer* editorially the utterances of Rev. I. L. P. Allen, before the Minnesota Methodist-Presbyterian Synod, on the public school question. Mr. Allen proposes to turn the question over to Archbishop Ireland and the so-called "liberal" wing of the Catholic Church; and the plan as an attempt to Romanize the public schools; that the Catholic press of America is controlled by "Rome's school of popes." Of this plan Mr. Allen did say:—

As to the "book power of Rome" nor the "political power of Rome" this country has at least no fear at from at the present time. It may be true, in a vague, general way, that certain ideals are gradually, but surely being subverted by the anti-American tendencies latent in a very large percentage of our immigrant population. The constitution, at whose instance the Constitution is being overthrown, should be known. Roman Catholicism has had in some of the European and South American countries, what it may fairly be said, has already made subservient tools of the individual, his morals, his religion, his business, his politics, and this country and its institutions to the Church, and to compel all people within the borders of the nation to be subject to the Roman Catholic denomination. That the "people" of this country must be the defenders and protectors of their religion. It is time that the people awake to the dangerous character of this religious conspiracy which strikes at the very foundations of civil liberty.

Certainly it is not the Roman Catholic, but those paid anti-Romanists, the National League, which is now subverting these important moral principles and this institution of the highest value to all the people, and the demand priced by them until they secure control over the public schools by the aid of the professed anti-Romanists themselves.

If the Roman Catholics can look out for themselves and this Government then is it not time the Protestants did the same, and looked after the public school system of the country. The Pope and the Roman prelates have said again and again that it is their theory the necessary result of the working of the present system. They know that the operations of such organizations as the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, with all its machinery of a business, social, and political, institution, will end in the same result. The real ephemeral and superficial at most. They know that these organizations can be controlled and captured in advance by their allies. They hold and actively propagate principles, the natural and necessary fruit of which Catholicism is based, and through which it gets all the power it has. Any anti-Romanism that is planted in that soil can be its short lived triumph before the eventual and certain triumph of Romanism. This combination is hurrying the country, this time with the assistance and under the services of those who are now publishing documents against the Catholic religion. They are the sappers and miners who go before the regular columns of the Church. What principles and papal methods the professed anti-Catholics themselves grant Protestants it will be but a simple thing for the Romanists to appropriate. So that, for the degree of Romanist influence, that is, that for the degree which makes real papists Protestantism a failure. And Catholicism are already allied together.
