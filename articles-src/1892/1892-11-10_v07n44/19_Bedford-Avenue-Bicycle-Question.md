BEDFORD AVENUE, Brooklyn, is quite torn up over the Sunday bicycle question. Both preachers and laymen have expressed themselves on the matter, and on both sides of it. It is not quite certain what those who object to the bicycle riding want. It may be that some ride their bicycles to church. Certainly that would be just as commendable as riding in the street car, or private carriage, or even why not just as proper as walking. The wheel is but a simple mechanical assistance in walking. If bicyclers are to be shut off the streets on Sunday, why should not promenading be prohibited, and certainly carriage riding? If these objectors are not thoughtless, what is their ultimate thought?
