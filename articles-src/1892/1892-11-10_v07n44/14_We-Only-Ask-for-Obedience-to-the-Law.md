THE advocates of Sunday laws pose as the friends of law and order. They say gravely: amidst as a serious crisis, and loudly protest that they are not persecutors.

That is perhaps all they want, is the law, yet is it not natural that those who want the power to shape, according to their own particular belief, the laws they ask to have enforced. That power they want and would use for the oppression of those whose only offense was their refusal to submit. They profess the faith of Christ. Let them take the methods, the arguments, methods, and plans of Roman Catholic persecutors, and they annihilate the earnest Jews every civil code.
