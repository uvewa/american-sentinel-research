A GENTLEMAN in Kansas sends us the following letter of information:—

Kansas City, Kan., Oct. 30, 1892.

EDITORS SENTINEL: I notice that you state that the religious papers in general do not say anything about the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee; but note one or two exceptions. With this in mind, I attended Rev. W. F. Crafts' meeting at Ottawa, this State, August 4, and after the meeting, had a little conversation with him, in which I called his attention to the Tennessee matter. He answered that he and his co-laborers were just as much opposed to that as any body could be; that Tennessee was away behind the times, etc. I then asked him why their papers said nothing about it. He replied that he had spoken about it several times in his paper (the Christian Statesman). I thought you would like to know that he had made such a statement.

Yours truly,

OSCAR HILL.

Among the so-called orthodox religious papers we know of but one, the New York Independent, that has really entered any protest against the action of the State of Tennessee in the matter of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists. So far as the Christian Statesman has said anything at all upon the subject, it has been to justify the persecution. July 2, it had this:—

Several Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee have been fined one dollar each for violating the law against Sunday work on their farms. For the sake of arousing sympathy, they refused to pay and went to jail. In most of the States such private work by those who observe another day is not punishable, but so long as forbidden by law, the judge rightly insists that it shall not be done.

This is certainly not a protest against the persecution. In his book, "The Sabbath for Man," Mr. Crafts does say in one place that it would seem to be a harmless indulgence to permit those who keep the seventh day to do private work on Sunday, but the tenor of his book is opposed to even this "indulgence." But on page 262 he says:—

The tendency of legislatures and executive officers toward those who claim to keep a Saturday-Sabbath is to over-leniency rather than over strictness. For instance, the laws of Rhode Island allow Seventh-day Baptists, by special exception, to carry on public industries on the first day of the week. . . . Infinitely less harm is done by the usual policy, the only constitutional or sensible one, to let the insignificantly small minority of less than one in a hundred, whose religious convictions require them to rest on Saturday (unless their work is of a private character such as the law allows them to do on Sunday), suffer the loss of one day's wages rather than have the other ninety-nine suffer by the wrecking of their Sabbath by public business.

Instead of reciprocating the generosity shown toward them by the makers of Sabbath laws, these seventh-day Christians expend a very large part of their energy in antagonizing such laws, seeking by the free distribution of tracts and papers to secure their repeal or neglect, seemingly on the policy of rule or rule. They persuade very few to keep the seventh day; they only succeed in confusing the consciences of many about the first. They increase the desecration of the Lord's day, but not the hallowing of Saturday.

But coming more directly to the question of the enforcement of Sunday laws in the South, Mr. Crafts says:—

Another element of hope in the United States comes from the South, whose religious conservatism has kept up a fairly good Sabbath observance thus far, and promises to continue it.

It should be remembered that the Southern people are very largely orthodox in religion. Judge Craft, of Memphis, says of the South: "The civil observance prevails very generally in the South, outside of New Orleans and one or two other cities. Sunday is a day of quiet and of rest in all our rural districts."

And again of the law of Tennessee, he says:—

From Tennessee, where, in 1884, there was some enforcement of Sabbath laws, a judge writes me: "There is no sort of danger of a repeal of the law. The only question is as to how latitudinarian may be the construction given to 'necessity and charity.'"

Evidently Mr. Crafts did not write with a view of securing the repeal of the law, but quite the contrary. Those expressions from his book and from his paper, show conclusively that he has not the slightest sympathy with those observers of the seventh day who are oppressed by laws which require them to keep Sunday also. In his book he sneers at observers of the seventh day, and in both his book and his paper, he misrepresents them. Nothing could be further from the truth than to say that the persecuted Adventists in Tennessee went to jail for the sake of arousing sympathy. Neither is it true that they were fined only one dollar each; that was the nominal fine, but in addition to that amount, the statute imposes in each docketed case an additional fine of five dollars on each of three funds, making a total of fifteen dollars for each defendant. Then in the Adventist cases there were costs amounting to about ten dollars each, making a total of about twenty-five dollars in each case, instead of only one dollar, as Mr. Crafts would have the readers of his paper believe. As a matter of fact, only one of the four convicted men could have paid his fine and costs without appealing to friends for aid. They were poor men suffering persecution for conscience' sake, and yet the sleek, well-fed Mr. Crafts who earns—or rather gets—twenty dollars every Sunday besides smaller sums almost every night during the week, persistently misrepresents them, and poses as one opposed to religious persecution.
