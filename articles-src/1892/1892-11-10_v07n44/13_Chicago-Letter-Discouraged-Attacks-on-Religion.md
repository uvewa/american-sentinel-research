### DISCOURAGED ATTACKS ON RELIGION.

The American Secular Union has just closed its sixteenth annual congress, electing the same national officers, with the exception of treasurer. There seemed to be an almost unanimous sentiment at the meeting, in favor of adhering strictly to the demand of the Union for a purely secular Government. All attacks on the churches or their doctrines, except where these conflict with the secular theory of government, were discouraged. It was maintained that the platform of the Union should be so broad as to admit of Christian clergymen and others who believe in entire separation of Church and State voicing these sentiments from the secular platform, without having their individual views of doctrine, not essentially at variance with the secular theory, assailed.

Among this class who were accorded a hearing at this meeting, was John W. Tindall, of the Chicago Inter-Ocean, who spoke on the "Sunday Newspapers," and Alonzo T. Jones, of the American Sentinel, who spoke twice, first on "The Captivity of the Republic," and second on "Present National Measures, Uniting Church and State."

This meeting took one long step in advance by repudiating its former demand for a secular Sunday law, and voting instead, a protest against all laws directly or indirectly enforcing Sunday observance. The organization laid plans for a vigorous campaign the coming year.
