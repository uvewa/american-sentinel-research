PRESIDENT FAIRCHILD of Oberlin College has thus stated in his "Moral Philosophy," the principles that should govern Christians in their relations to civil government:

Obedience is to be rendered to all human governments, in subordination to the will of God. It is too obvious to need discussion, that the law of God, the great principle of benevolence, is supreme, and that, "we ought to obey God, rather than men," in any case of conflict between human law and the divine.

There are cases so clear that no one can question the duty to refuse obedience. In all times and in all lands such cases have arisen. In a case of this kind, either of two courses is possible; to disobey the law, and resist the government in its attempt to execute it, or to disobey and quietly suffer the penalty. The first is revolutionary, and can be justified only when the case is flagrant, and affects such numbers that a revolutionary movement will be sustained. The second course will, in general, commend itself to consider and conscientious men. It is a testimony against the law as unrightous, and, at the same time, a recognition of government as a grave interest.

IN replying to the objection that the right of private judgment, as herein maintained, in reference to obedience to the laws of the land, would subvert government, and introduce confusion and anarchy, President Fairchild says:

Conscientious men are not the enemies, but the friends, of any government but a tyranny. They are its strength, and not its weakness. Daniel, in Babylon, praying, contrary to the law, was the true friend and supporter of the government; while those who, in their pretended zeal for the law and the Constitution, would strike down the good man, were its real enemies. It is only when government transcends its sphere, that it comes in conflict with the consciences of men.

THE principles thus cogently stated by one of our most eminent educators, can not fail to commend themselves to the better sense of every man. They fully justify the course thus far pursued by the Tennessee Adventists in their contest with the civil authorities of the State. May God help them still to be true to their convictions, and to say as did the three faithful Hebrews: "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
