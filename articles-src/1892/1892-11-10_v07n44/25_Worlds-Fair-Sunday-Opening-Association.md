The following is from the Chicago Daily News of October 31:

"The friends of an open Sunday for the World's Fair do not yet seem to be satisfied that they are defeated.

"An association has been organized known as the 'World's Fair Sunday-Opening Association.' Upon its advisory committee are the following gentlemen: Col. James A. Sexton, Hempstead Washburne, the Rev. Dr. Thomas, James W. Scott, the Rev. Minot J. Savage of Boston, the Hon. Frank Hatton of Washington, Samuel Gompers of New York, the Right Rev. Bishop Spaulding of Peoria, Ill., and the Rev. Robert Collyer of New York. Among its sympathizers, it is claimed, are his eminence, Cardinal Gibbons, the Right Rev. Bishop Potter of New York, Mrs. John A. Logan, the Rev. David Swing, the Most Rev. Archbishop Brennan of Dallas, Texas, and the Rev. J. T. Sutherland of Ann Arbor, Mich. The association has appointed Robert J. Thompson, secretary, and has temporary quarters at 160 Adams Street, Chicago. After Dec. 1, its headquarters will be the Willard Hotel, Washington, D. C.

"Its object will be to devise all ways and means to induce Congress to revoke its recent action and give to the Fair an open Sunday. A circular has just been issued setting forth the views of the association and urging the people to have their representatives in Congress work for the repeal of the Sunday closing clause."
