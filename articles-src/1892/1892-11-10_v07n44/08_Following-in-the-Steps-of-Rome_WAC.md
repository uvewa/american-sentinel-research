REV. DR. R. S. MARTIN, pastor of Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, in a recent sermon, printed in the Chicago Post of October 17, said:—

I believe that the Roman Catholic Church is bending every effort to dominate the United States, and that in time the Pope will establish his headquarters in this country and try to make Americans kneel before him and kiss his great too.

He further denounced "Romish methods" and declared that they were "aimed at the disruption of the country."

As to the intent of the Roman Catholic Church to "dominate the United States," Mr. Martin has by no means mistaken. This is the policy of Romanism ever and everywhere. From the time of Constantine until now it has sought to gain control of and dominate the civil power. This has been its object and the standpoint from which it has carried on its work wherever it has gone.

But what shall be said of the professedly Protestant churches, and of none less perhaps than the Methodist Episcopal Church, adopting the same methods as those of the Romish Church, and seeking themselves to "dominate the United States"? Are the same methods any more commendable or less censurable when employed by Protestants than by Romanists? Why is it any worse for the Romish Church to go into politics, and petition for religious legislation, and lobby, and wire-pull, and seek to elect its men, and carry its religio-political measures, and thus dominate the Nation, than for Protestant churches to do the same thing?

That these churches have entered this arena and are resorting to these methods, everyone who is at all informed in regard to recent events in this country knows. The Methodist Episcopal Church took the initiative in the formation of the American Sabbath Union, an organization instituted to preserve the Sunday Sabbath by law. Wilbur F. Crafts, the founder of the Union, went to Washington the past summer to lobby in the interests of Sunday legislation. Joseph Cook, in the Union Signal, of October 20, tells what Mr. Crafts learned there "after prolonged work in the lobby at Washington for Sunday closing." And the Christian Statesman of July 16, gives us the information that "Dr. H. H. George, of the American Sabbath Union, and Rev. T. P. Stevenson, of the National Reform Association, did good service as Christian lobbyists."

The bishops of the Church in the fourth century sent up petitions to the Government praying that Sunday shows and like performances be transferred to other days, that the "faithful" might not be lured away from church services. The bishops of the Protestant churches have here in the last few years been sending up their petitions, not to God, but to Congress for the same purpose and for the same reason. The New York Independent of October 20, giving its reasons for holding that the World's Fair should be closed in the afternoon as well as in the forenoon of Sunday, says:—

But is the afternoon free? True, there are no preaching services; but what about the Sunday-schools? They are just as legitimate, just as important, as the service which the sermon constitutes. God is worshiped as acceptably, the truth is presented as faithfully, souls are influenced as effectively, as in the morning. Expositions are just as attractive to those who sit in the classes as to those who sit in the pears.

These churches have likewise undertaken to carry their measures through by political threats and intimidation and expressions of determination to control elections. In their petitions to Congress for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair they—

Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other that we will from this time henceforth refuse to vote for or support for any office or position of trust any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair except on conditions named in these resolutions.

And Joseph Cook in the Union Signal already referred to, says:—

In Boston, the first question asked a stranger is. "Have you ever written a book?" in New York. "How much are you worth?" in Chicago. "How much do you expect to be worth?" in Washington. "Do you hope to be re-elected?" The American people have convinced Congress that this latter question is of great and growing importance in connection with votes on Sunday closing.

And in this fight for religious legislation and the establishment and enforcement of the Sunday Sabbath by law these churches openly advocate the use of such political methods as are known by the term wire-pulling, as the following from the Examiner, a Baptist paper of New York City, shows:—

The present is no time for jubilation, but is, and we beg pardon for the phrase, a time for wire-pulling and hard fighting.

One of these political wire-pulling methods is the use of money in carrying desired measures. That this resort is not altogether unthought of by these Protestant religio-political church managers in their determination to exalt and enforce the papal Sabbath, the further words of Joseph Cook in the Union Signal indicate:—

In view of the vigor with which the right of petition is exercised by the opponents of Sunday closing, we believe that it should continue to be exercised vigorously by the friends of Sunday observance, especially if there should prove to be the slightest danger of a reversal of the action of Congress. We urge alertness at all points of the compass, for our opponents are not likely to sleep, and portions of the press of the country favor them from obvious mercenary motives. So does the immense wealth behind the saloon. But there is more wealth behind the churches and the respectable portion of society than behind all the opponents.

From this it would appear that Mr. Cook, whom the Signal styles "the worldwide advocate of righteousness," has already advertised that the churches are ready to go into the bribing business if necessary to compass their ends, for that is what the controlling of political parties and legislation by money is generally understood to mean.

Did Romanism ever do more? Were ever more worldly measures employed by her in seeking to gain control of and to dominate this or any other nation? Are not these "Romish methods" ever again? And might not Mr. Martin well have said that Protestant churches are bending every effort to dominate the United States and using methods which are aimed at the disruption of the country? And might he not have laid a good share of the responsibility in this at the door of his own Methodist Episcopal Church? Most of those in these churches who are carrying on this movement doubtless little realize what they are really doing and what they have already accomplished in their adoption of the ideas and methods of the Papacy in defense of an institution of the Papacy. But they will perhaps wake up to the fact some day that in this they have simply been playing into the hands of Rome, but not, we fear, until it is too late to make amends and recover the once prized and much lauded boon of American liberty and freedom in matters of conscience. The following, we believe, sets forth the matter in its true light:—

God's word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures, in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectfully she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the Word of God will hereby incur reproach and persecution.
