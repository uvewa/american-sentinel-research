This article, "Christ's Kingdom Not of This World," published on another page of this paper, is worthy of careful perusal. It contains, however, one serious defect, namely, the concession which it gives to the civil Sunday fraud. It is the Church and not organized labor that demands Sunday laws. This fact alone shows the reason for the demand to be religious and not civil. Baptism should not be deceived into giving their support to religious legislation, in order to provide it in masquerade under some other name.

The decision of the General Term of the City Court that a contract for excursion transportation to be carried out on Sunday is void, emphasizes the fact that Sunday is more than a merely civil day, and that the purpose of the Sunday law of the State of New York is to recognize that it day as more than a holiday. The courts thought so, too, because otherwise the public morals demanded that the contract made for service to be rendered on the Fourth of July or on Thanksgiving Day, a transportation company failing to furnish transportation on either of those days, as stipulated, would be mulcted in heavy damages. This shows that Sunday stands on civil and permanent decay since a civil statutes; and that, because of its religious character.

But perhaps the most pertinent feature of this decision is that while the transportation company was released from the contract because of the moral character of the day, there was no refress for the men who had expended their money to go on the excursion. It thus appears that in the eyes of the courts of this State and city, the observance of Sunday is a matter of much more importance than honesty between man and man.

When the Saviour, the Son of God, was asked which was the great commandment in the law, he replied: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." The Lord Jesus Christ thus placed the two divisions of the law on an equality, as is also done in James 2:10, where it is declared that "whosoever shall keep the whole law, yet get offend in one point, he is guilty of all," for he has broken the divine law. But the courts of New York are more wisely, and in their attempt to administer the divine law, as construed by the law-makers of the State, have ascertained that though a steamboat company defraud some Germans who do not regard the first day of the week, yet, if by so doing the company refuses to run the boats on Sunday that is guiltless!
