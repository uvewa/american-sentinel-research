In the Northwestern Christian Advocate, of Chicago, of October 12, is the following:

Should cholera or some other disaster send a panic around the world next year and make the Fair a failure, our city would remain in better shape in human history than if, after the congressional millions are secured, Chicago is permitted to dragoon Congress and compel a Fair open on Sunday.

By this the Advocate evidently means that a scourge of cholera, so severe as to make the holding of the Fair an impossibility, would be preferable to an open Sunday Fair.

And the Northwestern Christian Advocate is a Christian journal.

Such a scourge of cholera would cause human sorrow and agony beyond computation. Yet such is an alternative the Advocate cheerfully accepts.

And the Northwestern Christian Advocate is a Christian (?) journal!

Such a scourge would close the probation of many hundreds of thousands of human souls. Yet the Advocate is willing that this should be, rather than their probation be prolonged with an open opportunity to desecrate the Sunday at the World's Fair.

In the Northwestern Christian Advocate a Christian journal!
