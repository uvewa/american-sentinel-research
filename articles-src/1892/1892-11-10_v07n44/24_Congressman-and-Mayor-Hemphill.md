In a note in this column, a few weeks ago, Congressman Hemphill, of South Carolina, and Mayor Hemphill, of Atlanta, Georgia, were thoughtlessly confounded. The records of the two men, in their respective spheres seem to be somewhat similar on the question of religious legislation. It had been understood, previous to the last session of Congress that Congressman Hemphill both comprehended and advocated the correct principle of legislative non-interference in matters of religion, yet he urged upon the House during its last session, the adoption of the bill prohibiting the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, in which it was legislatively decided that Sunday was the Sabbath. At his instigation the bill passed the House.

Mayor Hemphill, of Atlanta, was roundly denounced last August, by the religionists of his city for permitting street paving on Sunday, in Atlanta; he has now squared accounts with them by vetoing an ordinance of the Common Council permitting Sunday delivery of ice cream, etc.

Mayor Hemphill owns a controlling influence in the Atlanta Constitution, which publishes Sunday editions, and also has a large interest in the Metropolitan dummy line, of Atlanta, which carries seventy-five per cent more passengers on Sunday than on any other day of the week.

It would seem that public men, from the council chambers of the Nation to the chambers of the town council, whatever their individual practice may be, and whatever their convictions may be as to abstract right and justice in these matters, still feel themselves bound to respect policy above principle and exercise what Senator Hiscock has so aptly termed "wise statesmanship."
