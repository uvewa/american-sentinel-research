### THE MARLOWE THEATER.

The Marlowe Theater of Englewood is now giving Sunday night performances, protected by an injunction restraining the police from further interference. It will be remembered that when it undertook this some weeks ago, the churches invoked the police power of the city and closed the theater; and that a compromise was effected between a church committee appointed by a Sunday closing mass-meeting, and the managers of the theater, by the terms of which the theater was to close Sunday nights in return for church patronage the other six nights. The managers now claim that the church people have not fulfilled their part of the agreement, and that they are, therefore, no longer bound to adhere to theirs.

One encouraging feature connected with this last turn of affairs, is that the Baptist Church situated near by, instead of again calling on the police to close its Sunday evening rival, returned to Christian and Baptist principles and prayed for the conversion of the theater managers and their Sunday night patrons. Better late than never, but if this had been done at the start, the Sunday theater patrons would not be troubled with the suspicion that the appeal to the throne of grace was taken because the appeal to the chief of police proved a failure.
