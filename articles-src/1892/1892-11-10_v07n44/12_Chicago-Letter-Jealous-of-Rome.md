### JEALOUS OF ROME.

Dr. Martin of Grace Methodist Church, created some stir recently, by declaring that he would not attend the Inaugural ceremonies of the World's Congress Auxiliary, recently held at the Auditorium, because "the orator" of the evening, and the only orator, was Archbishop Ireland. Many sympathized with Dr. Martin and remained away, and it was noticeable that the meeting was largely made up of Catholics. Dr. Barrows of the First Presbyterian Church opened the meeting with prayer, and Dr. Harper, President of the University of Chicago, offered the closing invocation.

The Congress Auxiliary is held by Government sanction and support, and Dr. Martin and others are jealous of the Catholics because of partiality thus shown them. This jealousy, now that the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that "this is a Christian Nation," will doubtless ripen into a demand that the Government decide which of the contending denominations is entitled to the name "Christian" and consequently to furnish the orator on such State occasions. Should such a decision be made, and made in favor of the Catholics, the Protestants will have no one to blame but themselves, and should take with stoical fortitude the consequences of their scheming to establish Christianity as the religion of the Nation.
