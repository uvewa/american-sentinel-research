Among the rules adopted October 25, by the National Commission, for the governing of the World's Fair, is the following regarding Sunday closing:

The Exposition shall be open for the admission of visitors during the six months, commencing May 1 and ending Oct. 30, 1893, on each day of the week—subject to such regulations hereinafter provided for—except the first day thereof, commonly called Sunday, and on said last mentioned day the said Exposition and the gates thereof shall be closed.

The hesitation about touching this question, manifested both by the national commission and the local directory, is an evidence that it is felt to be an unwarranted assumption of local control by the general Government, and that the management chafes under the restriction.
