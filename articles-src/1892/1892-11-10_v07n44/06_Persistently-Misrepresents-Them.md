A GENTLEMAN in Kansas sends us the following letter of information:—

*Kansas City, Oct. 30, 1892.*

*Dear Sirs:* I notice that you state that the *Christian Statesman* has had nothing about the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, nor anything about the hearing at Ottawa, this State, August 4 and subsequent dates. I find that is not the correct statement. I am somewhat acquainted in the matter. He answered that he and his co-laborers always defended the rights of these people. He could be that "Adventists was easy bested the Sabbath laws." I told him the SENTINEL had pointed out these matters carefully and had written about it several times in his paper the *Christian Statesman*, and it seemed to me that he had not made such a statement.

Among the so-called orthodox religious papers not published by the Sentinel, the *Presbyterian*, that has really noticed any protest against the action of the State of Tennessee in the matter of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists. So far the *Christian Statesman* has had only twenty-five dollars which is an enormous sum, and what upon the subject. "*Mr. Crafts has had to justify the persecution.*" July 2, it had this:

Several Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee have been fined for working on Sunday, on the complaint of their neighbors. Attempts are being made to make this appear a case of persecution. They have been fined for violating the law, just as any other man would be. Religious persecution it would be to fine them or imprison them for keeping another day, or to compel them to attend services, or to offer sacrifices to some idol, or to forbid them from preaching. But it is not religious persecution to fine or forbid to for; the judge—

This is certainly not a protest against the action of the Tennessee courts. In so much for "Mr. Crafts does say in one of his circulars, that they were refusing to allow Sabbath keepers an exemption from indulgence to permit those who keep the seventh day to do private work on the first day, but the tenor of his book is opposed to exemption. In the *Statesman* of June 16, 1892 he says:

The matter of legislatures and executive officers themselves has been a tremendous burden upon the history of the land. The purpose of the *Sabbath* is to over-history rather than over-state. In this country the movement to enforce a better civil Sabbath from being Sunday by special exception, allows seventh-day Baptists; by special exception, to violate any such exemption is the first step and if there be a good policy, the only constitutional or sensible one; and in enforcing the penalty for violation of the law and require them to rest on Saturday (unless their conscience should be so inconvenient as to allow them to do so Monday), suffer the loss of the profits of their labor on Sunday. This latter is the policy of Arkansas, Georgia, and Maryland.

Instead of reciprocating the generosity shown him by those observing Sunday, who allow him seventh day Christians expend a very large part of their income in missions and other good works, the free distribution of tracts, and the organization of the missionary society to propagate the doctrine of the seventh day; they only succeed in confusing the minds of the people, and in breaking down the fences of Saturday.

But coming more directly to the matter of the enforcement of Sunday laws in the South, Mr. Crafts says:

Another element of hope in the United States, says this from, religious enforcement has been kept up a fairly good Sabbath observance in most of those States where the people are very largely orthodox in religion. The record of the Southern Sabbath is the best outside of New England and one or two other New England States, the South has shown a stricter enforcement of Sunday laws.

And again of the law of Tennessee, he says:

From Tennessee, where, in 1884, there was extreme enforcement of Sabbath laws, a judge writes me that the change of a repeal of the law "is like the report of Mark Twain's death—a good deal exaggerated," and the conservative cities are where the conviction grows in the direction of stricter laws.

Evidently Mr. Crafts did not write such a view of securing this repeal of the law, or in the interest of persecuted Adventists. He cites from his book and from his paper, what conclusively shows that he has not the slightest sympathy with those observers of the seventh day who are opposed to laws which require them to keep Sunday also, and that he favors the observance of the seventh day, and in both his book and his paper has persistently opposed the liberty of conscience to any class. Nothing could be further from the truth than to say that he persistently defended Adventists. He was interested in Tennessee to wait in jail for the sake of securing sympathy. Neither is it true that they were fined only one dollar each; that was the nominal fine, but in addition thereto, the prosecution levied a bill of costs against each, docketed costs an additional fine of fifty dollars, and costs on the bill of costs, making a total of fifteen dollars for each defendant. Then in addition to the fines, there were costs amounting to about five dollars each, making a total of about twenty-five dollars in each case, instead of only one dollar, as Mr. Crafts would have the readers of his paper believe. As a matter of fact, only one of the four convicted men could have paid his fine and costs, had he been so disposed; and they were poor men suffering for their religious practice.

They were poor men suffering persecution, and money, and "yet" Mr. Crafts, "persistently misrepresents" them—that twenty-five dollars every Sunday he collected at his own church. We call it religious persecution.
