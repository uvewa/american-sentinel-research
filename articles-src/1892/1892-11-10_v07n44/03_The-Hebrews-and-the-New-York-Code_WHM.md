ON Sunday, October 30, eighty-six employees of S. M. Levy and Co., cloak-makers, at No. 123 Prince Street of this city, were arrested charged with violation of the laws against Sunday work. The prisoners were all Hebrews. They were taken to the Prince Street police station and from there to the Jefferson Market Court, where they were arraigned before Justice Ryan. After reading the Sunday law to them, the Justice discharged them all, sixty-three men and twenty-three women.

It is probable that this was the expression of a personal animosity on the part of the person making the complaint. There is also an attempt to show that it had a political significance, as an attempt to secure votes for Tammany by intimidation. Whatever motive caused the act, however, does not reduce the injustice or the viciousness of the law, but that such motives as these may be attributed should rather call attention to the utter impropriety of the existence of a law which can, with impunity, be put to such uses.

Section 264, of the penal code, which Justice Ryan quoted to them, reads:

It is a sufficient defense to a prosecution for servile labor on the first day of the week, that the defendant uniformly keeps another day of the week as holy time, and does not labor on that day, and that the labor complained of was done in such a manner as not to interrupt or disturb other persons in observing the first day of the week as holy time.

All made the plea that they were accustomed to rest on the seventh day. According to the terms of the code, if they had not entered such a defense, and not only that, but that they regarded it as holy time, they would have been subject to the penalty of five to fifteen dollars or five days imprisonment or both.

By what right could Justice Ryan inquire into the religious belief and practice of these Hebrews? The same person who brought the complaint declares that three hundred more will be brought before the justice on the same charge. Can no one be found to present or hear a defense to these cases on the correct principles of justice and law?
