AN active agitation of the question of the Bible in the public schools is now going on in the State of Washington. This was opened as a Roman Catholic matter of the patronage and employment of the force of teaching in the State.

The origin of this was a clause in the State constitution which prohibits use of public moneys for religious purposes with an appropriation of any kind.

It may be that there will be an attempt to get this clause out of the State constitution.

The Seattle *Post-Intelligencer* credits members of the constitutional convention who voted for this clause with inserting the presentation to the people of the State education, as the people of the "the people of the education, it was simply to prevent State funds from finding their way into sectarian schools. Also that they considered its purpose was simply to prevent State funds to supporting Roman Catholic institutions." "That, they intended to prevent the State from interference in favor of one form of religion, by establishing its forms and doctrines in the schools of the State, or that they intended any State what they understood to be discriminating against any religious body."

What humbug, and what hypocrisy! Why are not the people told plainly what are the bare facts? They intended to concentrate and consolidate the State on the basis.
