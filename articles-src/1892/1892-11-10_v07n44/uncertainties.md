# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 44 (November 10, 1892)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text throughout most of the document.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Column 1
- **Line reference:** "Did we not stratify command you"
- **Transcribed as:** "stratify"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error. The context (Acts 5:27-29) suggests this should be "straitly" or "strictly" - a common biblical term meaning "strictly" or "expressly." However, the OCR text clearly shows "stratify" which makes no sense in context. Without access to the original scan, I preserved what the OCR provided.

### Page 2, Column 2
- **Line reference:** "those who sit in the pears"
- **Transcribed as:** "pears"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error for "pews" (church benches), which would make perfect sense in the context of the New York Independent discussing Sunday-schools and church services. However, the OCR clearly shows "pears" and without the original scan to verify, I preserved the OCR text.

### Page 5, Article attribution
- **Author:** J. O. Beard (initials at end: "J. O. BEARD")
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear signature at end of article. This author is not in the known authors list, suggesting a possible contributor or correspondent.

## OCR Quality Assessment

Overall OCR quality: GOOD
- Most text was clear and readable
- Standard 19th-century typography was well-recognized
- Few obvious OCR errors beyond those noted above
- Page structure and article divisions were clear
