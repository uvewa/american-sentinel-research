### METHODISTS COUNTED ON THE WRONG SIDE.

Mr. Higinbotham, President of the World's Columbian Exposition, and member of Trinity Methodist Church, was recently requested by his pastor to speak Sunday evening on the World's Fair. Mr. Higinbotham, in the course of his remarks, argued for an open Fair. Besides Mr. Higinbotham, Mrs. John A. Logan, another Methodist, has recently declared in favor of Sunday opening. These, and all members of the Methodist Church who agree with them on this point, have already been counted against Sunday opening in the remonstrance sent by the Quadrennial Methodist Conference claiming to voice the entire four millions of Methodists in the United States.
