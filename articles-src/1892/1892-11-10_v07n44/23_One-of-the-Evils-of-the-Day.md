One of the evils of the day is the declaration of principles by bodies of men, who go on to enact that no work or labor shall be done on that day, and who attempt in certain States, shall or probable work or labor except on a serious mistake. This study of the Bible era and be made to be made attractive to the little folks. But this can now be used by "politicians" to pick our pockets and desecrate all we value.

This thought is suggested by examining a work by Dr. Joseph B. Merrill, which has just come to us. This book has 48 pages, with stories, with its full-page illustrations at least two of the illustrations are really fine, and should greatly please any child. It is full of all wise will interest the children, and all fitted to be with moral principles. This book will suggest topics to the mother, and we have not the least doubt that the children might well be delighted with its contents.
