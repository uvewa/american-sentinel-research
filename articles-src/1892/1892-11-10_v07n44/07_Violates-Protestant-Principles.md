The Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden, a Protestant clergyman of national reputation very properly denounces the secret anti-Catholic society called the A. P. A. In the first Congregational Church, of Columbus, Ohio, on a recent Sunday he preached a strong sermon against it, condemning it on religious and on political grounds. In the course of his remarks he said:—

The proposition of the secret organization of which we are speaking is that Roman Catholics shall be disfranchised. But the Constitution of the United States expressly says that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Most, if not all, our State Constitutions contain the same prohibition. The thing proposed by this society is therefore directly contrary to the law of the land. As a law-abiding citizen, I can not do otherwise than oppose it.

The practical disfranchisement of any class of citizens in a republic is their practical enslavement. If they are permitted to take no part in making the laws or administering the government they are no longer free men. It seems to me a monstrous proposition to strip a large class of our citizens of the highest rights of citizenship and to compel them to exist as a subject class in the community. I am amazed that men of intelligence should favor such a policy.

As a Christian man I must also protest against the prescription of any class of men in the community on account of their religious belief. That this is contrary to the very foundation of Christian faith I have already tried to show. My Master is one who said, "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." Now if men are to be made free by knowing the truth they must be free to know it; and no kind of constraint or compulsion must be put upon them in forming their opinions. This kind of thing has often been done in the name of Christianity, but it has been done in defiance of all that is central and fundamental in Christian faith. When Protestants in this nineteenth century take up these weapons in their controversy with Catholics I am constrained to ask them who is their Master and where they learned their Christian ethics.

As everybody knows, THE SENTINEL has not the least sympathy with Roman Catholics; neither has it any with the so-called Protestantism that in opposing Romanism, violates every principle of real Protestantism. Doctor Gladden is quite right in opposing as un-American and unchristian, the A. P. A.
