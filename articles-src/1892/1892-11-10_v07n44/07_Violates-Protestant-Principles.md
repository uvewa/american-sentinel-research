THE REV. Dr. Washington Gladden, in writing on religious legislation and civil liberty very properly denounces the secret methods used by these religious lobbyists. In the First Congregational Church, of Columbus, Ohio, on a recent Sunday he preached a strong sermon against it, condemning it on religious and on political grounds. In the course of his remarks he said:

The proposition of the secret organization of the churches for political purposes, is such as the United States expressly says that "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office or public trust" under this Government.

Most if not all, our State Constitutions contain the same provision. To organize the churches for political duty is therefore directly contrary to the law of the State and of the Nation.

The practical Enfranchisement of any class of citizens or taxpayers on religious grounds is in direct violation of these fundamental laws—whether in making the law or administering the government it is the same. The attempt of the churches to bring a monstrous proposition taxing a large class of our citizens is an outrage upon the civil rights of every man. It is not just and it should not be submitted to without protest. It is not to state a subject class in the Puritan or any other sense.

It is an error to suppose that majority has an inalienable right. It is in itself unjust things the majority's right to rule, but the majority has no inalienable right to do evil, to invade the domain of conscience thus easily. The Government that has been set up by fraud, or force has placed at the head of a Government is a tyranny, no matter in what form and make no matter by whom it may be exercised. Governments are ordained to secure natural right, and any government that fails to do this has no right to exist, whether it be a government by one, by the few, or by the many.
