THE Africa which Livingstone and Stanley opened to the missionary and civilization, has already become the seat of religious war as cruel and devastating as any heathen slaughter for supremacy or for slaves. The Protestant ministers and the Catholic fathers have sown seeds of religious dissension, until now as a result of their missionary labor the prevailing religion is the religion of the rifle. A writer in the New York Sun, describing the condition of things in Uganda says that "politics is inextricably mixed up with religion, and the missionaries powerless to quell the fires of intolerance they have kindled."

So it always has been, so it is, and always will be, when use is made of religion to achieve political or legislative ends.
