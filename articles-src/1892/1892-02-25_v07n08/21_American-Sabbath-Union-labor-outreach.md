At the annual convention of the American Sabbath Union held at Des Moines, Iowa, some time ago, this resolution was adopted:—

> Realizing that the Sabbath was ordained for man, and that the proper observance of the day would secure to labor the one day of rest in seven, so much needed and so much prized by intelligent labor throughout the entire land: therefore, be it

> Resolved, That the president of this American Sabbath Union be authorized and requested to appoint a committee of one or three whose duty it shall be to visit as far as practicable, all local State and national conventions of labor organizations, and lay before them the aims and work of this Union, extending to them the right hand of fellowship, and secure, as far as possible, their co-operation with us in the work of preserving the Christian Sabbath and all its benign influences to our Nation and the world.

To meet the intent of this resolution Hon. L. S. Coffin, of Iowa, a member of the Board of Managers of the Sabbath Union and of the Brotherhood of Trainmen of America, has been selected to confer with all the different labor organizations of the country, and secure their co-operation.
