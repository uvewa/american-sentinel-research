# Derivation of Tennessee Sunday Laws.

From evidence adduced in previous articles as discrepancies in the Constitutions between the State of Tennessee and its own earlier Constitutions and the Constitution of the United States of America, and inconsistencies between the Constitution of that State is divided against itself, and that sundry provisions have been made that positively antagonized constitutional principles.

Natural justice is eternal and invariable, its expression will be found in abstract principles, axioms, in form and statuary, varying in application. These principles are not the development of a native reason or equity natural to the human mind and heart. Except for the gospel of Jesus Christ the concept "All men are created equal," and its necessary corollaries of abstract justice, could never have been developed into a potent force in human affairs, but would only have existed, if at all, as a dormant philosophical abstraction. Through the gospel came the first ray of hope to the downtrodden, oppressed, and persecuted. It was the gospel which first forced upon the minds of the ruling classes the comprehension of the fact, that liberty was something else than the privilege of the strong to oppress the weak, and compelled them to realize the universal application of the principle of natural justice.

preaching of his gospel did not usher in the reign of equal rights for all men, neither has it yet eradicated from the human heart the proud arrogance of dominion over his fellows in which man but merely resembles that Satanic characteristic through which the angels fell; neither will it have done until that day when His will shall be done upon earth as it is in heaven.

The doctrine of the enforcement of the precepts of religion, by human enactment, has been one of the earliest deceptions of that hypocritical Spirit of all evil, and by which he "said the transient blood of almost all the host of martyrs who have witnessed for the truth in all ages." Not this doctrine but its antithesis will be found in the fundamental law of the land of prophecy; the latest but born the nations, and the last. If then the State of Tennessee has embodied in its statutes the doctrine of the enforcement of religious precepts by the police power of the State, under authority of civil enactment, these statutes are a departure from that bill of rights in which the eternal principles of natural justice are expressed, in a language so complete that nothing need be added to it and nothing can be taken from it. If then Tennessee did not derive its religious laws from the gospel principles of government law which forms the nucleus of the Constitution of the United States, where did she get them? The children of that Constitution has been analyzed, in their full bills of rights,--at a stage in every case to be surprisingly interesting,--then from whence did they derive them? These religious laws are of foreign birth; the unnatural equity and justice of American institutions have a later origin and indigenous to Americans. Not American arms compelled them to human freedom, to natural justice, and to native land, which poisons her arteries, by direct inheritance, through her charter of 1663, which marked the initial step in the colonization of America by which is Elizabeth, by the Grace of God of England, France and Ireland Queen.

Walter Raleigh land and countries "not actually possessed of any Christian Prince, nor inhabited by Christian people." Thus in the first paragraph of the first governmental expression, in reference to North Carolina and the Continent is found again the error of the assumption of divine authority by human dignities, and by virtue of the same authority the letter of the law ignores the principles of universal justice and discriminates against the "heathen and barbarous" as having no rights which "a Christian" is bound to respect. Under this document it was also granted to Sir Walter Raleigh, to make all necessary provisions for the governing of this territory, always excepting that "they be not against the true Christian faith." Although under this great no permanent settlement was made, it first discovered and marks the point which inspired the adventurers who came to possess the land, and them from whom they claimed to derive their authority. The grant to Sir Robert Heath, in 1629, by Charles I, was similar in character, as is also the Charter of Carolina, given in 1663 by Charles II., wherein he grants to several of his courtiers who are "excited with a laudable and pious zeal for the propagation of the Christian faith" that certain country to be "dedicated to the all-powerful God," and that "being of some barbarous people, who have no knowledge of Almighty God."

And, in a still greater degree, further the purposes of those noble adventurers he grants to them, also, "the patronages and avowances of all the churches and chapels, which, as Christian religion shall increase within the country, isles, islets and limits aforesaid, shall happen hereafter to be erected, together with license and power to build and found churches, chapels, and oratories, in convenient and fit places, within the said bounds and limits, and to cause them to be dedicated and consecrated according to the ecclesiastical laws of our kingdom of England, together with all and singular the like, and as ample rights, jurisdictions, privileges, prerogatives, royalties, liberties, immunities and as free that whatsoever, within the countries, isles, islets, and limits aforesaid." To laws, free exercise and enjoy, and in as ample manner as any bishop of Durham, in our kingdom of England, ever heretofore have had."

This charter contains also a tolerance clause graciously yielding "indulgence and dispensations" to dissenters from the declared establishment of the Church of England, churches but confined in such language as to show conclusively that such an insubordinate element could be but barely "tolerated" and would not "but could not and expect to stand upon an equal civil footing with those who conducted the established ecclesiasticism. The conformist and the heathen are ignored as necessarily not having any civil rights."

The charter of 1663, granted again by

Not Charles II., to other of his courtiers embodied the same principle in words quite differently. In 1669 the so called "Fundamental Constitutions," were framed by John Locke (author of the essay on the human understanding), and adopted for the time as the law of Carolina. This Constitution contains fifteen sections devoted to the regulation of religion and religious questions in Carolina, beginning with this:--

> No man shall be permitted to be a freeman of Carolina, or to have any estate or habitation within it that doth not acknowledge a God, and that God is publicly and solemnly to be worshipped.

As the colony came to be sufficiently populated, a further section provided:--

> Every freeman and every one of every religious profession . . . shall be permitted . . . by the Parliament to take care for the building of churches, and the public maintenance of divines, to be employed in the exercise of religion according to their profession; but no person shall be of any religion, and the national religion of all the churches shall be, as afore said of Carolina; therefore, it shall also be allowed to receive public maintenance.

After laying down the rules and regulations of admittance to church membership, and defining the terms of profession which should constitute a church under this Constitution clause, the following broadly stated conditions of celibacy are laid down:--

> No person above seventeen years of age shall have any benefit or protection of the law, or be capable of any place of profit or honor, who is not a member of some church or profession, having his name recorded in some one, and but one, religious record.

The next step in the governmental process of Carolina was the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence in 1775, and the Constitution of 1776, but the code of civil practice prevailing under that charter of liberties as then, which have been quoted, being retained in spirit, and in some cases almost to the letter, although directly opposed to the principles of freedom of the Mecklenburg, with the Declaration of Independence and adoption of the Constitution of the United States, became the fundamental law of Tennessee.

About in 1790 Carolina ceded to the United States the Territory of Tennessee, and it retained therefrom of religious legislation passed under Church and State rule, and applied the doctrines of King Charles II., and others quoted, the statute, contrary to which the indictments charges that the defenders of the accused were constituted, which is to be found in the act of 1741 enacted by Hi. Excellency Gabriel Johnson, Governor,--and after the Revolution retained and made the Statutes of North Carolina, and incorporated in the laws of Tennessee.

The statute, in it is stated "To," in all regularized governments effectual care is always taken that the day set apart for public worship be observed and kept holy, and all and every person or persons whatsoever shall, on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety," "excluding all labor, hunting etc., is prohibited on that day.

In 1803, after Tennessee was admitted to statehood, the legislature passed "an act more effectually to prevent the profanation of the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday." This act was not different from its predecessor, except in the omission of some compounding verbiage and the addition of a clause intended to effectuate the intent of the act, in that one half the fine imposed upon the offender shall go to the informer bringing the action. These statutes are to be found in the laws of Tennessee, Scotts Edition, Vol. 1, p. 55, chap. 28.

These marks clearly the line of inheritance by which Tennessee came into possession of her religious laws. The history of their derivation is at hand, and the documentary evidence is in our own, still remaining in force, Statutes of Tennessee.
