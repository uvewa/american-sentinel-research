# Minneapolis Sunday Streetcar Decision.

The *World* of the 14th inst. remarks, editorially, that "the Minneapolis decision to stop the running of cars on Sunday seems to be very imperfectly understood in the East. It is in fact a war measure, an act of defiance in the struggle between the Twin Cities for supremacy." The facts stand thus stated:--

Minneapolis has a large and costly road--but Sunday, while those of Minneapolis have hitherto been shut up on that day. The determination by which the army of commercial travelers are transported from Minneapolis to St. Paul every Sunday night, is the encroachment of St. Paul upon the field of business heretofore monopolized. Of Minneapolis. Minneapolis wants its big West Side cable road for the examination of the one of houses it has decided to put on its commercial Sunday enterprise.

This is its explanation, and in it the *World* adds this: "The change signifies nothing but business enterprise." We agree. But the fact does not make matters one whit better. If they of council merely extended the conclusion that it was not proper to insist on the observation they were perfectly insisted on that one day, there would have been hope that the world for this would come to see and to trust that "Minneapolis and St. Paul --- Arnheads ought not to be permitted on any day. But at the same signification nothing but business enterprise" the very granting of the permission makes it only more evident that when Sunday laws interfere with business interests the people are ready to "go to the wall," but where they only affect the rights of the consciences of those they are firmly maintained.
