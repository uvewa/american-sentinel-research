# Shall Man Enforce God's Law?

Discuss the discussion in Atlanta, Georgia, for the past few months, on the subject of closing of all business in that city, the Rev. W. P. Smith is represented in the *Atlanta Constitution* to have made use of the following language:--

> It was a part of the public political law of every people, of what country God may reveal His will, that God's holy Sabbath should be observed; that a sort of "body of corporation" should take effect, and it is believed in good faith that it is a reasonable hypothesis upon which to base, that Congress, or the State, and Federal Government searching the seventh day as having been set apart was a day of rest for laboring persons for, not for one set of men, but for all classes of people; and, so far as all men are concerned, this is purely a matter concerning a purely a civil law, a purely a law concerned with moral purity. And here is its wording:--

> *The law of God is clear and positive; the law of the State is clear and strong and positive; this law of the State is in conformity with the law of God; and together they have established the first day of the week, or Sunday, as the day to be devoted solely to the worship of God. This sentiment is in accordance with the recognized moral obligation which is prominent in the opinion of the world at large, and the fundamental law of the world, in danger of evil and may become of no further avail; the penalty for its violation is clearly set in the pulpit and the press constitute a final appeal.*

The reference to the "only people of God" and to "rulers chosen by the Great Head and Ruler," of course means the Jewish nation, with God was the real head of both their State and Church; and since they are the "only" people ever had whose rulers were chosen by God himself, by what system of logic is it possible to conclude that a nation is or can be ruled should, in like manner, enforce the "chief doctrines of the Bible." If God did a certain thing during the theocracy of the old dispensation, is no warrant for a different dispensation and under a different state of things and no other State or Nation received from God the mandate. It is in itself an argument against such attempts, that if anything could precipitate a religious war upon this Nation, that would do it.

Put the fact is all this advocated by Dr. Fulton is Romanism. It is precisely the same principle which underlies the marvelous mechanism of the Roman hierarchy, and so need be to a careful.

But this it will not even surprising that in the same book on page 8, Dr. Fulton quotes the Blair Joint Resolution; also the Constitutions of the United States, and informs its principles. Every one of the State Governments known at that time. not in education, is in principle, Romanism, and that, if passed, it would build a new fortress out of the Protestant churches of the land, and would strengthen every Jesuit in the Nation, in precisely the same way that the Papacy was built out of the Christianity of the fourth century, that moreover, the Papacy in a far shorter period, while power is in their hand, upon the same professedly religious organization, and that it might, for a Protestantism of the faith, is simply to advise the bringing of religion into the control of the State, for a Protestantism in all its fullness, Dr. Fulton, is simply to advise Protestantism to strengthen the hands of the Papacy. When the teaching of the Christianity of religion is made compulsory in the church schools, the State will then claim and enforce the right to decide what is the Christian religion. What will then be called Christianity, will not be a matter for the conscience of each individual to settle, guided in its search after truth by the Spirit of God; but it will be a matter for
