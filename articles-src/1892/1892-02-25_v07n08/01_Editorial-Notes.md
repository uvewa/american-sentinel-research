# Editorial Notes.

CHRISTIANITY is a most benign thing. Christ ever rebuked the spirit that would call down fire from heaven to devour his enemies, and it was those who through sin have departed from him that have invoked the sword of civil power to compel Christianity.

KNOWLEDGE of good and evil affords no assurance of a greater love of the one or of a greater hatred of the other than would exist in ignorance. Our first parents do not found the devil well enough informed. The antichrist, although the arch-devil Lucifer may have the same intellectual ability and the same subtlety, and the disbelievers of the other side, but the fidelity of the saints and the disbelievers of the other side knows all hell. Unless knowledge plus the moral force I see locating in the gospel of Christ.

ACCORDING to the word of Christ, the civil power has nothing to do with either God or religion, or with offenses against God or religion. Religion is defined by Webster as "the recognition of God as an object of worship, love and obedience." Another definition, given by the National Reform Association itself, is "man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God." If he has no faith at all, and makes no pretension to obedience to God, that is nothing to the civil government, as long as the man conducts himself civilly. Neither has civil government anything to do with offenses against God; for himself cannot sin to him. man is responsible alone to God for the offenses which he commits against God. Civil government has no business to establish a religion, and then make offenses against it criminal; nor has it any business to put itself in the place of God, and presume to declare that an offense against the government *also of* God is an offense against God. How is the civil government to know whether an act offends God or not? The fact of the matter is, that just as soon as Sunday laws are investigated at all in the light of truth, or justice, or law, it is found that they are inseparable from an established religion,--inseparable from a union of Church and State.
