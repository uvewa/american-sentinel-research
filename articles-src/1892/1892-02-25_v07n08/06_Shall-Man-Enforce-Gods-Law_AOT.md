DURING the discussion in Atlanta, Georgia, for the past few months, on the Sunday closing of all business in that city, the Rev. W. P. Smith is reported in the Atlanta Constitution to have made use of the following language:—

> It was a part of the public political law of the only people of whom Almighty God ever made himself Head and Ruler, to observe and keep the Sabbath as a day of "holy convocation." Reducing this example of the Creator to the last analysis we find that it is a reasonable hypothesis upon which strong laws should be enforced by the State and Federal Government touching the seventh day.

> The Sabbath was set apart at the creation for holy purposes for man, for all men for all time, individually and collectively, personally and nationally, a positive law connected with moral principles exacting the public, undisturbed worship of God.

> The law of God is clear and positive; the law of the State is clear and strong—altogether sufficient—but a vitiated public sentiment tends to set aside the moral and legal obligation of appropriating one day in seven to the worship of God. This sentiment has grown to an alarming extent, until an institution which is prominent in the epitome of religious duties, and as sacred as life, and as old as the world, is in danger and may become of no force, unless the officers of the law and the preacher in the pulpit and the press combine to retrieve from thraldom this sacred institution.

The reference to the "only people of whom Almighty God ever made himself Head and Ruler," of course means the Jewish nation, while God was the recognized head of both their State and Church; and since they are the "only" people over whom God has ruled directly in civil matters, by what system of logic is it possible to conclude that a nation that is not so ruled should, in like manner, enforce the observance of the Sabbath? The fact that God did a certain thing during the theocracy of the old dispensation, is no warrant to man for attempting something similar in a different dispensation and under another form of government entirely. The Jewish nation, during the old dispensation, was identical with the recognized Church of Jehovah. And it must be evident to any candid mind, that God would regulate the affairs of a nation which was also a Church, in a different manner from what he would a nation in which his Church existed as only a small fraction of the whole number of people.

There is no evidence in the Bible that the new dispensation will produce a "Christian Nation;" but rather are we told that he sent his followers forth as "sheep in the midst of wolves." And the Master has further said to us, "Beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles," and "Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death, and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." This language would never convey to any one the idea that a time would come when Christians would dominate and compel their observances and beliefs by civil statutes.
