"Certain clergymen of Keyport New Jersey," says the New York World of the 16th inst., "have banded themselves together for the revival and enforcement of certain exceedingly blue laws that linger in the New Jersey statute book. They have decided to prevent the sale of newspapers on Sunday, to stop the delivery of milk and meat, to shut up the barbershops and cigar-stores and to lay an embargo upon the running of street cars on that day. Further than this, they have decided to compel all the people of Keyport to attend church every Sunday upon pain of imprisonment in their own houses, under an old provision of law which forbids men to leave their houses on Sunday except to attend church or a funeral."

In view of the facts stated in the foregoing paragraph, the World makes these observations: "The sensible citizens of Keyport should see to it that the remainder of the law is enforced. They should secure the arrest of every carriage driver who is brought out to convey his employer to church. They should close the drugstores. They should notify the doctors not to attend patients on the first day of the week. A little practical logic of that kind will quickly bring bigotry to its senses and remind it that we live in a free, secular country, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and not in a Puritan Colony of the early seventeenth century."

The fact that we live in the latter part of "the nineteenth century, and not in a Puritan Colony of the early seventeenth century," does not prove that the Puritan spirit does not survive, or rather that it has not revived. Indeed the facts stated by the World are proof positive that intolerance still lives. Moreover the existence of laws which make such manifestations of bigotry possible, show that the Puritan spirit not only lives but that it is strongly intrenched in the conservatism of the people, and their representatives.

The suggestion of the World that "the enlightened men of New Jersey and of every other State in which intolerant and un-American Sunday laws survive should unite to secure their repeal," is a good one; but this is more easily suggested than accomplished. There is a large and aggressive minority opposed to the repeal of Sunday laws and other religious statutes, and because of the indifference of the majority they are able to defeat all attempts to wipe out the Blue-Law inheritance which all the older States received from Colonial times. "The American State is secular," as the World says. "It has nothing to do with religion except to protect every man in his religious liberty. It has no business to make Sunday laws," but all this goes for naught; and not only are Sunday laws sustained, but herculean efforts are being made to secure in both State and Nation still more stringent religious laws, and a more rigid enforcement of existing laws. It is high time that the secular press ceases to pooh-pooh these efforts to enforce religious observance by civil statute. A generation has grown up who know not the meaning of liberty of conscience, nor the truth of the adage that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." The people must be educated along these lines, and this is the work which THE SENTINEL is endeavoring to do.
