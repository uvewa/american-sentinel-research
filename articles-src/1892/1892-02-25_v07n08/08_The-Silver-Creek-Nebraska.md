# The Silver Creek, Nebraska.

What right has the State to interfere with any man's worship, either for or against? And what right in good sense, has the State to say at what day or days I shall work or not work? All governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Every man has a right to think for himself alone. Let others mind their own business and keep hands off. The trouble is in a natural itching that most people have to hold or rule somebody else or to tell each one about other people's affairs. If some people, instead of trying to reform others from the outside, would try to reform themselves from the inside, they would do better.

This is good, sound sense. All religious laws whether relating to Sunday-keeping or to some other subject, have their origin in the habitual desire of the natural man to compel others to conform to his ideas. There is nothing in this world any more common than this intolerance.
