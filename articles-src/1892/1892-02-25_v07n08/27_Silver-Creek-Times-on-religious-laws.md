The Silver Creek, Nebraska, Times says:—

What right has the State to interfere with any man's religion, either for or against? And what right, in good sense, has the State to say on what day or days I shall work or not work? All these things belong to the individual to determine for himself alone. Let others mind their own business and keep hands off. The trouble all is in a natural itching that most people have to lord it over somebody else or to stick their nose into other people's affairs. If some people, instead of trying to reform society from the outside, would try to reform themselves from the inside, they would do better.

This is good, sound sense. All religious laws whether relating to Sunday-keeping or to some other subject, have their origin in the natural desire of the natural man to compel others to conform to his ideas. There is nothing in this world any more wicked than intolerance.
