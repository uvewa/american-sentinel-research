# Short Items and News Notes.

WE are sorry that a *Christian at Work* should have to make this statement as to the common law of the land. *Per Fas.* Perhaps true enough, "Fui," "Fio," "may carry the strength of an established religion and a state-established church; but not with the Christianity of Work. But passing this, we have just this to say on the subject, and in the briefest manner: Religion is a part of the common law of some States, but not of the Nation, and so is not part of the common law of the land. It is part of the common law of the States of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, etc., but even in these States only to very limited senses, as when the privilege of Christians is restricted to that of worship merely, as when the privilege to disturb the peace. On the other side of the question, also the courts have repeatedly declared that "neither Christianity nor any other system of religion is a part of the law of the State." This declaration has been by the courts of New York, later the same Court said, "If Christianity is a law of the State, then every church must have a sanction; adequate penalties must be administered for all." To make less coarsely calendar for any small doctrine in this respect, I might make say, as pointed out by Mr. Blakely, in his Church Reporter, and Other States have reached the same result, that Christianity does not pertain to its common law of the land which is expressly repudiated by statute. And when we come to the Federal Constitution we find no mention of God in it,-- not even in the oath. Furthermore, the eleventh article of the treaty with Tripoli contains the declaration--"As the Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion."

It has been to ostensibly stating, Christian people; we are not a Christian Government, as *Christian Work* claims its common law. So we retire the President's permission to resign, and also their question, and concurring with the *Journal's* permission to resign, and also supporting our position, we wish it a very good showing.--*Christian at Work.*

CURTAIN clergymen of Keyport New Jersey" says the *New York World* of the 14th inst., "have banded themselves together for the revival and enforcement of certain exceedingly blue laws that the New Jersey State statute books they have decided to prevent the sale of newspapers on Sunday, to stop the delivery of milk the next, and to shut up the barber-shops and cigar-stores and to lay an embargo upon the running of street cars on that day. Further than this, they are bound to compel all the people of Keyport to attend church every Sunday upon pain of imprisonment in their own houses, there is no old provision of law which forbids men to leave their homes on Sunday except to attend church or a funeral."

In view of the facts stated in the foregoing paragraph, the *World* makes these observations: "The sensible citizens of Keyport should see to it that this enforcement of the law is enforced. They should secure the arrest of every carriage driver who is brought out to convey his employer to church. They should close the drug-stores. They should notify the doctors not to attend patients on the first day of the week. A little practical logic of that

kind will quickly bring bigotry to its senses and remind it that we live in a free country, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and not in a Puritan Colony of the early seventeenth century."

The fact that we live in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and not in a Puritan Colony of the early seventeenth century," does not prove that the Puritan spirit does not survive, or rather that it has not revived. Indeed the facts stated by the *World* are good positive that it influences with evil lives. Moreover the existence of laws which make such manifestation of bigotry possible, show that the Puritan spirit not only lives but that it is strongly intrenched in the conservatism of the people, and their representatives.

The suggestion of the *World* that the enlightened men of New Jersey and of other States in which intolerant and un-American Sunday laws survive should unite to secure their repeal, "is a good one, but this is more easily suggested than accomplished. There is a large and a growing minority opposed to the repeal of Sunday laws and other religious statutes, and because of the indifference of the majority they are able to defeat all attempts to wipe off the law, the Blue Law idleness and the other States received from Colonial times. "The American State is secular," as the *World* says; "It has nothing to do with religion except to protect every man in his religious liberty. It has no business to make Sunday laws," but all this rises from a growing sentiment firmly entrenched sustained, but herculean efforts are being made to secure to both State and Nation still more stringent religious laws, and a more rigid enforcement of existing laws. It is high time that the entire press and every people took those efforts to enforce religious opinion by legal statute. A generation has grown up, who know not the meaning of the dangerous work that leads to the adage that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." The people must be educated along these lines, and this is the work which THE SENTINEL is endeavoring to do.

Under the title "Rights of Sabbath-keepers," the Chicago *Inter-Ocean* has the following:--

> Near Nortonville, Kansas, is a large colony of Seventh-day Baptists. Their children constitute the greater part of the attendance of a school district near that place under a vote to bond their district for the erection of a new school building; and in order to carry a bond election the voters on the day of election for Saturday. That the Seventh-day Baptists were practically disfranchised by the selection of Saturday as election day the *Atchison Globe* says the following:--

> The case of S. H. Billman *et al.* v. J. H. Free was a mandamus case against the county clerk, to hold in school district No. 12, in Atchison County, to vote on bonds, which came to the supreme court this week. Two main points were involved, the selection of a day for holding the election, and the number required for the carrying of the election where a majority--nearly two thirds in this instance--of the electors were Seventh-day Adventists, and the school district judge set aside the majority of the election resting in the district. Ques-

tion of election and the notices thereof was also in the discussion.

---

The *Sabbath Recorder* gives the result thus:-- the case was decided in favor of the plaintiff, the election being declared void for two reasons, viz.: "An election to Violate the Sabbath, or from their true belief, is violating the constitutional rights of Seventh-day Adventists."
