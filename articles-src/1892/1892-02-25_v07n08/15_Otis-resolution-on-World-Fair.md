A RESOLUTION has been introduced in the House of Representatives, by Mr. Otis, of Kansas, which proposes to close the World's Fair one day in seven, without making any reference to Sunday. Perhaps the framer of this resolution thought in this manner to shift the onus of discrimination in favor of a day of religious observance upon the World's Fair Commissioners.
