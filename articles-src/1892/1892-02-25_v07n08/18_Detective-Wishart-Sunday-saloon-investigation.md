DETECTIVE WISHART, of the Newark Law and Order League, has, it seems, been in very close attendance upon the saloons of that city, of late, during the hours of Saturday night and Sunday. He has communicated the result of this intimate-acquaintance with their doings, in detail, to the Mayor, Chief of Police, Excise Commissioner, City Attorney, &c.

Mayor Haynes, of Newark, when interviewed by a reporter for the New York Sun, said:

> I am astonished to find that a man who comes here to the city of Newark from Pittsburg spends his time on Sunday in saloons as he has. He is not yet entitled to vote in this city. He could not have got his information in any other way except from a personal examination of the saloons. I am sorry to find that he spends his Sundays in that way instead of going to church.

The Police and Excise Boards have "placed the communication on file."
