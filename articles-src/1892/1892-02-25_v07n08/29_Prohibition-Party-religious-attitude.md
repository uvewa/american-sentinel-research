Those who demand prohibition for religious reasons, because the liquor traffic is sin, and because it hinders religious work, necessarily stand committed to the suppression of everything that in their view is morally wrong, that is, everything that is in violation of the divine law; for it can not be denied that if it were the duty of the State to prohibit the liquor traffic because it is sin against God, it would be equally its duty to prohibit all sin. A good many people are beginning to see this, and the religious attitude of the Prohibition Party is likely to cause its leaders no little trouble in the near future.
