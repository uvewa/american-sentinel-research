THE Mail and Express publishes a "special" from Chicago as follows:

> A despatch received at the World's Fair headquarters from Louisville says that unless a provision is added to the bill before the Legislature for an appropriation of $100,000 for the Kentucky exhibit at the Exposition, urging the closing of the exhibit on Sunday, and permitting liquor to be sold on the ground, money would not be voted by the various Kentucky counties. There is a strong religious element throughout the State.

There certainly must be a peculiarly strong religious element to make so determined and united a stand for Kentucky Bourbon and the Kentucky Sunday. The commissioners have already granted one-half the prayer of these exemplary Kentucky Christians and admitted their whiskey; and as the latter half of the petition is found on investigation not to be inconsistent with the first, it may yet be that that will be granted also.
