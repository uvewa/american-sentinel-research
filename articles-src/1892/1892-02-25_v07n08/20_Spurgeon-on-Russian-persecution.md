Darkest Russia publishes the following letter from Mr. Spurgeon on the persecutions in Russia:

"MENTORE, Dec. 24th, 1891.

"Dear Sir,—I am not well; but if I had all the health and strength that could fail to the lot of man I should be quite unable to express my feelings when I read of Russian intolerance towards the Jews and Desenters. That this conduct should be sanctioned by a Church bearing the name of Christian and Orthodox is as sad as it is strange. The genius of the religion of Jesus is love, not hardness and oppression. Surely there must be thousands of Greek churchmen to whom the persecution of other religionists must appear to be shocking. Cannot their consciences be reached? The Czar is generally injuring his own country by driving out those of God's ancient people who have found rest in his land. No country can trample upon Israel with impunity. Jehovah is patient; but as there came a day for Pharaoh, so will there be a set time for every oppressor. In that coming day, when Jew and Gentile will be one in our Lord, may none of us have to confess that we were cruel to each other. Yours truly, C. H. SPURDENS."

This earnest expression of the genius of true religion from England's greatest preacher, just dead, is universal in its application. Why cannot the consciences of churchmen everywhere be reached, when they would persecute other religionists, or enforce upon them the acceptance or observance of their view of the requirements of religion?
