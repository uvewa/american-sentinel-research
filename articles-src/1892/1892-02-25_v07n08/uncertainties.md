# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, February 25, 1892 (v07n08)

## Files 09-11 (OCR from scan images)

### General Note
Pages 6-8 contain very small print in the short items sections that is difficult to read from the 300 DPI scans. Multiple items across files 09, 10, and 11 have significant OCR uncertainties.

### File 09: Short Items and News Notes (Continued)

**Page 62 (p.6), right column bottom - Church Temperance Society item**
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Very small type, multiple organization names difficult to distinguish clearly. The list of organizations may have errors in names.

**Page 62 (p.6), right column - District Whitney item**
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Text is very small and partially obscured. The reporter quote may have errors.

**Page 63 (p.7), left column - U. H. Peters item**
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Context of the Peters quote/letter is unclear from scan quality.

**Page 63 (p.7), left column - American Sabbath Union resolution**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Resolution text is in small type but more legible than surrounding items. Some words may be imprecise.

**Page 63 (p.7), left column - De Lancey Nicoll resolution**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Resolution text follows standard legislative language patterns but some words are uncertain.

**Page 63 (p.7), left column - Inter-Ocean editorial**
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Multiple paragraphs of small text with unclear readings throughout.

### File 10: Your Rights End Where Mine Begin

**Page 64 (p.8), left column top - "An unanswerable argument" paragraph**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Scripture references are clear (Luke 1:32, 33 and Luke 16:16) but surrounding text has some uncertain readings.

**Page 64 (p.8), left column - "A STATEMENT" main text**
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Opening quote and main argument are legible, but some sentences in the middle and end are uncertain.

### File 11: Minneapolis Sunday Streetcar Decision

**Page 64 (p.8), right column - "The World" editorial**
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM
- **Reason:** The opening quote from The World is relatively clear but the editorial commentary that follows has multiple uncertain readings, especially in the second and third paragraphs.

### Recommendation
Files 09-11 would benefit significantly from higher-resolution scans or a second OCR pass. The short items sections (file 09 especially) contain the most uncertainties due to the very small typeface used for these items.
