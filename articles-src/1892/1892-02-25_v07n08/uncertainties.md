## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 7, Line 301
- **Transcribed as:** "C. H. SPURDENS"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** This appears to be an OCR error. The letter is clearly about C. H. Spurgeon, England's famous preacher. The final "S" in "SPURDENS" is likely a misread of "ON" making it "SPURGEON". However, I transcribed exactly what appears in the OCR text as instructed.

### Article Advertisements (Page 7-8)
- **Decision:** Skipped all book advertisements and subscription information as instructed
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Clear commercial content not part of editorial matter

## Attribution Notes
- Article by "V. H. M." - Unknown author, initials preserved as given
- Article by "A. E. Place" - Initials "AEP" used in filename
- Several editorial notes with no attribution marked as "editorial"
- Reprints properly identified with original publication sources
