# Short Items and News Notes (Continued).

The Church Temperance Society, the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor, the Charity Organization Society, New York Sabbath Committee, American Bible Society, Society for the Prevention of Crime, Society for the Suppression of Vice, East Side Protective League, West End Association of the City, Before Club, Municipal League, and City Missions, have all banded together formally, in moral and material support, and have issued a call for prompt financial aid. The associations interested hitherto in the extirpation of the nuisances resulting from the saloons and such-like sport; but they leave the actual issue, and rise up against the religious attitude of Sunday observance.

DISTRICT WHITNEY, of the Newark Law and Order League, has in hand a case against a grocer who keeps his store open on Sunday. He has recommended the result of this investigation, together with the doings of the saloons of that city and locality, to the attention of the City Council through the Corporation Attorney.

A reporter for the *New York Sun*, said:---

> I have been authorized to say that fifty saloons have been in the city of Newark from Pittsburg; he speaks of the Sunday closing law being enforced there, and wants to know why the saloons in Newark should be open for business. He said he expects to be in Sanders in that way always.

The *Mail and Express* publishes a "great plan."

A singularly worded petition to close the World\'s Fair on Sunday has been presented to the Legislature. The visitors to the bill before the Legislature urged the closing of the Fair on Sunday; but the petition from twenty large Kentucky counties contains a strong element.

There certainly must be a peculiar fascination in the occupation of Sunday-keeping people, since a district so famed for Kentucky Bourbon and the Kentucky mint julep can be properly regarded as representing one half the prayer of those exemplary Kentucky citizens who sell the politics behind the Legislature, while the other half prays from behind the counter.

Jew and Gentile will be one in our Lord, may stay at rest, and let us alone to manage the matter of our own. Yours truly. U. H. PETERS.

This sermon of Peters is a representative of religion from England\'s greatest preacher, just dead, is continued in its argument. Why cannot the conscience of churchmen everywhere be reached, when they would perforce confess other obligation, or lower their view of the requirements of religion?

At the annual convention of the American Sabbath Union held at Des Moines, Iowa, some time ago, this resolution was adopted:--

*Resolved* that the Sabbath was ordained for man, not man for the Sabbath; but it was ordained for man to secure to labor the one day of rest in its seven, as the minimum of rest. Whereas, the tendency to secularize throughout the entire land therefore, be it

*Resolved,* That the principles of this great reform should be more vigorously than ever pressed; appoint a committee of one or three whose duty it shall be to visit the annual and state-wide annual conventions of all political parties in every possible way, and lay before them the aims and work of this great reform movement, and ask from each party, and major party, and sect, as far as possible, their co-operation and assistance in seeking through proper legislative channels to secure a day of rest for the whole people of the United States.

To meet the intent of this resolution Hon. L. R. Collis, of Iowa, a member of the Board of Managers of the Sabbath Union and of the Brotherhood of Christian Unity, has corresponded and is in touch with all the different labor organizations of the State.

The following is the text of a joint resolution introduced in the Legislature at Albany by Senator De Lancey Nicoll:

> *Resolved* (if the Legislature of the Senate concur) that our Senators in Congress be and they are hereby respectfully requested and urged to vote for, in any way possible, the passage of bills now pending in Congress, to the end that as well and every Sabbath after the opening of the World\'s Columbian Exposition in the city of Chicago, said Exposition be closed to the public, and that as an exposition it be restricted to weekday uses exclusively; and that any insistence on the part of officials having charge of such exposition to allow any business on the natural memorial of the Lord\'s day is an infraction of the compact with the American people; and requesting the members in Congress to favor no measures in further aid of such exposition which do not make certain that the Fair be closed to visitors, and without exhibit and as no exposition on the Sabbath day.

The following is an editorial in the Chicago *Inter-Ocean:*

The American Sabbath Union, of this city, is sending to Congress, from all parts of the country, a petition to keep the World\'s Fair closed on Sunday. They day it signaled foolishly their sympathy with the movement. In fact the high priests of the same denomination said that they were heartily in accord with the movement, and it was not denied that many of the clergymen have been conspicuous in advocating, petitioning and demonstrating for Sunday closing.

The sellers of beer and whisky are keener observers than most people. The would-be rulers of every body being still,--would make that day one of rest that if visitors and citizens did not have a chance for recreation along other lines,-- those visitors who come from far would rather go into any gallery than they would look at pictures and delicate fabrics and be instructed about the industries of the world.

The preachers who want others kept away from the Fair on Sunday, but do not wish any one to be congratulated on their new allies. It is to be hoped too, that they may get the new alliance honestly to help, and that they get a better understanding of the laws; themselves whether their policy which assures them will find out the truth in the matter.

It has been strongly stated, by those who would unmercifully close, that it is not fear that makes an exhibition of the public behind the legislature but to find out the truth in the matter. The *Tribune* is inviting itself and those from abroad to do just such amendments when it ventures to put them in its editorial columns.
