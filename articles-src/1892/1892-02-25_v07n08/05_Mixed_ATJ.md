# Mixed.

REV. JAMES D. FULTON, D.D., author of "Fight with Rome," "Why Priests Should Wed," "Washington in the Lap of Rome," and numerous other critics of the Romish nature, is perhaps regarded by the public, as one of the most firm and fearless combatants to the aggressive and ambitious designs of Romanism. Whether or not he is successful in these efforts to unmask the designs of Rome, or to make his burning words, he can but be convinced of his earnestness, and perhaps of his sincerity; but the question may often arise in one's mind, What is all this about? What is the Doctor really opposing? Is he opposing it? Is Romanism or merely? Is Romanism as it has been and, by its very nature, must always remain, the enemy of civil and religious liberty, and home of intelligence and religious liberty and home of intellectual and spiritual development. Is Romanism one who the perpetuators of this false, paternal system.

To fight for human rights the purpose of liberating the Romanist, is a noble work; so, let us fight for Romanism, to save and to reach those who are already spiritually and intellectually down, and who, therefore, are not the very persons who need our sympathy and rescue.

This, it must never be forgotten that Zwingli in Switzerland, Calvin in Geneva, Henry VIII. in England, and Knox in Scotland, all made the grand mistake of espousing the very principle of Romanism, even in their fight with the Romanist; and that, in their respective countries, they raised or retained the real Reformation. Romanism is a union of Church and State--a spiritual despotism. In the black record of the Papacy, in the loathful, and unwarrantable results of this union. To fight Romanism successfully, the Romanist must be taught that the United States, and the Constitution. United States is the only nation that has ever, even in theory, totally separated Church and State. The people of the United States are the only people on, as a people, have ever professed to discard the power of civil force in the matter with the Papacy, and with all despotism. It follows that the true Christian American, stands on a vantage ground in the conflict with the prince of darkness. He needs only to be strong in the faith toward God, and ever true to the principles of American liberty. He must not become a Romanist to fight Rome, for this is to fail.

Dr. Fulton has seemed to realize these facts at times, but in his attempt to carry the case he has become badly mixed. From pages 112 and 225 of "Washington in the Lap of Rome," quote the following

language would never convey to any one the idea that a time would come when with a Roman Catholic institution, children can be compelled to accept Roman Catholic instruction, and violence or horrors, then the State can at its own beck by the force the State has been formulating for many years.

> The law says no constructive services shall cease. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this State for all men.

The protection of the United States Constitution providing for religious liberty, expressly declares that no person should be restricted; that Congress should make no laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. This is the language substantially of the law of the country as stated by Roger Williams, who regarded the right of exercising religion as natural right, the right to persecute; and we would not accord to any man, woman, or child, or any party that is a right to God.

It is not only Americanism, it is not Romanism, but it is good religion, and good politics. But strange as it may seem, on the next two pages after the same book, and written by the same man, occurs the following:--

> Put this back where it belongs. . . . The Bible ought to be made a text book in every institution; it ought to begin in the State, in which the State Bible does for the State. "A he Romanists do not object to a fair tests them children."

Speaking of the ills, and vicious, and of the best things to bring, "We say children of the State. Give them religious instruction by giving access to the word of God."

In all of this, of course, as the correct place of the pulpit actually, the Doctor means that Protestant Bible, should be read by Protestant instead of Romanism to all, Catholic and children alike, in the State schools. He means that Protestant children, while they protest to be given by Protestants to all, or especially to the children of Catholics, to the State schools. And yet, it was only two pages back that the Doctor informed us in much enthusiasm and apparent sincerity, putting his words in large capital letters, that "the State has no right to recognize the Church," and again, that "this is the language of no discrimination and discriminations or preference." This same Doctor is now urging his preferences for the Protestant religion and the Protestant Bible, and that these, instead of being let "free" for the choice of every one, shall be forcibly taught in the State schools, and every two pages back tells us that this should be to respect what he does not claim, and likewise, and could have his children taught it. Vastly, Dr. Fulton's ideas of liberty, and of persecution, and of freedom from all discrimination, must be badly mixed. And the argument in support of all this in old pagan bias that religion is a benefit to the State. True, religion, supported only by the power of God, and taught only by the warm willing of the people, is a benefit to the State. But any religion that has to be taught compulsorily by the State, and depends for its support

upon taxes extracted from those who do not believe, is a curse to the State and to everybody else.

Again, Dr. Fulton says on page 227:-- Put the Bible back where it belongs. See that those to whom the nation has given certain instructions, so that they shall know the chief doctrines of the Bible. Let there be no discrimination between so-called orthodoxy and so-called unorthodoxy, let there be an equalized and non-religious recognition.

One can but really smile at this position that is designed to almost the same sentiments. Everyone knew that there is not one of "the chief doctrines of the Bible" that a host of so-called Christians, holding that different sects understand them differently. And this creates an insuperable, an absolute division between Catholics and Protestants, and between all Christian denominations, and altogether. Viewed in the light of past history, in the history of the men of each in the race of religions, those doctrines to all, and compelling all alike to support their teaching is but another form of the Inquisition, the Star Chamber and a host of others through history conducting our analogies, in expressive terms, "Americus" ought not to be permitted to do such a thing; would, as in the fourth century, engender such an antagonism and such sect, and such sectarian effort would be demanded to settle the controversy and those states would come to a climax, as they came then, in compromise after compromise, until, in its appearance after coming from the furnace of compromise it was still the same thing under a new name, and if anything could precipitate a religious war upon this Nation, that would do it.

Put the fact is all this advocated by Dr. Fulton is Romanism. It is precisely the same principle which underlies the marvelous mechanism of the Roman hierarchy, and so need be to a careful study.

But this it will not even surprising that in the same book on page 8, Dr. Fulton quotes the Blair Joint Resolution; also the Constitutions of the United States, and informs its principles. Every one of the State Governments known at that time, not in education, is in principle, Romanism, and that, if passed, it would build a new fortress out of the Protestant churches of the land, and would strengthen every Jesuit in the Nation, in precisely the same way that the Papacy was built out of the Christianity of the fourth century, that moreover, the Papacy in a far shorter period, while power is in their hand, upon the same professedly religious organization, and that it might, for a Protestantism in its fullness, Dr. Fulton, is simply to advise Protestantism to strengthen the hands of the Papacy. When the teaching of the Christianity of religion is made compulsory in the church schools, the State will then claim and enforce the right to decide what is the Christian religion. What will then be called Christianity, will not be a matter for the conscience of each individual to settle, guided in its search after truth by the Spirit of God; but it will be a matter for
