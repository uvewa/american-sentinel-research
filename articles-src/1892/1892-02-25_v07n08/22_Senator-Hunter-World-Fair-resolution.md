THE following is the text of a joint resolution introduced in the Legislature at Albany by Senator Hunter:—

"Resolved, If Assembly concur that our representatives in Congress be and they are hereby requested to use their influence with the Commissioners of the World's Fair, to be held in the city of Chicago, to the end that on each and every Sabbath day during the continuance thereof, it shall be closed to the public, and that as an exposition it shall be suspended until the succeeding secular day.

"Resolved, That we view with no little concern any hesitation on the part of officials having charge of this great enterprise, to provide amply against a national desecration of the Lord's day in defiance of a command to 'remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' And that we as a people may not incur the displeasure of the Supreme Ruler by encouraging their disregard of this sacred command in that respect, do earnestly urge our representative in Congress to favor no measure in further aid of such enterprise, except it be coupled with condition that the Fair be closed to visitors, and suspended as an exposition on the Sabbath day."
