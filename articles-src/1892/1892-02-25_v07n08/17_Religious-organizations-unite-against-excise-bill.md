THE Church Temperance Society, the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor, Charity Organization Society, New York Sabbath Committee, American Sabbath Union, Society for the Suppression of Crime, Society for the Suppression of vice, West End Protective League, West End Excise Reform, City Reform Club, Municipal League, and City Missions, have all handed together to defeat the excise bill now before the Legislature, and have issued a call for prompt financial aid. This is a remarkable array of organized forces. If they were honestly directed for the extirpation of the saloon and liquor evil, they would command respect; but they leave the actual issue, and rise up to tilt at a shadow and not to accomplish any reform.
