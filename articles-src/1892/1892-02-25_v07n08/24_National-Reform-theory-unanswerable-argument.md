An unanswerable argument against the National Reform theory that Christ is now this world's king, or that he can become such by political action, is found in the fact that his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom (Luke 1:32, 33); and that the subjects of the kingdom will all be immortal. Luke 20:35, 36. Man can not bring this to pass, but "the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this."
