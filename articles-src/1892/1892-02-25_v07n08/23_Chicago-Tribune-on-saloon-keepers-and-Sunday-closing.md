THE following is an editorial in the Chicago Tribune of February 2:—

The American Secular Union, of this city, is endeavoring to have the World's Fair kept open on Sunday. Seeing the saloon keepers working on that day it imagined foolishly their sympathies would be with it in its labors, and hence appealed to them for aid. Much to their surprise the saloon men said that they were heartily in accord with the movement to close the Fair Sunday, which so many clergymen have been conspicuous in advocating, because if it were open their business would suffer.

The sellers of beer and whiskey are keener sighted than those ministers who have said that the opening of the World's Fair to visitors Sunday—the machinery being still—would make that day one of riot and drunken revelry. The saloon keepers know that if visitors and citizens did not have a chance to go to the Fair the consumption of liquor would be increased enormously and that those who otherwise would look at pictures and delicate fabrics and the fine work of the jewelers would haunt the barrooms.

The preachers who want others kept away from the Fair because they do not wish to go are to be congratulated on their new allies. It is to be hoped that when they see the saloon keepers rallying to their side so enthusiastically they will begin to ask themselves whether the policy which secures them such friends must not be a mistaken one.

It has been strongly stated, by those who would secure Sunday closing, that it is not true that saloon men are in favor of it. Here is a good opportunity to find out the truth in the matter. The Tribune is a leading daily and it must have some ground for such statements when it ventures to put them in its editorial columns.
