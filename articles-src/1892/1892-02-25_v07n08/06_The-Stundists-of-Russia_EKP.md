# The Stundists of Russia.

For two hundred years and more Russia has been the broadest field of a host of sects, large and small. Notwithstanding the policy of uniformity which, according to the ideal of Czar Nicholas, aims at a condition "one Czar, one tongue, and one church for all the Russians," the "Baptists," or religious schism has prospered and the State of the Stundists of Russia.

The history of this disaster can be understood only as the outcome of a combination of the most diverse factors and forces. It is the peasantry who is nearly each and every case constitute these millennium congregations. In reality there is no middle class in Russia, Russia is divided into the nobility and the peasants. The trades and business are recruits from the ranks of the peasants. In harmony with this state of affairs is the further fact that the organization of religious dissent has never been on the basis of doctrinal difference. The present growth of religious schisms, especially the development of the Stundist movement, can be relatively explained only when the social effect of the emancipation of the serfs and its resulting conditions is taken into account. By its act several million servitors, practically slaves, became freeholders, who, when delivered from the oppression of superiors, were also at the same time compelled to, for their own making, provide for their own support, and manage their own affairs. Of this new movement, or less directly resulting from this social revolution, that of the Stundists is the most important. Their name points to a German origin, and the coloured impulse to the organization of the communities came from the German colonists of Southern Russia, although the Stundists, for the main, are Russians. These colonists of the Southern Steppes became acquainted to the truth and were of them first, and they really lived called "Stundler," or "Stunde" (to piety, study, devotion, and worship; their first the name Stundists was given as a term of reproach). But these Germans were industrious and sober, and it is true with material prosperity, and did their piety, that was the first and being the first impulse given for the Stundist agitation among the Russian farmers. The more sober minded recognized the necessity of a reformation in principles and morals as an absolute requisite to success and prosperity. And in the laudable origin of the movement is found the explanation of the character. The Stundists' agitation is, to

stampede on Sunday, then they can in a lifetime of trying to legislate away the civil rights of American citizens. The Church to-day needs more of the power of God and less of the power of the State, and then she would have more power with the people, and the little steeple-houses down in the road would not disturb the church on the hill.

E. K. PLACE.

The movement has spread with wonderful rapidity. The Russian passport of 1877 reported then a membership of 30,000, and in 1881 a membership of 400,000. A careful estimate can claim fully one million adherents at present. Pastor Dalton, who has been a Protestant preacher in St. Petersburg for many years, in a work on the Church of Russia, first published, claims no millions for the Stundists. The Established Church has regularly appointed missionaries to work among the Stundists and bring back the "heretics" to the Mother Church. The result has been a dismal failure, and that for no other reason than that the Stundists are morally, intellectually, and religiously by far the superiors of their opponents. These methods having failed, blind brute force is being applied at the demand of the ecclesiastical authorities. One of the clearest lessons of history is that the blood of the martyr has been the seed of the church. The same is proving to be true in the case of the Stundists. Bible-reading is prohibited, yet the movement is spreading as never before.--*Christian Welt, Leipsig, 1891.*
