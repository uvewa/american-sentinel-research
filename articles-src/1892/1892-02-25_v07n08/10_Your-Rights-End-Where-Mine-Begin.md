# Your Rights End Where Mine Begin.

An unanswerable argument against the National Reform argument that Christ is now the world's king, or that he can become such by political action, is found in the fact that he did proclaim his intention in establishing an everlasting and universal kingdom (Luke 1:32, 33), and yet the subjects of the kingdom (Luke 16:16), and bring life to pass, but "the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform it."

A STATEMENT that is quite often made, and which seems to be considered of much weight, by the workers for religious legislation is that "your rights end where mine begin." This statement has not a particle of truth in it as applied to the right of expressing in living arrangement assumption of all rights. For if your rights end where mine do begin, and wherever there that may be, there your rights must cease. The truth of the matter is that rights are personal; they begin where every individual begins; and end only where sins end.

CURTAIN clergymen of Keyport New Jersey" says the *New York World* of the 14th inst., "have banded themselves together for the revival and enforcement of certain exceedingly blue laws that the New Jersey State statute books they have decided to prevent the sale of newspapers on Sunday, to stop the delivery of milk the next, and to shut up the barbershops and cigar-stores and to lay an embargo upon the running of street cars on that day. Further than this, they are bound to compel all the people of Keyport to attend church every Sunday upon pain of imprisonment in their own houses, there is no old provision of law which forbids men to leave their homes on Sunday except to attend church or a funeral."

Those who would punish people for religious reasons, because the liquor interest is precisely the same. It demonstrates that those who would be honest to insulate themselves unavoidably stand committed to the suppression of everything else that is in reality sinful, namely, that it, everything that is in violation of the divine law; for it can be denied that it were the business of the State to prohibit the liquor traffic for the reasons urged against it, it would be equally its duty to prohibit all sin, and the religious attitude of the Prohibition Party is likely to be unable to come to pass as little truth as in the future times.
