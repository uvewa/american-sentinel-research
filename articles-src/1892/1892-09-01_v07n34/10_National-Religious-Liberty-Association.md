The ministers of Freeport, Ill., are now engaging in a vigorous enforcement of the statute requiring all kinds of business to shut on Sunday, and are waging the crusade through the city.

The *Cincinnati Post* publishes a long and interesting article from one of its regular contributors from the pen of a German contributor, narrating the arrest in Tennessee of men for work, who on a day the civil law or what is to what denomination the clergyman he belongs.

Some excitement upon this question of Sunday closing at one meeting was caused. One church sent has taken on a folder and has taken the trouble to report in regard to it an elaborate manner. Whether this is intended as a favor, “warning” or threat, remains to be seen.

The *Chicago Evening Journal* says:—

If any one supposes that the American Sabbath Union and the other organizations that are trying to enforce Sunday by law have completed their labors because Congress has ordered a close of the Exposition gates on Sunday they are greatly in error.

The *Journal* then publishes at some length the plans of their different organizations for the enforcement of the Sunday closing of saloons along with the Sunday closing of saloons.

If these organizations consider that they have the Sunday laws already on the statute books, and all that remains now is to have them enforced.

“President McKey of the Law and Order League has the following programme: The Park Commissioners to transfer the Park. Park is in City to City Hall yesterday to assist the police in keeping the Exposition grounds closed on Sunday. They are pledged to do this. They will next ask the mayor, acting on the matter, the Sunday concerts were a desecration. They will ask the mayor to prohibit them. All these things are secured any assuring by decorum will about the same course.

The *Catholic Mirror* says of the action of Congress:—

Surprising it is that when so, those who are in the cause that the course they must upon will be in the interest of common sense and Christianity; the way, they will see in the system which forms the civil law.

“The blunder on the part of Congress is to put the closing of the World’s Fair on religious grounds. The members of Congress simply had not the courage to resist the pressure brought upon them through petitions claiming to represent millions of names with a secret feeling of shame for their own want of an honest outspoken courage.”

The *Catholic Mirror* understands the origin of the Sunday institution. It knows it is a Catholic institution according to the views of its originators. It knows it is the mark of Catholic authority that has no warrant in the Scriptures. It knows that it is quite out of line with all the reasons of the enforced observance of the Sunday institution. Those who would lay the foundation head of Sunday authority and learn its Catholic origins should consult with the Mirror.

This corresponding Secretary of the American Sabbath Union issued a circular as a newspaper of August 17, says:—

“In the recent action of Congress in regard to the Constitution, it has recognized a religion. The Government, representing all the people in a land whose hands had been entrusted the honor of the Nation, has accepted the terms, a public policy of
