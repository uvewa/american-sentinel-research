## General Notes
- OCR quality: Good overall
- Main uncertainties involved proper author attribution and determining article boundaries

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Article "To Be Done a Little Later On"
- **Author signature:** OCR reads "A. O. TATT" but likely should be "A. O. TAIT" based on known authors list
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - probable OCR error on last letter
- **Resolution:** Used "AOT" initials, noted as "A. O. Tait" in author field

### Page 5, Article "Inconsistency of Congress Closing the World's Fair on Sunday"
- **Attribution:** Article credited to "A. W. Hayden, in the Lansing, Mich., Grange Visitor"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear reprint attribution at end
- **Resolution:** Treated as editorial item with embedded reprint quote

### Page 6, Last word in Millard sermon
- **OCR reads:** "interst- t" (probable hyphenation error)
- **Transcribed as:** "interest" (corrected obvious OCR error)
- **Confidence:** HIGH

### Page 6, Article "Why Appeal Is Made to Law"
- **Author signature:** "W. A. COLCORD"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - clear signature, matches known authors list

### Editorial Notes Section (Page 8)
- **Boundaries:** Multiple editorial notes on national religion topic appeared to be continuous
- **Resolution:** Treated as single long editorial piece rather than multiple short items
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM - could potentially be split differently
