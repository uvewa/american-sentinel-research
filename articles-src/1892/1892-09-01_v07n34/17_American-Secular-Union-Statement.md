THE corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union, in an article to the Boston Investigator, of August 17, says:—

"Congress has betrayed the people. Ignoring the Constitution, it has recognized a religion. The World's Fair Commissioners, the corporation into whose hands had been entrusted the honor of the Nation, have accepted the bribe, a paltry $2,500,000, and the gates of the Columbian Exposition are to be closed on Sundays.

"The whole arrangement, even from its inception, has been a conspiracy. Bigotry as a unit has combined to attain its object. The victory is infamy. The traitors are already rejoicing at the result and dividing the spoils. The pen with which President Harrison signed the cowardly contract has been sent to Col. Elliott Shepard as a souvenir of success, a religious relic, and the American Sabbath Association, the National Reform Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, are congratulating themselves on the attainment of their object, and longing for the inauguration of the old puritanical Sabbath. This, it is affirmed confidently by gentlemen Craft, Wanamaker, Shepard, Quay, et al, is near at hand.

"The appropriation in its present form is an insult to the people, and the Commissioners should have indignantly rejected it. The liberty of the Nation has certainly cost more than two or three insignificant millions. If lost it can be assured that it will cost more than that amount to regain it."
