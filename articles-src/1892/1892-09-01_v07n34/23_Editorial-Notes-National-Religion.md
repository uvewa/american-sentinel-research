THE political and national profession of Christianity by the United States, in its governmental capacity, if practically applied, is likely to produce some very unique international situations. If the Government, as a corporate person, can and does accept a religion, it must, as a governmental power, go forth and preach it to all the world.

THE Congress of the United States has undertaken to enforce a religious observance upon its own citizens, and the subjects of all other powers as well, at the city of Chicago, upon the occasion of the holding of the World's Fair. Is this the beginning of a world wide effort by this Government to evangelize all nations? He who professes a religious belief, is bound in conscience to preach the truth which he believes, and sacrifice himself, his time, his means, his labor to present it to the minds and impress it upon the hearts of all men.

THOSE who have constituted and called themselves "National Reformers," and who originated this movement for the legal enforcement of national religion, which is now bearing fruit, have said:—

1. The Nation is a collective being, with moral character and accountability, directly responsible to the Author of its existence, God himself.

2. As such a moral being, a true moral person, it is under the moral law of the Supreme Ruler of nations, which includes both the law of nature and the revealed will of God.

If this Nation is such a being, endowed with moral accountability, and responsible directly to God, then, having made before the nations of the world, by a Supreme Court decision and by religious legislation, a public profession of religion, it is bound in honor, and the requirements of religious consistency, as well as in conscience, to actively evangelize, not only at home but abroad. In fact, as this is a Christian Nation, there will be no need of evangelization at home and the entire available force of the Nation, in men and money, capable of being mobilized, can be thrown at once into the foreign missionary field.

THE editor-president of the American Sabbath Union has evidently grasped some of these great possibilities, which this adoption of a national religion offers, for proselyting among the nations of the earth. He proposes to utilize immediately, in this great work our Secretary of State, the foreign ministers and consular service. But in the expression of this a remarkable inconsistency is developed. The Mail and Express, which, directed by the Sabbath Union president, has been, and is, the mouth-piece of organized religio-legal intolerance at home, suddenly becomes an active advocate of religious liberty abroad. This paper says:—

The Secretary of State has done well to make prompt demand upon his Imperial Majesty, Abdul Hamid II, for indemnity for the destruction of American property in Konin. But Mr. John W. Foster will do better by following that up with a demand that the Mohammedan shall grant religious liberty for the whole world. Here is an arena for American diplomacy which it ought not to hesitate to enter.

Certainly; here is an arena for diplomacy. Is Mr. John W. Foster to undertake this diplomatic task for the State or for the Church, or for the State Church, as a diplomat and a statesman or as a diplomatic State churchman? The idea of the Mail and Express very evidently is that while Mr. Foster has done commendably in a matter which was strictly within his sphere as a representative of the authority of the State, he would do still better, if he would assume to himself the authority of the State Church and demand something beyond the mere civil rights of the citizens of the United States resident in a foreign country.

IT does not seem to be the civil injustice which American citizens have suffered in Turkey that calls out this article. The editorial pen has been stirred to point out the exact spot on the map into which Mr. Foster should throw his gauntlet, his pen, and his prayer-book, that he might step into the ring to do battle nominally for all three but really for the last. The editorial continues:—

The constant persecutions kept up by the Turks upon every form of religionists except their own and the intolerance and false beliefs forced upon them by their own ecclesiastics, excite the abhorrence of all other nations, as well as their wonder that such things can exist in this Christian era . . . the nations should unite in conferring upon the whole Turkish empire the benefits of absolute religious liberty.

Here is a task for Mr. Foster's diplomacy,—to secure the co-operation of the whole family of missionary nations in securing compulsory religious liberty, within the dominions of the unspeakable Turk, for the Turkish subjects themselves, as well as for others.

After presenting in two considerable paragraphs the very proper claims of humanity, the article proceeds:—

The present seems peculiarly fit for insisting upon religious liberty, for the Sultan is vigorously threatened with revolt by his Armenian subjects on account of their religious persecutions; and the German evangelistic institutions are threatened all through the empire; and England has had many of her gospel endeavors frustrated and their establishments seized. Moreover, the Sultan's Greek subjects are desiring a better way, and even his Moslem subjects are confessing that there is something in Jesus superior to Mohammed.

Germany and England, at least, would seem to be distinctly classed with the United States as missionary nations, for Germany is spoken of as evangelizing, and England as making gospel endeavors which have been frustrated.

Is it the gospel of Christ that is preached by an armed diplomacy which points to its armies and its navies to enforce its requirements? They who take the sword shall perish by the sword! Can it ever be a fit time to insist upon religious liberty abroad and practice religious intolerance at home! England and Germany are State Church nations; they have accepted religion as nations and have assumed the National Reform religious status of true moral persons, with moral character and responsibility, accountable directly to God. They both consider it their conscientious duty to enforce legal and religious disabilities upon dissenters,—their own creed does not provide for civil freedom in religious affairs. In this, Turkey differs from them only in degree. It is evident that the Mail and Express is in error here. It would be an unfortunate mistake in the religious diplomacy Mr. Foster is urged to undertake if he should draw this "Christian" Nation into an alliance, for such a purpose, with hypocritical missionary nations whose home practice could be so easily proved to be directly contrary to their foreign preaching. Certainly England and Germany have not absolute religious liberty; how then could they "unite in conferring upon the whole Turkish empire the benefits of absolute liberty" which they themselves do not possess?

THE United States is to take the lead in this great missionary enterprise by which the moral being of the "sick man of the East" is to be regenerated. The last paragraph of this foreign mission editorial is an exhortation:—

Now is the time for this Christian American Nation to step forward as the champion of religious liberty in the Orient, and lead the way in such negotiations between all the Christian nations that they shall unitedly dictate to the Sultan the abandonment of his bigotry and the establishment of absolute religious liberty throughout his empire. This is a field promising a triumph to American diplomacy. Will Mr. Foster be courageous enough to enter it?

Will Mr. Foster enter it? He would know, as a diplomat, that it would not yield success if not in accord with the religion professed by the Nation. The United States has professed a religion. That religion is the religion of which the observance of Sunday is the distinguishing mark. The decree of court and of Congress has established this mark. Those who dissent are branded as disloyal and are subject to penalties. The State religion professed by the United States, then, does not differ in this respect from that of Germany and England. Neither of these powers could urge or attempt to enforce upon Turkey that which is contrary to their own tenets. Full civil freedom in religion is contrary to the theory and practice of all three of these powers,—to preach it to Turkey or attempt to enforce it there, would therefore prove them to be themselves in error in their own professions. It would not be wise statesmanship in Mr. Foster, to prove the religious profession of this Nation in error by insisting upon the adoption by Turkey of principles contrary to those in vogue here. Mr. Foster, as an intelligent diplomat, will not enter this field.
