No business authorize me, in any man’s name, with a condition by any matter of civil matter of law.

This provision covers all the ground, and would, if respected, by its far-reaching intention, serve put an end to all legal persecution in this country.

The immediate neighbors of the Adventists do not seem to have any grudges against them. The persecution was undoubtedly stirred up by persons not living in the immediate neighborhood, and was with the purpose of destroying the influence of the Adventist church establishment. It is the only church in this place; and with its working the community has entire confidence, and it excites the envy of others.

Before the recent persecution, measures were on foot by the Adventists for the building of a new house of worship. The work was delayed somewhat by the imprisonment of some of the members of the church, but that work of an era of liberty; work has been begun and the point of the lumber for the new building is now on the ground. They also maintain a church school for their children, and the next session, and have driven the one of their church building to the edifice, and they hold it long sessions of all full upon it is a few pages. This school is, of course, as is common among the Adventists, taught by a school of a private Adventist church, employed by a school venture, and will be conducted, as all Adventist church schools are, without any ventures; and will be conducted, as all Adventist church schools are, without any resort the public funds. The private schools that have just sprung up and which have any religious exercises, without special reference to the peculiar doctrines of all Adventists. The church school was patronized by parents and children of all communions, a number of parents belonging to other churches, and Adventists do not insist on carrying their doctrines and propaganda into mixed schools even where they allow them in their own. They are consistent advocates of religious liberty.—*Springville, Tenn., Aug. 14, 1892.*

WHY APPEAL IS MADE TO LAW.

Why Appeal is Made to Law.

of Aug. 11, 1892, referring to the closing of the Columbian Exposition, and what is to be done with the twenty-first section—the appropriation for the Sunday closing, says:—

Since Chicago is bound to be enormously overcrowded during the Fair, and the contrary considerations might be balanced. It was decided that the crowds, though not to say such extent as we could wish, in a manner adequate to every purpose. In that case, excursions from every quarter were required to find accommodation in the city.

This last statement is simply an admission that the great masses of the people of the United States would not observe the Sabbath if they had a chance to do so, and that consequently it is useless to attempt in any way, however earnest and sincere, for ecclesiastical action, touching the closing of the Fair on Sunday or Sunday observance in general, can result is it simply that which is ruled forced upon the people. Those professed Protestants who have been responsible for urging upon and extorting from Congress this action would do well to ponder the words of Martin Luther, the great champion of the Reformation, and the father of Protestantism. He said:—

It is with the Word we must contend, and by the Word we must refute and expel what has gained a place in the heart. Violence will not accomplish such as are superstitious; nor even those who are not superstitious, for an honest mind. Take a year and time; and do not think that abuses are done by abusing more. I have preached against it, and to controversy. I have let it simply to God’s Word.

But the most probable reason why force rather than the Word of God is relied on for Sunday observance rather than the use of the Scriptures should be made plain. It is that the fact that the Word does not contain what they allege.
