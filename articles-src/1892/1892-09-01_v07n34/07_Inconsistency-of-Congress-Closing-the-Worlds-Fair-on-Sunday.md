WOULD not the consideration due to the foreign guests forbid the closing of the World's Fair Sunday? Uncle Sam is going to have company. He has invited all his sisters and his cousins and his aunts to come and see him, and as they have not had a real good family visit since the time of the flood or the Tower of Babel, he has suggested that they bring with them the most beautiful and excellent things in nature and art that their countries afford, so that when ranged alongside the others, all may compare and see who has the best country, and the greatest people.

Well, suppose the guests all come, and Uncle Sam welcomes them to the immense buildings and lovely grounds he has prepared for their reception, and tells them to put their paintings and statuary in the art gallery, and their machines in the tool-house, and their stock in the barns, and to "come right in and make themselves to bum." All goes off nicely until Sunday morning, when Uncle Sam tells his guests that it is contrary to his religion to look at their exhibits on that day, and that he has to go to church and would like to have them go too.

But some pagan, speaking for the rest, says, "No, thanks; we do not care to go, but don't let us interfere with your observing the day as you think best. It is no more than right that everyone should have that privilege. We will just stroll about and look over this great show while you are gone." "Ahem, yes," says Uncle Sam, "but don't you know it is contrary to my creed to allow any one else to look at such things Sunday? I have to lock up the horse barn and the cattle sheds, and the tool-house, and the art galleries and everything, and take the keys to church with me." And the astonished pagan says, "Why, how is this? Whose show is this, anyway? You don't say that we can't even look at the jewels and the pictures and the statues and ten thousand other things that we have brought here ourselves and that belong to us?" "Oh, no," says Uncle Sam, "it would not be right to do it, you know the Bible says we must observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy." "But," says the pagan, "who is going to desecrate the Sabbath? Is there anything unholy in looking at this collection of the most wonderful and beautiful things ever made by God or man? And as to your Bible," says the now irate heathen, "we have no objection to your believing it and conforming to its ceremonies, but where did you get the right to insist that others who do not believe it should conform to them also? And what will we all do while you observe your Sabbath if you shut up the house and carry off the keys?" "Why," says Uncle Sam, "you can sit on the front steps or go down into the parks if you will 'keep off the grass,' and amuse yourselves until I get around." And as he departs the unregenerate heathen swears by Buddha, Brahma, Confucius, or Zoroaster, as the case may be, that he never heard of that way of entertaining company before, and adds, "Hurrah, boys, let's go down and paint the town red."—A.
