The theory of legislation upon religious duties and questions is radically opposed to the teaching of the Scriptures of divine truth, which plainly declare “let every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” Rom. 14:12.

This text plainly asserts our accountability to God. From other scriptures we learn the scope of this accountability. We must, by inference, first, to our duty toward God; and second, our duty toward men. The first and great commandment in the law is, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;” and the second is like unto it, “Thou shalt love the neighbor as thyself.” And not only that, with these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

But while we have duty toward our fellow-men, failure to perform that duty is not, as we sometimes loosely say, in itself a violation of civil law. It is not in God’s law that defines our duty toward our fellow-men, and the violation of that law is a violation of civil law; but according as says the apostle, “transgressors also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.”

The divine law, of course; and this brings to us the truth that we are responsible to God—the divine law. “I have sinned, and done this evil in thy sight.” The wrong was done to man; the sin was against God; and to God the account must be given. “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.” But our sins against God we cannot present for the civil court, and our wrongs to our fellow men. ALL SIN being against God, “Thou shalt not” etc. And He it is who “shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or evil.”

God is the great and only moral governor. And to the great and only moral governor man is morally responsible. In the very nature of the case, to permit any power whatever to come between him and God would be to destroy individual responsibility to God.

But man is a social as well as a moral being, and as such it is endowed with certain inalienable rights; to him God has committed the preservation of these rights by means of civil government. This is in fact the expression in the American Declaration of Independence—

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

To disregard these rights or to trample upon them, therefore, is the only thing that is to sin against God. The sin, if not repented of and forgiven, the will of God is in his own time; the strong may be dealt with if you follow me; that self-imposed capacity as a State. And it is this fact that restrains from deeds of violence and injustice, many who have not the fear of God before their eyes. This safeguard to life and liberty is civil government. The is to help and natural rights, the God who in this nature has given just one law upon an equal, has given to each. In submission also to the Saviour, and an obedience to his law; while to the righteous and to them the appeal to conscience and of feeling, they are exercised alike by and for Jew and Gentile; and so far as this obedience to civil government is not in any sense dependent upon any religious establishment or creed. The power of civil government is given, like marriage, for the good of the

—and this was not an arbitrary arrange on the part of the Creator, but for wise and beneficent reasons which we can readily discern and comprehend. God committed to men, not the administration of the divine law, but the administration and maintenance of those rights which reason teaches that all individuals should justly enjoy in common; those self-evident rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, rights not peculiar to a Protestant Christian, and communion of any other religious sect, but common to all of their fellowship the heritage of duties due from every one to all. The divine law was divine law as regards the divine law in which being subject to we can see much, it would have destroyed moral responsibility to God. By the same token, had God not committed to men the power to regulate in some manner their civil affairs in order that their natural rights might be protected from those who have not the fear of God, one of two things would have followed—either all would be criminals, or all would still remain to obtain the very design of God in making man a free moral agent, so far as his moral nature, and so long delegated as to afford no protection against crime; or the Creator would assume in himself the preservation of every necessity that man should be the guardian of the temporal concerns of this world; but that this would in no way abridge all the individual moral responsibility to the Creator. Nor should men make it a pretext for assuming sovereign authority which belongs alone to God.

That the principles here stated in the correct and only true relation, is clear from the words of Christ when the Pharisees sought to entangle him in his talk. They said unto him, “Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cesar, or not?” But he understanding their wickedness, said, “Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Cæsar’s. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.”

In this, Christ plainly recognized the distinction between civil and moral. The paying of tribute was simply a civil duty. They were living under Cæsar’s government; that government was their contribution to the support of the government; and yet the word was an absolute one. He did not say, If the demands of government are just, pay tribute; but, in some cases render unto Cæsar. It was for this reason that Christ said, “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s.” Matt. 17:24-27.

But notwithstanding the fact that civil government is not Christian, the Christian is obligated to the civil government; though he is not a part of it. He should be loyal to the government, subject in all civil things, render to it freely all tribute—and hold himself unceasingly obedient to the powers that be, for the civil duties are the very object of civil government. Says an authority here, he has nothing to do with it in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.

Quietness and peace are essential to the enjoyment of those inalienable rights which are the endowment of the Creator and the object of the institution of government. It is essential to the pursuit of happiness, which the Declaration of Independence declares to be one of those inalienable rights which governments are instituted among men to preserve. It is the Christian’s true attitude toward civil government.

The Christian, being thus a true citizen toward every civil, rendering to Cæsar the things which are the things that are Cæsar’s and unto God the things that are God’s. But there is another class to whom the civil power belongs to. He, who would render to God all things which belong to God, to absolutely independently of any human legislation. It is in man’s nature to be allegiance must be paid to God. And as a matter of history, we find that this class has always been in conflict with the authority of the civil government. The command of God. This was the case with the three Hebrews in Babylon, for their allegiance to the commands of God. This was the case with the three Hebrews in Babylon; they were commanded to worship the golden image set up in the plain of Dura, a law of the empire. Daniel was forbidden to pray to any god for thirty days, and he continued faithful. It was also the case with the Christians under pagan Roman empire, disobeyed a law of the empire. In all these cases, and in every similar case, who, commanded by the authority of civil government to do what conscience said was wrong, disobeyed the civil government because of religious convictions. Whether he is right in the sight of the civil power or not, is a thing which no earthly state-God, judge, ye. For we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard, and we must obey God rather than men.

In all these cases the civil rulers sought to compel religious observance by civil law, and the servants of God refused to render unto Cæsar the things which belonged to God. And they took the punishment inflicted, protesting, however, their innocence while declaring bodily their purpose as to God of God. They were suffering in Cæsar’s hands for that which belonged to God.

God in his own good time brought the followers of Christ over assisted cheerfully, and as a matter of history they never lost their spiritual power and influence, though their temporal influence was somewhat cut off. They have consistently adhered to the teaching upon this subject to all Christ’s followers, and as the most conspicuous example in history—that of a free nation, year a. h. 310, the most perfect religious freedom that ever existed among any
