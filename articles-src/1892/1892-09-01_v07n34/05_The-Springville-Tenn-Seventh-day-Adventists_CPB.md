The people of this quiet neighborhood pursue the even tenor of their way. The postmaster at this place was quite right in saying that the Adventists still work on Sunday. And yet the work is done so quietly that very little of it is seen except by those who are on the lookout for it. The Adventists desire to avoid if possible giving offense to their neighbors; but they will not surrender their consciences into the keeping of anybody.

The Adventists believe that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between the seventh day of the week and all other days, and that it is their duty to respect that difference. They feel that they have no right to habitually abstain from secular labor and business on any day of the week except the seventh day, and that to do so would be a violation of the law of God. Thus their Sunday work is as much a matter of conscientious conviction as their Sabbath rest.

The fact that the Adventists are conscientious in working on Sunday makes their prosecution for such work a palpable violation of the constitution of the State. That instrument provides that—

No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.

This provision covers all the ground, and would, if respected by the courts, at once put an end to all legal persecution in Tennessee.

The immediate neighbors of the Adventists do not seem to have any feeling against them. The persecution was undoubtedly stirred up by persons not living in the immediate neighborhood, and was for the purpose of destroying the influence of the Adventist church and checking its growth. It is the only church in this part of the country that is in a really prosperous condition, and this excites the envy of other churches.

Before the recent persecution, measures were set on foot by the Adventists for the building of a new house of worship. The work was delayed somewhat by the imprisonment of some of the members of the church, but now that all are again at liberty, work has been begun and the most of the lumber for the new building is now on the ground. They also maintained a church school for several months this season, and have given the use of their old church building to the district for school purposes, and a public school will open in it in a few days. This school is to be taught by a member of the Adventist church, employed by a school board, the members of which are not Adventists; and will be conducted, as all public schools should be, on strictly secular principles. The private school was however, opened each day with simple religious exercises, without special reference to the peculiar doctrines of the Adventists. The church school was patronized by quite a number of persons belonging to other churches, and Adventists do not believe in carrying their religious propaganda into mixed schools even where they might have the technical right to do so. They are consistent advocates of religious liberty.
