The theory of legislation upon religious duties and questions is radically opposed to the teaching of the Scriptures of divine truth, which plainly declare that "every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 14:12.

This text plainly asserts our accountability to God. From other scriptures we learn the scope of this accountability; that it has reference, first, to our duty toward God; second, to our duty to our fellow-man. The first and great commandment in the law is, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;" and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." And our Lord adds, "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

But while we have duty toward our fellow-man, failure to perform that duty is not, as we sometimes loosely say, sin against man, but is sin against God. It is God's law that defines our duty toward our fellows, and the violation of that law is sin. "Whosoever committeth sin," says the apostle, "transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law." The divine law, of course; and so, in the fifty-first psalm, we find David confessing to God the wrong done to Uriah, in these words: "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight." The wrong was done to man; the sin was against God; and to God the account must be given. "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God," both for our sins against God and our wrongs to our fellow-men. ALL SIN is, without qualification, against God. And He it is who "shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or evil."

God is the great and only moral governor. To him, and to him alone, every soul is morally responsible. In the very nature of things this could not be otherwise, for to permit any power whatever to come between the soul and God would be to destroy individual responsibility to God.

But man is a social as well as a moral being; and as such he is endowed with certain inalienable rights; to him God has committed the preservation of these rights by means of civil government. This truth is thus expressed in the American Declaration of Independence—

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

To disregard these rights or to trample upon them is to wrong our fellow-man and so to sin against God. The sin, if not repented of and forgiven, God will punish in his own time; the wrong may be dealt with by our fellows in their organized capacity as a State. And it is this fact that restrains from deeds of violence and injustice, many who have not the fear of God before them. This safeguard to liberty and natural rights, the God who sends his rain upon the just and upon the unjust, has given to man. Its benefits accrue alike to the righteous and to the wicked. The powers of civil government are exercised alike by and for Jew and Gentile, pagan and Christian. Hence civil government is not in any sense Christian, but is humanitarian, that is, it is given, like marriage, for the good of the race.

And this was not an arbitrary arrangement on the part of the Creator, but for wise and beneficent reasons which we can readily discern and comprehend. God committed to men, not the administration of his law, nor any part of it, but the maintenance of those rights which reason teaches that all intelligent moral beings should enjoy in common; those self-evident rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence. Had God made civil government Christian, and commissioned men to administer his law, and to require of their fellows the discharge of duties due to the Divine Being, or even to administer the divine law as regards the duties which as social beings we owe to one another, it would have destroyed moral responsibility to God. On the other hand, had God not committed to men the power to regulate to some extent their social relation in order that their natural rights might be preserved, but had himself administered civil justice, one of two things would have followed: either vengeance would have been so swift and certain as to defeat the very design of God in making man a free moral agent, or else punishment would have been so long delayed as to afford no protection to those in need of it. It was absolutely necessary that man should be the guardian of his own rights in this world, and for the temporary concerns of this world; but that this should in no way affect his individual moral responsibility to the Creator. Nor should men make it a pretext for assuming to exercise authority which belongs alone to God.

That the principle here stated is the correct and scriptural one, is clear from the words of Christ when the Pharisees sought to entangle him in his talk. They asked him the question: "Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?" But he understanding their purpose, said: "Show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." In this, Christ plainly separated between civil and moral duties. The paying of tribute was simply a civil matter. They were living under Caesar's government and it was right that they should contribute to the support of the government; and yet this was not an absolute moral duty, but rather one growing out of the surroundings, and in some cases even something to be done merely to avoid offense. It was for this reason that Christ himself paid tribute, as we learn from Matt. 17:24-27.

But notwithstanding the fact that civil government is not Christian, the Christian must of necessity live under it, even though he is not a part of it; he is in the world, yet not of it; and he is not to render himself unnecessarily obnoxious to the powers that be, for that would defeat the very object of civil government. Says the apostle: "For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."

Quietness and peace are essential to the enjoyment of life and liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness, which the Declaration of Independence enumerates as among those inalienable rights which governments are instituted to preserve. Thus the Christian's true attitude toward civil government is quiet submission in all things civil; rendering to Caesar [the State] the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. But to do this, that is, to render to God that which belongs to God, he who would render it, must, in the things rendered to God, be absolutely independent of any human authority. In those things, his highest allegiance must be paid to God. And as a matter of history, we find that this has always been the attitude of the servants of God. This was the case with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who, for refusing to bow before the great image in the plain of Dura, were cast into the fiery furnace. It was also the case with Daniel, who, though prime minister of the empire, disobeyed a law of the empire. It was also the case with Peter and John, who, when commanded by the magistrates contrary to the word of the Lord, answered, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard."

In all these cases the civil rulers sought to usurp authority which belonged alone to God, and the servants of God refused obedience and quietly submitted to the punishment inflicted, protesting, however, against the injustice and maintaining their innocence while declaring boldly their purpose not to yield to Caesar the things that belonged to God.

The same course was pursued by Christians until apostacy began to corrupt the primitive simplicity of the gospel. The followers of Christ ever yielded cheerful obedience to all in authority in all civil matters, but they went to the block and to the stake rather than yield an iota of their soul-liberty. So persistent were they in maintaining this principle of individual responsibility directly to God, that their teaching upon this subject so permeated the Roman empire that by the year A. D. 319, the most perfect religious freedom that ever existed under any government except our own was granted in Rome, and was enjoyed by all, both pagans and Christians, until apostate Christians themselves sought to establish in Rome a man-made theocracy and denied to others the very rights which only a few years before they had claimed for themselves. And in so doing they violated not only the principles for which they had formerly contended but they set at nought the fundamental law of Christianity itself, as laid down by its Author: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
