Is it civil legislation for a religious day,—or is it religious legislation for a civil day,—or is it civil legislation for a civil day,—or is it religious legislation for a religious day,—what is it that is asked? The following editorial item from the Gazetteer, of Denison, Texas, puts a much finer point on the question of a civil Sunday than its advocates would wish to see:—

Pious people in this country of the orthodox stripe, profess to be greatly shocked at the custom in France and Mexico of holding general elections on Sunday. But it seems that some of the most influential citizens of Denison, "including the pastors of nearly all the churches," approve of it. At least we suppose they do, as they have called a "mass meeting" on Sunday to consider a question that is purely civil in its character, the securing of legislation by the city council, having for its object the enforcement of the Sunday law. The Gazetteer is confident these pastors will never admit that the Sunday law is a religious enactment, and they can not show that the observance or non-observance of Sunday, as a holy day or rest day is a moral question, or that there is any requirement for such observance of higher authority than a church edict.

Will they accept this alternative? Either Sunday is civil or it is not. It is religious or it is not. Which born of the dilemma will they take? They must accept the one or the other. The one which they will take is the one they have taken before. History repeats itself.
