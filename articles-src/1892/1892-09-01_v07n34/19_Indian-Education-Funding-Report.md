INDIAN COMMISSIONER MORGAN has prepared a table showing the amounts set apart for various religious bodies, for Indian education for each of the fiscal years 1886 to 1893 inclusive. For 1886 the total amount paid was $228,259. Of this the Catholics received $118,343. For 1892 the amount was $611,570, the Catholics receiving of this $394,756. For 1893 the total amount is $525,881, the Catholics being allowed $369,533. The total amount set apart for the eight years was $3,767,951. Of this the Catholics received $2,366,416.

Mr. Morgan entered upon his duties as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, July 1, 1889, and awarded the contracts for the four succeeding years.

He says he was opposed to the policy of appropriating money from the public treasury to sectarian uses, and gave public notice at the beginning of his administration that he would not make contracts with any new schools. He has steadily adhered to this policy, yet it was not his purpose to interfere with existing schools. Mr. Morgan says the amount awarded to the Catholic Church the last year of the last administration was $347,572, while the amount given to them during each of the four years of his term has been considerably larger.

Congress failed to appropriate the amount asked for by the Commissioner for Indian education, and it was necessary to cut the amount allowed the schools for the present fiscal year. These reductions have been made impartially.

There has been a steady growth in public opinion during the last three years regarding the entire matter of appropriation of public moneys for sectarian uses. The three great denominations, the Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians, have publicly condemned it, and there has been a change of sentiment in the same direction among the Congregationalists and Episcopalians. The Baptists have never drawn any of this money, and the Methodists have now entirely abandoned it, and while the Catholics receive for the current year over $369,000 the Presbyterians receive less than $30,000 and the Congregationalists a little more than $25,000.
