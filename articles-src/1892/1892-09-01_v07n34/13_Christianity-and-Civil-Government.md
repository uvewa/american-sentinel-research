The political and national profession of Christianity by the United States, in its governmental capacity, if practically applied to its relations, promises to yield very unpleasant international situations. If the Government, as a corporate person, can and does accept a religion, it must, as a governmental power, go forth and preach it to all the world.

The Government of the United States has undertaken to enforce a religious observance upon its own citizens, and the subjects of all other powers as well, at the city of Chicago, upon the occasion of the holding of the World’s Fair. This is the beginning of a world-wide effort by this Government to spread abroad its religion. He who professes a religion belief, is bound in conscience to preach the truth he believes, and sacrifice himself, his time, his treasure, his labor to present it to the minds and impress it upon the hearts of all men.

Those who have constituted and called themselves “National Reformers,” and the enforcement of national religion, which is now bearing fruit, have always said:

1. The Nation is a collective being, with moral character and accountability, directly responsible, as the Author of its existence, God himself.

2. God requires a being, upon a certain basis, and it subject to the moral law of the Saviour; the Supreme Ruler of its nation, which teaches him the law is the basis of civil government.

If this Nation is such a being, endued with moral accountability, and responsible directly to God, who must preach Christ directly to God, who must preach before the nations of the world, by a system to all the nations of the world; and by religious legislation, a public profession of religion itself, as a basis; and the requirements of religious constituency, as well as its commercial enterprises, not only for all, but only for our own favored religion. The United States a Christian Nation, there will be no need of anything more. It will simply be for the available force of the Nation, in men and money, capable of bearing military, can be thrown at once into the foreign missionary field.

The editor-president of the American Sabbath Union has evidently grasped one of these grand possibilities, which this adoption of a national religion offers, for presenting among the nations of the earth. He proposes to utilize immediately, in this great work our Secretary of State, the foreign ministers and consulate service. But in the expression of this a remarkable inconsistency is developed. The *Mail and Express*, which, directed by the Sabbath Union president, has been, and is, the mouth-piece of organized and legislative religious intolerance at home, suddenly becomes an active advocate of religious liberty abroad. This paper says:—

The Secretary of State has done well to make a formal demand upon Turkey for holding it as to indemnity for the destruction of the property of American missionaries there. He must continue to follow that up with a vigorous policy and a firm protest against any form of intolerance which is a dishonor to Turkey and for American diplomacy which is ought not to how.

Certainly, here is an issue for diplomacy. If a Mr. John W. Foster is to make this diplomatic fuss for the State or for the Church, or for the state-church; for a diplomat and a statesman or for a diplomatic State churchman? The ideas of the Christian Empire very evidently are in that while Mr. Foster has these close commercial relations with Turkey, and within his sphere as a representative of the United States Government, there should still better, if he would assume to himself the authority of the State-church, demand something beyond the mere civil right of the “Christian” to be tolerated as resident in a foreign country.

It does not seem to be the civil injustice which American citizens have suffered that interests the *Mail and Express* so much as Turkey that calls out this article. The attention of this journal is directed to the exact spot on the map into which Mr. Foster’s new diplomatic enterprise takes it, and his prayer-book, that he should step into the ring to do battle monthly for all have but really for the last. The editors continue:—

The constant prosecutions kept up by the Turks against every form of religious effort on the part of the non-Mussulman, and the attempts made by their own ecclesiastics excite the admiration of those who know the full truth. They wonder that our nation should allow such indignity, and the nations should unite in enforcing religious liberty throughout the empire.

Here is a task for Mr. Foster’s diplomacy—to secure the co-operation of the other Christian nations in Turkey toward “enforcing” the compelling compulsory religious liberty; i.e. the originals of the compulsible. Think of it. The Turks, religious intolerants at home, want for others.

The present unrest prevails sufficiently for insisting also upon the right of every man to be threatened with words by his American subjects. This is a matter of some concern. It is not enough that the empire is concerned; but throughout the empire, and England has had many a struggle with its institutions. Many European subjects are desiring a better way; and even his own Mussulman subjects, who have caught on to some extent.

Germany and England, at least, would need to be distinctly classed with the United States as missionary nations, for Germany in spoken of as evangelizing, and England as making gospel contributions to the pagans of the world.

It is the gospel of Christ that is preached by those missionaries, and not the gospel of its arms and its navies to its enforce its “religion.” They, of course, that spread shall perish by the sword! Can it ever be a fit time to exact upon religious liberty abroad and practice religious intolerance at home? England and Germany are State Church nations, they have accepted religion as nations and have assumed the National Reform religion, the state of true normal persons, with moral character and responsibility, accountable to God. They both consider it their conscientious duty to enforce legal and religious disabilities upon dissenters, —their own citizens and prosecuting all forms of freedom in religious matters. In this, Turkey is their equal and consistent peer. It is evident that the *Mail and Express* is in some trouble with the Turkey question; trouble in the religious diplomacy. Mr. Foster (as Mr. Blaine before him,) was drawn this “Christian” Nation into an imbroglio which no administration of non-missionary nations whose business was purely secular could have gotten the country into, and it could hardly proved its been directly contrary to their foreign preaching, frankly enough. England and Germany have no absolute religious liberty; how then could they with any consistency demand that Turkey contain the benefit of absolute liberty which they themselves do not permit?

Mr. Foster, (or Mr. Foster as yet) He would know, as a diplomat, that it would not carry a protest against any form of religious profession by the Nation. The Constitution does not establish a national religion. That is the religion of which the *Mail and Express* most zealously represents its highest earthly embodiment is making mark. The desire of court and of religious tyranny is its chief mark; and that will parallel its parallel. The State church national religion and the religion of force— such is the state of affairs which the *Mail and Express* does not offer in this respect from that of Islam. But Protestantism—the religion of freedom—could urge and attempt to enforce upon Turkey—and Turkey could, from their own results. Full freedom in this country is surely the best of all and practices of all three of these powers— England, Germany, and the United States— it there, would therefore prove them to be really champions of religious liberty.

It would not be wise statesmanship, to say nothing of Christianity, for the religious profession of this Nation is in the same general class as that of Turkey. It could hardly be an act of wisdom or consistency, or of truth, or of Christianity for Mr. Foster, as a diplomat, for Mr. Foster, as an intelligent and shrewd diplomat, must know it.
