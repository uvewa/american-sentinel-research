and the gates of the Columbian Exposition are to be closed on Sundays.

The whole arrangement, even from its inception, has been a conspiracy. Bigotry as such has too long found its object. The victory is wholly. The traitors are already parading at the result and dividing the spoils. The pact with President Harrison agreed the recently contract has been practically concluded. The Government puts on a religious role, and the American Sabbath Association’s Christian Temperance Union, are congratulating themselves on the attainment of their object, and longing for the inauguration of the old Puritan Sabbath. This is affirmed most candidly by gentlemen Craft, Wanamaker, Shepard, Quay, of al names on hand.

“The appropriation in its present form is an insult to the people, and the Commissioners should have indignantly rejected it. The liberty of the Saloon has certainly cost more than three or four things that were intended. If lost to its assured that it will not cost more than amount is required.”

If an address before the Congressional Club, at Chautauqua, a speaker, Rev. C. Phelps said, some sort of combination must be made. No great religious movement has been more rendered than to create such a combinations of all good forces that we do not need. The issue is an alliance; and combinations, not of denomination to enforce them, but for upright men favoring God and country are combined to do their best; the associations be formed with trustworthy officers to see that they give of their views of what should be the needs of the country in legislation, looking up the records of the candidates for political and civil office. He spoke firmly but with great discrimination. What is wanted is that such men in voting for honest men as to incur to all such men in voting for such, and such only; as those for our representatives. Those men should be in character, such men, regardless of religious or political party; and in character and ability should be in or subject the highest political offices, honest candidates must be by approbation of the State, but punished for violators of official duty, their impeachment or removal even, should be the logical result of an abuse.

That is to say that the municipal, State, and national elections should be controlled by a church combination on nomination and elections. Certainly the different theories upon which to secure the union of Church and State are multiplying rapidly.

*Fort Irvine and Hostile Battle Creek, Mich.*, has this paragraph on the “Settlement of the Sabbath Question”:—

The action of the United States Congress in connection with the Columbian Exposition has been hailed with great joy by the preachers of the evangelical clergy of the country. Having been accusingly challenged to find any substantial base for Sunday keeping, they had with yet an act of Congress on their behalf. True, they had the terms of Compilation and the “lord’s day,” which was brought into England by the Act of Abbot of Play, a. d. 1900, but these and other authorities of a like character had been regarded as being very good authority for Americans, and the congressional Sunday order supplies what for American clergy a long this want. So well great complications are now not also that the great body of American Christians have now only a very important question in regard to baptism was brought before the world Congress for a decision, the sentence of death wished to be imprinted. He was Christianized, had been, as he had led to his removal without being removed from the prison. The court decided that, sprinkling was baptism. We have never heard that Baptists have changed their manner of baptism since, and we are not inclined to believe that if this decision had been confirmed by the chief Justice Supreme Court, it will not have made any difference in their practice. The reason is plain. No court has a right to decide a religious question. Therefore the attitude of the Sabbath question by Congress on the United States Supreme Court carries with it no more authority than would a decision from it on the question of baptism.

The *Chicago Tribune* of August 17, contains a report of a meeting held in that city, to agitate the question of Sunday closing of the World’s Fair. The *Tribune* says:—

“A mass meeting was held last night to have the World’s Fair open Sundays at a meeting in the grounds of the exposition, at which the following named gentlemen spoke: Carter Harrison, J. W. Cate, President of the American Secular Union, A. F. Bashinger, Secretary of the Illinois Anti-Sunday Law Movement, Hugo R. Schultz, Vice-President of the Skandinavian Band.

Following resolutions, which were passed unanimously:—

*Whereas*, The law *as* having of Congress in closing the gates of the World’s Fair on Sunday is in direct violation of our constitutional liberty of conscience upon which our forefathers we founded; and is not in keeping with the spirit and genius of our free American government. Therefore

*Resolved*, That it is the duty of every good citizen to do is overcoming it in his power to have the law enforced to repeal the law.

*Resolved*, That the people are requested to hold mass-meetings throughout the United States and petition Congress and our United States Representatives in Congress to vote for the repeal of the Sunday clause in the Appropriation bill.

Addresses were delivered by J. F. Goeting, C. B. Waite and others.

At Englewood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, on Sunday, Aug. 21, the Englewood Baptist Church and the Young Men’s Christian Association considered the actors at the Marlowe Opera House and
