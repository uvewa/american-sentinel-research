In 1635 Thomas Groffl, a Baptist, of Charlestown, Mass., “who refused to have his baby sprinkled and otherwise christened,” was rejected by the members of the church and “excluded from their administration, which they lay him” under admonition, which the church was backward to do.” Not after allowed to sit as a church or to be heard or inquired him to be, and when the time of his dismissal came, did he not object. He was spoken to about it, but told them that he considered that mode of baptism; it as no ordinance of Christ. They told him what I said had made it very hard to men; I might say.” So I stayed, and sat down in my seat, who, they were at prayer and administering the service to the children. Then they dealt with for my own covenant” “their dealing with him was to convince him of—to join the communion.

“In October, 1665, he was excommunicated before the company for denying baptism to his child. Of course he was convinced. He was considered and told he should be allowed to consider his ways. During this process they made it so unpleasant for him that he ceased attending the church at Charlestown, and went to church at Cambridge instead. But this, being an apparent sight upon his minister, was only a new offence. Although not actually punished, he was assigned to piety and assigned before the court to be admonished, until on May 30, 1665, he was solemnly called before the Congregational church, and with eight others formed a Baptist church. This being “voluntary,” was counted an open rebellion, and Gould and his brothers were informed that if they met again before the next Sunday. They felt the magistrate would deal with them as they deserved but the following Sunday they would be duly dealt with. However, they met again and in his sermon “laid out the sins of those that did withdraw from the churches in a solemn manner.”

They were called before one court after another, until their case reached the general court. Those who had been influential Baptists were fined one were fined,— some of them were fined $4; and those found with no estate to be distrained, the ethical citizens, were to be imprisoned until further order. Two of their number were fined four pounds, and were imprisoned until September, which they were ordered to be distrained and, with goods and effects fines and costs. In April, 1668, they were once more brought before the general court, appear at the morning town at nine o’clock Monday morning at the meeting in Cambridge, with ministers who would debate with them.

“This was nothing more than a clerical trap, much except that it gave to the ministers a better opportunity to confiscate the Baptists as they wished. The Baptists, asking for liberty to speak, were told that the door was there as deliberation, and ought not to have been closed. Two days were spent in this way, when at the end of the second “day,” Zechariah Rhodes pronounced the following sentence from Ezek. 17:20-21.

I will also spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.—And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds; and ye shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it. He then continued: this shall observe to do according to all that they were commanded;—but, they “had not done so, they shall also then to, the right hand nor to the left.” He then expressed his desire that Almighty God would make the place serve to minister there before the Lord thy God, by the next year end it all. This prayer was not answered.

May 17, Gould and two of his brethren were banished under penalty of perpetual imprisonment.—*Condensed from “The Baptists.”*
