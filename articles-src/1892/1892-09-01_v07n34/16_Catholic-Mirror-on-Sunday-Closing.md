The Catholic Mirror says of the action of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday:—

Surprising it is that those who are thus acting with the idea of keeping the Sabbath holy, do not see that the course they insist upon will be the very one to embitter thousands against Christianity and religion. Deprived of their rights in this way, they will see in the system which forces this wrong upon them, something odious and intolerable.

The blunder on the part of Congress is to be regretted, and all the more, since it was not made from the impulse of principle. The members simply had not the courage to resist the pressure of the fanatical element which urged the Sunday closing, and in yielding must have done so with a secret feeling of shame for their own want of moral fortitude.

The Catholic Mirror understands the origin of Sunday and knows what constitutes its proper observance according to the views of its originators. The Mirror, however, does not seem to be in accord with the advocates of the enforced observance of the American Sunday. They should go back to the foundation head of Sunday authority and learn what is befitting that holiday of the Church.
