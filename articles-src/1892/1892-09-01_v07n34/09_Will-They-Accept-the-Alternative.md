Is it civil legislation for a religious day, or is it religious legislation for a civil day? Is it civil legislation for a civil day,—or is it religious legislation for a religious day,—is what it all finally resolves itself into. A fellowcitizen came from the church to a fellow, of Peddas, Texas, puts a much sharper point on the situation when he writes to us, than its advocates would wish to see:—

My dear sir: I see it stated in the public prints that many people of different religious stripes, profess to be greatly shocked at the customs of Sunday closing the World’s Fair at Chicago on Sunday. But it seems that some of the most prominent churches are beginning to see and awaken a different feeling in the premises. At least we suppose they do, as they have called a meeting and decided to hold open their houses on the Lord’s day, as there is a clause in the legislation by the city council, having for its alleged object the closing of all places. It is furthermore a condition that three groups will never admit of that “religious legislation.” If it is a civil demand for the observance of Sunday, as a holy day or rest day is a “religious legislation,” then do both sides stand to be heard.

Either Sunday is civil or it is not. It is either religious or not religious. What dilemma will they take? They must acknowledge that it is religious or deny religion. They will take is the one they have taken before. History repeats itself.
