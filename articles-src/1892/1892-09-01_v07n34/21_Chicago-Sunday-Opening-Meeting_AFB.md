THE Chicago Tribune of August 17, contains a report of a meeting held in that city, to agitate the question of Sunday closing or opening of the World's Fair. The Tribune says:—

A new impetus was given to the movement to have the World's Fair open Sundays at a meeting of citizens and representatives of various organizations at Aurora Turner Hall last night. Ex-Judge C. B. Waite, President of the American Secular Union; John F. Geeting, Vice-President of the same society; A. F. Ballinger, Secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association; and J. W. Herman, were the speakers of the evening. Henry Schurz, Vice-President of the Rheinhander Bund, acted as chairman.

The assemblage expressed its sentiments in the following resolutions, which were passed unanimously:

"WHEREAS, The late action of Congress in relation to closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday is inconsistent with the principles of individual liberty of conscience upon which our Government was founded, and may be looked upon as a direct movement in favor of the union of Church and State, be it.

"Resolved, That it is the duty of every good citizen to do everything in his power to have the late action of Congress in reference to Sunday closing reversed."

"Resolved, That the people are requested to hold meetings all over the country and to pass resolutions requesting and instructing their representatives in Congress to vote for the repeal of the Sunday closing condition in the World's Fair appropriation."

Addresses were delivered by J. F. Geeting, C. B. Waite, J. W. Herman, and A. F. Ballinger.
