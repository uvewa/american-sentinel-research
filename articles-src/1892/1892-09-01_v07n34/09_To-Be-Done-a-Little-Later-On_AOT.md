ATLANTA, Georgia, is gradually coming to the front on the Sunday closing question. The police of that city have just had under consideration whether or not they would close all the book stores on Sunday. As some of the book stores sell the daily papers, and desire to keep open on Sunday morning for that purpose, there was opposition to closing on their part.

One member of the committee having this matter under consideration, said that they "might as well stop all the newsboys and close up all the news stands on Sunday as to make a certain book dealer close his doors." To which another member retorted that "he was in favor of doing that at the proper time, but it was not under consideration now." That is the way of it. The seemingly innocent things they are asking now in the line of Sunday legislation, are only a prelude to the rigid and meddlesome puritanic laws that they will bring out a little later on. A. O. TATT.
