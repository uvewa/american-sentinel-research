THE Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Mich., has this paragraph on the "Settlement of the Sabbath Question":—

"The action of the United States Congress in closing the Columbian Exposition has been hailed with great joy by the popular clergy of the country. Having been exceedingly bothered to find any substantial basis for Sunday-keeping, they hail with joy an act of Congress in their behalf. True, they had the decree of Constantine, and the 'holy roll,' which was brought into England by Eustachius Abbot of Flay, A. D. 1202, but these and other authorities of a like nature were not looked upon as being very good authority for Americans, and this congressional Sunday edict supplies for the American clergy a 'long-felt want.' So with great complaisance they now speak of the 'settlement of the Sabbath question.' This reminds us that a very important question in regard to baptism was once settled (?) by a Kentucky court! A man under sentence of death wished to be baptized. He preferred immersion, but as he could not be immersed without being removed from the prison, the court decided that sprinkling was baptism! We have never heard that Baptists have changed their manner of baptism since, and we are inclined to believe that if this decision had been confirmed by the United States Supreme Court, it would not have made any difference in their practice. The reason is obvious. No court has a right to decide a religious question. Therefore the settlement of the Sabbath question by Congress or the United States Supreme Court carries with it no more authority than would a decision from it in regard to baptism."
