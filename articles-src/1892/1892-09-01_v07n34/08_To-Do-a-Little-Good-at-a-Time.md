ATLANTA, Georgia, is gradually coming to the front on the Sunday-closing question. The police of that city have announced a crusade, and have declared that they would close all the book stores on Sunday. A number of persons, readers of the daily papers, and desire to keep open their shops and news-stands have declared that there was opposition to closing on that day.

One member of the committee having the matter under consideration, said that he “might as well stop all the newsboys also, and if they all stop work about it.” He says he got a bill some years back to make a certain class of stores Sunday closed, and the effort came to nothing; but the committee torted that “Jesus is in favor of doing one good at a time,” that the council should take it at the proper time, but at the present time the conditions require rest. “That is the way to do it.” The seemingly harmless, they say, that the measures which they now recommend, are only a prelude to the rigid and complete enforcement of Sunday observance; and bring out a little later an A. O. T.
