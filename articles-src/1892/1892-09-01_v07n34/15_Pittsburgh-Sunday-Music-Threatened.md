PITTSBURG is to be deprived of Sunday music in her parks if the Law and Order League can have its way. The Dispatch says:—

"President McCrory, of the Law and Order Society, is after the Sunday sacred concerts in Schenley Park. He was in City Hall yesterday seeking information as to who paid the bands furnishing the music. Controller Morrow, to whom he applied, could not tell, but he agreed with Mr. McCrory, that the Sunday concerts were a desecration and should be suppressed. Mr. McCrory started away declaring he would see about the matter at once."
