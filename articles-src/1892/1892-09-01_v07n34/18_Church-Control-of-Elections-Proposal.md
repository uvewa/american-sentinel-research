In an address before the Congregational Club, of Oakland, Cal., recently, Rev. W. C. Pond said:—

Some sort of combination must be made. No more effective missionary service could to-day be rendered than to create such a combination of all good citizens, to throw their votes neither for men without principles nor for principles without men to enforce them, but for upright men fearing God and working righteousness. Why could not an association be formed with trustworthy officers so salaried that they can give their whole time to watching the operations of our municipal Government, looking up the records of the candidates for every position, and giving the people the results of their investigations? ... What is needed is reliable information for honest men as to the candidates they are voting for, and then a union of all such men in voting for such, and such only, as are thus recommended. These men should be enabled to give their whole time to a matter so important, and in character and ability should be fit to adorn the highest judicial positions. But they ought not to be appointees of the State, but sustained by voluntary offerings, thus kept dependent upon and in touch with the men who will rely upon their counsels.

That is to say that the municipal, State, and national elections should be controlled by a church committee on nominations and elections. Certainly the different theories upon which to secure the union of Church and State are multiplying rapidly.
