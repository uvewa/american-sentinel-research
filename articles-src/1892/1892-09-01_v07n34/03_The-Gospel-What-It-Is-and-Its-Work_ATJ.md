Now let us take our bearings again, that we may fairly enter upon the examination of another point. Out of that first falling away came the mystery of iniquity. And as that mystery of iniquity was the Papacy, and the Papacy it is important for us to know how that thing was accomplished; just what took the lead; when it appeared, and how it appeared; as the apostle says, there was a falling away from the truth; the perversion of truth; and all kinds of different amendments and additions to the faith of Jesus; the union with the heathen philosophy and science with the profession of Christianity that those who were not that of the children of God behind; and when they found that they had not the power of God, and could not influence men any longer by the presentation of the truth, just what and counsel, they looked to the State for the assistance of earthly governments, by which they would compel men to yield obedience to the church.

In Constantine’s time there was the working of this power, the philosophical science, this formation of the mystery of iniquity, doing its utmost to secure to itself of the civil power and compel men to yield to what it taught as the truth, and of the apostolic form of religion, which was but a heathenized Christianity. I shall call your attention to a few facts in connection with this effort, not in a connected chain as a series of events, a series of steps, to show how the evil work was done. Any one who would know how to detect the rise of the image of the beast in our day, call your attention to a few facts in connection with the working of this power, the philosophical organization, the organizers and managers of which were “only actors to assert the government as a kind of guardianship” for the church.—*Ecclesiastical History*, book 5, chap. 2.

This was the first effort of any “bishop” in the empire to make politics a branch of his “ecclesiastical business,” and therein to make theology a branch of politics, in an intrigue-blending with the government, they succeeded in hastening to him their influence and power in theology for his politics. And one of the very first fruits of this came, the Constantine was established in the rulership of one half of the Roman Empire, with Licinius, to the other persecuting edict of Diocletian, and granted liberty and full freedom to the Christians to observe their own mode of worship; “likewise to the Christians and to all, the full choice to follow that made of worship which they wish;” “that every man have the privilege to select and to worship whatsoever divinity he pleased;” and commanding that the churches and the church property which had been confiscated by Diocletian, should be restored to “the whole body of Christians”; was to work conveniently respectively.—*Ek.*, book 20.

This was all just and proper enough, and innocent enough, in itself and on its face; if that had been all the edict contributed to. But it had no sooner been accepted as a kind of sovereignty of the churches than the “mystery of iniquity” which had been entered into to feed and dominate by ecclesiastical ambition and manipulation likewise claimed to be legitimate and only true representatives and depository of Christianity, in the church—it was the Catholic Church, and no sooner had the Edict of Milan ended the confiscation of the properties of Christians, than it was seized upon and made to apply only to the use and benefit and to bring recognition and the legal establishment of the Catholic Church.

For the Catholic Church had been established that all who did not agree with it in certain forms, “beliefs” and practices, were entirely heretics, and not Christians at all; this therefore committed the Imperial Government to the dictum of the Catholic Church that therefore none such were entitled to any of the benefits of the law respecting property to the Christians. In other words the Catholic Church claimed the right of any others than Catholics to receive church property or money from the Edict of Milan, by disputing their right to be Christians. And by this means the Catholic Church forced an imperial decision as to who were Christians. And under the circumstances, by the power and influence which she had, by what she had already done in behalf of Constantine, it was a foregone conclusion of not only that the decision would be but what it would be in favor of the Catholic Church.

In the province of Africa the same persecution contained those things— their property was at once restored to the Catholic party; and it being a question of identity, if any of these things belonging to the Christians had gone into the possession of others, or other places, are now possessed either by purchase from our treasury or by any other title, let them be restored to the Christians. As we have previously determined, that whatsoever these same churches formerly possessed shall be restored of the age.

“But it was not what was said and all. It was not “the Catholic Church” to which an edict, and the property was to be restored. But to “the Christians,” the whole body of Christians.” But, mark that it was by the dictum of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church made a turn upon that and carried with it an imperial decision by the imperial authority as to who were Christians, and the emperor having given him her influence in politics, he did not dare to say otherwise than as it pleased, she would swing her influence over Licinius or some other one, and he would become emperor. She had political power in her hands, and she used it.

Nor was it enough that the emperor should decide that all things above were “for the Catholic Church of the Christians.” Immediately there was two other powers contending for the prestige. Therefore, the emperor was obliged next to decide which was the Catholic Church. This question is one in which the contest was by this decision rendered important, and obligatory upon an edict that was drawn from Constantine, addressing in some of the most famous cases of history in Africa, in which were these elements.

It is my will that these men, within the province that is entrusted to me, in the what Christian peoples, who maintain the Catholic faith, from any form of disturbance.—Extract from an edict of Constantine.

The Catholic party claiming the title in Africa was the party which was defended by Cecilianus, Bishop of Carthage. The other party then drew up a long series of charges against Cecilianus, and presented them to the emperor with a petition that he would have the case investigated by the bishops of Gaul. Constantine was to act as a judge in the matter of the contention. But, instead of having the bishops of Gaul examine into the case for its contentions, he wrote a letter to the bishop to Rome and sit with the bishop of Arles together; he commissioned the bishop of Rome Constantine sent a letter, with copies of all the charges and complaints which had been lodged by the African party against Cecilianus, with instructions, and in this letter to the bishop of Rome, with either he, said the following paragraph:

I am so much the more urgent in this request, upon you, upon the whole, it is known to you as a preacher of Christianity.

This council of Rome confirmed the opinion of Cecilianus. The other party in Africa, was indeed, for one case which had been decided by the contending party, one of which was in communion with the Catholic Church which was the one over which the bishop of Rome presided. Their right to the party appealed from this decision, and protested against it; and Constantine could be called to examine the question. And upon this further appeal Constantine sent the matter to a council of bishops called and assembled at Arles, constituting his own delegates. And by the decrees of the temporal courts. Then the parties appealed from this to the decision of the council to the emperor himself. And upon this further appeal the emperor passed judgment confirmed the decision and the action of the councils, and reaffirmed the establishment. And so the defeated party rejected not only the decisions of the two councils, but the decision of the emperor too.

Then Constantine addressed a letter to the Christians, bestowing more favors upon the Catholics, and inflicting new penalties upon the opposing party, the Donatists, to complete their subjugation.
