AT the First Presbyterian church yesterday morning Rev. Noises Millard preached a forcible and timely sermon with a very practical bearing. He touched upon many of the leading questions of the day.

Dr. Millard took his text from Luke, 20: 25, “Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.” In the course of a discourse he said, “There would have always been interpreted as drawing a sharp line of discrimination between things civil or ecclesiastical, between Church and State, between organized into one organized political estate, with all his explanation of a divides therefore, and the temporal and dividable the basis of Church and State. He was, in this position, thoroughly original and unapproachable. More than eighteen hundred years ago time no one had dreamed of a separation of Church and State, of the spiritual and temporal powers on the same basis. Prince and priest had always been in closest alliance, even where the offices were not combined in one and the same person. In all ancient governments an altar was fixed by the throne. The Jewish State was so completely a theocracy that the nation might be called one great church.

“In ancient Egypt religion was intertwined with every department of the administration of the State. The priest and the Pharaoh stood in like respect and authority and posed inseparable hands in administrative affairs. The untouched tablets of the Assyrians of Persians monasteries tell a like story of these priestly prerogatives. In Greece and Rome religious impiety as a civil crime, to be punished by the state. For Socrates was put to death her wisest philosopher and her worthiest man.

The first court in the accusation against him said, ‘Socrates does not worship the gods which the city worships, the penalty of law is in his hand.’ Socrates himself did not deny the right of the State to prescribe religion to him, but simply wished to disprove the accusation. So again in Rome, the Pontificus Maximus was as much an integral concern of the State as were the council and prefects. Christ, when he uttered the sentiment of the text, was, accordingly, utterly revolutionary, and proclaimed for the first time the idea of liberty and practice of all forgoing and fundamental principles of government. A distinctive chapter which the unholy main causes of which the unlawfully union maintained have been distinguished, but the assaults of mankind! That alliance has been maintained, both to the detriment of the Church and the peace of the State.

“Well has it been said: ‘Wherever and whenever the church has succeeded in uniting itself with the secular power, the result is a compound of tyranny,’ and wherever, in spite of ancient precedent and right of liberty of conscience has been contended, persecutions have flourished. Moreover, and informatively the best interest through this alliance, has been determined, from a just perception of her children in a genuine manner who gladiate her religion is better served by its own unaided methods of the age.

“The strongest words were needed to call attention to the gravity of Christ’s position, it could be found in the State, even to this day mankind in many places are remarkable in impress his mind and put it into practice. Surely, even never would conceive such a thing as far they soon overcome everything.

“State churches and established religions relying on State support are still the normal throughout Christendom from Russia to Chile. Even where the principle of divorce of Church and State is accepted in theory, it has been practically impossible to avoid and avoid it in practice. Multitudes of men who bear the Christian name are still feeling that our Government, as a government, ought to be specifically Christian; as Protestants which it should deny to Catholics, and also principles to believers which it should deny to unbelievers. Many who profess to accept the principle of the divorce of Church and State take no position incompatible with it. Not a few have petitioned our Congress to close the World’s Fair on Sunday, basing their petition as religious grounds. I wish that all the people were religious enough to keep the day. But I would be very far from wishing to ask the Government through Congress to enjoin it. All that Congress has a right to do is to legislate a civil Sunday in the interest of a day of rest for all people who had a religious element. I would be glad if the Church could everywhere as well call of the civil Sunday; as by its own influence and power, to make it a religious Sunday. But this must be voluntary, not legislative.

“What is so-called to behold in Tennessee.—To-day four men languish behind the bars of a jail in that State, not for what they did. Not because they commit irregularly; did they commit; did they commit.” No, they did not violate laws and sacred laws of citizenship; but because they believe that Saturday, the seventh, and not Sunday, the first day of the week, is the true Sabbath commanded of God, and had the courage of their convictions.

“Simply because they keep Saturday and work on Sunday, right in the face of the teachings of our natural laws, the strong arm of the law has been stretched out and thrown them up in prison. So Susan B. Anthony.”

“Having seen their principle it is discrimination against it from some, things' difference of Church and State is but the divorce of Church and society. The reverse is the case. The Separation offers in two manners, namely, that the separation of the Church and State does not mean that religion is not and organized.

“The separation of Church and State does not society. Church and State are not to be divorced, but the Church lies behind and creates the Church, while the Church in the broadest sense lies behind principles. Religions and society may blend and yet Church and State shall be separate.

“Remember: The divorce of Church and State is not a divorce of moral and religious considerations from legislation, but it must be put down immorality, but first to put it in to suppress it by religious dogma, not ecclesiastical dictation. The Louisiana lottery were gone, thank God, in large part, not yet, threw there into the pocket of the State, but because in morals the whole nation is right.

“Nor, thirdly, is the divorce of Church and State a divorce of religion from politics. In purely political questions it is the right of the pastor, faced, and Christian men generally to enter the political arena when the voice of the pulpit is barred out. But religion and politics must not meet with as much moral as they are political. In a country ruled by the people they will be the better of their own interests, they got their way, they will see in the system which forms the laws they will carry out.

“The blunder on the part of Congress is to put closing of the World’s Fair upon religious grounds. The members of Congress simply had not the courage to resist the pressure brought upon them through petitions claiming to represent millions of names with a secret feeling of shame for their own want of an honest outspoken courage.”

The *Catholic Mirror* says of the action of Congress:—

Surprising it is that when so, those who are in the cause that the course they must upon will be in the interest of common sense and Christianity; the way, they will see in the system which forms the civil law.

“The blunder on the part of Congress is to put the closing of the World’s Fair on religious grounds.”—*Springville, Tenn., Aug. 14, 1892.*
