[The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle publishes a report of an unusual sermon delivered in that city. It was indeed a word duly spoken and timely, showing the speaker to be filled with the pure principles of religion undefiled, in the strength of which he loves his neighbor as himself.]

At the First Presbyterian church yesterday morning Rev. Nelson Millard preached a forcible and timely sermon with a very practical bearing. He touched upon many of the leading questions of the day in a very impartial manner.

Dr. Millard took his text from Luke, 20:25, "Render therefore unto Caesar, the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's." In the course of his discourse he said, "These words have always been interpreted as drawing a sharp line of discrimination between things civic and ecclesiastical, between Church and State, between organized religion and organized politics. Jesus with all his emphasis of a divine interdict, declares the divorce and forbids the banns of Church and State. He was, in this position, thoroughly original and unspeakably in advance of his age. For up to this time no one had dreamed of a separation of the secular and ecclesiastical powers. Prince and priest had always been in closest alliance, even where the offices were not combined in one and the same person. In all ancient governments the altar was hard by the throne. The Jewish State was so completely a theocracy that the nation might be called one great church.

"In ancient Egypt religion was intertwined in the closest manner with the administration of the State. The priest and the Pharaoh stood in like respect and authority and joined inseparable hands in the administration of affairs. The unearthed tablets of the Assyrian and Persian monarchies tell a like story of these peoples. Even enlightened Greece treated religious impiety as a civil crime, to be punished by the secular arm. Athens put to death her wisest philosopher and her best citizen on the charge of impiety. The first count in the accusation against him read, 'Socrates does not worship the gods which the city worships, the penalty due him is death.' Socrates in his defense did not deny the right of the State to punish impiety as a crime, but simply sought to disprove the accusation. So again in Rome, the Pontifex Maximus was as much an integral element of the State as were the consul and prefect. Christ, when he uttered the sentiment of the text was, accordingly, utterly revolutionary, speaking right in the teeth of the universal theory and practice of all foregoing ages. Did he not foresee the dark and disastrous chapter which the unholy union of the Church and State was to write in the annals of mankind? That alliance has been very destructive both to the purity of the Church and the peace of the State.

"Well has it been said: 'Wherever and whenever the Church has succeeded in uniting itself with the secular power, religion has been debased, the supreme right of liberty of conscience has been outraged, persecutions have flourished. Moreover, not infrequently the State, through this alliance, has been transformed from a just protector of her children to an insane monster who glutted her religios political appetite on the richest and purest blood of the ages.'

"If anything more were needed to show the originality of Christ's position, it could be found in this, that even to this day mankind in many places seems unable to appreciate His idea and put it into practice. Surely, men never would conceive that which so far they seem unable even to receive.

"State churches and established religion relying on State support are still the rule throughout Christendom from Russia to Christ. Even where the principle of divorce of Church and State is accepted in theory, men often wince at its application and avoid it in practice. Multitudes of Christians in this land of ours have a feeling that our Government, as a government, ought to bestow certain privileges on Protestants which it should deny to Catholics, and also privileges to believers which it should deny to unbelievers. Many who profess to accept the principle of the divorce of Church and State take positions inconsistent with it. Not a few have petitioned our Congress to close the World's Fair on Sundays, basing their petitions on religious grounds. I wish that all people were religious enough to keep the Sabbath sacred, but we have no right to ask the Government through Congress to interfere in this matter by religious legislation. All that Congress has a right to do is to legislate a civil Sunday in the interst- t of a day of rest for all people but not a religious Sabbath. I would be glad if the Church could everywhere so avail itself of the civil Sunday, as by its own influence and power, to make it a religious Sabbath. But this must be voluntary not legislative.

"What a spectacle we behold in Tennessee! To-day four men languish there in jail, and for what crime? Did they commit burglary; did they forge; did they commit arson? No, they belong to a sect called Seventh-day Adventists, who believe that Saturday, the seventh, and not Sunday, the first day of the week, is the true Sabbath commanded of God, and the day that ought to be kept holy.

"Simply because they keep Saturday and work on Sunday, Tennessee law and Tennessee bigotry, right in the face of the spirit of our national Constitution have locked them up in prison. Shame on that persecuting State?

"Having now unfolded their principle of the divorce of Church and State, let me discriminate it from some things with which it is often confounded. First, the divorce of Church and State is not the divorce of religion and society. This answers the Catholic argument often advanced, namely, that the separation of the Church from the State leaves society godless and paganized.

"The Church is not religion and the State not society. Church and State are only the outward organization. Religion lies behind and creates the Church, while society lies behind and creates the State. Religion and society may blend and yet their outward organization be wholly separate.

"Secondly: The divorce of Church and State is not a divorce of morality and State. The State has a perfect right to put down immorality, but this is by no means the same as religious persecution. The Louisiana lottery went down, thank God, in a large part, not merely because it would have been in the end a financial folly for the State, but because it was a public dishonor and demoralization.

"Nor, thirdly, is the divorce of Church and State, the divorce of the pulpit and politics. In purely political questions as the irrigation of lands, banking laws, etc., the voice of the pulpit is barred out. But not so in those many questions which are as much moral as they are political. In these the voice of the pulpit will never be silenced until the spirit that animated the ancient Jewish prophets and made them the moral Titans that they were, has died out of the Christian Church."
