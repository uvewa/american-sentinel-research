What would be the general opinion of the intelligence and good sense of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL if it should publish, in good faith, such a paragraph as this:—

We call attention to the fact that the “American Sabbath Union”—another name for “Sunday”—is industriously circulating petitions urging a necessity for an open Saturday, but actually in the interests of the workingmen, but really in the interest of the Saturday Sabbath. They would prefer to have the Fair open Saturday so as to be circulating the day it may become the custom as it is represented by fair and worship. And Mondays as a compulsory day for rest and worship.

If the best sense and intelligence of THE SENTINEL had ever revised and even suggested, what would be the general opinion of THE SENTINEL?

A SUMMARY of the Columbian Sunday Advocate, bearing the motto, “Devoted to the Maintenance of One Day in Seven for Rest, Recuperation, Benevolent Ministration, and Religious Instruction and Worship,” and “at the foot of the title page in broad-faced small caps, the injunction of Nehemiah,” “I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath,” has been sent to this office. There is an article in the publication the following paragraph:—

We call attention to the fact that the “National Religious Liberty Association”—another name for seventh-day Adventist, is industriously circulating petitions urging a necessity for an open Sunday, but actually in the interests of the workingmen, but really in the interest of the Saturday Sabbath. They would prefer to have the Fair open Sunday so as to be circulating the day it may become the custom as a rest day for rest and worship.

What should be the general opinion of the intelligence and good sense of the Columbian Sunday Advocate since it has published, in good faith, such a paragraph as that? And, as the best sense and intelligence of the Columbian Sunday Advocate has expressed itself in such a paragraph what can be our opinion of the paragraph?

THE National Religious Liberty Association has circulated a petition which has been presented, with many thousand bona fide, individual signatures, to the Senate and the House. This is the exact form of the petition:

We, the undersigned citizens of the United States, kindly respectfully but decidedly protest against the Congress of the United States committing the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World’s Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation.

This is the only form of petition which the National Religious Liberty Association has circulated since the agitation of the question of closing the World’s Columbian Fair arose. It must, therefore, be this to which the Columbian Sunday Advocate refers in the quoted paragraph. The Advocate says that the petition is “for an open Sunday Fair.” Is it? Is the petition in the affirmative form at all? It is not. Does the petition ask that Congress shall decree the Sunday opening of the Fair? It does not. It follows then that what the Advocate says it does is what it solely itself. It would ask Congress to commit the Government to a union of religion and the State while the unitedly stated purpose of the petition is to protest against such a course. A set of men who would have an open every-day Fair would have been just as unsolicited for and just as vicious a piece of legislation as the legislative authorship by which its Sunday closing has been secured. The National Religious Liberty Association would no more have been guilty of petitioning for the one than for the other.

Further that this petition is “essentially in the interest of workingmen.” Is it? Will the reader of these paragraphs recall that petition and find the sentence, or the phrase, or the word, which can be tortured into either really or “essentially asking anything which is for the interest of any man or any set of men any more than for that of each and every citizen of the whole United States?

The Columbian Sunday Advocate cannot do it. There is no such sentence, word, or phrase there. But the Sunday Advocate says that it finds that their claim, in this petition, is “essentially in the interest of workingmen;” is “really in the interest of the Saturday Sabbath.” This self-expressed conviction, who can say? “I would rather not know so much than know so many things that are not so.” I would far sooner fail to get every sympathy for the Columbian Sunday Advocate which it suggests than to accede to so many facts that are not facts. The reality is that there is nothing in the petition ostensibly in the interest of workingmen. There is nothing in it really in the interest of the Saturday Sabbath. This is a vivid illustration of how dangerous it is to know and to print things which are not so. This statement shows, that, in the mind of the Columbian Sunday Advocate, there are two real Sabbaths: the Saturday Sabbath and the Sunday Sabbath, and that a petition which is in the interest of one class—workingmen—is so. It is with such acknowledgment of plenty of ignorance in this that the Sunday Advocate betrays its own cause, by falsely accusing the National Religious Liberty Association of doing that which it is not guilty. If the Association would acknowledge Sunday as a sabbath and plead in the interest of the Sabbath, then the Advocate by favoring that which is in the interest of Sunday does advocate the Sunday Sabbath. Thus the Advocate betrays itself explicitly, and in a comprehensive statement almost pitiable. If a petition for opening on the Sunday Sabbath is in the chiming on the Sunday Sabbath it is no happiness to the Saturday Sabbath, and the Advocate is guilty of that of which it has accused the Association. But the language of the petition, the principles, and all the plainest intentions of the Association prove it guiltless of the accusation which the Advocate makes; while the Advocate stands self-convicted upon its own statement. The alternative of the situation in which the Sunday Advocate has attempted here is to force upon the Association is that it would prefer to have the Fair open Sunday to conserving that day the Saturday Sabbath by conserving that day the Saturday Sunday as a rest day and demanding for some other day—instead day for rest and worship, and the accusation which it has made, either in ignorance or malice, has here its own inevitable confession. Upon what grounds of the Columbian Sunday Advocate, or either side is based I would not be charitable to consider them as showing a lack of fidelity; yet it is and it has been made now public to all concerned knowingly rather than fools. It is a serious consideration.
