The Chicago Advance (Congregationalist), of Aug. 11, 1892, referring to the closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress, and what is to be done with the twenty-two Sundays during the time of the Exposition, says:—

At the best, Chicago is bound to be enormously overrun during the Fair, and the customary quietude of the Sunday will inevitably be much broken in upon. Streets will be thronged and city railways crowded, though not to any such extent as would be the case were the Exposition to be kept open. In that case, excursions from every quarter would fill the whole city with noise and tumult.

This last statement is simply an admission that the great masses of the people in this country would disregard the Sunday Sabbath if they had a chance to do so, and shows that all the Sunday keeping governmental action, touching the closing of the Fair on Sunday or Sunday observance in general, can result in is simply that which is forced upon the people. Those professed Protestants who have been responsible for urging upon and extracting from Congress this action would do well to ponder the words of Martin Luther, the great champion of the Reformation and leader of Protestantism. He said:—

It is with the Word we must contend, and by the Word we must refute and expel what has gained a footing by violence. I would not resort to force against such as are superstitions: . . . nor even against unbelievers! Whosoever believeth let him draw nigh, and whosoever believeth not stand afar off. Let there be no compulsion. Liberty is of the very essence of faith.

But the most probable reason why force has been resorted to in this matter of Sunday observance rather than the use of the Word is because of the consciousness of the fact that the Word does not sustain the Sunday Sabbath.
