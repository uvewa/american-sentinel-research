The Chicago Evening Journal says:—

If any one supposes that the American Sabbath Union, the Columbian Sunday Association, and the Chicago Ministerial Union, are resting from their labors because Congress has ordered the Exposition to be closed on Sundays, he is greatly mistaken.

The Journal then publishes at some length the plans of these different organizations for the enforcement of the Sunday laws in Chicago, beginning with the Sunday closing of saloons.

They openly congratulate themselves that they have the Sunday laws already on the statute books, and all that remains for them to do is to secure their enforcement.
