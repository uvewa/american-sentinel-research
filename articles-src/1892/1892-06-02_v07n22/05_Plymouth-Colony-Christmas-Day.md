In giving a history of Plymouth Colony, Mass., Governor Bradford concludes the record of 1621, thus:—

And here I shall end this year; only I shall remember one passage more, rather of mirth than of weight. On the day called Christmas Day, the governor called them out to work (as was used), but the most of this new company excused themselves, and said it went against their conscience to work on that day. So the governor told them that if they made it a matter of conscience, he would spare them until they were better informed. So he led away the rest and left them; but when they came home at noon from their work he found them in the streets at play openly—some pitching the bar and some at stool-ball and such like sports. So he went to them, and took away their implements, and told them that it was against his conscience that they should play and others work. If they made the keeping of it a matter of devotion, let them keep their houses, but there should be no gaming or reveling in the streets.

If the ultra Sunday law advocates could be treated in a similar fashion so as to bring down upon their own pates the full force of the logic of their movement, they might see the injustice and tyranny there is in it. If those whose consciences are disturbed by open picture galleries and moving cars on Sunday, were forbidden to look at their own pictures, or to ride in their own carriages, or to require their servants to wait upon them on that day, they might discover that other people have rights that ought to be respected.
