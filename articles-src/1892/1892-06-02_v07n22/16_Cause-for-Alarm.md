James B. Mason, of Chapel Hill, N. C., who was educated at the State University and Trinity College, and was licensed in 1869 from the law school of the late Hon. W. H. Battle, Judge of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, gives utterance to the following significant words:—

> "Where are the Roger Williamses, the Martin Luthers, and the John Wesleys, and their early coadjutors, the staffs of religious liberty, and where are the Thomas Jeffersons in the affairs of State? A sad recalling! We pause! We reflect much! Here with hope, there with forebodings! We cease here to speak of or imagine them!

> "From these masterly days we have made rapid strides in civil and religious liberty, and free America—the United States—enjoys to-day the admiration of the entire civilized world. This I say, and this I believe. But, withal, have we not reached a point in human events demanding a pause and reflection? Is not the insignia of religious bigotry and intolerance wont to be erected? Are not legislators attempting to do the work of the Church? Is not the Church attempting to control the affairs properly belonging to both Church and State?"
