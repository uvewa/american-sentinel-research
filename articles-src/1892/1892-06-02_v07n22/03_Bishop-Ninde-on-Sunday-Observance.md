In a speech in a meeting, in Omaha, recently held in the interest of Sunday observance, Bishop Ninde expressed the opinion that there is little use to expect the people to keep the Sabbath holy until the church has won the masses to Christianity. He wanted to see the ministers get hold of the masses. There are people who make light of popular preachers, but he is ready at all times to take off his hat to the man who can draw the masses to hear the word of God. The church should go after the millions, no matter what their condition is. The churches of the present day have gotten into the habit of shifting along to keep up with the rich, instead of going after the masses everywhere and under all circumstances. He believes that if the churches would take hold in earnest and work for the salvation and conversion of every rank and class of humanity, the great Sabbath question would soon solve itself. The Bishop was loudly applauded, but just the same the usual appeal was made to the arm of flesh in the shape of a demand for enforced Sunday rest.
