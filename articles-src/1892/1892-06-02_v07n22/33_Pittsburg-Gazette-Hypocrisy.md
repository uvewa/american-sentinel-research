The Western Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, so-called, at its meeting in Pittsburg, March 29, adopted a resolution strongly commending the Commercial Gazette of that city for not issuing a Sunday edition. Referring to this fact the Christian Nation says:—

The Pittsburg papers which issue an edition on Sabbath have shown that in so far as the preparation of the paper is concerned, the Gazette does far more work on the Sabbath than the Sunday papers do. Reporters and correspondents are busy the whole day long in obtaining political and other kinds of news for the Monday issue. Work is begun in the office at noon on Sabbath. While all this is not so bad as the carrying, selling, and reading of the papers on Sabbath, we fail to see why a Sabbath reform association should pass a resolution indorsing such a paper. It gives the other journals a good chance to raise the cry of "hypocrisy."

The Nation has put this very mildly. The facts not only give "other journals a good chance to raise the cry of 'hypocrisy'," but they actually prove hypocrisy.
