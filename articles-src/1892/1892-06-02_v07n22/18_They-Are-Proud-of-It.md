The Christian Statesman writing of the early part of this century, says:—

Only mail trains were allowed. Congress having authorized Sunday mails in 1810 as a war measure, which became the occasion of a Sabbath observance revival in 1828-9, when petitions poured into Congress from nearly every State, asking that this official attack upon religion and rest should cease. The petitions failed, because the Post master General and Congress were partly too shallow and partly too wicked to see the fallacy of a Seventh-day Baptist argument presented to them, which assumed that for Congress to cancel its order for Sunday mails would be a union of Church and State as if the order itself were not a case of State against Church, and also against the rights of Government employes in the matter of rest and conscience.

Seventh-day Baptists were undoubtedly responsible for the argument which decided the issue in 1836-9, and we are proud of the honor which our forefathers gained for themselves, and for the truth. The Statesman seems to lack the power to take God and the Sabbath into account in its consideration of Sunday. To read its pages one would think that the fundamental issue of the hour is the right of Government employes and poor workingmen to rest on Sunday. God, and his Sabbath, which the Statesman calls "Saturday," and disregards as loftily as though Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth, had "no rights which the Statesman is bound to respect," must not come into mind!

It is a serious pity that the "Postmaster General and Congress were partly too shallow and partly too wicked to see the fallacy of a Seventh-day Baptist argument" in favor of rendering unto God the things that belong to him! How wonderfully deep, and how holy the Statesman is when compared with such a Congress, and such a Post-master General! It overwhelms one to think of it!—Sabbath Outlook.
