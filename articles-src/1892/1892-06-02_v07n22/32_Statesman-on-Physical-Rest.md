The following from the Christian Statesman, of April 16, shows about how much the editor of that paper believes the theory he, in working up sentiment for Sunday laws, tries to get other people to believe, that physical rest one day in seven is a law of nature, and necessary alike to man and beast. He says:—

On the Sabbath the same lecturer, by the use of some private team, can arouse two or three adjoining towns.

This editor reminds us of the man who declared that he proposed to have peace if he had to fight for it. He intends to compel everybody to keep Sunday if he has to disregard the day himself, drive horses at a break-neck speed on that day, and explode every one of his fine-spun theories to do it.
