"The approaching summer," says the Congregationalist (Boston), "will find hundreds of trains running over the railroads of our State every Sunday. Some of these trains will be used wholly for business purposes, but most will be filled with pleasure seekers, and will be arranged to secure this patronage. It is only just to say that on these trains will be some religious people bound on distinctly religious errands. If our Sunday trains existed only to accommodate notoriously wicked people they would hardly be called a problem."

That is to say if religious people did not use Sunday trains for religious purposes they would not be tolerated! And that is only to say that Sunday belongs so wholly to religion and to religious people that it ought to be controlled wholly in their interests. It is a good thing that such papers as the Congregationalist speak out plainly upon this question. It will do much to clear away the "civil Sabbath" fog which the American Sabbath Union has caused to settle around the Sunday question.
