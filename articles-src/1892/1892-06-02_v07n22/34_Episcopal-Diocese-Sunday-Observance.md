At the annual convention of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, May 18, held in St. Paul's Cathedral, Garden City, L. I., a special committee on Sunday observance handed in its report.

After it was read lay delegate James B. Cooper, of Babylon, who is justice of the peace in that town, took the floor. He said he did not believe in the Church sanctioning any measures to suppress the violation of the Sunday laws in Long Island City and other towns in Queens County. Justice Cooper said further that the people who flock to Long Island towns on Sundays were principally working people, and that was the only day they had for recreation. They probably drank poor whisky and worse beer, he said, but they were certainly no worse than the rich people who went off on their yachts on Sunday and drank champagne at ten dollars a bottle.

No action was taken in regard to local Sunday observance, but a resolution presented at the request of Bishop Whittaker, of Pennsylvania, requesting the officials in charge of the Chicago Exposition to close the place Sunday was adopted without discussion.
