Congressman Hopkins, of Illinois, has said to a reporter for the Washington Post that, "Nearly all the people who are sending in petitions to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, are doing so under a misapprehension. They all seem to think that those who want the Fair opened on Sunday, want the wheels of the whole Exposition to be going round. This is wrong. In the first place, it is not yet decided whether the Fair will be open or not. I am told that the subject has never been brought up by the Board of Directors. In the second place, those Directors who are in favor of keeping it open on Sunday are not in favor of allowing any machinery to be operated. They merely want the fine art galleries, and similar exhibition halls, open, so that people can stroll through them, just as they do through all the art galleries in the cities. As for running the heavy machinery, that has never been contemplated by anybody.

"Then again, some people claim that if the Exposition is not shut one day, all of the employees will have to work seven days a week. The fact is, that the World's Fair is being built on the eighth-hour plan, and six days constitutes a week's work. An additional force of employees would be kept in reserve, so that nobody would have to work seven days. As far as I can learn, the laboring element of Chicago, and the surrounding towns, is unanimously in favor of keeping the gates open on Sunday. It is proposed to inaugurate a department of public worship, at Jackson Park, and hold religious services in the buildings if the gates are opened.

"During the summer months more than 50,000 working people visit Jackson Park every Sunday to enjoy the cool breezes and the pleasant lawns. They went there before the World's Fair was thought of."
