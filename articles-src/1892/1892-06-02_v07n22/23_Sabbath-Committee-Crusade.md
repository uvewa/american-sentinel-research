The New York Sabbath Committee, through its secretary, Rev. W. W. Atterbury, and employing the same detectives who purchased the exhibition of the city's wickedness for Dr. Parkhurst, has undertaken a crusade against the dime museums and theatres which open on Sunday. Arrests have been made of the proprietors of Huber's Dime Museum and the Globe Theater.
