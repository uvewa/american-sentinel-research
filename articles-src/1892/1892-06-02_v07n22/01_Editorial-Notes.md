A PHYSICIAN paper asserts that on a recent Sunday, Law and Order spies tried to keep the employes of a circus, that happened to be in the city, from feeding the animals. "Nothing," it remarks, "is too mean for the emissaries of the McMasters."

IT is said that Rev. Anna Shaw was asked to speak at the temperance convention in Boston on the question of the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. But the lady had a mind of her own, and promptly refused to do any such thing, which was well; for I don't believe in playing into the devil's hands by making Sunday a civil day. I am in favor of opening the Fair on the people's child holiday."

"THE approaching enmity," says the *Congregationalist* (Boston), "will find hundreds of trains running over the railroads of our State every Sunday. Some of these trains will be used wholly for business purposes, will be filled with pleasure seekers, and will be arranged to secure this patronage. It is only just to say that on these trains will be no conspicuously religious people bound on distinctly religious errands. Sunday trains expected to accommodate sidetracked wicked people why would hardly be called a 'problem.'"

That is to say if religious people did not use Sunday trains for religious purposes, it would not matter; but the point is that is to say that Sunday belongs so wholly to religion and to religious people that it ought to be controlled wholly in their interests. It is a good thing that such papers as the *Congregationalist* speak out plainly upon this question. It only helps to make it clear what a "Civil Sabbath" fag which the American Sabbath Union uses to settle around the question really is.

IN a speech in a meeting, in Omaha, lately held in the interest of Sunday observance, Bishop Hare expressed the opinion that there is little use to expect the people to keep the Sabbath holy until the church has won the masses to Christianity. He wanted to see the militaries get hold of the common people. There are people who make light of popular preachers, but he is ready at all times to take off his hat to the man who can draw the masses to hear the word of God. The church should go after the millions, no matter what plan they employed in doing it. The churches of the present day have gotten into the habit of shifting along to keep up with the rich, instead of going after the masses everywhere and under all circumstances. He believes that if the churches would take hold in earnest and work for the salvation and education of every rank and class of humanity, the great Sabbath question would soon solve itself. The Bishop was loudly applauded, just as the same the usual appeal was made to the arm of flesh in the shape of a demand for enforced Sunday rest.

In giving a history of Plymouth Colony, Mass., Governor Bradford concluded the record of 1611, that—

And here I shall end this year, only I shall add a few words concerning some of their small things worthy. On the day called Christmas Day, the governor called them out to work on new works; he, the most of this now so newly entered them. But the most of the new company excused themselves and said it went against their consciences to work on that day. So the governor told them that if they made it matter of conscience, he would spare them until they were better informed; but he found the rest still there, but when he came again he found some at games, playing in the streets openly, some pitching the bar, and some at stool-ball and such like sports; so he went to them, and took away their implements and told them that they and their friends both, it was against his conscience that they should play and others work. If they make the keeping of it a matter of devotion, let them keep their homes, let them attend devotion, and not insist that others be deprived of recreation.

If the Sunday law advocates could be treated in a similar fashion so as to bring down upon their own pates the full force of the logic of their observances, there might be no tyranny and tyranny there is in it. If those whose convictions are disturbed by open picture galleries and moving cars on Sunday, were forbidden to look at their own pictures, or to ride in their own carriages, or to require their servants to wait upon them on that day, they might discover that other people have rights that ought to be respected.

Subsequent to the resolution before the Methodist General Conference, in Omaha, in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, Rev. F. T. B. Hickason, a delegate from the New England Southern Conference, said:—

I represent that little spot on the map of this great continent, a little speck which you call Rhode Island. It is not uncommonly known as the way out State in the Union. Many facts in our history are explained by one phrase, "Soul Liberty." It really relates to this subject. Many of its memoranda and records express the sentiments of the Baptists in their industry. It was proposed there to open those gates on Sunday. The Baptists said not only not to do it—said, "Gentlemen, you have it in your power over the doors of that little colony on Sunday, and I suppose I can not prevent it; but, gentlemen, don't call it an American holiday, don't call it God's holy day," said it did its work, and the golden doors swung apart and all entered there, and there hung the banner, also, he imprinted on the Conference to take home an expression of our body as suggestive of the action of the Paper of Bishops, who, with the light-houses along the main land, those of the Christian Republic. Representing to its Rhode Island and New England Southern Conference the feelings we find ourselves heartily in the sentiment, and by a rising vote, pass the resolution here presented.
