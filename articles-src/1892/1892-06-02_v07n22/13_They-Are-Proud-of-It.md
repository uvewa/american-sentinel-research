THE *Christian Statesman* writing of the early part of this century, says:—

City and town taxes were almost *always* being authorized. Sunday mails in 1810’s a war measure, while we can not commend the purpose of Congress in authorizing them. Soon the protests grew from nearly every State, asking that this practice be discontinued. In the meantime the civil and religious forces of the country throughout the land and Congress were partly too shallow or partly too timid to give them any sort of regard. The Baptist argument presented to them, which practically was an argument for the separation of State as if the order itself were not a case of State care for a religious institution, and the people and Congress were both unconscious of the real merits of it.

“The old-style Baptists were undoubtedly responsible for the argument which decided Congress in favor of the Sunday mails.”

So in the first place, the Baptists upheld the honor which our forefathers gained for the United States. And again in our day, the Statesmen moans to back the power to bring it back and the Sabbath into respect by bringing consideration of Sunday. To read it in their pages one would think that the fundamental issue of the lover in the right of Governments occupied early time for man to rest on Sunday. God, and his Sabbath, while the *Statesman* calls the "Sabbath” and disagrees so loftily as though “Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth” had “a right” when the American constitution itself, “maker” must not come into mind.

Separation of church and State may have been a sentiment, and the people and the postmaster General and Congress were partly too shallow and partly too timid to give to the fallacy of a Seventh-day Baptist argument a first hearing, surely, the old Constitution comes to a remedy: what are the things that belong to him? How wonderfully deep and how holy the Statesmen is when compared with much a low a claim, the right of a man to work. It overwhelms one to think of it!—*​​​86680*

It will be observed that at this time the National Board of Sunday was welcomed as beginning at sundown on Saturday, and ending the same time the following Sunday. This was in accordance with the Bible count of time, now abandoned, however, by Sunday-keepers, possibly on account of the mischief which from the standpoint of Sunday Sacredness it makes with the first day morning, an account of which is given in the twentieth chapter of Acts. Counting from evening to evening, the Troas meeting was held on what we call Saturday night, and the light of their supper was spent for the apostle in walking from Troas to Assos, a distance of 19 miles. But on the first day of the week by the day count, but counting from midnight to midnight as this custom, reckoning by the civil day, their claim either thoughtfully or dishonestly claim, that the meeting at Troas was on what we call Sunday evening, and that the apostle resumed his Sunday morning.
