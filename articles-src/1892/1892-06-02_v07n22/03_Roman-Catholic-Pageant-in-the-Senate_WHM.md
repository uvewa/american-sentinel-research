So far as showing the place of Rhode Island the Doctor would pass better refer by reference to its early history and its whole stand for liberty of even other religion than by that particular feature of Rhode Island history that approves to the resolution. Not as the reference to "Old" Plymouth was the Puritans but for half dealing sometimes but tolerance for the religious opinion. They had to secure enjoyed persecutions themselves that they began, to persecute others and, "Old Plymouth Rock" instead of being, as some would have us believe, a fair representative of the rights of freedom of the first religious despotism established upon American soil.

It must have been with mingled feelings that those who consider this a Protestant country listened to the presentation of a funeral pageant in the Senate Chamber of the United States on the occasion of the death of a deceased senator from Virginia, on May 19. It was the first time that the Roman Catholic formal ceremonials were ever witnessed in the Senate Chamber. The sight was one to fill timid for those who are, but imagination, gorgeous, stately, impressive.

The Vice-President, the officers of the Senate, and the senators, bowed with heads, with silken sacred, rum at the entrance of the speaker, and officers, and more like the train of monks in long robes, then the marble of white silk; they arrange them the surplice of white silk of the bishops and fathers, and assistant celestials in their robes and vestments of purple and black, silver embroidered; at the bit of the church as it is placed upon the cathedral carries the was these in this as are ascended the altar, the above shining in the form of a cross surrounded with a field of the officiating bishop, a master of a polished epoch and pulpit oratory, the stately ceremonial was consummated with and of silver, a golden gleam of the strange and bewildering pageant through the historic senate chamber.

And this was not a Roman Senator, but a plain and simple Virginia Senator of the nineteenth century, who had served his country faithfully and without thought of colonization; but who years ago had said that when he became a Roman Catholic it would be a Roman Catholic. Rome never forgets.

It is a striking suggestion of the wide spread and ambitious relation of the Church and State question of the day that a noted obituary of the State of Congress was in the minds of the two prominent gentlemen mentioned in connection with death have just occurred almost within a few weeks. Less than a year ago this Virginia Senator was a member of the Senate District Committee, which had under consideration, the Sunday for the District of the Fair, and was afflicted at that time. His retirement was due to ill health, the next morning,—dying.—a man as earnest in his creed as he was elder in his denomination, was advertised by the laying on of the "Catholic" rites. Those who gathered to hear him were told, "Our martyr had endured nothing this morning. Man dies, but the truth and the power shall always give themselves both, to after them.

LEGAL toleration is the mother of illegal intolerance. Illegal laws bring illegal anarchy and materials. Legal religion is the identity of equity and intolerance.
