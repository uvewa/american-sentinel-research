THE following story comes from Milford, Conn., illustrative of the ways in which Sunday laws were enforced in that State ninety years ago:—

DEACON HUXLEY, an inhabitant of Milford, was returning from an afternoon meeting in an adjacent parish. As he was coming near to the front gallery of the old Plymouth Church, and the window of the lower story was open, so he could command a view of the road for a quarter of a mile, when Mr. Burr, who was sitting in the gallery, saw the deacon coming, and compelled to step over until the sun had set, as it was Sunday afternoon. And as the deacon was coming toward the church, and ran on at a rapid rate past the meeting house, Mr. Burr read, and Mr. Burr asked: "What's the matter, deacon?" The deacon replied, "Oh, it is past sundown and I want to get home." Mr. Burr then man put up his horses and wait until sunset. But this was before Mr. Burr was converted. Rev. Bezaleel Pinneo was the minister. Two grand and aged, and among the most respectable inhabitants who stood at the lower beach, he related the following anecdote. One of these was Jason Burr, Vice-President of the Litchfield County Temperance Society.

When Mr. Burr was driving past the church in an obstinate, he replied: "I asked no difference between this and any other day; but, sir, you may as well know, for I have a standing rule in my house, I forbid you to pass through this place until after sundown on Sunday."

Burr obeyed the command, and his horses were detained at the meeting-house until the sun set. It's having, saying told after his son were done.
