*Apropos* of Justin D. Fulton's criticism of Mrs. Potter Palmer's request to the Pope to aid the Columbian Exposition in some way, the Chicago *Inter Ocean* quotes the Washington *Post*, of May 17, as follows:—

It begins to appear that by the time the Chicago Fair opens there will be trouble about. It is not the purpose to make war on the Roman Catholic, and the Roman Catholic Church, but those who have persistently insisted on the closing the Fair during the Sunday have now invited papal interference in the matter of the Exposition.... They set the Roman maximum insist upon recognition for their bishops that of the church, and the Pope's representative care for free privileges within the grounds: if, as a matter of course, they have a right to demand it. The trouble is, the Pope already has his legate on the ground. If the politicians who call this a Christian Nation, it is to be turned into a battle-ground of sects. And it is precisely to avoid this danger.... If the Protestants insist upon the exclusion of the Roman Catholics from the Fair grounds, and the Exposition, at once and irreversibly carries sectarian controversies into the Fair and degenerates into a most forlorn controversy of sect which the Fair was designed to be. We are no remedy for, or protection against the action of the Romish Church, or for the Protestant church, and it is a tremendous menace to our institutions, both general and local. It is now clear that the only escape from these consequences is to let the Fair open its doors, and if it only the Fair if it only get the opportunity.

The *Post* fails here to make a correct discrimination as to the part supposed to be played by the different forces and denominations in regard to the World's Fair. The party known as the National League has actually known its demands as to the Sunday closing, and the party has a very strange array of indifference; its requirements is that all shall conform to the customs which all of Christendom are wont to observe, and to allow us to Sunday observance, in the matter of religious opinion upon the Fair. The words of the *Post* would lead one to suppose that the anti-Sabbatarians and the State or would, advocate the more legislative as to the seventh day as it was said in the time for the first. But few Lews, comparatively, have expressed themselves into the subject at all; and wherever they have it has invariably been to advocate Sunday opening, not the observance of religious questions.

So Sabbatarians who are expressing themselves with earnestness in this matter would feel themselves bound to oppose with equal zeal and persistance any suggestion to enforce civilly the observation of the seventh day. They stand, every one of them, for the principle of the strict non-interference of the civil law in matters of religion, and religion only; that the civil authorities have no right to legislate for or against, neither to force or compel to, in derogation of other religion in obedience or religion to religious observances whatever; that human laws can and only have to do with human relations in the domain of a principle of universal application, bearing equally upon every person, and which is upon him who violates it.

The position of the Sabbatarian is as logically against a Saturday law as it is for the protection of the Sunday observer in his rights. But neither the Sabbatarian principle should be maintained; every person has his right to observe or not observe. This is to be expected. The fact of the circumstances for that the principle of his observance seems to be less in point since the American Sentinel "must be preserved" that should govern the managers of the Columbian Exposition in 1892.

demanded for closing the Fair that the "Sabbath" may not be desecrated, will inevitably give publicity to the concern of its aim to whether civilly, or even what day set apart by divine authority for religious worship. Whatever may be the results of such a discussion, the Sunday-rest agitators can not right by right and furnish ammunition for the contention.

The better way would be to act justly, and let every exhibitor follow the dictates of his own conscience. Let the Sabbatarians exhibit his exhibits on Saturday, but compel no one else to do so; let the observer of another day rest on that day, but compel no one else to do so; let any man rest on whatever day he may choose, on any other day that he may choose, but compel no one to choose one of a different mind to do. This is justice; this is democracy; and this should be the policy that should govern the managers of the Columbian Exposition in 1892.

W. A. BLAKELY.
