The Senate Committee on the District of Columbia has decided to report favorably a bill for the better observance of delivery of ice, to the District, on Sunday, as well as on weekdays. The bill permits the sale and delivery between the hours of seven and also at morning the morning out and in the evening, while the House has taken time by the forelock and passed the bill, without so much as a word of debate, excepting that a gentleman from the State of Missouri that hot weather was coming on and the citizens of the state of Washington could sit all summer and might need ice too the Democrats did raise the committees no doubt, even then did not find its way into the published record. This measure is worthy of note as the first distinctive legislation of the Sunday question by either branch of Congress in the present session. The wording of the bill raises the House and Senate between the seventh and the first day, that record in Genesis is wrong and that Sunday is the Sabbath. The importance of this day is this: it converts the broad road to a union of religion and the State into a well-traveled congressional Record. This is the record:

DELIVERY OF ICE ON SUNDAY.

Mr. HEMPHILL. I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the consideration of H. R. 6,692 prohibiting the delivery and sale of ice in the District of Columbia on Sunday.

The bill was read, as follows:

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,*

*That the sale or delivery of ice in the District of Columbia on Sunday is hereby prohibited and any person found guilty thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $25.*

*That any power or commission or connecting for the delivery of ice at any house or place of business in the District of Columbia on Sunday is hereby prohibited, and any person found guilty thereof shall be punished by a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $25.*

The Committee on the District of Columbia recommended the following amendment—in line 2, after the word "Sunday" in line 2:

The following amendment was agreed to:

In line 2, after the word "Sunday," insert "except between the hours of seven and nine in the morning and five and seven in the evening."

The amendment was agreed to; the third reading of the amended bill, and the Speaker pro tem. stated the question on the passage of the bill.

Mr. HEMPHILL. There are two sets of people's asking for this bill, and the ice companies in the city of New York, who also desire the passage of this bill. He said the bill has no opposition in the District of Columbia whatever, and that this bill will relieve others by limiting their work to the hours stated in the bill. This measure ought to pass as it is in the interest of those people who are compelled to work on Sunday delivering ice.

Mr. PICKLER. Why would not one delivery a day on Sunday be enough?

Mr. HEMPHILL. They think that this bill is enough.

Mr. HEMPHILL. And that it will give better satisfaction.

Mr. HARMER. "It is not a bill of interference."

The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time.

Mr. HARMER. They think that this bill is enough.

The Speaker declared that "the two-thirds having voted."

In a division there were—ayes 79, noes 1, not voting.

As the bill was originally introduced in the Senate, the vote was changed so as to read: "A bill for the better observance of Sunday as a day of rest in the District of Columbia."

As it will be brought upon its passage in the Senate soon, no doubt, yet, the Breckinridge Sunday bill; and the discussion will probably demonstrate the existing status of this question before the national law making body before this session shall end by ceasing to deliver ice on Sunday, which has heretofore been done, the different ice companies have said when questioned on its use came into question of how or for such action is their behalf by Congress, that it only arises from among the management of the different companies, each the that the law requires it. This is worthy of note as the first distinctive legislation of the day, and through a monopoly of the district, or that day service it would become the custom. It occurs to the management sometimes, however, that the principal complication is from the fact that the business, using its wagons for general delivery purposes merely, including Sunday, should not become a law.

No, but every fair, big or little, will have been received by the House and the Senate of this same Congress. The Senate has already passed those who are interested in providing the law in the organization of the National Fair of Congresses coming to a consideration of the advisability of closing and presenting a point in regard to reference to the sale of groceries on Sunday. It is evident that on such a matter already model proceedings that have been established, committing Congress to the broad road to a union of religion and the State, will be more and more rapidly and steadily followed by other and more profound proceedings on the same line. When this Congress is much more religious, very much more so, than any one of them would not find the knot to the theory of every member of Congress to make religion so, reality, yet it would yield more readily to the combined pressure of all of its individual pastors and religious teachers.

The petitioning of Congress for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday goes on. Dr. DeCosta at the late Methodist Conference at Omaha bitterly reproached and assailed that small section of the population of the United States asked, through them, that the doors of the Fair should be open. The Fair gates on Sunday, or at least that Congress should not make the appropriation. The claim of numbers, by which the Methodist line up with, about the entire church membership, of all denominations, in the United States, outside of the Roman Catholic Church. These are really legislative minds extraordinarily blind to the patent misrepresentations with which they make. They say or think that if they say it is so, then it is so, or whether it is so or not, and whether they expect, others to agree with them.

The conference, at Omaha, Baptist conference devoted an entire afternoon or evening to the discussion of the Sunday question and adopted a resolution in assertion of the claims of the first day of the week to be observed as a holy day of rest in preference to the seventh day distinctly recognizable from the Scriptures: and were passed in the usual language which characterize the work of officials of the church organization of late, resolving an "approval of the Christian Sabbath," and asking that Congress shut the gates of the Fair on Sunday against Americans with some million dollar boxes of bullion yet unloaded.

For the furtherance of the organized effort to attain national and municipal enforcement of rest on Sunday, a series of conferences is being held in eastern cities for an interest; it has been quite the intention to take the form in the large cities, Washington, in the hope that some stray shot may hit a Congressman or two so as to do as much possible among the legal legislators. A special Sabbath conference has recently been lately convened in New York, in the premises of the Fifth Avenue Baptist, and was incidentally invited to the fashionable church in an otherwise conspicuous church not to an overthrow conspicuous for church activity as the Fifth Avenue. See SENTINEL of May 16. Dr. Parkhurst's rhetorical question was repeated in the interests of his large, pure, audiences. His sentences were near enough to common sense to be quotable. This unlocked for detachment of the church and State rendered it quite original, and endowed Mr. Parkhurst freely, as one who was fairly representative of Washington and New York society. The audience were but very few lawmakers and officials of the city government, but quite freely to the public invitation being accompanied with private solicitation and correspondence. He was a studied philosophical person and the National Association of reform of the District of Columbia which was a Christian lecturer, in which, he talked of how the movement which took for itself a "civil institution," and reached the "conclusion of religion." Dr. Joseph Parker of Haven at "a redeemed commonwealth," Known now to the deeper root of church to "the State the duties of the Church is the conveyance of good morals to the citizens."

It is a great thing to be a holy man, better to be a holy man with a clear head and a clean heart. It is the great thing of life, having faith in God and family, heart to offer respect and love to the family, but if I do not mistake, and I do not, Dr. Parkhurst's particular mission is to the organization of society, and striving to have a pure municipal politics.... One of the best and most practical things that could come out of a holy man tied together in holy relations. There may be differences, but the consciousness of a great common possession of a great church would be to strengthen our every endeavor.

The body of the discourse was an entire statement of how, addresses of the Presbyterian methods for the evangelization of the masses and the purification of society, as an attack upon Tammany and the New York State party organization and the New York police force.

In introducing Dr. Parkhurst, President Harrison stated as much the same by referring to the means used by the Doctor to obtain evidence, in the late cases against political corruption. He declared on behalf of the society for the Prevention of Crime which Dr. Parkhurst heads, that we, Christian citizens of this Capital city, are not all depraved, and that we will have to participate in that shame.

It is safe to say that had all present been ready to agree to any such division with hearty unanimity.

It must have been with mingled feelings that those who consider this a Protestant country listened to the presentation of a funeral pageant in the Senate Chamber of the United States on the occasion of the
