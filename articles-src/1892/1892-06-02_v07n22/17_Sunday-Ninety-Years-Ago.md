The following story comes from Milford, Conn., illustrative of the way in which Sunday laws were enforced in that State ninety years ago:—

Deacon Higby, as tithingman of Milford, was accustomed to sit between sunrise and sunset every Sunday in the front gallery of the old Plymouth Church, on the turnpike in that place. From the window he could command a view of the road for several miles east and west, and if any traveler passed on pleasure or business bent he was halted and compelled to stop over until the sun had set. Vice-President Burr arrived at Milford on Sunday morning. Deacon Higby saw the imposing equipage coming toward the church, and ran out to stop it. The postillons drew up at his word of command, and Mr. Burr asked, "What's the matter?" Deacon Higby told him that he was breaking a law of the State by traveling on Sunday, and that he must put up his horses and wait until sunset. Burr was somewhat astonished at the command, and, after looking at the tall and imposing figure of the tithingman who stood at the horses' heads, he remarked, as if expecting to settle the question: "But I am Aaron Burr, Vice-President of the United States."

The deacon was no respecter of persons. With an obeisance, he replied: "It makes no difference if you are Vice-President of the United States. In the name of the God I serve and the country I honor, I forbid you to pass through this place until the sun has set."

Burr obeyed the command and had his horses put out, and he and his retinue took dinner in Butler's tavern, staying until after the sun went down.

It will be observed that at the time referred to Sunday was reckoned as beginning at sundown on Saturday, and ending at the same time the following evening. This was in accordance with the Bible count of time, now abandoned, however, by Sunday-keepers, possibly on account of the mischief which from the standpoint of Sunday sacredness it makes with the first day meeting, an account of which is given in the twentieth chapter of Acts. Counting from evening to evening, the Troas meeting was held on what we call Saturday night, and the light part of Sunday was spent by the apostle in walking from Troas to Assos, a distance of nineteen miles. That is just what he did; but counting from midnight to midnight as is now the custom gives color to the claim either thoughtlessly or dishonestly made, that the meeting at Troas was on what we call Sunday evening, and that the apostle resumed his journey Monday morning.
