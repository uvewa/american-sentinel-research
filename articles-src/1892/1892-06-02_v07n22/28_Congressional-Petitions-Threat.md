In the Congressional Record, of May 25, under the head of "Petitions," is this suggestive paragraph:

By MR. GREENLEAF: Three petitions, as follows: One from the Presbyterian Church of Brighton, N. Y.; one from the Presbyterian Church at Parma Center, N. Y.; and one from Westminster Presbyterian Church of Rochester, N. Y., in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, in which occur these gently persuasive words, viz.: "Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other that we will from this time henceforth refuse to vote for or support for any office or position of trust any member of Congress, either Senator or Representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair except on conditions named in these resolutions."

This same thing was said quietly in reference to the action of some of the members of the House of Representatives, in the last Congress, on Sunday bills then before them; in this Congress the open threat is made publicly, and to their very faces.
