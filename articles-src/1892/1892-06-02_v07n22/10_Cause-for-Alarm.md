Legal toleration is the mother of illegal intolerance. Illegal laws bring illegal anarchy and materials. Legal religion is the identity of equity and intolerance.

Beside all of allied—Christian, Jew, or infidel, tolerated or conformist, for article X, of the Amendments says:—

There is and can be but one limitation to the exercise of these rights, that is the infringement of the rights of another; for so long as a man does not infringe upon the rights of another, he has the inalienable public right to the employment of his rights. It has also been by included the right is not to exercise those rights if a man shall so choose, are true liberty is upon. Trust any man constitutionally—*Politics, an Editor's Trust.*

MR. MASON, of Chapel Hill, N. C., who was educated at the State University and Trinity College, and was licensed in 1800 from the law school of the late Hon. Court of North Carolina, given utterances to the following sentiments:—

"Where are the Roger Williamses, the Thomas Jeffersons and the Madisons; and their early conditions, the staffs of government in our grand Republic, the Thomas Jeffersons in the affairs of State? The age needs them. The present crisis demands them! Here with hope, three with freedom from error, from the temple of conscience!

"Repeat them!

"Though the martyr days we have made rapid strides in civil and religious liberty, and have contributed our full share to the progress of the liberty of the spirit-thrilled world. This I say, that in our American civilization we have not reached a point in human events described in our history that allows us to write the insignia of religious bigotry and intolerance over our portals. And I say to legislators attempting to do the work of the Church: It is not the Churches' attempted to control the affairs properly belonging to both for them in peace."
