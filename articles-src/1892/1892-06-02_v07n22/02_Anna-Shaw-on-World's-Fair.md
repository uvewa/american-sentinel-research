It is stated that Rev. Anna Shaw was asked to speak at the temperance convention in Boston on the question of opening the World's Fair on Sunday. But the lady had a mind of her own, and promptly replied: "You had better not call on me, for I don't believe in playing into the devil's hands by making Sunday a dull day. I am in favor of opening the Fair on the people's chief holiday."
