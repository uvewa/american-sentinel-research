The House of Representatives, in Committee of the whole, has passed an amendment to the bill appropriating money for the Government exhibit at the World's Fair, conditioned the appropriation on Sunday closing of the Fair by a vote of 130 to 50.

The following from the *Christian Statesman*, of April 19, shows about how much the editor of that paper believes the theory by, in writing for sentiments for Sunday laws, tries to get other people to believe, that physical rest one day in seven is a law of nature, and necessary alike to man and beast. He says:

... on the Sabbath the same becomes, by the use of the same forces, some better, two or three or more at and this.

This editor reminds us of the man who declared that he proposed to always have a pint ready to fight for. He intended to compel everybody to keep Sunday if he has to disregard the day himself, drive horses at a break-neck speed on that day, and yet shake every one of his fatigue our theories about rest.

The Pennsylvania Sabbath Association, according to all the meetings at Pittsburgh, March 29, adopted a resolution strongly supporting the Constitutional amendment of that city for not issuing a Sunday edition. Referring to this fact the *Christian Nation* says:—

The Finsbury papers which issue an edition on Sunday have not shown able to in case for its impression of the paper is concerned, the *Gazette* does no more work on the Sabbath than do many of their critics. The Sabbath starts of the *Gazette*, but they, who day in obtaining editorial, notice and society who day in obtaining editorial, notice and society give in the office at noon on Saturday. While all other papers postpone to Monday morning the printing of the papers on Sabbath, we fail to see why a Sabbath Association should hold its in particular condemnation inducing such a paper. It gives the each journal a good chance to cry out of "type."

The Nation has not yet put very much emphasis on it. The facts not only give "color perhaps a good business to make the city of 'type'" because "the results" which they actually prove hypocrisy.

After it was read lay delegate James R. Cooper, of Babylon, who is Justice of the Peace in that town, took the floor. He said he did not believe in the church manifesting any measures to suppress the violation of the Sunday laws in Long Island City and other towns in Queens County. Justice Cooper said further that the people who flock to Long Island towns on Sundays were principally working people, and that was the only day they had for recreation. They probably drank poor whisky and wore fewer, he said, but they were certainly no worse than the rich people who went on their yachts on Sunday and served champagne with their luncheons.

Action was then taken in regard to Sunday observance, but a resolution was passed at the request of Bishop Whittaker, of Pennsylvania, requesting the officials in charge of the Chicago Exposition to close the place Sunday was adopted.

REV. G. B. Chesbrough attempted to have Congress shut these proceedings that law there has was from freedom of rivers, from that of free actions which they ask. The last court ready of more European counties would hardly have any of this great success.

It certainly was not the intention of the State should observe the "American Sentinel" or any existing law.

It certainly must be very apparent that the interest of the whole of the church and strongly toward a union of this Church and State. The result was the reading of the Methodist Episcopal General Assembly an appeal to the Congress in behalf of its turmoil of cheers and applause which the spectators from these contributing petition that they were captivated by the speaking, and that three of them will join in the church, and then there will be peace, or the Church will have power to order the State, of the people, and that even this will enforce the dogmas of the Church. It is the old history over again.

Conference can so then without objection, act of relation of races and religion of right kind for religion.

The charge made by the *Review* is true; but that has not and does not make either way the less, but just so much greater. Formerly the Catholic Church had a monopoly of political wire-pulling, now nearly all the so-called Protestant denominations are taking a hand so that out of works, but it is no better when done by Protestants than by Catholics. In fact, it is really worse, for that it is does not in defense of God-given rights, but for the sake of obtaining power as religious denominational organizations "over" over night some of other one, but it is growing.

THE Toledo, Ohio, *American* is responsible for this paragraph:—

Cornelius Morris, of Illinois, had said to a reporter for the Washington *Post* that, "Ninety per cent of the working people of America want to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, and bring us under a misapprehension. They, at least today, want the whole of the to have Fair to open on Sunday, and the exhibit of the Fair to be opened on it is yet not decided whether the Fair will be open for religious exercises if the Exposition is closed by opening it up by the Board of Diocesan in the question of keeping it open on Sunday or not in favor of Sunday exercises.

CONGRESSMAN MORRIS, of Illinois, had said to a reporter of the Washington *Post*. that, "Ninety per cent. of the working people of America want to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, and bring us under a misapprehension." They at least today want the whole of the fair to work but it is not yet decided whether the Fair will be open for religious exercises if the Exposition is closed opening it up by the Board of Diocesan in the question of keeping it open on Sunday are not in favor of Sunday exercises.

A STATEMENT of a Methodist Conference of the New York *Christian Advocate* as saying: The heart of this Nation is a Christian heart." It say that this is a Christian heart." To say that it is not to a Christian heart is not the point. The Christian heart beats in the Christian life. Therefore to say that one has a Christian heart is to say that he is in Christ, or, in other words, that he is Christian, and that, not in any secondary meaning, not through a veil or blood, it does not appear to be in truthfulness. Does anybody believe this is true of this Nation?

A STATEMENT in the *Chicago Tribune* "Can Saturday be in Sunday?" The thing is of course quite impossible, but here are a few who think that it gives rise to the question. The facts are briefly as follows:

It is probable that all that Mr. Pinole wanted to establish is that he is to leave every day undisturbed by assessors and their official officers. In this he is clearly right. Every man ought to be left perfectly free to keep every day or no day just as he selects. But this is not to be tied on hand he is required by the law to perform certain, such as rest in anything that he can not conscientiously do; nor on the other hand, if he is compelled to keep a day whether he wishes to or not. No day ought to have any legal standing above another, but the right of every individual is divided ought to be sacred, and no man ought to be required to do on any day what he holds sacred to devotion, any act or others that can be performed on some other day.

Dr. Parkhurst, one gave some of his fellow workers from this experience was that this country could not even be expected to uphold in all that it has in common applied at the present day and that is a different one as this country. This country can not exist as and place among the nations of earth and unite the two government, and the other half the sentiment, that the common people can at any time exercise or a citizen is the Pope or Rome, or his representatives in the United States.

This is worthy of a place alongside the paragraph which we produce elsewhere. Commenting last week, sent to me from Roman Catholic just as free to follow the dictates of his own conscience. The question of them is twofold. These are terrific ministers, it is true, but they are terrific truth. None the less terrific because. And the whole story of remedying the evil except by doing conscientious work stand along the question's progress. The priest that has one rights under the law that Protestant minister has. It is right that they should have. The State is not set for the prizes, or the claims of any denomination.
