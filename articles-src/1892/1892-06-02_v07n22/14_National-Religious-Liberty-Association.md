Bible laws have been around for counting to the original by means of that forty-eight on Sunday May 22, and held 2d bills.

In the various justice courts of New York City eight to ten persons are brought weekly in courts $5, for selling liquor and maintaining open games on Sunday.

Born of the prominent ladies of Cape May, N. J., who are a crusade against the saloons of that place on Sunday. May 29 and scored the arrest of several saloon keepers for "breaking the Sabbath."

The New York Sabbath Committee, through a semi-detective who protested the exhibition of the many detectives who protested the exhibition of the city watchman for Dr. Parkhurst's evidence, takes a crusade against the dime museums and theaters which upon us again, and the prosecution is made of the proprietors of Huber's Dime Museum and Koster & Bial's.

From the favorable report of the District of Columbia bill in the House, the Sunday ice bill for the District of Columbia, H. R. 6692, a bill simply prohibiting the delivery and sale of ice within the District of Columbia "on Sunday between those hours on Sunday." has been passed by the House of Representatives without debate. The bill was acted upon by the District Committee of the Senate, and, it has even reached only for today but passing with the House in the passage of this bill. The action is of this importance since it will establish the principle of Congress acting upon its jurisdiction.

One of them silently the passage of the Sunday ice law bill by the House of Representatives, the *New York Tribune* of the 18th inst., heartily berates of Washington on the charge of "setting an example to the rest of the country in Sunday ice-cream." As good was taken. Whereas all things now considered, together with the legislation taken in the advantage of the slightest act which establishes a beginning of their principles, and the colonial Church and State laws took precedence by default.

*One Pres.*, of May 13, has the following special from Washington:

"Many of the churches are sending petitions to the House of Representatives, praying for some legislation prohibiting the opening of the World's Fair on Sundays."

"Why is the demand made? If these denominations keep Saturday or Monday as a religious day, no such demand would ever have been made by them. It is evident, therefore, that this demand is made because they regard Sunday as a religious day. This proves that this is wholly a religious question; and Congress, therefore, has no right, according to our Constitution, to legislate upon it; even if this day is regarded by law majority as a holy day. If the State is to determine religious questions by the number of its adherents, and put its stamp upon the religion of the majority, then Popery, Paganism and Mohammedanism, as religions have rested, and under the color of which intolerable persecutions and tyrannies have been perpetrated and justified. According to the great American principle in respect to the civil government, religious faith is no part of citizenship, and no criterion of right. Sabbath observers, Sunday observers, and no-day observers, are dealt with on precisely the same terms, the State knowing them only as citizens. We forfeit no right by being one, and gain no right by being the other. It is not within the province of the State to decide which is true or which is false.

The *Chicago News* says, "The World's Fair is open on Monday," and publishes the following editorial item in regard to this matter:

"It would be just as well for those persons—and there are hundreds of thousand of them in the United States—who are trying to bring the Sunday closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, to bear in mind that the very thing that has happened which they feel was apprehended. The art galleries and churches, and similar exhibits at the World's Fair are open every Sunday and hundreds of dollars of every cent at interest are gathered up, upon the payment of the established fee. The World's Fair Directors have thus decided this matter for themselves, and the question is only to be recommended, by Congress, by great religion and ordinary and many other difficulties beyond this discussion.

It may well be asked: Are the World's Fair Directors above the law? Can they set the voice of the Nation in this matter? There is little evil between the general powers of the Columbian corporation and the general government? Until the fully covered metropolitan shall be thrown open in its full and completeness shall the authorities of the land now under debate by the whole Nation is not, of course, with final decision rest.

Shall the present condition of Saturday night seeing at Jackson Park be accepted and go further?

The World's Fair opens on Sunday. It is a condition, not a theory, that confronts us."

The *Chicago News* is an humble follower of the *Mail* and *Express*, and would as much advocate the closing of all the parks in the Sunday visitors. Ordinarily, in pleasant weather, Jackson Park is filled on Sunday with thousands of sight-seers. Shall the fact that a World's Fair is to be held in the Park preclude their going there on Sunday for a year and a half?

In the *Congressional Record*, of May 21, under the head of "Petitions" is this suggestive paragraph:

By Mr. GROUTNEY: Three petitions, as follows: N. Y., one from the Presbyterian Church at Parma Center, Ohio and others, World's Temperance Party, closing the World's Fair on Sunday, in which cover the entire petition which prayed to be presented. That we do hereby pledge ourselves and each other to use every means and influence that we can individually bring to bear, to secure the defeat of any man for Congress, either Senator or Representatives, of any State legislature, or any appointment of any kind to the World's Fair.

The *Hartford Times*, of May 21, has the following paragraph, under the title: "It is an Intimidation.”

"Many of the churches are sending petitions to the House of Representatives, praying for some legislation prohibiting the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday."

The *Sabbath Recorder*, a prominent organ of the American Seventh-day Baptists, speaks approvingly editorially upon the Sunday-closing discussion, and in its issue of May 26, has the following special from Washington:

We may look for one result from the discussion of the Columbian Exposition Sunday closing question: The American public is being "thoroughly" instructed in regard to the fact that the Seventh day is the Sabbath; and that the first day of the week is not. That is a good thing: when men who try to combat the change of the Sabbath from the seventh day into the first will be fighting windmills. It was truly a great event to have it publicly proclaimed. There is no way to deny this fact.

These are the historical facts and arguments and motifs that are entitled by the themselves and the facts. It is the Sabbath that constitutes the World's Fair on the first day of the week.

These facts themselves are right and the right, but national that their opponents should bring to light the full along the whole history and to have that upon that point. Hence, Although the sacredness of the day has no real bearing on whether or not the Fair should be closed on Sunday, yet the re-

In the proposed closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, we feel compelled to bear in mind that the very thing that happened which they feared. really want the fine art galleries, and similar exhibits; halls, open, so that people may read them; through them, just to they do through all the art galleries in the cities. As for running the big machinery, that has never been contemplated by anybody.

"Those again some people claim that if the Exposition is not shut down one day, all of the employees will have to work on to seven a week. The facts in the matter are that no employee can work beyond eight hours. An additional force of employees would be kept in attendance on Sundays in order to run the machinery. As far as I can learn, the laboring element of Chicago and the surrounding towns, is unanimously in favor of keeping the gates open on Sundays. It is inconceivable that it is proposed to abolish public worship, at Jackson Park, and hold religious services in the buildings if the gates are opened.

"During the summer months more than 50,000 working people visit Jackson Park every Sunday, to enjoy the cool breezes and the pleasant leisure. They went there before the World's Fair was thought of."

At the annual convention of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, May 5, held in St. Paul's Cathedral, Garden City, L. I., a special committee on Sunday observance handed in its report.

After it was read lay delegate James R. Cooper, of Babylon, who is Justice of the Peace in that town, took the floor. He said he did not believe in the church manifesting any measures to suppress the violation of the Sunday laws in Long Island City and other towns in Queens County. Justice Cooper said further that the people who flock to Long Island towns on Sundays were principally working people, and that was the only day they had for recreation. They probably drank poor whisky and wore fewer, he said, but they were certainly no worse than the rich people who went on of their yachts on Sunday and served champagne with their luncheons.

Action was then taken in regard to Sunday observance, but a resolution was passed at the request of Bishop Whittaker, of Pennsylvania, requesting the officials in charge of the Chicago Exposition to close the place Sunday was adopted by consensus.

A STATEMENT in the *Chicago Tribune* of Sunday, the 15th all, is headed: "Can Saturday be in Sunday?" The thing is of course quite impossible, but here are a few who think that it gives rise to the question. The facts are briefly as follows:

VALPARAISO, Ind., May 15.—The status of the Sabbath question in the vicinity has been demonstrated in the courts. Charles Pinole, a barber, was arrested some time ago and on the basis of his signatures or a commitment black Saturday, the important feature is, inherent in the discussion country that the matter now the migration to it establish that Sunday or the Newbie had little to decide.

It is probable that all that Mr. Pinole has raised to establish is that he is here to keep every day's untroubled by assessors and their official officers. In this he is clearly right. Every man ought to be left perfectly free to keep every day or no day just as he selects. This he is not to be not to be tied on hand he is required by the law to perform, certain that it rests in anything that he can not conscientiously do; nor on the other hand, if he is compelled to keep a day a holiest he wishes to or not. So day ought to have any legal standing above another, but the right of every individual is ought to be sacred, and no man ought to be required to do as any day what he holds sacred to devotion, any act or others that can be performed on some other day.

The *Catholic Review*, of May 28, has the following note:—

"The Methodist Conference rose to say that the Catholic Church is trying to influence politics in this country; and that is wrong, very wrong. As they say, for it is so. But it seems to be all right if for them, to put the pressure of their organization on the course of public affairs. Their General Conferences pronounced against the Chinese exclusion bill, resolved that the education of the children in the public schools must be free from religion, applauded Senator Quay for the suppression of the Chinese, and that among the Indians of the West should receive an equal share of the Government fund. Of course, if the Catholic Council were to do these things, it would be “meddling in politics,” but the Methodist
