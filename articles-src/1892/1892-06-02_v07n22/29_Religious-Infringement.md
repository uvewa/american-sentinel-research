The Washtenaw Times, of May 21, has the following paragraph, under the title, "It Is an Infringement":

"Many of the churches are sending petitions to the House of Representatives, praying Congress for legislation prohibiting the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday.

"Why is the demand made? If these churches kept Saturday or Monday as a religious day, no such demand would ever have been made by them. It is evident, therefore, that this demand is made because they regard Sunday as a religious day. This proves that this is wholly a religious question, and Congress, therefore, has no right, according to our Constitution, to legislate upon it, even if this day is regarded by the majority as a holy day. If the State is to determine religious questions by the number of its adherents, and put its stamp upon the religion of the majority, then its ground is that on which all State religions have rested, and under the color of which religious proscription and persecution have been perpetrated and justified. According to the great American principle in respect to the civil government, religious faith is no part of citizenship, and no criterion of right. Sunday observers, Saturday observers, and no-day observers, are dealt with on precisely the same terms, the State knowing them only as citizens. We forfeit no right by being one, and gain no right by being the other. It is not in the province of the State to decide which is true or religious or respect."
