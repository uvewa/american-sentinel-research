The Sun, of May 25, has the following special dispatch from Norwich, Conn.:—

Thirteen young men, most of whom belong in Norwich, went trout fishing in Voluntown on Sunday, May 1, twelve miles east of this city, in the wilds of eastern Connecticut, and a grand juror of that town, who takes care of the peace of the town, arrested the whole band, charging them with violating an old Blue Law of the State which forbids fishing on Sunday. He let them come home, but to-day they had to drive twelve miles to Voluntown to appear in court. They paid fines and costs amounting to thirteen dollars each.

Gradually the colonial laws in reference to religious observances are being revived. At the present rate of progress in this respect, it will be but a few years before we shall see a repetition of early colonial days in this regard.
