A member of the Methodist Conference at Omaha, is reported by the New York Christian Advocate as saying; "The heart of this nation is Christian. The American heart is a Christian heart." To be Christian is to be Christlike, or like Christ. Therefore to say that one has a Christian heart is to say that he is like Christ, or, in other words, that he is a Christian, and that, not in any accommodated sense, but in deed and in truth. Does anybody believe this is true of this nation?
