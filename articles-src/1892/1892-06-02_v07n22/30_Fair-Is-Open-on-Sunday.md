The Chicago News says, "The World's Fair is open on Sunday," and publishes the following editorial item in regard to the matter:

It would be just as well for those persons—and there are hundreds of thousand of them in the United States—who are trying to bring about the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, to bear in mind that the very thing against which they protest is now in full operation. The gates of the World's Fair are open every Sunday and hundreds of sight-seers go to it. They are readily admitted upon the payment of the established fee. The World's Fair Directors have thus decided the matter of the Sunday opening, while the whole country, represented by Congress, by great religious gatherings and many other influential bodies, is still debating the matter.

It may well be asked: Are the World's Fair authorities justified in forestalling the judgment of the Nation in this matter? There is little real difference between the present arrangement at Jackson Park and that which will be in force if the fully erected enterprise shall be thrown open to visitors on Sundays a year hence.

Because of this action of the Directors the question now under debate by the whole Nation is not, "Shall the World's Fair be open on Sunday?" but, "Shall the present condition of Sunday sight-seeing at Jackson Park be changed after the formal opening of the World's Fair?"

The World's Fair is open on Sunday. It is a condition, not a theory, that confronts us.

The Chicago News is an humble follower of the Mail and Express, and would no doubt advocate the closing of all the parks to Sunday visitors. Ordinarily, in pleasant summer weather, Jackson Park is filled on Sunday with thousands of sight-seers. Shall the fact that a World's Fair is to be held in the Park preclude their going there on Sunday for a year and a half?
