The claim so often made that Sunday laws are necessary for the preservation of the public health is utterly without foundation and unsupported by fact. The whole claim is a pretense, a transparent fraud, and nothing more, and is but a covert and dishonest scheme for the control of one's thought of thought, and to repeal the half of personal liberty. It has nothing whatever consistent with the religious power. Let it go at that.

BECAUSE those who are working so hard for the closing of the World’s Fair on Sunday, are so bitter in denunciation of the sacredness of the day, they, lazy, claim that this is an altogether civil question, of view, seem to think that all are so and that there is nobody who understands the Sunday institution itself. But it has already been shown in these columns that the sacredness of Sunday does not affect the question in the remotest degree. If the Sunday institution was clothed with all the sanctity that even can be claimed for it by the most devout Sunday worshiper, still it would be entirely beyond the province of the civil power to enforce it at the Columbian Exposition, or close by law anything by virtue of that sanctity.

The basis for opposition to Sunday closing of the Fair is that it is a step taken by Christianity generally to compel compliance with their demands, irrespective of the charges in the Fair, “which is the very notable and intelligent discussions of the merits and practicability of the institutions at the Fair to be opened or not, and to the claims of the religious community in the matter that every one shall keep a holy day,”—and to direct the Fair shall be closed. From the first, however, the Sunday question was started in earnest, and by zealous partizanship on its behalf, was it not the stated purpose of the National Legislature to determine as to the opening of the fair or not? Of course not. “All men are created equal,” and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Men are not equal to those who have no happiness.

But God has given us nothing relating to these particular rights, and whatever a government has to do in the premises is to protect them if it falls in duty to the government to protect these rights, every man has a capacity for ministry, however small, must have its absolute independence to that degree, that these rights may not be transferred to another. Article IX., amendment.

The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny others retained by the people.

We are thus any other rights not mentioned or named in the bill. But who are the conservators of these rights? Is it the churches? Most certainly not. As these are the despotic rights, they in right
