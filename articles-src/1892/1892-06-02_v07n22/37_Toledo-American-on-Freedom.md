The Toledo, Ohio, American is responsible for this paragraph:—

One of Abraham Lincoln's strongest and truest utterances was that this country could "not exist half free and half slave." This aphorism can be applied at the present day and to a different condition of circumstances, with the same force and truth. This country can not exist and hold its place among the nations of earth with half its people free to follow the dictates of their own consciences, and the other half under the domination of the Romish priesthood, whether the head of the Church is the Pope at Rome, or his representatives on this side of the Atlantic.

This is worthy of a place alongside the paragraphs which we quoted from Our Country last week. Are not Roman Catholics just as free to follow the dictates of their consciences as are other people? They are terribly mistaken, it is true, but that is their business. There is no possible way of remedying the evil except by doing missionary work among that deluded people. The priest has the same rights under the law that Protestant ministers have. It is right that they should have. The State is not set for the protection of its citizens against false doctrines.
