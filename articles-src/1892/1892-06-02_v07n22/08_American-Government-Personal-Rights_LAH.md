The Declaration of Independence was written in 1776, but the real Constitution was not adopted until the year 1787, and did not go into effect until March 4, 1789. But we may be thankful that there were men at that time who foresaw the dangers that freedom had occasion to look to. "It will study all of these together. These were the most remarkable of all human documents; under these we have grown to be the freest, the most enlightened Nation, the admiration of the world. All honor to the Founders!

What makes the best Government? Our fathers held that the securing of these rights of this Republic are civil and religious liberty, not merely toleration. Therefore, it is a recognized principle that religion is, of right, no part of the civil government.

"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

The first principle to aid the State to the people is old as the race.

Natural or civil rights of any man: "All men are created equal." That is they are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Men are not equal as to size.

But God has given us nothing relating to these particular rights, and whatever a government has to do in the premises is to protect these rights, and whatever a government it falls in duty to the government to protect these rights, every man has a capacity for ministry, however small, must have its absolute independence to that degree, that these rights may not be transferred to another. Article IX., amendment:

The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny others retained by the people.

We are thus any other rights not mentioned or named in the bill. But who are the conservators of these rights? Is it the churches? Most certainly not. As these are the despotic rights, they in right

need is a perfect law to make men perfectly good.

The Psalmist says: "The law of the Lord is perfect." They say of the Mr. Gaudi, a district secretary of the National Reform Association, says: "Not to the natural law and recognize God's authority over us," nations; this perfect law and make everybody perfectly good? Ah! Mr. Gaudi in his oration On the Obligation to enact by righteousness [goodness] upon, by the Law this Christ it is dead in the law, If of there has not in ages been a law that could give life, then righteousness should have come by the law. But the law does no man [is] justified [made righteous] in the sight of God. . . . Whereas by the law is for, the just shall live by faith," and the law is not of faith. Here we see told positively that even the holy law of God, to think that the laws of men, which never made men good, or compel them to do their duty to God, Paul says; "I do not frustrate the grace of God; for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is died in vain." Therefore it is evident that those who are trying to make men do their duty to God, by the law, are endeavoring "to frustrate the grace of God." And whatever Christian men who are engaged in his attempt to "set up the moral standard of the Nation higher than it now is," it would only be to "frustrate the grace of God." Righteousness cannot come by law, but by Jesus Christ.

*An Appeal Appears to Principle.*

The associated press reports of the proceedings of the Methodist Conference as follows:

*Dr. J. M. King, of New York, a leading counselor of the Church of South, presented the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States in relation to the various educational issues. It invites the cooperation of all good citizens in the contest for educational morals, and invites their encouragements, and to define the attitude of the denomination. It protests against the appropriation of any national revenues concerning that any appropriation sectarian education was not in accord with the principle expressed in the preamble to our Constitution regarding the education of the Indians. Dr. King spoke earnestly in the educational aid in various lands his work being done. He believed it was a great cause, and it required some $10,000. He wanted the whole church and all its people to rally to the cause.*

When Mr. King and Mr. King and Mr. Allen, Butler championed this amendment. And then there was the following interesting reading; the judiciary notice some time ago, in reply to the Constitution in reply to its opponents of the passage of this amendment, Mr. King said that it was a "speculative" upon it for financial question," therefore, of course, being of that restricted application, it could apply only to money transactions between the Government and individual churches or denominational institutions. According to that interpretation this proposed amendment would be to bar the use of money by the general Governments for the advancement of the work of any particular sect, and not supersede that divers popular religion compelled from different denominations, for the attainment of which is one of the purposes of the religious Congress to be held at the World's Fair.

Dr. Dunn chairman of the National League for the Preservation of American Institutions has given the following thought to the use and applicability of that purpose, beyond the general purpose of locking the treasury doors against the Roman Catholic Church, does in just the view they have taken of it,—that the States and the general Government being debarred from showing financial favor to different or individual denominations, the view would be paved toward the furtherance and establishment of that secular form of religion which they fondly hope will be developed and run in this country as the Christian religion. These men who are moving for the adoption of this constitutional amendment and have associated with it such reformation, are all of them members of the National League, the passage by Congress of any measure which alone the Sentinel League and National Reform, Allen, and the rest of the gentlemen of the National League, are staunch supporters of the enforced reading of the Bible in the public schools, and the King James or the Revised Version, though they would be ready to reply to a doubt, if necessary, to shut out the Pope. And “if the reader will look up this League and its origin,” it will be found that this League are members of, and sympathizers with the National Reform Association and the American Sabbath Union. This seems to be the practical advocacy of this proposed constitutional amendment, in a special case. The application of the general principle is the very best thing to which they hope would merit. They would even prefer that the Roman Catholic Church should continue to receive the lion’s share of the public funds.
