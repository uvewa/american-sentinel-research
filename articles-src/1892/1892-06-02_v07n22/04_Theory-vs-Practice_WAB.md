One of the stock arguments used by those who advocate Sunday laws from a so-called "civil" standpoint, is to the effect that large numbers of workmen who are "compelled" to labor on Sunday, to prevent further abuse of Sunday and therefore need a law freeing them from "Sunday slavery," as those who prefer indulgent and ordinative style it.

This is patronizing, pure and simple, and if carried out, would make slaves instead of those who are now free. All the law that any free man needs to protect him in this matter, and which enters justly into the case as it now stands, can not compel any man to work against his will. It rests entirely with himself whether or not he shall work, either on Sunday or any other day of the week.

But a law be passed, forbidding labor on Sunday and what then becomes of his freedom of will? It has been taken from him by despotic authority, and so far as Sunday is concerned, "Thenceforward" he has no choice in the matter. He may rest, but must rest whether he desires to or not. Between the two evils of compulsory labor and compulsory idleness, a sensible man must certainly choose the former, especially as there is no such thing as "compulsory labor" in the sense in which the term "compulsion" is regard to be work exists only in the minds of those who advocate Sunday laws. Between the two—compulsory rest, would, according to the advocates of Sunday laws, be properly denominated; and tyranny that blinded bigots have been in enforcing entails law is right.

But as the question of fearfulness of *Sunday rest* is concerned, it need only be said that it is not within the province of the civil law to compel any individual is injuring his health by overwork. Thousands of men of over the land are destroying their business have so as to press upon their mind that they are growing rich; others, both employers and employed, themselves in various ways that they set the standard of their own destruction; yet the law takes no notice of these cases. The law does not protect a man from himself a thousand times over, for the very simple, yet sufficient, reason that the government is not ordained for the regulation of such matters. Wherever any secular government leaves its legitimate work, to tamper matters not of personal privacy (Sunday laws included), it ceases to be pure government and becomes an engine of oppression.

But let us notice a little further, the claim that the workingman deprived of labor is injurious to health, etc. The writer recently visited a small manufacturing village in which is located a manufacturing plant which works its employes on the same system which requires the labor of more than a thousand men, and six or ten days a night the year round. Much of the work is unnecessary heavy and hard, I saw no place where, a man's health would break down, caused, nor less this institution to rest on Sunday. And yet, justice compels the statement that nothing in stores is more a solvent and hearty assemblage of men than are engaged in work at that place.

Another man of whom I inquired recently, he informed me that he had worked as a machinist in a cotton mill for twenty-one years, that he had not suffered a day's illness. Not only so, but he stated that he had only been absent *two days during the entire time.* To my inquiries as to whether his was not an exceptional case, he replied that it was not.
