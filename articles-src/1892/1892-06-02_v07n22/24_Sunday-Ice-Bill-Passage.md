Upon the favorable report of the District Committee of the House, the Sunday ice bill for the District of Columbia (H. B. 8367), entitled "A bill prohibiting the delivery and sale of ice within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday," has been passed by the House of Representatives. The same bill has been favorably passed upon by the District Committee of the Senate, and it now remains only for the Senate to concur with the House in the passage of this bill, and Congress will have fully entered upon its course of religious legislation.
