THE Observer of this city comments thus sadly upon the fact that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is to continue open to the public Sunday afternoons:—

The people who now go to the museum on the Sunday could largely attend during the week, and there is no more reason than there ever was for the Sunday opening. That it has come to stay is not at all unlikely. Encroachments on the Sabbath are becoming more and more frequent, and the continental Sunday is not unlikely to be a settled institution of American life ere the present century closes.

Possibly the Observer might find some consolation in the facts stated recently in the Sabbath Outlook that Sunday was always a holiday rather than a holy day; and that having adopted it, rather than the Sabbath of the Lord, its friends could not reasonably object to its festival character.
