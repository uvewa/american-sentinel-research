THE Washington Post gives some condensed information in reference to the "King's Daughters," an organization now in open affiliation with the National Reform Association and the Sabbath Union, which is of interest:—

"The great Order of the King's Daughters is carrying on its work of organization as rapidly as possible in the different States. Something of the phenomenal growth of the order may be gathered from the reports of these organizations' secretaries. A little more than a year ago the first State Secretary was appointed in Massachusetts, and there are now chronicled in her report the names of 443 circles, with a membership of 6,534. There are twelve denominations represented, working along fifteen lines of work. Connecticut has had a State Secretary for a year and a half and enrolls 1,000 members in 100 circles. It is not yet five years since the first silver cross on its purple ribbon was carried over the border into Canada, and now in the Province of Ontario, circles of King's Sons and Daughters flourish in fifty cities, and contain a membership of 1,800 people. South Carolina has 1,633 members, and Illinois a registry of 3,782. Day nurseries, kindergartens, free employment bureaus, reading rooms, rest cottages, and other lines of work as varied as the ingenuity of the human brain will admit are formulated and carried to successful issue by this Legion of King's Daughters In His Name."
