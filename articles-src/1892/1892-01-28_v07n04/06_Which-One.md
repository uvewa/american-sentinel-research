There is a saying that when the original knot is tied and the train are pronounced man, then the struggle begins to know which one. This is not true when man and woman are truly married, and love ties the knot. The reason this is not true is because God said, that the woman is part of the man, out of a part of the man, to be a part of the man. Either one alone is incomplete. God said, “It is not good that man should be alone.” If this was said even before the woman was made, and the averages experience, and development of ancient manhood, had proved it to be, at least equal true of the woman. The two together, and it takes both to constitute a whole man, capable of fulfilling all the functions, and realizing the ideal for which the race was created.

Now it is by no means chance that the Church in the Bible is always represented as a woman. The metaphors of the Bible carry with them a deep and consistent meaning, that our highest comprehension of them. The true Church of Christ, with its longing love, and tender sympathy and gentle ministration, is in the word as a true woman is in a proper relation, elect. The sympathetic voice, the tender touch of graceful ministration to the suffering soul, are essentially feminine. The world and its kingdoms are only represented in the Bible by the cold metallic models of a man, and by the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the ram, and powers of the earth.

Surely why not marry the Church with the world? Because she was made for the world. Sad the Saviour, “Ye are not of the world as I am not of the world.” If ye were of the world the world would love his own; “but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” Again the admonition is, “Love not the world, neither the things of the world. If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him.”

It is therefore evident that the Church was not made for the world, as the wife for her husband. Or the objects of the true Church has been won by God’s mighty love out of the world, and separated as a Church, into its Church. 1 Cor. 1:2. Its complete man not by uniting Army’s is Arm to minister to, in his earthly ambitions and passions, but by lifting him into them, and uniting him in Christ, in whom is all the fullness of the Godhead, and in whom all his completeness is found. For the Church, to earthly governments is, therefore, not only to rob Christ of his bride, and drag her down from through futile depths of pollution, to the adulterous commerce of the world, but it is to go about a union where there can be no genuine love.

The world hates the Church, and the true Church can not love her world. She may love the individuals in the world, and long to lift them up to union with Christ, but she can not love the world. Both a union can only be set of the dictation of force and passion; and when marriage takes place for these reasons, it is for secular reasons, and not to the liking of God of the uniting parties. Moreover when such a union takes place, the struggle always begins, at once, to know over which shall be the one, for they are not really “united,” but —

Thus and since objects and ambitions are different, and not only different, but conflicting. The conflict is immediate in the union and it can result in only one of two ways. Wh the conflict is for the best that can be in a compromise between the Church and the State,—a compromise which neither party regards as entirely satisfactory and that, and so, with plotting and counterplotting, the struggles are never at of “at rest”. If it is never settled at all, it is either by the total subjection of the Church to the State, or by the total subjection of the State to the Church. The total subjection of the State to Rome under the emperors, where religion was utterly prostituted to political interest, the latter to the Papacy of the twelfth century, with the so-called wars of Christ, but the real vices of the devil.

The supposed. The world knows that both of these systems are not to be tried again, but the experiment repeated. Either of them if carried out to complete results can only be destructive of the true Church from the earth. It is either a false State, and false Church, where the soul of man cannot live the life of God, or it is a false Church in the State where the bodies of men can be provided from persecution and punished for. No wonder Roger Williams said of body-killing, soul-killing, and State-killing doctrines.
