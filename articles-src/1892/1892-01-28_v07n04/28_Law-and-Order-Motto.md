IN leading in the fight against the publishers of Sunday papers in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the Christian Statesman says:—

A Sunday newspaper office in this State and most others, is a "speak-easy," a place doing business contrary to law. Let it be remembered that the Law and Order motto is, "We ask only obedience to law." The opposite creed is anarchy.

And this has ever been the motto of intolerance and bigotry. The pagans, in persecuting to the death the early Christians, had no other motto; they simply demanded obedience to the law of Rome. And in every country where Christian blood has been shed and Christian hearts wrung with anguish, because of the inhumanity of man to man, the same plea has been made, "We are only enforcing the law." This was all that was done in Tennessee in the case of the late R. M. King, hounded from court to court and finally to his death, for the offense of quietly plowing in his field upon a day that his neighbors professed to regard as sacred to the worship of God, but which they were not careful to keep holy themselves.

It is a weak cause that fights shy of the merits of the case and pleads that it is only "enforcing the law." If the editors of the Christian Statesman will consult an old book known as the "Acts of the Apostles" they will find in the fifth chapter eminent precedent for disobeying an unjust and iniquitous law. In this case the Law and Order League of Jerusalem were only trying to enforce the law, and certain apostles of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ were the "anarchists," who not only violated the law but declared their intention to violate it. We do not say that the case of the Pittsburg papers is equally meritorious, but the example of Peter and John should forever close the mouths of those who call themselves Christians, to the poor plea, they are only "enforcing the law." The law should be justified by an appeal to the principles of right and justice or it should go to the wall.
