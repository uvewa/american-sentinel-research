REPRESENTATIVE SPRINGER, of Illinois, has presented in the House the memorial of the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, and their proposed amendment to the Constitution, which reads as follows:—

No State shall pass any law respecting the establishment of any religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used, for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination, or religious society, or undertaking which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.

It seems pertinent to inquire, if this should be incorporated in the Constitution of the United States, what would become of the religious laws already on the statute books of the different States, and what bearing would it have on the different appropriations for the World's Fair, should the many petitions to Congress be heard, and that pass partially under ecclesiastical control?
