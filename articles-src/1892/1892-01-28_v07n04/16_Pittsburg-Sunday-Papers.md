THE Pittsburg dispatches of January 17 chronicle the progress of the attack on Sunday newspapers by the Law and Order League thus:

"Sunday papers were sold all over Pittsburg and Allegheny, as usual, to-day. Thomas Matthews, who was fined $25 and costs yesterday, for sales of three weeks ago, has appealed the case, and will have it carried to the Supreme Court. He disposed of all the papers he could get his hands on to-day, people going out of their way to buy from him. New York, Philadelphia, and other eastern papers were handled as usual at the Union News Company's stands. The Company had forty employees at work.

"Superintendent R. R. Burke has returned from New York, and says General Manager Williams advises him to co-operate with the Pittsburg newspapers in fighting the Law and Order Society."
