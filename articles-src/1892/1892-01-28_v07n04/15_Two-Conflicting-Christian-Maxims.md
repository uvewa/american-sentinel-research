A CORRESPONDENT of the Twentieth Century finds what he denominates "Two Conflicting Christian Maxims," that is: 1. "Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do." 2. "Keep the World's Fair closed on Sundays."

To find the reason for the discrepancy between these two expressions is not an unprofitable mental exercise. It may be found that one of the "maxims" is not Christian.
