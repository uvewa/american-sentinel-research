THE following is a despatch from Paris, France:—

"There is a movement on foot here to secure the popular observance of Sunday, and a very strong society has been formed to further this cause. The honorary President of the society, Senator Jules Simon, said to-day, 'We desire that our workmen may have a day's rest once a week, and Sunday is naturally the day we have chosen. But our undertaking is a difficult one, because it runs counter to numerous customs and interests which do not like to be interfered with. At present our factory hands and shop people work not only during the long hours of every week day, but also on Sundays. We do not wish to forbid people working on Sunday if they wish to do so, but we aim to prevent them from forcing other people to work."

"M. Leon Say, the eminent political economist and deputy, who is President of the society, said: 'Our society is the result of a congress of social economists, held in Paris during the exhibition of 1889. It was then unanimously recognized that a weekly day of rest is indispensable to the working masses. We do not ask for legislation, but depend entirely for success upon the power of persuasion. And it can not be said that we have hitherto labored in vain. Two years ago our society numbered twenty persons; to-day we count over twenty-five hundred members, made up of Republicans and Monarchists, Catholics and Protestants, bishops and freethinkers. We have already achieved some practical results. In the post-office we have got the hours shortened on Sunday, and we are now laboring with the railroad companies.'"
