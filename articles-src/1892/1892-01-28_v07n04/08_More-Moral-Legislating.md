Ask Mr. Alexander, of North Carolina, comes forward with another bill intended to put an end to “gambling” in agricultural products. “Gambling,” is as defined in the practice is not unlike a contract to deliver or receive at some future time any product of the soil, such as cotton, wheat, corn, oats, etc., the contractor not being at the date of the contract the actual owner of the product in store.

In some, anything, that has been said against any preceding bills of the same sort applies with equal force to Mr. Alexander’s bill. The end sought in all of them is quite beyond the reach of legislation; not actually destructive to commerce. A law really capable of suppressing grain the future delivery of cotton would cripple every milling business in the country, and a law capable of achieving the same consummation as regards other agricultural products would paralyze impossible all wholesale commission houses. We would revert to the stage in which the family and family, and community would do commerce without any object larger than a peck measure. The whole thing is preposterous and impossible.

Mr. Alexander, however, does not stop at merely prohibiting the trade. In commerce, he adopts the examples already set up in the case of the lotteries, and provides for the exclusion from the mails of all letters, postal-cards, circulars, and other literature relating to the “gambling” in agricultural products, and of all newspapers, pamphlets, publications, containing advertisements of such business and of market reports of quotations and transactions therein. He even orders that a tax of $1 per word shall be levied on all telegraph and telephone messages used in pursuance of the aforesaid gambling. He does not arrange his forces to the excess of the expense compared to the interest, but that will come if this plan is followed, doubtless. If a man’s wife be dead, he regards his bit as being compensated, though it be not enough already enough, as we say.

We are not surprised at Mr. Alexander’s bill. As the Post has had occasion to observe on various occasions the ideas, it is quite impossible to be sure nothing through a panorama of foolish and mischievous legislation, or proposed legislation, the chief whereof is to make people moral by statutes. First was a bill authorizing and supporting the sovereignty of the States and to destroy the Federal feature of our form of Government. Congress has just as much right to say that newspapers shall not print that they shall or publish anything else, and it will have the same right flair to so say that they shall not advertise any more or however or private banking concerns that deal in stocks and bonds, or life insurance as to guarantee its return or otherwise gambling or in his own, that the whole, we are not sure that it wouldn’t be well to have all these points covered by legislation at once. The sooner the country realizes the folly of it, the sooner we shall return to wholesomeness and rational methods.—*Washington, January 17.*
