THE Union Signal remarks that "epidemics of typhus fever and small-pox in various localities are adding to the horrors of famine in Russia; as if this were not enough, officials are misappropriating funds for the relief of the sufferers; government now refuses to grant permission for private distribution of food, or soup houses. Meanwhile the Czar continues his efforts to stamp out all religions except the Greek Church; his latest step in this direction being the closing of certain Catholic churches."

Our contemporary should find no fault with the action of the Czar in opposing what he believes to be false religions. He is simply acting on the principle advocated by the whole National Reform fraternity, of which the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has become only an annex.

THE Union Signal item furnishes also an illustration of the fact that State recognition of God and of his law does not make the officers of the State Christian, nor even honest. National Reform, so-called, is advocated in this country as a panacea for all the evils that States are heir to, but it fails to heal in other lands, as is witnessed by this item of news concerning the peculations of the highly pious(?) officials of that Christian(?) sovereign, the Czar, who rules in the name of God—and by his authority just as truly as would the National Reformers in this country were the power which they seek given into their hands.
