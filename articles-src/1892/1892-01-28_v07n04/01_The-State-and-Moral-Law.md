THE State knows no such thing as a real distinction between right and wrong. The State only knows rights and wrongs, and the distinction between these. Men have rights—in the State they have equal rights. For one to infringe the rights of another is to commit a wrong, and the State deals with it only as this kind of a wrong. The State can not make of it any question of real right or wrong in a moral point of view.
