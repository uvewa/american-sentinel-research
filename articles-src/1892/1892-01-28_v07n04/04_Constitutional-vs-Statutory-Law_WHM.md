IN the article entitled "A Constitution Divided Against Itself," in the last issue of this paper it was shown that the fundamental law of the State of Tennessee contained a fatal discrepancy in the antagonism between those sections of the Bill of Rights, treating of freedom of religion and conscience, and sections of a following article which directly contravene these sacred rights which were again, in the sections of a succeeding article, doubly assured by the most solemn legislative reaffirmation known to constitutional form. So serious a flaw as this in the fundamental guaranty of the rights and privileges of the citizens must necessarily extend into that body of statutory law, which is supposed to grow up in complete consonance, in spirit and technical legal agreement, with it. That the statutory law of Tennessee has sections diametrically at variance with Sections 3, 4, and 6 of Article 1, and Sections 15 and 16 of Article 11 of the Constitution of the State, no evidence is needed to prove, other than their quotation. The code of 1884, and the laws of Tennessee 1889, contain the following, bearing upon religious observance:

Chap. 2, Sec. 2289. If any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life, or of causing or permitting the same to be done by his children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, on Sunday, he shall on due conviction thereof before any justice of the peace of the county, forfeit and pay $3.00, one half to the person who will sue for the same, and the other half for the use of the county.

Sec. 2290. Any person who shall hunt, fish, or play at any game of sport, or be drunk on Sunday, as aforesaid, shall be subject to the same proceedings and liable to the same penalties as those who work on the Sabbath.

Sec. 3671. No licensed grocer or other person in this State shall retail spirituous liquors on Sunday. The punishment of this offense shall be fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court.

Chap. 31, Sec. 1. [Laws of 1889.] Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee: The law of this State prohibiting the sale of liquor on Sunday as compiled in section 3671, of Milliken and Vertree's compilation, be so amended as to prohibit the sale on Sunday of any malt, vinous, fermented or other intoxicating liquors, or to keep open on Sunday any place where such liquors are sold or dispensed, and any person offending shall be punished as provided in said act; provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to druggists selling on the prescription of a practicing physician; provided, further, that restaurants and eating-houses where spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors are sold under the license of the law of the State on week days, shall be allowed to conduct their eating department on Sunday, but the barroom shall be closed, and no drinks of any kind sold.

Sec. 3529. Civil process may be issued on the Sabbath, on the application of any party, supported by oath or affirmation, that the defendant is removing, etc.

Sec. 3612. Actions may be abated by plea of the defendant in the following case: Where the process is issued or served on Sunday, except in the cases prescribed in section 2529.

As might be expected, from the constitutional example set, these statutes and laws are not strictly consistent with each other, but while the one forbids the exercising any of the common avocations of life, the other discriminates in favor of law itself and permits the issuance and serving of legal processes in certain specified cases. But this lack of consistency is immaterial, for, in a question of conscience, the interference of civil law is equally an error whether it forbid or enjoin. In this case the statutes do both, and so between the Constitution and the statutory law the entire neutral field is covered, and it has been so contrived that together they have completely nullified that clause of the Constitution which asserts the freedom of conscience, and the right of the citizen to worship as he wills.

The declaration of rights says, in words which none can mistake, that it is the natural and indefeasible right of all men, and of every man, to worship as they will, while the statute declares that all men shall not worship as they will but as the law wills, and it is the will of the law that they shall render the homage of their weekly rest on Sunday, the first day of the week. If the conscience of the Jew, the Seventh-day Adventist, or the Seventh-day Baptist, dictates to him that he shall worship his God by resting from labor on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath of the Lord his God, the statute law of Tennessee interferes and declares that he shall render homage to the statutes of Tennessee, by refraining from work or amusement on Sunday, the first day of the week, the sacred day of the code of Tennessee. Thus the code does "interfere with the rights of conscience" which the Constitution has said is outside the scope of human authority. Ever since the Sabbatic law was given to Adam in Eden there have been those upon the earth who have observed it. They who follow that custom belong to the most ancient "religious establishment" and follow the most venerable "method of worship" upon earth, and yet in spite of this, and in defiance of its constitutional declaration, the State of Tennessee not only gives preference to another mode of worship, but at the same time by so doing, selecting the distinguishing difference between the two as a subject of legislation, distinctly discriminates against the older form. Not only therefore are the rights of conscience contravened, but a preference is given, by law, to one religious establishment and mode of worship over another.

Under these statutes numerous convictions have been had of those who profess no religion and have no respect for the sacredness of any divinely appointed rest day; of those who acknowledge a nominal fealty to what they understand to be the Christian religion, and recognize Sunday observance to be its distinguishing outward mark, though they themselves have failed in strict obedience to it; of those who, in spirit and truth, are loyal to their religious convictions, and render their worship to God upon the seventh day which He commanded, thus remembering the Sabbath day—and, holding in mind the frequent divine remonstrances against sun worship, refuse homage to the day which is the sign of that idolatry, and has been from all time the "wild solar holiday." Upon these three classes the statute law of Tennessee bears with equal inequity; so far as the civil discrimination is against them, and in favor of that class, which recognizes the power of the State to establish a religious rest day and acquiesces in the selection of the day of the sun in which to yield that observance. That the framers of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee dimly perceived the injustice, of which they had convicted the statute law, is in evidence through the insertion, in the Constitution of 1870, of a clause which the previous Constitution did not contain.

ARTICLE II, SEC. 15. No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public on any day set apart by his religion as a day of rest.

The perceptions of these legislators were obtuse to the abstract truth of the principles expressed in Section 3 of the Bill of Rights, and they were unequal to a comprehension of their breadth, but they did see that under the existing statute law an injustice was liable to be done, therefore they inserted this clause in the fundamental law. While this only multiplied still farther the legal inconsistencies of civil interference in religious matters, it shows conclusively that they realized wrong might be done under existing laws, and desired to cure the error as far as they saw it.

Under this section equal and exact justice to all, would of course require that no one be compelled, by law, to rest on any day not set apart by his religion as a day of rest, for this clause establishes by inference the fact that, to the minds of those who drew it, whatever day a man's religion set apart for a rest day was his legal Sabbath, and in their minds the one stood in the same relation, legally, to his Sabbath as the other to his Sunday. The logical deduction from this then is, that as no preference can be shown to either religious view, therefore, if one party is restricted from labor on the rest day of the other, then the other must be restricted from labor on the rest day of the first. The legal obligation is mutual, and if the restriction applies in one case it must in the other. But the reduction of this, to its necessary resultant, only adds to the maze of inconsistencies and antagonisms.

The Constitution of the State of Tennessee is, consequently, divided against itself and the statute law of the State is in antagonism to a principle declared constitutionally fundamental. Decisions have been had along the line of these legal deflections, and a body of precedent has grown up in the State reports, which is the accepted law of the courts, and is now upheld by the decision of the Supreme Court of the State, and the Circuit Court of the United States, irrespective of the question of whether it is in conflict with constitutional principles or not. The conditions resulting from such a legal and judicial situation must deviate more and more from the normal as they develop. It is a question worthy of the serious consideration of constitutional lawyers and jurists, as to where such a course is leading. The people will find the result of vital importance to them when the error has had its perfect work.
