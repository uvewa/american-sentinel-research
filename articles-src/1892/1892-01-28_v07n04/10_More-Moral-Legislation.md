AND now Mr. Alexander, of North Carolina, comes forward with another bill, intended to put an end to "gambling" in agricultural products. "Gambling" is defined as the purchase or sale of a contract to deliver or receive at some future time any product of the soil, such as cotton, corn, wheat, oats, rye, etc., the contractor not being at the date of the contract the actual owner of the product in question.

Of course, anything that has been said against any preceding bills of the same kind applies with equal force to Mr. Alexander's bill. The end sought in all or any of them is quite beyond the reach of legislation not actually destructive to commerce. A law really capable of suppressing contracts for the future delivery of cotton would cripple every milling business in the country, and a law capable of achieving the same consummation as regards other agricultural products would render impossible all wholesale transactions in those lines. We would revert to the spinning wheel and the family loom, and our commerce would be done without any agency larger than a peck measure. The whole thing is preposterous and impossible.

Mr. Alexander, however, does not stop at merely prohibiting the traffic in question. He adopts the example already set up in the case of the lotteries, and provides for the exclusion from the mails of all letters, postal-cards, circulars, and other literature relating to this "gambling" in agricultural products, and of all newspapers, prospectuses, pamphlets, etc., containing advertisements of such business and of market reports of quotations and transactions therein. He even orders that a tax of $2 per word shall be levied on all telegram or telephone messages used in pursuance of the aforesaid gambling. He does not arrange to take charge of the express companies in the same interest, but that will doubtless be done later in an amendment; unless, indeed, he regards his bill as being comprehensive and stringent enough already, as well he may.

We are not surprised at Mr. Alexander's bill. As the Post has had occasion to observe on various occasions hitherto, the country seems to be passing through a paroxysm of foolish and mischievous legislation, or proposed legislation, the object whereof is to make people moral by statute, and the effect whereof is to efface the sovereignty of the States and to destroy the Federal feature of our form of Government. Congress has just as much right to say that newspapers shall not publish "future" quotations as to say that they shall not publish anything else, and it will have the same right later on to say that they shall not advertise liquor houses or horse-races or private banking concerns that deal in stocks and bonds, or life insurance companies where the policy holder gambles on his own death. Upon the whole, we are not sure that it wouldn't be as well to have all these points covered by legislation at once. The sooner the country realizes the folly of it, the sooner we shall return to wholesome and rational methods.—Washington Post, January 17, 1892.
