In arguing, as the National Reformers, of various schools, do, that Christ is now this world’s king, they ignore the teaching of the Scriptures upon the subject, and make their confusion among the many texts that relate to the subject.

It is true that very many scriptures do speak of Christ as king. He is declared to be “King of kings, and Lord of lords.” But that he is each now in the sense of his divine providence, being the ruler of all. But is by no divine revelation, the kingdom of God does not teach. In fact it does assert the contrary, as it is the purpose of this article to show.

Certain texts in the book of Daniel are frequently referred to to prove that Christ is now King of this world. Dan. 2:44; 7:13, 12; yet not to look touches short than they do. The second chapter of the book of Daniel is recorded a vision which was given to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, by providence of a dream, which was subsequently interpreted by Daniel, a prophet of God.

In the vision the most high God. In his dream the king saw a great image with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay.

The different parts of this image, the prophet declared, represented kingdoms. To Nebuchadnezzar he said, “Thou art this head of gold.” Not that Nebuchadnezzar alone was the head of gold. As a head was the kingdom of gold, which he represented. In the kingdom which “is represented in the golden head, he the prophet told the king, ”and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron.”

It is, however, unnecessary for the purpose of this article to take time to identify these kingdoms; they are almost universally held to be Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome. Even the historians Gibbon recognized that this and described Rome amongst all these as the greatest of the peoples, thus—

In the second century of the Christian era, almost all those, almost all those civilizations of the world was held together in a state of habitual reverence to the Dutchess, in train above the countries. Parallel to the dominion of the coast of the ocean, and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, which might serve to represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.

But is, as has been, as before stated, unnecessary to dwell upon the ages past. The reader will great at once that the same and the empires were the ones symbolized by the image, and probably ask what this has to do with the National Reform theory that Christ is now the world’s king. Very much; for in the vision of the image is brought to us was the division of the Christian Church place into ten parts, which was one fourth succession and that its toes thus four hundred years after the first advent of Christ; and it is
