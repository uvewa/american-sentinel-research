THE Christian Statesman has always insisted that in order to make this a Christian Nation the Constitution must be so amended as to place all "our Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land;" but now Dr. Herrick Johnston rises up and argues that the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday because "the Nation is Christian, Christianity is embedded in our national laws, and is recognized in our national usages and appointments. We issue proclamations of thanksgiving, appoint chaplains, administer oaths, and open Legislatures and Congresses in the name of the God of the Sabbath." Now if the Statesman is correct it destroys the Doctor's argument; and on the other hand, if the Doctor is correct the Statesman is without a mission, and has only been fighting wind-mills, lo, these many years.
