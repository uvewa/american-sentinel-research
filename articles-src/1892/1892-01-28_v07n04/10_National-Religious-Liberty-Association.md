NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; for we believe that such legislation must result in the oppression of some who are conscientious in their religious convictions and their civil liberty.

R. C. PORTER

“Till no to permit persons from being forced to labor on Sunday,” in the District of Columbia or its territories has been introduced by Breckinridge, of Tennessee, in the same as that last, a bill introduced by Mr. Morse.

The Iowa Double system and exchanges an saying in the disgrace to the tickets of purpose to Congress for the closing of the World’s Fair on Sunday, that “the entire petition will be to that Congress legislators will be is here known closed on Sunday.”

A CORRESPONDENT of the Penikesh Country finds and reports the following: “Bible from seize inscribed A. D. 1581, in which is to be found the true ‘Sabbath’ that is ‘ . . . . dates from mine inscribed A. D. 1581.”

The law for the means for the testimony between various religious to is not on unprofitable lines. ” It is may be found that that “God is not the author of confusion” is not Christian.

The Pittsburg delegation of January 17 character of the topic of the attack on Sunday newspapers by the Law and Order League thus:

“Sunday papers were with all over Pittsburg and Allegheny, as usual, to-day. Thomas Mathews, who was fine 845 and body costs yesterday, for selling Sunday papers three weeks ago, appealed the case, and will have it carried before the Supreme Court. The dropped of all the papers be noted got the boards of this city, people going out of their way to buy from him. About three times the usual number of papers were handled as usual at the Union News stand, and the paper stands generally throughout the cities were open.

“Representative R. E. Burke has returned from New York, and says General Manager William ask him that to co-work with him in carrying on the fight in fighting the Law and Order League.”

There is a movement on foot here to secure the proper observance of Sunday, and a very strong society has been formed to further this cause. The Stated President of the society elected, is a Episcopalian, said to-day: “We desire that our workers may have a day’s rest once a week, and Sunday is naturally the day for we have chosen. But our undertaking is a difficult one, because it runs counter of numerous national and interests which do not like to be interfered with. At present our factory hands and shop people work not only during the long hours of every work day, but also on Sundays. We do not wish to forbid people working on that day if they wish to do so, but we ask no power to them from forcing other people to work.”

“Mr. Leon Say, the eminent political economist and deputy, who is President of the society, said the society was the result of a congress of all the economists, held in Paris during the exhibition of 1889. It was then unanimously recognized that a man’s day of rest is indispensable to the toiling masses. We do not ask for legislation, but depend on changing the habits of society. We are growing, And it can not be said that we have hitherto labored in vain, because at the time of the revolution of twenty years; to day we count over twenty five hundred members, made up of Republicans and Monarchists, Catholics and Protestants, Bishops and workingmen. We have already achieved some remarkable results. In the post-office we have got the hours shortened on Sunday, and we are now laboring with the railroad companies.”

REPRESENTATIVE Stump, of Illinois, has presented a petition from the League for the Protection of American Institutions, and that they proposed amendments to the Constitution, which reads as follows:

He thinks shall pass any law respecting the inherent of any religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof to or use of its property for religious purposes or the right of any therein. A bill has been introduced in Congress by Mr. of for, for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding by appropriation of public lands or otherwise “supporting” in any religious or scientific education, or religious society, or undertaking which is wholly or in part under scientific or religious or religious control.

As seems pertinent to inquire, if this should be incorporated in the Constitution of the United States, what would become of the religious laws now in force in many States? If the Congress has no right to legislate on this question; and what bearing would it have on the different petitions asking Congress to close the World’s Fair on Sunday? If Congress has no constitutional authority to legislate on any religious question, what right have individuals to send many petitions to Congress on hand, and that just this is the kind of class legislation asked.

At the annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union recently held in Springfield, more work and about the persistent influence of the Sunday paper. It was even argued that the city of Springfield would have been moral, and an entirely different city had no been for the secular publications, although the work on the paper was done during the days of the week. Thus it seems that one of the most objectionable features, in the estimation of the associations, in the advertising published in Sunday newspapers, which caused the trouble is to be made in secular use, and that is whether it is the teachings of this peoples.

In law of this, it will be interesting to learn that a clergyman, a member of the American Sabbath Union, recently distributed in his Sunday morning audience, a prospectus for a certain newspaper, one of which advertisement of a park on real estate firm, and lastly, an advertisement for a hotel in the east part.

The publishers of Sunday newspapers do not insist the places are kept and sustained or and seek the support of their advertising shown in the face of each newspaper. “We blacklists that the men that is in thy brother’s eye, but consider not the beam which is in thine own eye.”

The Washington Post gives some condensed information in reference to the “King’s Daughters,” an organization now in open affiliation with the National Reform Association and the Sabbath Union, which is as of interest.

“The great Order of the King’s Daughters so far as the work of organization so rapidly as covers in the different States. Something of the phenomenal growth of the order may be gathered from the reports of those organizational secretaries. A little more than a year the State has been where they was appointed in Massachusetts; and there are now enrolled in her reports the named of 415 circles, with a membership of 4,516. There are now twenty documented representated, working about fifteen lines of work. Connecticut has had a State Secretary for a year and a half and sends tell 1600 members in 160 circles. It is not yet of record since the first orders cross to the people’s which was carried over the border into Canada, and now in the Province of Ontario, credits of King’s Sons and Daughters formed in fifty cities, and contains a membership of 1,400 people. South Carolina has a flourishing state, with twenty-nine circles. Day nurseries, kindergarten, free employment bureau, hospital, workrooms for the poor are a few lines of work as varied as the ingenuity of the human mind added with Christian zeal and carried to economical issue by this Legion of King’s Daughters.”

Word of Word, in London, England, has a paragraph showing the progress of the Sunday afternoon movement there.

“The Working Men’s Lord’s Day Rest Association is working hard, and not for nothing. It is told that after a silence of nine years the House of Commons has returned one again to the question of running Sunday trains. On the second reading of a measure, by 106 votes against 15.

UNITED STATES PAPERS IN INDIA.

It was hugely reported when Mr. William Blakely decided to go to congress and obtain one American States paper having on Sunday printed in Bombay. It was thought to reflect adversely upon American civilization, and then the question is what is to be done about them. In reference to Always it has to said he was going out, to be furnished to the world, in an English translation, in respect to British legislation, to speak, and in both the United national and State documents, and with it to these printed and supplied.
