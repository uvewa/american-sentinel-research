At the annual meeting of the American Sabbath Union recently held in Springfield, much was said about the pernicious influence of the Sunday paper. It was even argued that the civil law should prohibit a paper intended for Sunday circulation, although the work on the paper was done Saturday, if it was not of a religious character. One of the most objectionable features, in the estimation of the convention, was the advertisements published in Sunday newspapers, which caused the mind to dwell on secular matters, and thus unfitted it for the teachings of the pulpit.

In view of this, it will be interesting to learn that a clergyman, a member of the American Sabbath Union, recently distributed to his Sunday evening audience, a programme of the services, on the back of which were advertisements of a pork-packing and jobbing firm, a laundry, jewelry store, real estate firm, and lastly, an advertisement for more advertisements.

The publishers of Sunday newspapers do not invade the place and hour of worship and thrust a copy of their advertising sheets in the face of each worshiper. "Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
