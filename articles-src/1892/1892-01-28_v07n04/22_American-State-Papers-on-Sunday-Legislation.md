FROM the Boston Herald:—

"AMERICAN STATE PAPERS ON SUNDAY LEGISLATION."

"It was a happy thought when Mr. William Addison Blakely decided to compile and annotate the American State papers bearing on Sunday legislation. It is a subject which is constantly coming up for discussion, and then the question always is, What is the law upon the subject? A suitable introduction is furnished to the work, in which the principle involved in Sunday legislation is brought out, and then follow the national and State documents which deal with these matters, very largely annotated by Mr. Blakely, and admirably edited. In the appendix the text of the different State Constitutions is given in full as it bears on this subject, and many other important papers are also added. The volume, taken as a whole, will be found of very great value, and it ought to find its way into every library and into every editorial office in the country. 'American State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation.' 8vo. Compiled and annotated by William Addison Blakely, counselor-at-law, National Religious Liberty Association, 43 Bond Street, New York."
