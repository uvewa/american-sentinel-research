IN arguing, as the National Reformers, of various schools do, that Christ is now this world's king, they utterly ignore the teaching of the Scriptures upon the subject, and make utter confusion among the many texts that refer to the subject.

It is true that very many scriptures do speak of Christ as king. He is declared to be "King of kings, and Lord of lords;" but that he is such now in the sense of ruling over the nations of this earth, other than by his divine providence, the word of God does not teach. In fact it does directly avow the contrary, as it is the purpose of this article to show.

Certain texts in the book of Daniel are frequently referred to to prove that Christ is now king of this world, for instance, Dan. 4:17, and yet no book teaches more plainly the contrary. In the second chapter of Daniel is recorded a vision which was given to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, by means of a dream, which was subsequently interpreted by Daniel, a prophet of the most high God. In his dream the king saw a great image with head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay.

The different parts of this image, the prophet declared, represented kingdoms. To Nebuchadnezzar he said, "Thou art this head of gold." Not that Nebuchadnezzar as an individual or even as king was the head of gold, but that he stood for the kingdom which was represented by the golden head; for the prophet immediately added (verses 39, 40), "And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, shall bear rule over all the earth. And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron," etc.

It is, however, unnecessary for the purpose of this article to take time to identify these kingdoms; they are almost universally held by Protestants to be Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome. Even the historian Gibbon recognized this fact, and describing Rome uses almost the language of the prophet, thus:—

The arms of the Republic sometimes vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean; and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the nations or their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome.

But it is, as before stated, unnecessary to dwell upon this point. The reader will grant at once that the empires named were the ones symbolized by the image, and probably ask what this has to do with the National Reform theory that Christ is now this world's king. Very much; for in the vision of the image is brought to view also the division of the Roman empire into ten parts, which was not accomplished till more than four hundred years after the first advent of Christ; and it is declared (Dan. 2:44) that "in the days of these kings [or kingdoms] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever." That is the everlasting kingdom of Christ which is in the Scriptures so often promised to him, but which has not yet been set up in the earth; and which is never to be established by human agency, but by divine power. And until that time comes it is folly to talk of Christ as this world's king. Nothing has occurred this side the breaking up of the Roman empire that could possibly be the setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God, and until that event does take place the dominion of earthly governments must remain in the hands of men, just where God himself has placed it, and declared that it shall remain until he come "whose right it is." Then, and not till then, will Christ be this world's king.

Christ himself, while distinctly avowing his kingship, declared that his kingdom was not of this world (John 18:36). As a priest-king upon his Father's throne, as appears from Heb. 6:1, he rules over a kingdom of grace, a purely spiritual kingdom, the subjects of which are candidates for his future everlasting kingdom, which the Apostle Paul locates at his second coming, when he says, "I charge thee therefore, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, preach the word." 2 Tim. 4:1. As a priest upon his Father's throne, Christ is now gathering out of every kindred and nation, a people who will serve him, whom he will make immortal, that they may be subjects of his eternal kingdom. And it is that they may be left perfectly free that he forbears now to rule over the affairs of men. But National Reformers are impatient of God's methods, and seek, as did some anciently, to take Christ by force and make him king. But to all such he says, "My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight; . . . but now is my kingdom not from hence."
