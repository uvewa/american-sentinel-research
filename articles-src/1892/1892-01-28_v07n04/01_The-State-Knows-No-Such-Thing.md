The State knows no such thing as a real distinction between right and wrong. The State only knows right and wrong, and the distinction between these. Men have rights—in the State they have equal rights. For one to infringe the rights of another is to commit a wrong, and the State deals with it only as that kind of a wrong. The State can not make of any question of right or wrong in a moral point of view.

I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invoke the civil magistrate to sustain its institutions, the clergy, or its defenders; nor of the religious societies, that the general Government should be invested with the power of affecting any uniform mode of worship or any penalties. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the slightest there as of act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the time for these exercises, and the object proper for them, according to their own particular tenets and doctrines, and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.—*Thomas Jefferson.*

The National Reform theory is that civil government is not a voluntary association, but a divine institution, and that it is clothed with authority and power that transcend all human institutions. Its design, they assert, is not the securing of human rights, but the suppression of wrong and promulgation of good. “Civil government,” says Rev. D. McAllister, of the National Reform association, “is the keeper of both tables of the law.” But this is much mischievous, for the reason that it makes men judges of that law, and destroys direct individual accountability to God. If God has made the State the custodian of his law, he has also made it the interpreter and expander of his law, and it is the duty of the people to receive the law from the State. This is substantially the claim made by the papal Church, a claim which Protestants hold to be blasphemous. But if it be blasphemy when made by a church, is it not even more so when made in behalf of the State?
