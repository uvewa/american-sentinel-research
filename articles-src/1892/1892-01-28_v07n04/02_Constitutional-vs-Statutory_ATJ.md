In the article entitled “A Constitution Divided Against Itself,” in the last issue of this paper it was shown that the fundamental law of the State of Tennessee contained a fatal discrepancy in the antagonism between those sections of the Bill of Rights, treating of freedom of religious conscience, and sections of a following article which directly condemn these sacred rights which were again, in the second article of amendments, *doubly* secured by the most solemn legislative reaffirmation possible to constitutional form. So strong a flaw as this in the fundamental guaranty of the rights and privileges of the citizens must necessarily extend into that body of statutory law, which is supposed to grow in its complex considerations, in spirit and technical legal agreement, with it. That the statutory law of Tennessee has variations diametrically at variance with Sections 3, 4 and 6 of Article 1, and Section 11 and 15 of Article 11 of the Constitution of the State, no evidence is needed to prove, other than their quotation. The code of 1884, and the laws of Tennessee 1889, contain the following, bearing upon religious observance:

SEC. 2289. If any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life, or of causing or permitting the same to be done by his or her children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, on Sunday, he shall, on due conviction thereof before any justice of the peace of the county, forfeit and pay fifty cents, one half to the person who will sue for the same, and the other half for the use of the county.

SEC. 2290. Any person who shall hunt, fish, or in any case of sport, or the drunk or disorderly, as aforesaid, shall be subject to the same penalties as aforesaid, and sue and liable on the same penalties on those who work, on the Sabbath.

SEC. 2291. If any person or other person be in the habit of getting drunk or taking in this State shall employ figures on Sunday, the purchaser of this offence shall be fine and punished as prescribed in section 2289.

(Chap. 91, Sec. 1 [Laws of 1891.]) Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That the law of this State prohibiting the sale of liquor on Sunday, or on any day of a national, or State, and Veteran’s exemption, be so amended as to prohibit the sale and Storage of any malt, vinous, Fermented or other intoxicating liquor, or to keep open on Sunday or place where malt liquors are sold or dispensed, and any person offending shall be punished as provided in said act; provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to druggists who sell in quantities of not more than one quart. provided, Further, that restaurants and eating houses where spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors are now sold in quantities not exceeding five gallons work days, shall be allowed to conduct their business on Sundays as on other days, but after being closed, and no drinks of any kind sold.

SEC. 2611. Fifty percent shall be taxed on the person, on the application of any party, supported by oath of information, after the defendant has been convicted on the charge.

SEC. 3611. Actions may be abated by plea of the defendant in the following case: Where the suit was commenced on a service on Sunday, except in cases permitted in sections 2894, 2895.

As might be expected, from the constitutional example afar, one these statutes and laws are not strictly constitution with each other, but while the ones forbids certain acts on Sunday, the other permits them to be done in violation of the other part of the secular life, the other discrimination in favor of law itself and permits the imitation and services of legal processes in certain specified cases. But this lack of consistency is inherent. Every law, in a question of conscience, the interference of civil law is equally an error whether it forbid or enjoin. In this case the statutes do both, and so between the Constitution and the statutory law the State has neutral field in covered, and it has been so contrived that together they have completely satisfied that class of the Constitution which asserts the freedom of conscience, and the right of the citizen to worship as he will.

The declaration of rights says, in words which none can mistake, that it is the natural and indefeasible right of all men, of every creed, to worship as they may or may not choose to worship as they will; and the same statutes declare that all men shall not worship or they will not on the sabbath, and it is the will of the law that they shall and must pay the forfeit of a weekly rest on Sunday, the first day of the week. If the conscience of the Jew, the Seventh-day Adventist, or the Seventh-day Baptist, dictate to him that he shall worship his Lord by resting from labor on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath or the Rest day of the Lord, the same law that interferes and declares that he shall render his homage to the statutes of Tennessee, by refraining from work or amusement on Sunday, the first day of the week, the second of the code of Tennessee. Thus the code does “interfere with the rights of conscience” which the Constitution has said is outside the scope of human authority.

Ever since the Sabbath law was given to Adam in Eden there have been those upon the earth who have observed it; and thus the State rather contends or belongs to the most ancient “religious sentiment” and “method of worship” upon earth, and in spite of this; and in defiance of its constitutional declaration, the State of Tennessee not only gives preference to another model of worship, but at the same time by doing so, selecting the distinguishing difference between the two as a subject of legislation, distinctly discriminates against the other. Not only another Sabbath can are the rights of conscience contravened, but a preference is given, by law, to one religious establishment and mode of worship over another.

Under these statutes numerous convictions of those who allow who profess religion in neglect are ripe upon the sacredness of any divinely appointed rest day; of those who acknowledge a nominal obligation to what they understand to be the Christian religion, and recognize the law observances to be the distinguishing outward mark, through they themselves have failed in strict obedience to it; of those who, in spirit and truth, are loyal to their religious convictions, and render their obligation to God upon the seventh day which He commanded, thus commanding the Sabbath day—and, holding it mind the beyond divine requirements of any temporal office, refuse homage to the day which is the sign of that idolatry, claiming from all time the “rest” sole idol of holiday.” Upon these classes the statutory law of Tennessee bears with equal iniquity; so far as the civil discriminations is implied therein, and in favor of that class which recognizes the power of the State to establish a religious rest day and acquiesces in the selection of the type of day in which to yield that observance. That the framers of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee themselves perceived the injustice, of which they had countenanced the statute law, is in evidence through the insertion, in the Constitution of 1870, of a clause which the previous Constitution did not contain.

ARTICLE 1, PAGE 10. Sec. 30. No person shall in time of peace be required to perform any service to the public day on such of its night in the making of any

The perceptions of these legislators were close to the utmost reach of the principles expressed in Section 3 of the Bill of Rights, and they were tramped in a complacent of their breadth, but they did not see that under the existing statute law an injustice was liable to be done, therefore they inserted this clause in the fundamental law. While this only multiplied still further the legal inconsistencies of civil interference in religious matters, it shows conclusively that they realized wrong might be done under existing laws, and desired to cure the error as far as they could.

That this section equal and exact justice to all, would of course require that no one be compelled, by law, to rest on any day, or not any act: by religious use as a day of rest, for this clause establishes the principle of equity as a law; and to the mind of him who draws it, whatever day a man might observe, in his conscience, was a legal Sabbath, and in their minds the one stood in the same relation, legally, to his Sabbath as the other to his Sunday. The logical deduction from this is, that as no preference can be shown to all parties in religious view, therefore, if one party is restricted from labor on the rest day of the other, then the other must be restricted from labor on the rest day of the first. The legal obligation is mutual, and if the restriction applies to one case it must in the other. But the reductio to of this, to its necessary resultant, only adds to the mass of inconsistency and extra-constitutional discrimination.

The Constitution of the State of Tennessee is consequently, divisible against itself and the statute law of the State is its antagonist to a principle declared constitutionally fundamental. Decisions have been had, along the line of these legal fictions, and a body of precedent has grown up in the State reports, which is the accepted law of the courts, and is so upheld by the decision of the Supreme Court of the State, and the Circuit Court of the United States, irrespective of the question of whether it is in accordance with constitutional principles or not. The unreliable positions that such a legal and judicial situation must develope more and more from the normal as the days develop it. In a question worthy of the serious consideration of constitutional lawyers and jurists, as to where such a course is leading. The people will find the result of vital importance to them when the error has had its perfect work.
