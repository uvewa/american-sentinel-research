In the discussions in Toronto, Ontario, over running the street cars on Sunday, the Baptist ministers of that city have dissented from the ministers of the other denominations. As is well known the street cars do not run in Toronto on Sunday. The city council recently said to the people that if they would secure a given number of names to a petition, praying that the cars be run on Sunday, they would submit the question to the vote of the people. To this action of the council the Ministerial Association strongly dissented, saying that the question was not one to be submitted to the people. The Baptist Ministers in the Association took exceptions, as voiced in an editorial in the Canadian Baptist, of December 24; of which the following is an extract:—

It must have required not a little courageous loyalty to conviction on the part of the Baptist ministers of this city to take and maintain the stand they did, in opposition to the views of most of their brethren of other denominations, at the recent meetings of the Ministerial Association. Yet, in view of the important principles involved, no clear-headed Baptist could have done otherwise, even if the danger of being misunderstood had been twice as great.

The question involved was, as we understand the matter, two-fold. First, would it be morally right for the members of the Association to advise and use their influence to induce the members of the city council to violate their distinct promise, given some months since, that in the event of their receiving a petition, signed by a certain number of citizens, asking them to refer the question of running the cars on Sunday to the people, they would do so and abide by the result? It is not necessary to our purpose to inquire whether the members of the council were well advised in making such a promise under the circumstances, or not. It is not, we believe, denied that the pledge was distinctly given. As honorable men the councillors were surely bound to keep it, and honorable advisers would seem bound to encourage them in doing so.

The other question at issue is fundamental and far-reaching. It involves the germ of the whole question of the union of Church and State. On what ground may a body of Christians, ministers or laymen, properly appeal to the State or municipal authorities to prohibit Sunday labor of any kind? . . . In this case the majority of the ministers and several of the councilmen advocate their resolution on distinctly religious grounds. We are citizens, they say in effect, of a Christian State. The obligation to keep the Sabbath is imposed upon us by a divine command. The running of the street cars on Sunday is a violation of this command and a desecration of the Lord's day, and should not be permitted in a Christian nation.

At first thought it may be a matter of surprise to many of our readers, as it evidently was to many members of the Ministerial Association, that any Christian, minister or layman, could take exception to such an argument or refuse to join in such an appeal. But a little reflection will, we are sure, make it clear that the Baptist ministers present at the meeting were justified on scriptural and on Baptistic grounds in doing so.

Let us suppose that the views of the majority of the Ministerial Association had prevailed with the council. What logically follows? The city council of Toronto take it upon themselves in the first place to decide that the particular kind of work involved in running, or in riding in the street cars, is a desecration of the Sabbath, and contrary to Scripture, and therefore to be forbidden without reference to the will of the people. They can not accept this interpretation of Scripture—for such it is, since many good Christian people do not regard the fourth commandment as binding upon the Christian conscience in respect to the first day of the week—upon the authority of the ministers, though it would be easy to show that the thing would be normal, the less objectionable if they could. But that would be clearly to shirk responsibility and abdicate their own proper functions. The councillors themselves then must first decide for the whole body of citizens what is the requirement of the Bible in the given case, and, in the second place, must enforce by legal pains and penalties their decision or opinion in regard to that requirement. No Baptist could for a moment submit to the usurpation of such authority in religious matters by any civil power. If a government or municipal council may rightly prescribe and enforce this religious observance, why not any other which may seem to them desirable or obligatory?

It will be understood, of course, that the Baptist pastors, and the Baptists of the city generally are as strongly opposed to the running of street cars on Sunday as their pedobaptist brethren can possibly be, and are fully prepared to support their opinions by abundant arguments of the kind which come properly within the purview of the council. The only difference is that they deny that the council has any right to forbid their running, on religious grounds, or to enforce Sabbath observance as a religious ordinance. The religious aspect of the question is beyond and above their sphere. From this it follows that the Baptists will probably recognize the right of the citizens to decide the question. Happily, there is every reason to believe that the majority will decide in favor of preserving our quiet, Christian Sabbath.

The Baptists have made a good record in the struggle for religious freedom. And every friend of liberty will rejoice to see them on the right track in Toronto, they need to take one step further, however and see that Sunday is purely and entirely a religious institution, and that any civil legislation whatever in regard to it, whether by the whole people or by a city council, is wholly in the interest of religion. But religion can not be advanced by compelling its observance under the pains and penalties of law, else God would long since have resorted to that method, and not left it a matter of free choice. Hence all Sunday laws, considered from whatever standpoint, are wrong.
