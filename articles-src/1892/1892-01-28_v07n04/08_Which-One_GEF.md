THERE is a saying that when the nuptial knot is tied and the twain are pronounced one, then the struggle begins to know which one. This is not true when man and woman are truly married, and love ties the knot. The reason this is not true is because God made the woman for the man, out of a part of the man, to be a part of the man. Either one alone is incomplete. God said, "It is not good that man should be alone." If this was said of man before the woman was made, time, and the average experience, and development of ancient maidenhood, has proved it to be, at least equally true of the woman. The two go together, and it takes both to constitute a whole man, capable of fulfilling all the functions, and realizing the ideal for which the race was created.

Now it is by no mere chance that the Church in the Bible is always represented as a woman. The metaphors of the Bible are more subtle and far reaching in their meaning, than our highest comprehension of them. The true Church of Christ, with its longing love, and tender sympathy and gentle ministrations, is in the world as a true woman in a plague stricken hamlet. The sympathetic voice, the tender touch of grateful ministration to the suffering soul, are essentially feminine. The world and its kingdoms are fitly represented in the Bible by the cold metallic image of a man; also by the lion, the bear, the hegoat, and the ram,—all masculine.

Surely why not marry the Church to the world? Because she was not made for the world. Said the Saviour, "Ye are not of the world even as I am not of the world. If ye were of the world the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." Again the admonition is, "Love not the world, neither the things of the world. If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him." It is therefore evident that the Church was not made for the world, as the wife for the husband; on the contrary, the true Church has been won by God's mighty love out of the world, and espoused as a chaste virgin to Christ. 2 Cor. 11:2. She completes man not by uniting herself to him to minister to his earthly ambitions and passions, but by lifting him above these, and uniting him to Christ, in whom is all the fullness of the Godhead, and in whom only, we can be complete. To unite the Church to earthly governments is, therefore, not only to rob Christ of his bride, and drag her down through infinite depths of pollution, to the adulterous commerce of the world, but it is to bring about a union where there can be no genuine love.

The world hates the Church, and the true Church can not love the world. She may love the individuals in the world, and long to lift them up to union with Christ, but she can not love the world. Such a union can only be at the dictation of ambition and passion; and when marriage takes place for these reasons, it is to the lowering, and not to the lifting of both the uniting parties. Moreover, when such a union takes place, the struggle always begins, at once, to know which shall be the one, for they are not really united, not both one.

Their aims and objects and ambitions are different, and not only different, but conflicting. The conflict is imminent in the union and it can result in only one of two ways. While the conflict is on, the best that can be is a compromise between the Church and the State,—a compromise which neither party regards as satisfactory and final, and so, with plotting and counterplotting, the struggle goes on. If it is ever settled at all, it is either by the total subjection of the Church to the State, or by the total subjection of the State to the Church. The former is paganism, as in Rome under the emperors, where religion was utterly prostituted to political ends; the latter is the Papacy of the twelfth century, with the so-called vicar of Christ, but the real vicar of the devil, supreme. The world knows what both of these systems are too well to wish either experiment repeated. Either of them if carried out to complete success is the utter destruction of the true Church from the earth. It is either a false State, and no real Church where the soul of man can live the life of God, or it is a false Church, and no State where the bodies of men can be protected from persecution and death. No wonder Roger Williams called this a body-killing, soul-killing, and State-killing doctrine.
