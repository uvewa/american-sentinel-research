That injustice to citizens and final governmental destruction arises from ecclesiastical assumptions of power in the civil sphere, or vice versa, has been fully demonstrated in the history of the Christian nations. In the fourth century the history of that Government shows the theory that the Roman Government was, or could become, a theocracy, brought about a union of the Church with the civil power, in order to receive support from the State in bringing the world to the religious faith held by themselves. In his History of the Christian Religion and Church, A. Neander, sec. 3, part 1, Neander says of that time:

This theoretical theory, originating not in the Bible but upon a basis of the ancient religious constitutions of the Old and New Testaments, based upon a comparison of the Jewish theocratic Christian opposition of the spiritual to the secular power, and which could only result in the formation of a monarchial that, subordinating the secular to itself is a that sintered well. It was the theory that found its realization in the papacy.

Sommer’s “Ecclesiastical History,” book 1, chap. 3.

Neander says that this furnished to worldly-minded bishops “a welcome pretext for devoting themselves to any foreign affairs more attractive, rather than to the unpleasant business of their rightful calling; and the same wish to allow themselves to be governed by improper motive in the settlement of less disputes.” Vol. 3, sec. 2.

Then the way was open for the Church to exalt itself above the civil power, and the dignitaries of the Church were not slow to seize the opportunity. This point gained, the highest offices in the Church were filled by political methods, and through intrigue and bloodshed the contest before any formal initiative into Church affairs. With them, no opposition of whatever kind was tolerated, and the Church, or who dared to be out of harmony with a Church ruler, paid the penalty with his life.

All the naturally grew of the false claim that the State owed the obedience of the Church of that time. If the State was a part of all government entered by men, as the government of God. In this way the Church became the State, and the State became the Church. This accomplished, the Church of Rome was not long in securing an extortion, as bishops lived in a style of luxury and pomp, no bishops lived in a style of luxury and grandeur. But when the Church thus placed itself to surrender its power of the civil power, and for that of regal splendor, it was but the steppings of the nation’s downfall. Corruption of the most fetid kind permeated the government and reserved the people. This government was doomed to fall before the barbarians of the North who displaced her iniquity.

The Dark Ages followed, and for hundreds of years persecution, ruined many persecutions affected the people of Europe. Not one of them was more tragic than the great truth been recognized, “that the State has no concern with the opinions of men, and no right to interfere, even in the slightest degree, with the forms of worship which they may choose to adopt.” Buckle’s History of Civilization, vol. 1, page 192.

The theoretical theory has in fact always wrought against when introduced into human government. It could not be otherwise; for that theory comports to the Bible the principle of a supreme government, and to administer the rule according to the interpretation placed on the Bible by the adviser of the government. This takes away the right of private judgement, extends the authority of law to opinions, as well as to acts, and so involves the individual of every subject of the government, which always was, and always will be, extremely wrong.
