Word and Work, of London, England, has a paragraph showing the progress of the Sunday observance movement in England, as follows:—

"The Working Men's Lord's Day Rest Association has issued a New Year's Address, which shows that after a silence of nine years the House of Commons has once more opposed the Sunday opening of museums, by 166 votes against 39. It goes on to say that the efforts to establish Sunday concerts had elicited important protests from several theatrical artists, who felt the need of Sunday rest. Concerts on Sunday for money payments are illegal, but constant efforts are made to evade the law. Seventy-five Members of Parliament and peers had expressed their disapproval of the proposed visit of the Emperor of Germany to the Naval Exhibition on a Sunday, and the visit took place on a Friday. Improvements as to Sunday opening had taken place at the People's Palace. The most marvellous progress had been made in securing one day's rest in seven on the Continent. Efforts were being made to prevent the Sunday opening of the Chicago Exhibition. The bill for closing public houses on Sundays had been supported by 4,678 petitions, having 892,253 signatures. Sunday labor in connection with Sunday excursions had increased, and there were six distinct organizations striving to secularize the Sunday in London. Forty illustrated lectures on Sunday observance had been given; 283,000 publications had been issued; about 4,000 letters, etc., had been received, and 52,000 letters, book packets, etc., sent from the office in 1891. The cause of Sunday rest had lost powerful supporters by the decease during the year of the late Right Hon. W. H. Smith, Sir R. N. Fowler, and Sir Thomas Chambers. The committee appeals for more extended support."
