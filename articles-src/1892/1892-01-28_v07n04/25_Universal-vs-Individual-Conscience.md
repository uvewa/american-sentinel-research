A WRITER in the American Ecclesiastical Review, for January, states, as a dangerous tendency, that the common current of public opinion in this country "is, taking for granted, as a sort of ethical maxim useful in practical politics, that the universal conscience must supersede the individual conscience, and that when religion comes in contact with the popular will, expressed in the Government and State legislation, it must yield as a private interest to the general good."
