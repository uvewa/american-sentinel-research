It is stated that laws against Sunday work by factories are in force in Tennessee, Minnesota, Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan.

Among the demands recently formulated by the Socialists of Germany are that no statutes which shall be held Sunday or other holidays, the right of free speech and free assembly, the abolition of State subsidies to churches and the volunteer, the secularization of the schools, and free education.

A WRITER in the *American Ecclesiastical Review*, for January, states, as a dangerous tendency, that the common current of public opinion in this country is taking for granted, as a sort of ethical maxim useful in practical politics, that the universal conscious must supersede all religious coercion in contact with the popular will, expressed in the Government and State legislation, it must yield as a private interest to the general good.”

The Union Signal remarks that “specifics of typhoid fever and small pox and all various diseases are going to the old horns of families in Russia; at this were so strong already, area meaningfully the contest some refuse to grant permission for private distribution of food, or soup houses. Meantime the Union Government efforts to stamp on out all religious except the Greek Church; its latest step in this direction being the closing of certain heretical order, is the La Cathédrale churches.

Our contempory should find no fault with the action of the Czar in opposing what he believes to be false religion. He is simply acting on the principle advocated by the whole National Reform formerly, of which the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union has become only an adjunct.

The Union Signal item furnishes also an illustration of the fact that State recognition of God and of the law does not make the officers of the State Christian, but the term “National Reform, as called, is advocated in this country as a panacea, for all the evils that States are heir to, but it fails to heal in other lands.

The Christian Statesman has always been flatly, quite forcibly put over the nomination last the matters more something from some this, that the event of their an putting a petition signed in certain number of persons, asking them to order the question of asking the use to Sunday to the people, they would to act abide by the result. It is not altogether our dear purpose to inquire whether the consistency of this, but of from whether the Baptists would resist under the circumstances, or not. It is to be the that was right in so doing.

At an horseshoe turn the convictions were well expressed, the influence of those who would assent. They are of conscience that would bound to enumerate from them in doing right.

The question stated at base is a fundamental as mechanics. It involves the grace of the whole relation of the union of Church and State. This vital subject may a body of Christians are at once or lawyers, properly agreed to the State on any ecclesiastical or position through law Society of any kind to set the case the majority of the citizens and several of the councillors aforeside have been for running street cars on Sunday as they are citizens, they say in effect, of a Christian City and the matter must not be determined upon on a by a divine command. The ringing of the doors not open in Sunday is a violation of the sentiment and a desecration of the Lord’s day, and should not be permitted in a Christian nation.

At first thought it may be a matter of surprise to hear a body of clergymen thus opposing what would seem to be a purely democratic exercise; but we must ourselves of the Ministerial Association, that any Christian, minister or layman, could take exception to such an argument or refuse to join in such an appeal. In little reflection will, we are more inclined to think that the Baptist ministers present as the meetings were as just set upon a broader and deeper principle than are their associates, either religious or political.

Let us express the views of the majority of counsel. What legitimacy follows! The city council of Toronto had a right proposition on the matter to place to decide that the particular kind of work in vehicles or running, or its riding to the church is a desecration of the Sabbath, and contrary to Scripture, and therefore to be forbidden without reference to the will of the people. Now, how many good Christian people do not regard the Council’s assumptions in a light, how many people in the use of this statement, as to whether in the authority of the testimony, change them in a moment. In this they will be found as consistent as the law or physician of they could. But that the authorities to people is done only amounts and their own proper function. The constitution themselves there must first decide for the, in which body of citizens what is the enjoyment of the Bible for all not given case, and it is the unconstitutional force by legal pains and penalties their decision on that body at large whether the body at large wants could. For a moment it a submit to the temptation to meddle in religious matters by any civil authority, and whether or territorial council need not presently to enforce and redress the religious matter for the otherwise is held to have been established, desirable or obligatory.

It will, in the subservient of course, the Baptist pastors, and the Baptists of the city generally are on strongly opposed to the running of street and on Sunday as their prohibition brethren can possibly be. They do not propose to express their own opinions by abundant arguments of the kind which comes properly within the province of the clergy. The only difference is that they deny that the court or has any right to forbid these running, on the ground grounds, or to enforce Sabbath observance as a religious ordinance. The religious objections to it are beyond and above their sphere. From this position they could consistently urge upon the right of citizens to decide the question. Happily, in every country it is clear to the majority will decide in favor of preserving our quiet, Christian Sunday.

The Baptists have made a good record in the struggle for civil ypical and constant. And a every friend of liberty will rejoice to not them on the right track in Toronto, they need to take now one step further, however and see that Sunday is purely and entirely a religious institution, and that any civil legislation, whatever in regard to it, whether by the whole people or by a city council, is wholly in the interest of religion. But religion can not be advanced by compelling the observance under the point and penalties of law, she God alone has much since have reserved to that method, and not left it a matter of free choice. Hence all Sunday laws, condemned found whatever standpoint, are wrong.

The CHRISTIAN Statesman has always insisted that in order to make this a Christian Nation the Constitution must be so amended as to place all “our Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land;” but now Dr. Herrick Johnson rises and argues that the World’s Fair should be closed on Sunday because “the Nation is Christian, Christianity is embodied in our national laws, and is recognized in our national usages and appointments. We issue proclamations of thanksgiving, appoint chaplains, utilize oaths, take sabbath, and open Legislatures and Congresses in the name of the God of the Sabbath.” Now if the Statesman is correct—it destroys the Doctor’s argument; and on the other hand, if the Doctor is correct the Statesman is without a mission, and has only been fighting wind mills, lo these many years.

In leading in the fight against the publishing of Sunday papers in Pittsburg, the intellectual leader of Law and Order League says:—“—

A bawdy newspaper office in this time and place, is a “speak easy,” a place doing business in violation of the liquor law, the Sabbath and Order motives. We ask only observance of law”—

And this has ever been the motto of its intolerance and bigotry. The papacy, in its persecution to the death the early Christians, had no other motive; they simply demanded obedience to the law of Rome. And in every country where Christian blood has been shed and Christian hearts wrung with anguish, because of the ignorance of man by man, to the same plea that been made, “We are only enforcing the law.” This was all that was done in instances in the case of the life of La Salle King, hounded from court to court to finally be his death, for the offence of simply plowing in his field upon a day that in neighbors professed to regard as sacred to the worship of God, but which they were not careful to keep holy themselves.

It is a weak cause that fights shy of the merits of the cause and pleads that it is only “enforcing the law.” If the editors of the Christian Statesman will consult an old book known as the “Acts of the Apostles” they will find in the fifth chapter eminent precedent for disobeying an unjust and iniquitous law. In this case the Law and Order League of Jerusalem were only trying to enforce the law, as is witnessed by this item of news concerning the persecutions of the highly of the early official of that Christianity! now seeking the Cross, who rules in the name of God—and by his authority just as truly as would the National Reformers in this country were the power which they seek given into their hands.

The OBSERVER of the city comments thus sadly upon the fact that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is to continue its open on Sunday afternoons—

The people who now go to the museums on the Sunday were before direct street is not one thing more no one reason than this even are of them of Sunday opening. That it has come to stay is to be set at sobriety. Recommendations on the Sabbath are weakened not strengthened by it. And such occasional Sunday is not unlikely to be a settled institution of elements on law on the present country

Possibly the OBSERVER might find some consolation in the facts stated recently in the Catholic Outlook that Sunday was not always a holiday rather than a holy day; and that having adopted it, rather that the Sabbath of the Lord, the liberals could not reasonably object to its festival the secular uses.

Vick’s Floral Guide, 1892.

TEAS and tried friends are always welcome, consequently Vick’s Floral Guide is ours of a warm reception, especially when dressed as daintily as this year. The “Niella Laura Carmelita of this year’s cover, and “Brilliant Poppies” on the back, are unusually attractive; and the intermingled colored plates of flowers and vegetables are certainly works of art and beauty. The first twenty-four pages, printed in vivid ink, describe novelties and specialties. Send ten cents to James Vick’s Sons, Rochester, N. Y., and procure a copy of this attractive and useful catalogues. It costs nothing, as the ten cents can be deducted from the first order.

CHRISTIANITY may be the religion of the people, but it is in no sense the religion of the State.—*Judge Appleton.*
