In the foundation of our Government one of the cornerstone was, that “no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States,” and while this principle has not as yet been set aside, yet there are some indications of a move in that direction.

The Prohibition Party in Lyon, Mass., has just been flatly rejected over the nomination, in that city, of a Catholic prohibitionist on its demerit. South ward was found fault with prohibition faith and record; he seemed to be sound along that line. But as soon as it was ascertained that he was a Catholic, then, behold, a split in the party was that matter at once. Now the Catholic faith, from the standpoint of us who are Protestants, is to say the least, very objectionable. But what has that to do with a political party, and whether or not the Catholic party serve in civil office?

Have we not taken the position in this country that the Church and State are two entirely separate institutions? And that as a man so he conducts himself as a good citizen, it is no person’s business what system of religious faith a candidate holds, or whether he believes in any religion at all?

But the prohibitionists in Lyon, in withdrawing their support from a man, simply because he is a Catholic, show that, in their minds at least, Church and State are not separate in this country; and while they object to a union of the State with Catholicism, they would not raise the same objection if the union was made with Protestantism. Whereas the American principle is that the State shall be allied with no religion.

Much is being said in prohibition circles in regard to making it a church party. The happily there are some correct principles against it. The principles of prohibition are good, and the country would be benefited if they could be enforced. But when the Prohibition Party builds a platform sure to contain elements of all persuasions and beliefs, as far as religion is concerned, it is too narrow to be worthy the name of American patriotism.
