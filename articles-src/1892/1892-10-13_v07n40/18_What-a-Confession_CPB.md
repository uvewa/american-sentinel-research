In view of the efforts which are making to secure a repeal of the Sunday-closing proviso in the World's Fair appropriation passed by Congress at its last session, the Examiner (Baptist, of this city) says:—

The present is no time for jubilation, but is, and we beg pardon for the phrase, a time for wire-pulling and hard fighting.

The "Century Dictionary" defines "wire-pulling" thus:—

1. The act of pulling the wires, as of a puppet or other mechanical contrivance. Hence—2. The rousing, guiding, and controlling of any organization or body of persons, especially a political party, by underhanded influence or management; intrigue, especially political intrigue.

The Examiner has used the term advisedly. The adoption of the proviso by Congress was secured by wire-pulling, and if retained at all, it can only be by more wire-pulling. The churches composing the American Sabbath Union having in this matter entered the field of political controversy they must use political methods even to wire-pulling. There is no escape! Having undertaken to regenerate the Nation and make it Christian by act of Congress they must control that body by whatever means are necessary.

The Examiner confesses that improper means were used to secure the desired legislation, when it says: "The law makers at Washington did not vote for Sunday closing from personal preference, but, so to say, under the lash of an indignant public." The "indignant public" was the churches under the leadership of the American Sabbath Union; but instead of being the "public" those who demanded the recognition of Sunday sacredness by the closing of the Fair, were, and still are, only a small minority. But by intimidation they secured the legislation sought for, and now they confess that they must retain it by wire-pulling, that is, by underhanded influences. What a confession!
