Tennessee, as our readers are aware, is a State where they have so much regard for Sunday that they can not permit conscientious observers of the seventh day to do ordinary farm labor on the first day, nevertheless, the Memphis Appeal-Avalanche, of October 3, comes to us containing this announcement:—

The Daily Appeal-Avalanche, 1,008 inches of the news of all the world each day, and the mammoth Sunday edition, always the largest and best in the Great South, 15 cents a week.

The same paper contains the following concerning the man who will doubtless be the next governor of the State:—

Judge Peter Turney arrived in the city yesterday (Sunday).

The Democratic gubernatorial nominee came on the early train, over the "Ellen N." and was accompanied by the venerable orator and statesman, Hon. John H. Savage, of McMinaville. Judge Turney came from Alamo, Tenn., where he had spoken to 4,000 people on Saturday.

The distinguished visitors repaired at once upon their arrival to the Gayoso Hotel, where they were assigned to rooms 404 and 405, on the second floor.

Judge Turney received a number of visitors during the day, Chairman Armour, of the county executive committee, being among the number, as well as other prominent Democrats.

Judge Turney was seen by an Appeal-Avalanche representative during the evening, and his reply to a question, expressed the opinion that there had been no material change in the situation in the State during the past month.

Then there are the usual advertisements of Sunday railroad trains, etc.; but none of these things move the average Tennessee Sunday-keeper; it is only when some presumptuous Adventist works quietly in his back field, or when some faithful housewife who has rested on the seventh day plies her needle or bakes bread on Sunday, that the dignity of Tennessee law is injured, and the officers of justice (?) rise in their might to vindicate the honor(?) of the commonwealth!

Newspapers may publish and circulate Sunday editions, politicians may carry on their campaigns, railroads may run as many trains as they wish, gangs of section men may work, squirrel hunters and picnickers may pursue the even tenor of their way on Sunday without hindrance from the authorities; but when one who believes that Saturday is the Sabbath emphasizes his dissent from the popular theology by resting on the seventh day and working on the first day of the week, he is promptly indicted and punished to vindicate the honor of the State of Tennessee!

C. P. B.
