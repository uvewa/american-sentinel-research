BISHOP POTTER is a believer in Sunday sacredness, though he does not base the observance of the day upon the fourth commandment, as does the American Sabbath Union. He says: "We shall get a good Sunday in America when men learn to recognize its meaning and its uses—not when we have closed all the doors which, if open, might help to teach them that lesson."
