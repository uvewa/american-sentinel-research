It will become politicians to be a little cautious how pious they appear before the church people, whose influence they wish to gain to forward their own political ends. Their fervent protestations of religious fervor may prove a boomerang, and come back upon their own heads. Thus Whitelaw Reid posed in so divine an attitude before the late convention of Christian Endeavors, in New York, that they took his sanctimonious declarations at par, and thought it would be a good time to ask him to make his practice consistent with his profession. So they drew up a resolution, asking him to suspend the Sunday issue of the New York Tribune. At last reports, he was gazing dazedly on that proposition; and the country is waiting with some interest to see how far he is willing to go to make good his profession.—Review and Herald.
