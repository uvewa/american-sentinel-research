It is unfortunate that so many who are enjoying unrestricted freedom themselves should deny to others the same freedom. Sunday keepers would raise a cry from Maine to California were any attempt made to interfere with their Saturday work and Sunday rest, and yet we see many of them making and enforcing laws against Sabbath-keepers which put them in jails and chain-gangs for carrying out the literal words of the Bible, which are as follow:—

Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work.

Some of our jails are now being used to punish American citizens and Christians for conscientiously obeying those words. The Arena of Boston truly says:—

If in any State the Adventists, the Hebrews, or any other people who believe in observing Saturday instead of Sunday, should happen to predominate, and they undertook to throw Christians into dungeons, and after branding them criminals, should send them to the penitentiary for working on Saturday, indignation would blaze forth throughout christendom against the great injustice, the wrong against the liberty of the rights of the citizen. The only difference is that your Mr. King is in the minority; he is the type of those who always have been, and always will be, made to suffer when the Government is strong enough to persecute all who do not accept what is considered truth and right by the majority.

Such laws as these should be abolished at once, and the American people should have such a jealous regard for their liberties that it could never be said that American jails were being used to crush out unpopular beliefs. These unfortunate persons may be assured that the sympathy of the great body of the American people is with them, and that their struggles against oppression and persecution to-day is only the continuation of the struggle against bigotry and despotism that has been waged so successfully for the past few centuries. True Americans and the Christians everywhere are with the Adventists. The South Chicago Church Bulletin, a Baptist organ, says:—

Let us be careful how we let in the camel's nose of religious legislation, lest the brute crowd his bulky form in and occupy the whole shop. If the law by which these men were legally imprisoned be a righteous law, then may any State, nation or country set up a religious creed, and enforce it; then France treated properly the Huguenots; Russia the Jews; and early New England and Virginia the Baptists and Quakers. Protestant America had better be careful how she lays foundations for other men to build upon. Rome has as good a right to build in her way as we have in our way.

All true religious institutions are able to stand without the aid of human law, and every attempt to enforce any religious tenet always has, and always will, do ten times as much harm to Christianity as good.—Bribuse-Headlight, Harvey, Ill.
