Some people are never satisfied to use the power of law as it should be used—to protect society from the encroachment of the lawless element. They are not satisfied with liberty to pursue their own business unmolested; they must needs restrict the liberty of others and seek to use the power of law to enforce their ideas upon others.

A striking illustration of this has recently come to view in Tennessee where some orthodox church members are repeatedly prosecuting a minority sect because they refuse to conform their religious practices to suit the ideas of a majority. The press report by an eye witness says:—

At Paris, Tennessee, four Christian men have been lying in jail since June 3, for the "crime" of following their "common vocations on Sunday, by working on the farm, plowing, loeing," etc. The term of one having expired, the other three, after having lain in jail forty-four days, were Monday, July 18, marched through the streets in company with some colored criminals, and put to work shoveling on the common highway. All three were men of families, one fifty-five and another sixty-two years of age.

These men are among the best citizens of Tennessee. The prosecuting attorney, when arguing before the court, said:—

It is to be regretted, because of the fact that otherwise [aside from their observing the seventh day as the Sabbath, and working on their farms on Sunday] they are good citizens.
