## Editorial Notes.

NOW that the Supreme Court and Congress have undertaken to regulate the religion of the Nation, there could be no impropriety in going just a step further and requiring the people to attend mass. The mass is no more a religious institution than is the Sunday, and if it is all right to require the observance of one why not of the other also?

------

THE author of "The Sabbath in Puritan New England," relates that "a large portion of the stipends to early pastors being paid in corn and labor, the amounts were established by fixed rate upon the inhabitants, and the amount of land owned and cultivated by each church member was considered in reckoning his assessments. These amounts," continues the historian, "were called 'voluntary contributions.' If, however, any citizen refused to 'contribute,' his land was taxed, and if he refused to pay his church tax he could be fined, imprisoned, or pilloried. For over hundred years the ministers' salaries in Boston were paid by these so-called 'voluntary contributions.'"

This array of Puritan history is interesting only as illustrative of what was established and instituted by National Reformers in regard to religious liberty. This is the kind of "voluntary" religion--religion that the National Reformers propose to require at the hands of all the people. They will leave everybody free in religion--just as the Puritans did! Is this a matter of paying the ministers' salaries?

It is unfortunate that the Attorney-General of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Tennessee feels impelled to continue the prosecution of the Adventists of Henry County, that State. No sane principle requires such action on his part. He knows, for no can fail to know, that others than Adventists work in Henry County on Sunday, and yet he takes no action against them. Sunday week, Sunday picnics, Sunday excursions, and Sunday squirrel hunting go on in the immediate neighborhoods of his own home, but he takes no notice of it, though attention has been publicly called to the facts. But the Adventists are pursued with relentless rigor. These facts show that the prosecutions are inspired, not by principle, not by a fine sense of official duty, but by religious prejudice.

The following extract from a private letter written, on the evening of October 1, by a member of the Springville Church, will throw some light upon the methods pursued in this persecution.

> We had our quarterly meeting (the Lord's supper, etc.) to-day and had a splendid good meeting, almost every member of the church was present, and love and harmony prevailed. All seemed to be of good courage, and but for the anxiety of the prosecution, or persecution, rather.

WANT us to the people to go to us Sunday? The advocates of Sunday laws say that they shall not work and they shall not play, neither shall they see any public company to visit the parks or the country; while on the east and the city churches would slam their doors in their faces if they attempted to go to church. What are they to do?

WARNING to the Sign of the Times of the change that the Tennessee *Adventists* offended the moral sense of the community, a Methodist minister says: "The gospel itself may be no offense to these; Christ himself was" "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and has a stone that cannot to pass, his word."

But a word--Strangely enough the hardest words fall against the truth.

Two lawyers, in Ripley, Tenn., have written to us to say:--

> Being citizens of the State of Tennessee, where men are deprived of their liberty and are imprisoned for crime solely on account of their religious beliefs, we wish to say that we are strongly opposed to the un-American measure. We must honestly concur in the opinions of your most valuable paper on the subject.

These gentlemen send us a year's subscription, and a request that the paper be sent SENTINEL regularly.

ON the subject of Express and all the rest of the Morning of the 23d inst., has an interview with Bishop Doane concerning Catholics, in which that functionary declares himself in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The Bishop declares that he has no sympathy with either the Puritan or the Catholic or with the continental Sunday. But in the latter the Bishop sees one redeeming feature, he says: "The one continental Sunday that there is (to be said, however the day was said, it begins, theoretically and very often actually, with the religious service of obligatory the mass."

The man is the one important thing in the estimation of the Romanist, and if only that be not neglected it is small difference how Sunday is spent. This being the case why not have Congress make a law requiring all the employees of the Fair to attend mass on Sunday morning for what purpose the gates of the Exposition might be closed for two or three hours.

Wednesday to go before the Grand Jury and act if they know about Sunday work in this neighborhood. They seem determined to get Brother Watt and Stemple, Durks, for their toil and all three of the Dortch brothers. Brother Watt has been summoned to testify Charles Elicans because he works on Sunday, has through a minister and a gentleman yet. They asked "Did" Dortch a great many other questions of the same nature. Every question was what his two sisters did on Sunday. They asked Sterrit: "Did you work on Sunday?"

If all are indicted that they said they would be in jail it will take most of the membership.

As remarked last week, several of the witnesses summoned before the modern Inquisition were beaten more boys, it was suggested, some of them were required, to testify against their own mothers, telling what did on Sunday in the privacy of their own homes and but in the interests of Law, Order, and the national good they were required to contribute to what the sisters did on Sunday. It would not be at all surprising if it were to transpire that all of these witnesses were required to criminals themselves, and were indicted on their own testimony. It would be quite in keeping with the methods of the Tennessee Inquisition.

A CATHOLIC paper complains that Commissioners Morrison is doing his best to destroy Catholicism among the subject of Indian schools. Yet, if we, if who is his persecutors, and endowed through the constitutional motions upon to all citizens to make our objection effective, we are "dragging the Catholic Church before Congress in a manner to make Protestants totally against us at the polls. Incredible."
