BUT while Bishop Potter and very many more who are fully as much entitled to be called Christians as are those self-appointed guardians of morals, the American Sabbath Unionists, advocate an open Fair, they do not touch the real principle involved in the controversy. None of them deny the right of the State to regulate such matters; none of them take the position that Congress had no right to legislate upon the subject, because the matter of the observance or non-observance of Sunday is a religious question to be settled by each individual for himself. In fact they all tacitly admit that it is a proper subject of legislation. Indeed, even Bishop Potter's article does not rise above the dignity of a mere apology for Sunday opening. He simply urges that an open Exposition, with its commercial side closed, is not inconsistent with proper Sunday observance. He might have said with much more force that the action of Congress in conditioning the appropriation on a closed Fair was wrong in principle and mischievous as an example, because the matter of Sunday observance is something with which civil government properly has nothing to do; and that the attempt of the American Sabbath Union to intimidate the managers of the Fair by threats of boycott if it were open on Sunday, was both un-American and unchristian. But he says nothing of the kind, and simply argues for an open Fair as a matter of policy.

The question of whether the Fair shall be opened or closed on Sunday is a very small one compared with the principle involved. For more than one hundred years it was supposed, as asserted by George Washington while President, that "this Government is in no sense founded upon the Christian religion;" that in this Nation, State and Church were entirely separate; but now the Supreme Court has decided that this is, and always was, a Christian Nation; and Congress has, in its World's Fair legislation, championed a religious institution, a dogma of the dominant part of the Christian Church; and now the great question is not, Shall the Fair be open on Sunday? but, Will the people of this Nation tamely accept the dictum of the Supreme Court establishing a national religion, even though it be the religion of a vast majority? and will they even tacitly admit that Congress has a right to legislate upon religious questions, and in favor of religious institutions and dogmas? All this is now involved in the question of closing the great Fair on Sunday; for the managers of that Fair clearly desire Sunday opening. Shall they be permitted to use their own pleasure about it? or shall they be compelled to close the gates because the churches of the country regard Sunday as sacred and think it sinful to visit an Exposition on that day? If the power of the Government is to be used to coerce the managers of the Columbian Exposition in this matter, why may it not be used to coerce every citizen in religious practices—or even in opinions? The compulsory closing of the Fair is only the first step in intolerance. Will the people arouse to the danger? In the language of Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in the United States Senate in 1829, concerning a proposition to discontinue Sunday mails, it may truly be said of this, "If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not controlled, by the same influence. All religious despotism commences by combination and influence; and when the influence begins to operate upon the political institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the castastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences."

Will the people heed the warning?
