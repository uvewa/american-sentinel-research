COMMENTING upon Bishop Potter's article, the Christian Union remarks that his "is a somewhat idealized picture of the Exposition as it will actually appear if opened on Sunday afternoons and evenings; but not so idealized as the contrasted picture which imagination has sometimes painted, of a day of perfect rest and of all the sight-seers reverently attending public worship or spending the hours quietly in meditation and religious reading."
