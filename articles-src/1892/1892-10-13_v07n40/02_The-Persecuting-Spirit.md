# The Persecuting Spirit.

A SEVENTH-DAY Adventist colporter, at Pomona, Cal., writes us as follows:--

> On this side the question of Sunday-- California vs. rest--is no means free from the spirit of persecution. A few days since, a minister, a member of the Presbyterian Church, who told me he was personally acquainted with Harrison, said that it was a "regular *well to slavery*" dabbling.

Congress is conditioning the appropriation on a closed Fair was wrong in principle and mischievous as an example, because it makes the matter of Sunday observance something with which civil government property has nothing to do, and that the attempt of the American Sabbath Union to intimidate the managers of the Fair, by threats of boycott if it were open on Sunday, was both un-American and unchristian. But he says nothing of the kind, and simply argues for an open Fair as a matter of *policy.*

THE question of whether the Fair shall be opened or closed on Sunday is a very small one compared with the principle involved. For more than one hundred years, George Washington while President, laid down the rule "that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith;" that in this country, State and Church were, entirely separated; but now the Supreme Court has decided that this is, and always was, a Christian Nation; and Congress, in its appropriation for the World's Fair, has established a religious institution, a dogma of the dominant part of the Christian Church, and now the great question is not, Shall the Fair be open on Sunday? but, Will the people of this Nation tamely accept the dictum of the Supreme Court establishing a national religion, even though it be the religion of a vast majority? and will they quietly submit to the claim of Congress to a right to legislate upon religious questions, and that, too, upon the most controverted of all dogmas? All this is now involved in the question of opening the Fair on Sunday day; for the managers of that Fair clearly have not only the right but should be permitted to use their own judgment about the gates because the churches of the country have constituted themselves a lobby to get it visit an Exposition on that day? If the power of the Government is to be brought to bear in favor of closing the World's Fair Exposition in this matter, why may not the same power be used to enforce other religious practices--or even to oppress religious dissenters? The fact is that this is the first step in intolerance. Will the people heed the warning? It is time they did. The Hon. Richard M. Johnson, in the United States Senate in 1829, introducing a proposition to discontinue Sunday mails, is truly said to be said of this: "If admitted, it may be justly apprehended that the future measures of the Government will be strongly marked, if not eventually combated, by the same influence. All religious despotisms have commenced by combination and influence; and when the influence is thus brought to bear upon the institutions of a country, the civil power soon bends under it; and the catastrophe of other nations furnishes an awful warning of the consequences."

Will the people heed the warning?
