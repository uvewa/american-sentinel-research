THE Bishop's meaning will be made plain by a further quotation, as follows: "It would seem as if the door of a library were one of the doors; the door of a well-arranged and well-equipped museum, another; the door of a really worthy picture-gallery still another." All these exist, the writer argues, "for their enlightening, refining, and instructive influence." "This," says the Bishop, "would seem to indicate that, consistently with the scrupulous observance of Sunday as a day of rest, a great assemblage of the achievements of human art and industry might wisely be made a silent school-room of the progress of human civilization."
