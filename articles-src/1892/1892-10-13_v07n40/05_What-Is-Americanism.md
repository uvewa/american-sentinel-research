## What Is Americanism?

THE act of Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sunday is sharply criticised by the Philadelphia *Protestant Standard* in a recent issue. Not that it questions or at all wonders at the action, that seems to the *Standard* to be perfectly natural enough, for it says:--

> It was a persistent and very enterprising effort to carry on the work of the House of Representatives, only to have it tabled in the Senate at last.

It will be a persistent fight up to the very opening of the Exposition, for, continues the *Standard:*--

> A victory, for which let us all earnestly labor.

If one may judge from its name, the *Protestant Standard* might be expected to be well posted in the principles of bold resistance to the claims of Rome over the consciences of men. It was just the same thing in its crafty doing of Rome to secure the closing of the Columbian Exposition that the ancient Inquisition planned on a far larger scale. The *Standard* says in its plan. It commends the action of Congress because Congress has acted in harmony with the sentiment of Christendom that is to say, just as the ancient Inquisition in Israel "resolved that it was expedient" for the Jewish nation to be ruled by the Government of God.

If the Government is to become the tool of the church, and carry out its decrees, what sort of freedom is there left for those whom the so-called Christian friends have done, to receive as to compel them? If the Sunday law is the entering wedge, how long before other decrees supposed to be of the power to do harm, the religious question is to be urged, and, even further, persecution is to follow?

If there is danger in Rome and her ways, why can not the *Standard* see that the action of Congress in closing the Fair is the very road traveled by her in gaining the supremacy over the nations of Europe? There is danger in the method when there is why is there no danger when Protestants adopt the same thing? History shows that these methods become less harmful in the hands of Protestants than in those of Rome. What guaranty have we against them? If the use of the people's money to enforce religious observances is right, and the *Standard* evidently thinks it is, on what principle can the *Standard* object to "eleven millions [who] have the purpose and the determination and the constitution" to apply to Congress for aid in the maintenance of the other claims? If the practice continues, as against the wishes and against the consciences of a large number of the citizens of this country, are we not in for the very things that the *Standard* deplores in the history of Rome?

It is too late in the day for Protestants to combine and secure aid from the civil power, and then affect to stand back as if the whole matter were one on which all men may agree, upon some other religious body applying for aid. If Sunday laws are to quite so un-American for a faction of those to combine and secure the aid of the civil power, a dogma of the Church upon all citizens? Is it really? In it not in fact a faction of the religious element that are responsible for this piece of un-Americanism?

They only claim a little over eleven millions of petitioners, but some of these are counted twice, some even three times. If reports are true, twice and three times; yet, so important are they in their own estimation, and so firm in their unbending determination to accomplish their nefarious work, for they were counted as individuals, then as members of conferences, and also as members of some order or league, that many Sunday-schools and members of Christian Endeavor Societies signed those petitions because their leaders did.

So it is in fact but a faction of the religious element that are responsible for this undertaking, un-American act, and should cause patriotism, not to rejoice, but to mourn in the strongest terms. We must brand all fraud and dishonor and oppose all such attempts for as long as it has shown itself un-American and unconstitutional.

But what is true Americanism? "True Americanism" says a writer, "demands that it has not ever been that religion and all civil rights should be the same, but they should be forever separated. It is not that religion is found most in its purity when it separates from governmental patronage. It is not true Americanism found in the principles that civil and religious liberty is offered to all men equally, regardless of color, position or creed? Is it not that 'the proper object of government is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their religious as well as civil rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy.'" --*Senate report 1829.* Then why this act to decide for the whole Nation, which day shall be, in a holy day? Why is it that they have listened to these demands of a religious faction? or why should they ever listen to the demands of even the majority and legislate upon religious questions? The facts are, that the whole thing—Church lobbying and all—is un-American and unconstitutional.

The *Standard*, while it uses the the dangerous text, Rev. 13:14-18; 14:9, 10; F. F. 13:14-18, should seek for the eyesalve of the third angel's message to open the eyes to the danger in the making and worship of the image to the beast and so of the Rev. 13:14-18; 14:9, 10. F. F. PUZZLES.
