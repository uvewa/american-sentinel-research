IN the past the advocates of Sunday closing have been wont to brand all who disagreed with them as "infidels," "foes of Christianity," "allies of the saloons," etc., but in the face of such utterances as these just quoted from Bishop Potter and from the Christian Union, they must admit that even the so-called orthodox ministry and the religious press are not a unit on this question. Indeed, now that those who favor an open Fair on Sunday are beginning to declare themselves, those who demand that the Exposition shall be closed, may find that they can not laugh down the charge that they themselves are only playing into the hands of the liquor interests when they insist upon shutting people out of Jackson Park on Sunday. Upon this point Bishop Potter says:—

There has been a very persistent effort to ridicule the idea that saloon keepers and their like, and worse, in Chicago, would be friendly to the closing of the Exposition on Sunday, since it would force the crowds of idle strangers into their doors—either front or rear. But such ridicule is very ill-timed in view of facts that are abundantly well known as to the use that people shut out from the Exposition made of their Sunday afternoons in Philadelphia. It may indeed be urged by those who are contending for the closing of the Exposition throughout Sunday that they are not responsible for what people do with themselves so long as they keep them out of the Exposition. But it would seem as if it might with some pertinency be retorted that if they are simply devoting themselves to a work of exclusion, it would be better worth while to shut up some other doors before they troubled themselves to close those of the Exposition.
