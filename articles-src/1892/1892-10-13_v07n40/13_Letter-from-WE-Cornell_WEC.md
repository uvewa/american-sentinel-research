## Letter from W. E. Cornell.

ther Church and State regime. History repeats itself, and the same conditions as work to out own country that were in operation then will surely produce the same results. It does not argue for alarm, but for preparation; not for fear, but for trust to an extent that we will in time have created right; but it can ever be, indeed, but a condition at a distance, yet with God's help. The course we have brought should simply because the evil power had authority to enforce what was regarded as right.

For one, sincerely hope that time will never come when the minister will have power to sweep away the stoles, as a resistant agitation to the matter of a natural sentiment in favor of a nation, even though it may be wholly wrong in principle. I should be glad to know that my fears have been misapprehended, and to this end would respectfully submit my views.

W. E. CORNELL.

Parish House, St. James's,
N. Y., June 30, 1892.

*Dear Sir:* Your interesting letter of the 16th is at hand. It seems a pity that even those who compel men to be "orthodox" in their opinions this religion is not precisely a matter of opinion; that it is really religion that is the soul (practical morality and humanity) is the life of the Nation and our civilization can not exist for a day without it. Religion is the elemental truth of religion; it is the salvation of science; it is the taking care of God's children.

I believe that the failure of the American political Concordance were due to a leaving especially out of account the religious sentiment. In the prosecution of their plan that we shall be able to re-claim the American Republic to our principles, and thereby save the Nation from the formidable dangers that now threaten its dissolution.

I am not personally in sympathy with the establishment of that American church for which I hope and pray, yet I confess that while I think the attempt to "establish" it by force of law is clearly an illegal way. Certainly it will be like nothing else in our history; and while I understand it will itself only as more repeat the stories of civilization.

In such facts as these I find the strongest argument against the separation of Church and State, it seems to me to be very obviously apparent. The English establishment has shown that it is a sort of kind of religion that has to do only with the "next world;" the establishment makes it a reality and a manifestation; (3) The increasing popular consciousness that only a law and not simply a moral principle, will avail to save us from the social disaster, a consummation which on the day that is fully and taken to be found firm, and under a complete church, as the establishment rather than as a new, officeseeker, or as an afterthought--will then begin to take form. It will not be the "established American church of which the President of the United States would be the 'temporal head'" that the last distinguished prelate occupying a place in the acknowledged band, of the English ministry; but it will do the work for America, and indeed it has become a commonplace to say I hope that you may hear from you again. I thank you very much for the interest you have taken in this subject.

CHARLES PELLING.

Mr. Ferguson has recently resigned his pastorate. The publication did not take kindly to some of his views. It does not appear however that they dissented from his advocacy of a union of Church and State, for there are members who still cling to the idea of a great American church with the president of the United States as temporal head and that they sell their valuable church property for the relief of the poor; they intimated that they would like to employ another pastor; hence the resignation.

"Is the Church plug for Conscience' sake" is the title of one of the latest tracts published by the National Religious Liberty Association. It is a 16 page tract. This tract is also published in the German, Swedish, and Danish languages. Address all orders to Review and Herald, Battle Creek, Michigan, or Pacific Press, Oakland, Cal.
