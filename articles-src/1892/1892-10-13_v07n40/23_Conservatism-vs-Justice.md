The difficulty of securing a change in a law which affects only a small portion of those who have a voice in the matter, is well illustrated by the repeated failures of the Welsh dissenters to secure at the hands of the British Parliament, disestablishment in Wales. The law assumes that the Church of Wales is the church of the Welsh people; but the notorious fact is that three-fourths of the Welsh people are dissenters—principally Baptists and Wesleyans. Justice to the people of Wales demands disestablishment, but English conservatism and indifference defeats the measure. It is stated, however, that Mr. Gladstone has invited an eminent Welsh ecclesiastic to draft a bill for the disestablishment of the Welsh Church. It is conceded that this question will come to the front as soon as home rule is out of the way. Mr. Gladstone himself may not carry the act, but his successor in the leadership of the Liberal Party with probably do so.
