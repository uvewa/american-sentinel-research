On this subject the Union Signal says:

There is one thing that Christian people may as well accept as settled, and that is that the Columbian Exposition will be open on Sunday, if the powers of darkness, assisted by their usual allies in this world, the evil, the well meaning, but mistaken or indolent, the indifferent and the weak, can compass that event. The tone of the secular papers shows that it is fatal to trust to any partial victory or to any temporal decisions in favor of Sunday closing. The opponents of that measure will not be defeated until they are utterly routed. This being the case, it is the part of wisdom to look the issue in the face and see just what the opening of our World's Fair on Sunday involves.

Negatively, we throw away the rarest opportunity of preaching in the world, by a magnificent object lesson, the benefits of a day of rest.

Incidentally, our faith in and loyalty to our religion will preach with all the tongues of Pentecost the gospel of Christ. At a cost which can not be computed of labor, treasure and love, we send our brightest and best to carry that gospel to foreign lands. In our own land, without labor or sacrifice, we may proclaim Christ's religion to the whole world by the most effective of all modes—practice. If we throw open the gates of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, we are false to the greatest opportunity ever granted a Christian Nation.

The "civil rest day" has evidently been swallowed up by the ecclesiastical institution; in other words the mask has been thrown off and the demand is openly made that the Nation shall support a dogma of the Church for missionary purposes.
