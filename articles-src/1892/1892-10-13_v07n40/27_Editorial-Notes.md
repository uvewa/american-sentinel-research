WHAT are the people to do on Sunday? The advocates of Sunday laws say that they shall not work and they shall not play, neither shall they use public conveyances to visit the parks or the country; while the most of the city churches would slam their doors in their faces if they attempted to go to church. What are they to do?

WRITING to the Signs of the Times of the charge that the Tennessee Adventists "offended the moral sense of the community," a Methodist minister says: "The gospel itself may be an offense to some." Christ himself was "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense," and he said that he "came not to send peace, but a sword." But why a sword?—Simply because the natural heart would war against the truth.

TWO lawyers, in Ripley, Tenn., have written to us saying:—

Although we reside in the State of Tennessee, where men are deprived of their liberty and are inmured in prison for observing Sunday contrary to the popular custom, we desire to say that we are strongly opposed to the shameful persecution. We most heartily concur in the opinions of your most valuable paper on this subject.

These gentlemen send us a year's subscription, and will hereafter read THE SENTINEL regularly.

THE Mail and Express of the 3d inst., has an interview with Bishop Doane (Roman Catholic), in which that functionary avows himself in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The Bishop declares that he has no sympathy with either the Puritan Sabbath or with the continental Sunday. But in the latter the Bishop sees one redeeming feature; he says: "For the continental Sunday there is this to be said, however the day may end, it begins, theoretically and very often actually, with the religious service of obligation—the mass."

THE mass is the one important thing in the estimation of the Romanist, and if only that be not neglected it is small difference how Sunday is spent. This being the case why not have Congress make a law requiring all the employees of the Fair to attend mass on Sunday morning? for which purpose the gates of the Exposition might be closed for two or three hours.

Now that the Supreme Court and Congress have undertaken to regulate the religion of the Nation, there could be no impropriety in going just a step further and requiring the employees to attend mass. The mass is no more a religious institution than is the Sunday, and if it is all right to require the observance of one why not of the other also?

THE author of "The Sabbath in Puritan New England," relates that "a large portion of the stipends in early parishes being paid in corn and labor, the amounts were established by fixed rate upon the inhabitants; and the amount of land owned and cultivated by each church member was considered in reckoning his assessments. These amounts," continues the historian, "were called voluntary contributions. If, however, any citizen refused to 'contribute,' he was taxed; and if he refused to pay his church tax he could be fined, imprisoned, or pilloried. For one hundred years the ministers' salaries in Boston were paid by these so-called 'voluntary contributions.'"

This scrap of Puritan history is interesting as it gives a clue to some of the ideas entertained by National Reformers in regard to religious liberty. This is the kind of 'voluntary' religious service that the National Reformers propose to require at the hands of all the people. They will leave everybody free in religious things—just as the Puritans did in this matter of paying the ministers' salaries.

It is unfortunate that the Attorney-General of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Tennessee feels impelled to continue the persecution of the Adventists in Henry County, that State. No sound principle requires such action on his part. He knows—for he can not fail to know—that others than Adventists work in Henry County on Sunday, and yet he takes no action against them. Sunday work, Sunday picnics, Sunday excursions, and Sunday squirrel hunting go on in the immediate neighborhood of his own town, but he takes no notice of it, though attention has been publicly called to the facts. But the Adventists are pursued with unrelenting rigor. These facts show that the prosecutions are inspired, not by principle, not by a fine sense of official duty, but by religious prejudice.

The following extract from a private letter written, on the evening of October 1, by a member of the Springville church, will throw some light upon the methods pursued in this persecution:—

We had our quarterly meeting [the Lord's supper, etc.] to-day and had a splendid good meeting. Almost every member of the church was present, and love and harmony prevailed. All seemed to be of good courage, and not at all afraid of the prosecutions, or persecutions, rather.

As you already know, they took some eighteen witnesses, mostly young men and boys, up to Paris Wednesday to go before the Grand Jury and tell all they knew about Sunday work in this neighborhood. They seem determined to get Brother Ward and Grandpa Dortch, for they took all three of Brother Ward's boys and "Bud" Dortch. They intended to have Charley Brigham because he worked at Dortch's, but through a mistake got his brother instead. They asked "Bud" Dortch a great many questions about his father, and even asked him what his two sisters did on Sunday. They asked Harvey Moon what his mother did on Sunday.

If all are indicted that they got information against it will take nearly the whole church.

As remarked last week, several of the witnesses summoned before this modern Inquisition were more boys; and, as we also suggested, some of them were required to testify against their own mothers, telling what they did on Sunday in the privacy of their own homes? And this in the name of Law, Order, and Justice!!

Another witness, a young man, was required to tell what his sisters did on Sunday! It would not be at all surprising if it were to transpire that some of these witnesses were required to criminate themselves, and were indicted on their own testimony. It would be quite in keeping with the methods of the Tennessee Inquisition.

A CATHOLIC paper complains that Commissioner Morgan is doing his best to destroy Catholic missions among the Indians, and says: "Yet, if we object to his persecutions and endeavor through the constitutional means open to all citizens to make our objection effective, we are 'dragging religion into politics,' and we are acting in a manner to make Protestants combine against us at the polls. Indeed! Why should Protestants consider themselves aggrieved because we ask for justice? What would the Methodists do, if a Catholic president and a Catholic priest Commissioner of Indian affairs and a Catholic priest Inspector of Indian schools were to adopt an anti-Methodist policy in any of the fields of government? Would the Methodists utter no protest? Would they vote to prolong the tenure of office of their oppressors."

The whole trouble is in the fact that the Government ever became involved in the support of denominational schools among the Indians, or anywhere else. The Government can be impartial as between the sects only by letting religion and all religious questions entirely alone.
