A Seventh-day Adventist colporter, at Pomona, Cal., writes us as follows:—

Although we have no State Sunday law here in California we are by no means free from the spirit of persecution. In my colporter work, a few miles north of this place, a short time since, I met a man, a member of the Presbyterian Church, who told another member of the same church, in my presence that I was "engaged in a very bad work;" that I was a "regular wolf in sheep's clothing, going from house to house attacking our American Sabbath, and insulting our Government;" and that "such work ought to be stopped;" and that if he had the power he would brand me with a hot iron and give me thirty days to leave the country in; and if I ever came back he would hang me.

Conventions to "promote the better observance of the Sabbath" are being held in some parts of this State.

This is the same spirit that in Tennessee puts Christian men in the chain-gang for dissent from the prevailing religion. We may expect to see it manifested more and more under the fostering influence of the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, and the Sunday bills enacted by the Fifty-second Congress.
