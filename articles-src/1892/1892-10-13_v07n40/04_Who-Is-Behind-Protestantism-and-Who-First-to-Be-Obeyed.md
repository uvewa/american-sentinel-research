## Who Is Behind Protestantism, and Who First to be Obeyed?

THAT guarding of Sabbath and Sunday observances is to be arbitrarily usurped and the deceptions of Satan will flood the world. The man of sin has instituted a spurious Sabbath, and the Protestant world has taken this child of the Papacy and cradled and nurtured it. Satan means to make all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of the fornication of Babylon. Men are banding themselves together to come to the God of heaven. The first day of the week will finally be enforced as a Sabbath for all observers. Shall we be followers of the commandments of men, shall we bow to the authorities of earth and despise the Creator? The powers of darkness have been gathering their forces to bring this about in the world, that is to say, the man of sin may exalt himself above God. God does not force men to obey him, but the powers of darkness have been trying to compel men to disobey him; men ever since Abel fell under the murderous blow from the hand of jealous Cain have suffered and died rather than yield to his own service.

Satan has contrived to bring about a state of things in which righteousness would be termed irregularity, and irregularities righteousness. What are we to do? We are to keep in living connection with the God of heaven, bearing his name and wearing his robe, and we are not afraid to let it come forth that we are called sinners, that glorious blindness that can discern truth from error. What we want to know is what is right--not what is customary-- and do you think that all the powers of darkness that press against the laws of God bring about a condition of things where men will make the Sunday the Sabbath, we will have an opportunity to know what it is to suffer? And because a penalty is not now to the image, and retribution mark of the beast in the hand, or the forehead, but will stand in the truth because it is the truth, there will be opposition; and an attempt to compel the conscience and to force obedience to that which is not true, and the example of other nations furnishes an awful warning of what is coming.

Will the people heed the warning?

It may not come to the notice of all, but it is well that we direct attention to the observance of the genuine Sabbath, and God will give us light and understanding within.

The question is asked, Shall we not keep the first day? I have been taught that way in harmony with the higher nature that the God made the law for all the universe. He created man, he gave the benediction, protection of nature, folds our breath and life in his hand, daily renews his bounties. The idea before all the great men and the highest before them.

No law has ever been made to exalt the old Sabbath; but that Satan has taken the lead for its enforcement is significant foremost. Every law for the elevation of Sunday brings down the dignity of the fourth commandment. Every move that has been made to enforce the observance of Sunday has been made for the purpose of exalting the man of sin above God and Christ that is now enforced. Satan would have us exalt the old Sabbath, but we can not do it, for it would be disloyalty to God. In the face of Nebuchadnezzar's decree of death, the three Hebrew children refused to bend their knees, preferring to stand in the fiery furnace rather than bow to the golden image. They declared they were not careful to answer the king, and said, If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

They were thrown into the burning fiery furnace, but the Lord was with them. The king looked into the furnace, and said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God;" after the king's faith was tested, he declared and said to those around him, therefore I make a decree, that whatsoever wishful to show to the people, nations, and languages that the great I AM, the God of the heavens, the creator of the worlds--the eternal and ever blessed and unchangeable God--shall be worshipped. Did not the Hebrews break the law of the land? Yes, but the law of God was first to be obeyed.--*Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald.*
