## Sunday Observance in Tennessee.

TENNESSEE, as our readers are aware, is a State where they have no toleration nor regard for Sunday that they can not permit conscientious observers of the seventh day to do ordinary farm labor on the first day, and a number of Adventists have been, during the month of October, it comes a fresh case in this misfortune.

A report from there, touching the persecution of Adventists all over the world each day, and the measure of the treatment they have received at the hands of the enemies of religious liberty, is received.

This report contains the following concerning the man who will doubtless be prosecuted for Sunday work:

> Judge *Peter Turney* arrived in the city yesterday.

This initial advertisement then continues:

> A NOTORIOUS CASE. Witnesses to be examined. By the early train, over the "Elim N." and was at his post this morning of the term of court. Judge Turney came from Alamo, Tenn., where he had spent several weeks looking after his extensive private interests. The counties repaired at once upon the opening of court. Judge Turney received a number of visitors during the day. Among them were ministers as well as other prominent Democrats.

Then another advertisement:

> *Judge Sr.* Reported Amended.

This initial advertisement contains the following:

> It is unfortunate that the Attorney-General of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Tennessee feels impelled to continue the prosecution of the Adventists of Henry County, that State. No sane principle requires such action on his part. He knows, for no can fail to know, that others than Adventists work in Henry County on Sunday, and yet he takes no action against them. Sunday week, Sunday picnics, Sunday excursions, and Sunday squirrel hunting go on in the immediate neighborhoods of his own home, but he takes no notice of it, though attention has been publicly called to the facts. But the Adventists are pursued with relentless rigor. These facts show that the prosecutions are inspired, not by principle, not by a fine sense of official duty, but by religious prejudice.

The following extract from a private letter written, on the evening of October 1, by a member of the Springville Church, will throw some light upon the methods pursued in this persecution.

> We had our quarterly meeting (the Lord's supper, etc.) to-day and had a splendid good meeting, almost every member of the church was present, and love and harmony prevailed. All seemed to be of good courage, and but for the anxiety of the prosecution, or persecution, rather.

This report goes on to say that the initial advertisement then contains the following:

> Wednesday to go before the Grand Jury and act if they knew about Sunday work in this neighborhood. They seem determined to get Brother Watt and Stemple, Durks, for their jail and all three of the Dortch brothers. Brother Watt has been summoned to testify. He acted as counsel for Elder Conley. He asked: "Did Conley here a good name in the community? That is, through a minister and a gentleman! What did he do on Sunday? They asked." Did Conley a great many other questions of the same nature. Every question was what his two sisters did on Sunday. They asked Sterrit: "Did you work on Sunday?"

> If all are indicted that they said they would be in jail it will take most of the membership.
