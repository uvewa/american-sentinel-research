## There Is Mischief in It.

IN commenting upon the Supreme Court decision, that this is a Christian Nation, a writer in the *Christian Statesman* signs himself "Politus." "Politus," says:--

> There is a state union of church and State which is established among all nations at all times of the Papacy, in fact it can only result in the setting up of one church to lord it over the rest.

If the "Christian nation" decision is but a step toward making religion a matter of the individual conscience, the Supreme Court decision cannot but be mischievous to the cause of individual rights. But as the right of petition is always the guaranteed right of the people, and the further right of the people to take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the court of public opinion, the mischief should and will be counteracted.

But let every man and every woman be sure to cast his or her vote against the admission of this mischief. There is danger in almost every move that is made, something that is insidious, something that takes away from individual liberty. This doctrine, that this is a Christian nation, never designed that any man or set of men should be obliged to observe any particular day or to worship (or not to worship) according to the dictates of any other man or set of men.

All of which is beside mark.
