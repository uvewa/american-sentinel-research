## What a Confession!

In view of the efforts which are making to secure a repeal of the Sunday closing proviso in the World's Fair appropriation signed by Congress at its last session, the *Examiner* (Baptist, of this city) says:--

> The powers to undo the injustice, lack and equipped the pulpits, a time for war-like.

The *Century Dictionary* defines "wire-pulling" thus:

> 1. The act of pulling the wire, as of a puppet show. 2. *Figuratively*, the use of secret or underhand influence; especially, the exertion of such influence through the agency of others; indirect personal interference with the action or disposition of a body of persons, especially a political organization, a legislature, or the like, through interest, or through fear.

The *Examiner* has used the term familiarly. The adoption of the proviso by Congress was secured by wire-pulling, and yet a professedly religious paper, discussing this matter entered the field of political influence, advising still more wire-pulling, seems to see no inconsistency in thus advising even to wire-pulling. There is no consistency in trying to use such means to evade the Nation and make it Christian by law, or at Congress ever could make that body by whatsoever means are necessary.

In the earlier ages of the world, religious means were used to secure the desired legislation. Probably it was a delegation of senators at Washington did not vote for Sunday closing from personal preference, but, to use a very trite expression "to satisfy, er, to say," under the influence of an intelligent, well-read, public "the intelligent, well-read public," of the ministerial association; under the combined efforts of the American Sabbath Union; but instead of the Congress of the nation having mandated the recognition of Sunday sacred rest by closing the gates of the Fair, which is still, only a small minority. But by intimidation they secured the result they sought for, and now they confess that they must resort to the same methods, with unhindered influences. What a confession!
