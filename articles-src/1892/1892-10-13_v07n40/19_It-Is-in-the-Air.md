Newport, the village mentioned in the following paragraph taken from an Oregon paper, is a small place in Benton County, Oregon, never noted for its piety. But it seems that the Sunday-closing crusade does not despise the day of small things, nor the town of small population and less religion. The story as told by the Salem Journal, is as follows:—

The people down at Newport are having a lively time over the enforcement of the Sunday law. Recently two of its young men were arrested for violating some of its provisions, but were acquitted, says the Herald. The mayor, George Landis, aided by the district attorney, Seymour Condon, of Eugene, who happened to be over there, ordered all the saloons and places of amusement to be kept closed on Sunday and gave notice through the press that any violation would be vigorously prosecuted. Early Sunday morning two images were seen dangling from the top of a flagpole, the mayor and Mr. Condon having been hung in effigy. This was too much for Mayor Landis and he tried to take the obnoxious figures down, but the ropes had become entangled and they seemed to be there to stay. The mayor then arrayed himself with a shovel and dug the pole out of the ground and took the images away and burned them. The other faction then swore out a complaint and had the mayor arrested for working on Sunday. The result of his trial will be awaited with interest. A lot of notices were posted about town accusing Mayor Landis of high-handed anarchy, which were torn down, resulting in several free fights. The end of it seems not yet, and some further developments may be expected.

Great is Sunday! "the wild solar holiday of all pagan times," as an English writer has styled it. Infidels, and Christians vie with one another to do it reverence—or rather to compel others to honor it. The correspondent who sends the clipping quoted above, remarks that "what makes this item of interest is the fact that hitherto the people have thought that in this 'infidel country,' as they have been wont to call it, there was no danger of the enforcement of Sunday laws. It seems, however, that the very air is impregnated with this intolerant Sunday spirit."
