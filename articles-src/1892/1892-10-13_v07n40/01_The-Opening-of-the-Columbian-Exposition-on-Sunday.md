# The Opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday.

THIS October *Forum* has an article by Bishop Potter on the opening of the "Columbian Exposition" which is attracting considerable attention, not because of the prominence of the writer in the religious world, and because of the views set forth in the article.

BISHOP POTTER is a believer in Sunday observance, though he does not base the observance of the day upon the fourth commandment, as does the American Sabbath Union. He believes it to be a good Sunday in America when men begin to recognize its meaning and usefulness. But he has some views that when we have closed all the doors which, if open, might help to teach them these things.

THE Bishop's meaning will be made plain by a further quotation, as follows. He would say of the doors of the Fair "be open to those who want the other, the door of a well-regulated and well-equipped museum, another, the door of a really worthy picture-gallery still another." "All these stand," says the writer, "for that which is inspiring, refining, and instructive influences." "That," says the Bishop, "is something to indicate that, consistently with the scrupulous observance of Sunday as a day of rest, a great assemblage of the achievements of human art and industry might wisely be made a silent school-room of the progress of the human civilization."

SETTING forth his views further, the Bishop says:--

> Let the Columbian Exposition pertain to the best of its art, its most valuable and instructive contributions, be open on Sunday, but with no wheel turning, no engine moving, no booth or counter open to buyer or seller, no sign of barter or commerce, along with the noblest and, better still, by its doors closed till the morning hours of every Sunday are ended-- that the American people believe in a day of rest. But if there be those who would have and enjoy the chance to look, it may be, more closely at the handiwork of man, to study the progress of the race in the story of its artistic and industrial and mechanical achievements, and to recognize that, as it may easily be, in the spirit of such achievements, with Job, that "there is a spirit in man, and that the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding,"--that certainly can be no unworthy use of Sunday.

COMMENTING upon Bishop Potter's article, the *Christian Union* remarks that this "is a noteworthy and idealized picture of the Exposition as it will actually appear if opened on Sunday afternoons and evenings; but not so idealistic as the contrasted picture which imagination has sometimes painted, of a day of perfect rest and of all the sight-seers reverently attending public worship or spending the hours quietly in meditation as religious reading."

The *Christian Union* continues:--

> Bishop Potter's view is that which we have from the first advocated--an opening of the educational and a closing of the commercial side of the Fair. In our judgment Bishop Potter correctly represents the sober second thought of the thoughtful portion of the American people upon the express question involved in the condition of absolute closing advised by Colonel Shepard and the Sabbath Union. ... It would be somewhat too ideally picturesque would be a fair without law closing the park, which has heretofore always been open to the people, and shutting them out absolutely for the entire day from a view of those exhibits which are connected with the fine arts and industry.

In the past the advocates of Sunday closing have been wont to brand all who disagreed with them as "infidels," "foes of Christianity," "allies of the saloon," etc., but in the face of such utterances as those just quoted from Bishop Potter and from the *Christian Union,* they must admit that even the so-called orthodox ministers of Christianity are not a unit on this question. Indeed, now that those who favor an open Fair on Sunday are beginning to declare themselves, those who demand that the Exposition shall be closed, may find that they are being laid down to the charge that they themselves are only playing into the hands of the liquor interests when they insist upon shutting people out of Jackson Park on Sunday.

Upon this point Bishop Potter says:

> There has been a very persistent effort to ridicule some of us as the foes of the working people because we, in Chicago, would be friendly to the closing of the World's Fair upon Sunday. I venture to maintain that those who are concerned to receive the crowds of idle strangers into their doorways and bar-rooms on Sunday are not friendly to their interest in view of facts that are abundantly well attested. The men who manage the World's Exposition made of their Sunday afternoons in Philadelphia it is not unfair to say for the purpose of gain. And those who are contending for the closing of the Columbian Exposition Sunday that it may serve as a vehicle for what people do with themselves on the Sabbath, have long kept out of the Exposition all Sunday,--the question for the Exposition managers is first to be rested of that they are simply devoting themselves to their own interests, and that others as well wish to show and open other doors before they open those of the Exposition to those of the Fair.

BUT while Bishop Potter and very many more who are by any fair standard entitled to be called Christians are those self appointed guardians of morals, the American Sabbath Union, are advocates of the Fair, they do not touch the real question at all. They are, each of them, largely involved in the controversy. Some of them deny the right of the State to regulate such matters; others there are who position that Congress had no right to legislate upon the subject, but leave the matter of the observance or non-observance of any day as a rest day, where it belongs, to be settled by each individual for himself. In fact they all tacitly admit that it is a matter of individual conscience; for even Bishop Potter's article does not rise above the dignity of a mere apology for Sunday opening. He simply urges that Sunday opening will not be so bad after all.

All of which is beside the mark.
