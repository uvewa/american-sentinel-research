THE Christian Union continues:—

Bishop Potter's view is that which we have from the first advocated—an opening of the educational and a closing of the commercial side of the Fair. In our judgment, Bishop Potter more correctly represents the sober second thought of the thoughtful portion of the American people than does the more rigorous measure involved in the condition of absolute closing affixed by Congress to its appropriation; and such a condition as he somewhat too ideally pictures would be a far better testimony to a true Sunday observance than a drastic law closing the park, which has heretofore always been open to the people, and shutting them out absolutely for the entire day from a view of "this great assemblage of the achievements of human art and industry."
