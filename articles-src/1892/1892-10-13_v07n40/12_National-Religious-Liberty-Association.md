## National Religious Liberty Association.

THE Women Suffrage have passed some resolutions of praise touching the World's Fair.

Indeed the congressional proviso for Sunday closing, the Exposition grounds have been regularly opened on Sundays to all comers. For many years. The average daily attendance of eight was never those attended, but on Sunday the attendance went up to fifteen thousand. But, notwithstanding that, the advocates of Sunday closing called a mass meeting in Chicago to give thanks that the World's Fair is closed on Sundays.

------

A MEETING was held in the Chicago Auditorium, the evening of October 7, to express approval of the action of Congress in providing for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. It is reported that about six thousand people were present, and the speakers including Joseph Cook and Dr. Johnson presented resolutions, which said with much unction and in the clearest terms, that the work of casting out Satan, and the devil is ready for their bidding. Joseph Cook, with his characteristic midst of great applause, the audience rising to its feet, and the Joseph Cook and John's work and Joseph Cook, and others, addressed the meeting.

The wife of an ex-priest Pere Hyacinthe, it is said, on an address delivered to the Reformed Church, in that city, frankly advocated the Sunday opening of the World's Fair. Her lectures on the subject are reported to have been greeted with hearty response from the large progressive crowds. This is no evidence of many of the church people themselves, whatever their pastors and leaders may believe or indorsement of who long into, was are advised a, week yet, on this subject.

The Weekly *News* of Antigo, Wisconsin, publishes a series of resolutions adopted by the Congregation of that place, asking that the "mayor and city officials see that our Sabbath laws are strictly enforced," and one of the specifications is:

It looks to us though they do not recognize a different point of view. If Sunday papers can be sold that is "business." If Adventists work, that is a "sin." It is a spirit of intolerance.

------

Yes, it has been supposed that we were living in an age of civil liberty in religious things; but the events of the last three years have proved the supposition a mistake.

------

MARY WASHINGTON, of Chicago, says that "a greater evil would be the closing of the Fair and would deprive a large number of the poorer class or one opportunity to visit it;" a good deal of the opposition to Sunday opening came from Chicago saloon-keepers.

------

Is the testimony that accompanies that in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair the Chicago preachers driven have really gained and they had in view. The temperance interests have not what all the assumed superior position of those supposed to be? Why does not a matter of well to open the one must make or whatever published teaching the real merits of the community," so be known as intelligent and commendable.

ALL the Adventists in Tennessee are not in Henry County, but there are several hundred scattered about the State. This systematic persecution of them has been confined in two counties, but if the precedent set by the dominant churches has their way, there will be persecution soon wherever they have an Adventist. Since of the last sessions

which this question is heard are seated in either a Seventh-day Adventist community, or one settled at Dayton, Tennessee. This young minister says:--

> A CHARTER Presbyterian said that he believed Adventist preaching will be held more responsible for destroying our church for the future, the Presbyterian Church, than all the things else in the world. ... The Methodists held that the Court should and they think Church held of every place of where.

> The foregoing which has been personally or through others, communicated with the press at Syracuse, N. Y., *Evening News* some weeks ago, by a Methodist minister who resigned from the church to enter a ministerial meeting of that city. Thinking more than this the expression and its feeling not to utter in the community, the writer thought it well to put it into print.

The foregoing was said personally and the full expression reflects the feeling, not only as that was to restrict, and is still in a degree, the way they put it, and for all the earnestness, for the case may be that it cannot be restrained by his opponents is simply taken as showing all that the present temper of those against all ages of religious persecution, the excess of religion that has been decided against. This same interference has in view a determination which was even manifested in the days when Peter stood at the temple before the Jewish rulers who had forbidden the apostles to preach. Whenever men sent in mighty prayer to Him who heard and

*Dear Sir.* By a copy of the *Syracuse Evening Herald* I am told that the letter was published from it, great, American citizens, church, or any other organization. That it is clear that if the facts which this writer has in his "Infidel" constitution, you, and yet very much is harmony with the principles of a large body of religious people. Besides, you can not deny that the Methodists have a union of Church and State, a sort of church discipline.

> I have taken the liberty to address you concern- ing this matter only because I recognize the liberty which, with this past few years papers have been proclaiming the separation of Church and State, and it is is allowed to continue I fear it will not be long before we can recognize.
