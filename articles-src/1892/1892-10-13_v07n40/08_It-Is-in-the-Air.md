## It Is in the Air.

NEWTOWN, the village mentioned in the following paragraph taken from an Oregon paper, is a small place in Benton County, Oregon. The very fact that the same effort seems to have the grip on these little towns and villages of the country speaks volumes for the impulse to force others to submit to their views of Sunday. The extract from the town of small population and less prominence, the *Albany Democrat-Journal,* is as follows:--

> There is at the present time quite a commotion over the enforcement of the Sunday law. It seems that several business houses have been in the habit of keeping open on Sunday, being prohibited, says the *Herald.* The mayor, George Condon, a citizen in good standing and formerly a citizen of Europe, who happened to be over there, directed the attention of the people to the matter. He made known his resolution publicly, and announced through the press that any violation would be vigorously prosecuted; and he declared that any house open on Sunday would be prosecuted to the full extent of the law; but in spite of this, the mayor and Mr. Condon having been living in the town but a short time--announced he would enforce the Sunday law against violators, and he tried to take the obnoxious figures down, and otherwise to enforce the law. The proprietor of the principal saloon on the main street armed himself with a shovel and drag the pole out of the ground and otherwise show his contempt for the law. The mayor thereupon swore out a complaint and had the mayor arrested for working on Sunday.
