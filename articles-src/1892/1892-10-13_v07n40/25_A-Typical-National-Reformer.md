Rev. Charles Ferguson said that he believed in one organic church for the future, the great American church, of which the President of the United States should be the acknowledged head, which church should take hold of every phase of American life.

The foregoing which has been previously referred to in these columns, was clipped from the Syracuse, N. Y., Evening News, some weeks ago, and reported as the utterance of Mr. Ferguson before a ministerial meeting of that city. Thinking there very strange words for a minister of the gospel to utter in this country, the following letter was addressed to him, and elicited the subjoined reply, which certainly entitles him to the palm as a typical National Reformer:—

Des Moines, Iowa, June 21, 1892.

Rev. Charles Ferguson.

Syracuse, N. Y.

Dear Sir: By a copy of the Syracuse Evening News of the 13th inst. you are reported as expressing yourself as believing in "one organic church, for the future, the great American church, of which the President of the United States shall be the acknowledged head, which church shall take hold of every phase of American life."

It strikes the writer that if these are your sentiments, you are not very much in harmony with the fundamental principles underlying this Republic, for were your ideas to materialize we would have a union of Church and State in verity, which combination the founders of our Government studiously sought to avoid.

I have taken the liberty to address you concerning this matter more particularly for the reason that within the past few years there appears to have been a wonderful growth of sentiment among the religious element of the land right along this line, and if it is allowed to continue I fear it will not be long ere we see just what Rome saw under her Church and State regime. History repeats itself, and the same conditions at work in our own country that were in operation then will surely produce the same results. Is there not cause for alarm that these sentiments will continue to grow to such an extent that we will in time have created right here in our own beloved land a condition that will lead to the Dark Ages, which condition then was brought about simply because the civil power had authority to enforce what was regarded as orthodox in religion?

I, for one, sincerely hope that time will never come in this country, but as continual dropping wears away the stone, so a constant agitation of the matter of a united sentiment in favor of a certain line of thought may bring about action in that line, even though it may be wholly wrong in principle. I should be glad to know that your views have been misinterpreted, and to this end would respectfully solicit a reply hereto.

Very truly yours,

W. E. CORNELL.

Parish House, St. James Free Church,
Syracuse, N. Y., June, 23, 1892.

To W. E. CORNELL, Esq.,
Des Moines, Iowa.

Dear Sir: Your interesting letter of the 21st is at hand. Certainly I do not desire a civil power to compel men to be "orthodox" in their opinions. But religion is not primarily a matter of opinions. Religion is the deep background of common justice, morality and humanity; it is the life of the Nation. The commonwealth would disintegrate in a day without it. Religion is the elemental truth of things; it is the science of sciences; it is the taking of the facts of the universe as they are.

I believe that the fathers of the American political Constitution were wise in keeping speculate theology out of politics. I hope by the steady prosecution of their plan that we shall be able to get more and more of living religion into politics, and thereby save the Nation from the formidable dangers that now threaten its disruption.

I have no cut-and-dried prescription for the establishment of that American church for which I hope and pray. I expect that it will wait and grow in the divine, vital, historic, irregular, illogical way. Certainly it will be like nothing that ever was in the world before. History repeats itself only as men repeat the stories of childhood, in an ever-changing sense.

The signs of the growth of this great church seem to me to be very obviously apparent. The two main tendencies that make in this direction are: (1) the increasing popular contempt for the kind of religion that has to do only with the "next world"—a contempt which will ultimately destroy sectarianism; (2) The increasing popular consciousness that only a true and vital religion can solve the pressing economic and political problems—a consciousness which on the day that it fully awakens to the broad truth that religion is the foundation of the State—not a decoration, an efflorescence, or an afterthought—will then begin the construction of the outward form of that "American church of which the President of the United States shall be the acknowledged head, and which shall concern itself with every phase of American life."

I can see nothing very terrible about this—no racks, no thumb-screws. The Sovereign of England is the "acknowledged head" of the English Church; but the Inquisition is not in session there; and indeed it has become a commonplace to say that the English Constitution is practically more free and democratic than our own.

I hope that I may hear from you again. I thank you for your letter, and beg to subscribe myself,

Yours sincerely,

CHARLES FERGUSON,
Rector of St. James Church.

Mr. Ferguson has recently resigned his pastorate. His parishioners did not take kindly to some of his views. It does not appear however that they dissented from his advocacy of a union of Church and State; they apparently saw nothing alarming in the idea of a great American church with the President at its head; but when Mr. Ferguson proposed that they sell their valuable church property for the relief of the poor, they intimated that they would like to employ another pastor; hence the resignation.
