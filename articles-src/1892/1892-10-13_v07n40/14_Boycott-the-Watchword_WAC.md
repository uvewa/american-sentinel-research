The word of the Lord is out that the time would come in this country when it would be declared that no man might buy or sell save he that had the papal badge—the Sunday Sabbath—or the name or number of the name of the Papacy. Rev. 13:16, 17. That this time is rapidly approaching and the days soon to dawn when the full force of this situation of things shall be realized is evident from the present movements of the friends and supporters of the Papal Sabbath. Says the Chicago Inter-Ocean of September 26:

Boycott is to be the battle cry of West Side church people. Bishop Fallows presided over a mass-meeting of citizens at Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church yesterday afternoon which decided to adopt stringent measures by which it is believed advancement can be made in the movement already started to secure for the workingmen of Chicago one day of rest out of seven. The church was well filled and lively interest was manifested in all that was said and done.

Rev. Alfred H. Henry, pastor of the Leavitt Methodist Episcopal Church, introduced the boycotting idea. He said:—

Mythology tells us that Achilles' only vulnerable point was his heel. The vulnerable point of the merchant of to-day who opens his store on Sunday is not his head or his heart; it is his pocketbook.

I wish it could be agreed upon to patronize only those who close on the Sabbath.

As the result of the meeting, the following resolution was introduced and unanimously adopted:—

WHEREAS, It is contrary to the laws of Illinois and against the expressed wish of the people of Chicago, propagated through the churches and labor organizations through the agency of the daily press, for the clothing stores to open their doors on the Sabbath day; and

WHEREAS, The citizens of the West Side, in mass meeting assembled, on this Sunday, September 25, do earnestly protest against the continuance of this evil; therefore, be it

Resolved, That it be the sense of this meeting that we, the purchasing public of this, the West Side, do agree not to purchase any goods sold by any store that may keep open its doors on the Sabbath, and do further agree to exert our influence in every way practicable for the closing of stores on the Sabbath.

Thus is the word of the Lord being fulfilled, and thus are the friends of the Sunday Sabbath seeking to increase regard for the day by appealing, not to the head or to the heart, but to the lowest and most sordid of all motives—that root of all evil—the love of money.

W. A. COLCORD.
