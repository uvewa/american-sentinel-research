In commenting upon the Supreme Court decision, that this is a Christian Nation, a writer in the Protestant American, signing himself "Publius," says:—

As this is a direct union of Church and State, we may expect that out of it will grow an image of the Papacy, in fact it can only result in the selling of this country into the hands of Rome. As religion is a matter of the individual conscience and every person must decide for himself in matters of religion, it is therefore but a usurpation of individual rights. But as the right of petition belongs to the citizen, so also does the right of protest and appeal. And as this is a government of the people, and the people are above the Supreme Court, for the people made it; so we may take an appeal from the Supreme Court to the people. Let the people watch that thing, for there is mischief in it. It is mischief itself.

Then let every man appeal to his own manhood, to his own individual rights, and refuse to worship this image, or admit that this is the voice of the people. This decision means danger to every man, woman, and child in the land; therefore in the name and in the interests of the more than sixty millions of people, let us take an appeal, and so far maintain our rights; among which is the right to worship (or not to worship) according to the dictates of an individual, personal conscience, and not that of Supreme Courts or any other earthly power.

All of which is sound sense.
