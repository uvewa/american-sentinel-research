## Take Him at His Word.

IT will become politicians to be a little cautious lest they point their eyes before the church people, whose influence they wish to use, to forward their own political trick. Their first revival protestantism of religion furthest may prove a boomerang, and come back upon their own heads. When Bishop Doane put himself in an attitude before the late convention of Christian Endeavorers in New York, that they took his sanctimonious declarations at par, and it thought it would be good to ask him to make his practice square with his profession. So they drew up a resolution, asking him to resign from the Sunday issue of the New York *Advertiser.* At last reports, he was going sharply on that proposition, and the country is a-waiting with some interest to see how far he is willing to go to make good his profession.
