## Conservatism vs. Justice.

THE difficulty of securing a change in a law which affects only a small portion of those who vote on it in the United States, is well illustrated by the repeated failures of the Welsh dissenter to secure at the hands of the British Parliament, disestablishment in Wales. The law sustains that the Church of Wales is the church of the Welsh people; but the notorious fact is that three-fourths of the Welsh people are dissenters--principally Baptists and Wesleyans. The tables of the people of Welsh demands disestablishment, but English conservatism and indifference defeated the measure. It is stated, however, that Mr. Gladstone has invited an eminent Welsh nonconformist to prepare a bill for the disestablishment of the Welsh Church. It is conceded that this question will come to the front as soon as home rule is out of the way. Mr. Gladstone, in his letter to the late Mr. Morley, that his successor in the early acts carried on the programme in the leadership of the Liberal Party with problems of Sunday railroad trains, etc.; that of their fellow citizens there may be the Tennessee Sunday-keeper; it is only when pressed by Adventists who persistently quietly to his back fold, or when some who happened honestly be has last resorted to the seventh day plan his needle or baked for Sunday, that the dignity of Tennessee law is injured, and the offender of justice fly to rise their right to visit the boycott of the community.

Newspapers may publish and circulate, Sunday editions, politicians may carry on their campaigns, railroads may run as many trains as they wish, with goods of sections may work supplies, liquor and tobacco may be sold in almost total disregard of the law, and the ordinary citizen may find his way on Sunday without hindrance from the law; but a man who honestly believes that Saturday is the Sabbath established by his Creator from the first, the theology by resting on the seventh day and working on the first day of the week, is promptly indicted and punished by the courts.
