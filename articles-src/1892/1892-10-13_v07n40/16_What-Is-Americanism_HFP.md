The act of Congress in closing the World's Fair on Sunday, is denominated by the Philadelphia Protestant Standard as "A triumph of Americanism." With wonder it exclaims, "What a triumph for Americanism!" It does not, however, seem to be perfectly sure of success, for it says:—

Of course, a good deal yet remains to be done in order to carry out the wish of the House of Representatives. We do not say that this question is really decided. There are battles yet to be fought.

It will be a persistent fight up to the very hour that the Fair opens, and perhaps some time after. What we feel proud over is, that true American spirit and sentiment have defeated the continental idea. Americanism has scored a victory, for which let all patriots be thankful.

Now if one may judge from its name, Protestant Standard, this paper should be well posted in the principles of both Protestantism and Americanism. The Standard can see the deceitful trickery there is in the crafty designs of Rome to secure control of the schools through Bishop Ireland's plan. It commends the action of the recent Methodist Episcopal General Conference in that they "resolved that they would not receive any more money from Government for educational work," and adds:—

If the Sixteenth Amendment is to become a part of our Constitution, we think the different denominations ought to prepare the way by resolving, as our Methodist friends have done, to receive no money from the Government for the promotion of sectarian ends. If Rome is to be throttled and deprived of the power to do harm, the religious bodies must tell Uncle Sam that they will get along without his money.

If there is danger in Rome and her ways, why can not the Standard see the danger there is in Protestants going over the very road traveled by her in gaining her position of intolerance and oppression? If there is danger in the methods of Rome, why is there no danger when Protestants adopt the very same methods? or, do these methods become less harmful in the hands of others than when Rome uses them? If the use of the people's money for sectarian purposes, is un-American—and the Standard evidently thinks it is—why is it not also un-American for the "eleven millions [who] have protested against Sunday opening of the Exposition" to apply to Congress for aid in the furtherance of the desires of some of the sects combined, as against the wishes and protests of the more than fifty millions? If it is un-American for some of the sects to combine and secure aid from the civil power to enforce a dogma in which these may agree, upon some other religious sects who dissent therefrom, is it not quite as un-American for a faction of these sects to combine and foist by aid of civil power, a dogma of the Church upon the whole country? In reality it is but a faction of the religious element that are responsible for this piece of un-Americanism.

They only claim a little over eleven millions of petitioners, but some of these were counted, not once alone, but, if reports are true, twice and three times; yes, and even four times (such was their determination to accomplish their nefarious work), for they were counted as individuals, then as members of congregations, and then as members of conferences, and also as members of some order or league. Then many Sunday-schools and members of Christian Endeavor Societies signed these petitions because their leaders did.

So it is in fact but a faction of the religious element that are responsible for this unchristian, un-American act; and should cause patriots, not to rejoice, but to arouse in the strength of their manhood and denounce and oppose all such invasion of the rights of the people as un-American and unconstitutional.

But what is "true Americanism?" Has it not ever been that religion and all religious institutions, and the Government should be forever separate? Is it not that religion is found most in its purity when separate from governmental patronage? Is not true Americanism found in the principle that civil and religious liberty is offered and guaranteed to all, irrespective of color, position or creed? Is it not that "the proper object of government is to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their religious as well as civil rights, and not to determine for any whether they shall esteem one day above another, or esteem all days alike holy?"—Senate report 1829. Then why this act of the Fifty-second Congress in attempting to decide for the whole Nation, which day is, or shall be, a holy day? Why is it that they have listened to these demands of a religious faction? or why should they ever listen to the demands of even the majority and legislate upon religious questions? The facts are, that the whole thing is un-American, and a triumph of un-Americanism.

The Standard, while it can see the danger there is in Rome, the beast of Rev. 13:1-10, should seek for the eyesalve of Rev. 3:18, that it may also be able to see the danger in the making and worship of the image to the beast as spoken of in Rev. 13:14-18; 14:9, 10.

H. F. Phelps.
