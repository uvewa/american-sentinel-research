# The Abuse of Law.

SOME men have been so long accustomed to the power of law as it should be used--to protect the liberty of the people--is one of the hardest elements. They are not satisfied with this liberty to protect; they have their ideas thrust upon them; they must needs restrict the liberty of the people and seek to use the power of law to enforce their ideas upon all classes.

A striking illustration of this lie has recently come to view in Tennessee where some orthodox church members are becoming possessed by a minority sect because they refuse to conform their daily giving practices to suit the ideas of a majority. The press report by an eye witness is as follows:

> Having in jail since June 8, for the "crime" of working on the farm, plowing, hoeing, etc., on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and for which he was fined and costs, July 11 marched through the streets in convict garb, with chains around him; ... marched in with a lot of horse thieves and robbers, and a lot of other convicts ... set to work on the streets or famine on fifty five and another man at fifteen hundred per day.

"These men are among the best citizens in the community," says the writer, "and when arguing before the court, said:"--

> It is unfortunate that so many who are otherwise lawful citizens on every other point should lay to others the same freedom. These men who have recently been hauled to Manila to California were any attempt made to interfere with their freedom. ... That is, work and Sunday rest, and yet we see some of them making and enforcing laws against Sabbath-keepers which put them in jails and chain-gangs for carrying out the literal words of the Bible, which are as follows:

> Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work.

Some of our jails are now being used to punish quiet, peaceable, and industrious men for conscientiously obeying those words.

If in any State the Adventist, the Hebrew, or the free thinker who conscientiously observes one day instead of Sunday, should happen to poison cattle, destroy property, or rob his neighbor on Sunday, and any one should arrest him, try him and send them to the penitentiary for working on Sunday, could any sane man see in that prosecution the wrong against the liberty of the rights? ... No! the oppressor who makes this law the basis of his persecution is the tyrant of the minority, he is the type of those who burned the books of Luther and persecutes all who do not accept what is considered correct doctrine.

Such laws as these should be abolished and then the American people should have such a justice regard for their liberties that the baser sort of people ... and American jails were being used to crush religious liberty to the ground.
