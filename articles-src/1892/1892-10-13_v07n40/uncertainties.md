# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 40 (October 13, 1892)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The OCR quality was generally good, with clear text throughout most of the document.

## Specific Uncertainties

### Page 1, Column 1, Line 122
- **Transcribed as:** "Christ rebuke his disciples"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Note:** May be "rebuked" (past tense) rather than "rebuke" - OCR shows "rebuke" but context suggests past tense

### Page 3, Column 1, Article "Religious Liberty"
- **Transcribed as:** "workedt righteousness"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Note:** OCR shows "workedt" which is likely "worked" - appears to be OCR error with extra 't'

### Page 4, Address Footer
- **Transcribed as:** "PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY, 12TH &amp; CASTRO STREETS"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** HTML entity "&amp;" preserved as appears in OCR

### Page 7, Advertisement section
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple product listings and prices
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Note:** Complex table formatting simplified; prices and product names appear accurate

### Page 8, Subscription rates table
- **Transcribed as:** Multiple rows with varying rates
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Note:** Some numbers in the table may be inconsistent (e.g., row showing "100 to 50" appears illogical but matches OCR output)
