# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, October 13, 1892 (v07n40)

## General Notes

This issue presented significant OCR challenges due to scan quality. Multiple articles span across pages and columns, making text flow difficult to trace precisely.

## Article 04 - "Who Is Behind Protestantism, and Who First to be Obeyed?"
- **Page 3, left column:** This article attributed to "Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald" is embedded within editorial content. The exact boundaries of the EGW quote vs. surrounding editorial commentary are difficult to determine due to scan quality.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW - The scan quality on pages 2-3 makes precise character-level transcription very difficult. Many words had to be inferred from context.

## Article 05 - "What Is Americanism?"
- **Page 4, right column:** Several phrases were difficult to read due to scan quality. The final paragraph referencing "Rev. 13:14-18; 14:9, 10. F. F. PUZZLES" is unclear and may be misread.
- **Second pass completed:** Yes
- **Confidence:** LOW - Multiple phrases throughout this long article required contextual inference.

## Article 06 - "What a Confession!"
- **Page 5, left column:** The blockquote from the Examiner at the beginning was very difficult to read precisely.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 07 - "There Is Mischief in It"
- **Page 5, left column:** Generally clearer text. The quoted material from "Politus" was somewhat difficult.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 08 - "It Is in the Air"
- **Page 5, right column:** The quoted passage from the Albany Democrat-Journal was difficult to read in places.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 09 - "Sunday Observance in Tennessee"
- **Page 5, right column, continuing to page 8:** This article appears to have text split across pages 5 and 8. The quoted testimony material on page 8 was particularly difficult to read.
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

## Article 10 - "Take Him at His Word"
- **Page 6, left column top:** Short article, relatively clear.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 11 - "Conservatism vs. Justice"
- **Page 6, left column:** The article text was merged with what appears to be continuation text from another article about Tennessee Sunday enforcement. The boundary between articles is unclear.
- **Confidence:** LOW

## Article 12 - "National Religious Liberty Association"
- **Page 6, right column:** Multiple short news items. Some text was very difficult to read precisely.
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

## Article 13 - "Letter from W. E. Cornell" / "Letter from Charles Pelling"
- **Page 7, left column:** Two letters presented together. The boundaries between the Cornell letter and Pelling response are marked by signatures but some text is difficult to parse.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM

## Article 14 - "Editorial Notes"
- **Page 8:** Multiple short editorial notes. Some text was clearer than others. The Tennessee persecution material (Grand Jury testimony) was particularly difficult to read precisely.
- **Confidence:** LOW-MEDIUM

## Overall Assessment
This issue had notably poor scan quality compared to many other issues. A higher-resolution scan would significantly improve transcription accuracy for this issue. Many articles required substantial contextual inference, and the text flow across pages and columns was often ambiguous.
