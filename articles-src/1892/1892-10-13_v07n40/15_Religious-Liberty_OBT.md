WHILE the precious boon of liberty vouchsafed to us by the event which we as American people celebrate on this memorable birthday of our Nation, is not of a civil character alone, but of a religious type as well, it is in keeping with the strictest propriety that from every Christian heart there shall ascend to the great Giver of life and freedom a tribute of praise for the religious liberty enjoyed in this free land of ours. And while it is our province at this hour to dwell on the theme of freedom to worship "how or what we may," it will not be out of place for us to quote a little scripture wherein is written that "God hath made of one blood all nations for to dwell on the face of the earth."

This, coupled with another portion of the sacred word, saying that "God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feared him and workedt righteousness is accepted with him," will warrant the conclusion that the great Creator never designed that any man or set of men should dictate to their fellows their manner or object of worship. This thought is clearly set forth in the story given of the protection extended by the all-powerful Hand to the three Hebrew children whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, cast into the burning fiery furnace because they would not bow to the image which he had set up. This and like accounts, given in the Book of books, reveal the fact that religious intolerance began in the early history of the world.

SAY NOT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.

Shall I say religious intolerance? Nay, verily, for this expression reflects the thought that religion of any kind not restricted by its opposers is simply tolerated evil. The correct thought is that in all ages of religious persecution, the exercise of religious rights has been denied its adherents. This same interference with the God-given right of others was manifest in the days when Peter stood at the gate before the house where the followers of the lowly Nazarene were met in mighty prayer to Him who heard and made the prison doors to shake and the fetters to fall from him whom Herod had taken, seeing as he did, that he had pleased the people by putting to death James the Just. Nor had this rage abated when Saul of Tarsus haled men and women, committing them to prison, and with letters of authority from the chief priests and the scribes, bent his way to Damascus to carry out his foul designs against the people of God; who also in turn suffered at the hands of the enemies of truth and right, when God had turned the zeal of his mad career to his own glory. Nor does the Bible story of violence close till we have read of the beast which made war with the saints and overcame them; and of the souls under the altar who were slain for the testimony which they held.

When we turn our thoughts to the realm of profane history we meet scenes almost too horrid to be credited.

Since the declaration of our national independence and the conflict of arms which resulted in the triumph of freedom, both civil and religious, the courts have refused to sit in judgment on the consciences of men and women, or pronounce sentence on the faith of any person. None have been compelled by law to worship contrary to their honest convictions, nor punished for non-conformity to any prescribed form of religion.

This is not saying that none have at any time suffered at the hands of their enemies or been disturbed by the ruthless crowd. Some have even suffered violence at the hand of mobocracy while declaring the pure principles of pure Christianity and proclaiming the message of love, of good-will to men. And while yet this great evil may be abating, we can occasionally hear of foul threats and even worse, for no other offense than teaching Bible truth. While to-day we celebrate the birth-day of our national independence, and exult in the exercise of civil and religious liberty, there are under arrest in one of our noble States of the South a number of persons who hold the seventh day of the week to be the day still required by the great Law Giver to be kept holy rather than the first, and are now languishing in imprisonment for choosing to quietly pursue their daily vocation as farmers on the first day of the week after having conscientiously observed the seventh day of the week. And it has not been very long, only a few months, since a prisoner convicted at the same court died while his case was pending an appeal.

At the present time are pending issues which may terminate in such an amendment to the Constitution as to render the passage of an act enforcing Sunday observance constitutional; indeed some who have given the matter attention, take the position that Sunday laws are now constitutional, basing the statement on the recent decision of the Supreme Court that this is in verity a "Christian Nation."

Painful as it may be to devoted Christians to witness the utter disregard for the Lord's day exhibited by the masses of our people and by many, too, who profess Christ, it is to be hoped that neither the amendment nor the law will ever be secured; for it will be one step, and a long one, toward the union of Church and State, and if that ever returns, we may forever bid adieu to religious liberty. It can not be denied that while those now serving out their sentence as above cited are strict observers of the seventh-day Sabbath, at the same time those who care not for either day, but find their own pleasure on that day in all manner of sporting and gaming, to say nothing of secular labor done, go scot-free. These imprisonments are simply religious persecutions incited by some portion of the religious populace. I know what I am talking about, for I have heard with my own ears the statements made to those who were seventh-day observers that the law could and would take hold of them for Sunday work. More than this, it only remains, after an official declaration that the Christian religion is the religion of the Nation, for the powers that be to declare which of the many forms of religion in our land is Christian; and if by any means the already most powerful sect in our land is so declared, all the horrors of the past have only to be repeated.

It may not have come to the notice of all of you that the topic of union of Church and State is already under discussion in this boasted land of liberty. Only a few days ago in a town where I was passing through on my way to an appointment, the remark was made, "Union of Church and State is just what we want." Not long since two clergymen were sitting together engaged in conversation and a by-passer throwing his influence against the proposed amendment as it was under discussion, when one of these clergymen remarked, "This priest and I get along all right," remarking further that he saw no evil to come from it. Whereupon the third gentlemen remarked that if the amendment carried it only meant union of Church and State, and finally the Catholic Church in power. The Protestant clergyman expressed his surprise, but the other coolly replied, "That is just what it means. God deliver this land from the time when any one sect shall have legal power to enforce adherence to any set of religious principles."

It may be urged that this proposed amendment has for its object only to enforce the observance of Sunday as a rest or holy day, and that it ought to be so observed. No matter how much we might desire that the sacredness of the Lord's day be no longer trampled under foot, just as soon as its observance is enforced by law, just so soon will the consciences of large numbers be trammelled and their religious service dictated; and this is the fatal step toward the union of Church and State. The seventh day is just as sacred to those who believe it to be the Sabbath as is the first to us who constitute by far the greater portion of Christian people, and it would be only subservience to tyrannical power and not acceptable service to God, should they be compelled to observe a rest day that did not have for them the sacredness that should surround the Sabbath. And more, it is not at all likely that if the law existed the wholly irreligious would be punished for disregarding it. It will be only a religious persecution when it is done.

To-day when the world is enjoying the festivities of the occasion, and from the platform all over our fair land there is ascending feelings of gratitude for the wonderful liberty we enjoy, and a feeling of security comes to those who listen to the orations of power delivered, yet with all our boasted liberty there is lurking among us that which if allowed to continue will one day break forth in a storm that will sweep away every vestige of our freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience. It therefore stands every American citizen in hand to awake to a proper sense of his obligation to throw his influence on the side of the scale which will preserve the religious liberty which our fair land has so long enjoyed.
