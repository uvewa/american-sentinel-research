A GENTLEMAN in Nebraska writes thus to us declining to renew his subscription to THE SENTINEL:—

Lincoln, Neb., Sept. 19, 1892.

ESTOR AMERICAN SENTINEL—Dear Sir: Your card requesting a renewal of my subscription received. I am exceedingly sorry that I can not continue to subscribe for a paper that stands so manfully for freedom of conscience. But it seems to me that you are pulling down with one hand what you are seeking to build up with the other. If you would also oppose that religion whose principles are responsible for the state of affairs of which you complain, then you would be consistent. But so long as you support the Christian religion with its terrible doctrines and its debasing superstitions I can not conscientiously continue my patronage to your paper.

With hopes for the intellectual emancipation of the race from the bondage of ignorance and fear, I am very truly yours,

We are sorry that the writer of this letter does not distinguish between the Christianity of the Bible and the Christianity of the churches. True Christianity does not persecute. Christ rebuke his disciples when they asked him to call down fire to destroy those who refused to receive him. It is only as his professed followers lose his spirit and forget his teachings that they become intolerant.

Even Paine in his "Rights of Man," recognizes the fact that intolerance does not belong to Christianity, as Christ taught it. He says:—

All religions are, in their nature, mild and benign, and united with principles of morality. Now is it that they lose their native mildness, and become morose and intolerant? By engendering the State with the Church, a sort of mule animal, capable only of destroying, and not of breeding up, is produced, called the Church established by law. The Inquisition in Spain does not proceed from the religion originally professed, but from this mule animal engendered between the Church and State.

And again, of governments established by force, Paine says:—

Governments thus established last as long as the power to support them lasts; but that they might avail themselves of every engine in their favor, they united fraud to force, and set up an idol which they called divine right, and which, in imitation of the Pope who affects to be spiritual and temporal, and its contradiction to the Founder of the Christian religion, twisted itself afterward into an idol of another shape, called Church and State.

Paine, infidel though he was, knew full well, and was man enough to acknowledge it, that the doctrine of Church and State was not Christian doctrine in any proper sense of the word; and it would be well if his disciples of the present day had equal discernment. But how can we expect them to understand Christianity better than do so many who profess it? And yet it does seem that all ought to know that true Christianity never seeks to ally itself to the State, and never persecutes.

C. P. B.
