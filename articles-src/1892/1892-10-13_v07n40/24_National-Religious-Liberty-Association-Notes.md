The Woman Suffragists have passed resolutions in favor of the Sunday opening of the World's Fair.

Despite the congressional proviso for Sunday closing, the Exposition grounds have been regularly opened on Sundays to all comers, and are now. The average daily attendance of eight-seers, is now three thousand, but on Sunday the number sums up to fifteen thousand. But, notwithstanding this, the advocates of Sunday closing gather in mass-meeting in Chicago to give thanks that the World's Fair is closed on Sunday.

A meeting was held in the Chicago Auditorium, on the evening of October 7, to express approbation of the action of Congress in providing for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair. It is reported that about six thousand people were present, and much enthusiasm was manifested. Dr. Herrick Johnson presented resolutions, which closed with the words, "Satan has at last gone into the business of casting out Satan, and the devil is ready for suicide." The resolutions were adopted in the midst of great applause; the audience rising to its feet and giving three cheers. Elliott F. Shepard, Joseph Cook, and others, addressed the meeting.

The wife of the ex-priest Pere Hyacinthe, is in Chicago, and in an address delivered at the first Methodist Church, in that city, frankly advocated the Sunday opening of the World's Fair. Her utterances on the subject are reported to have been greeted with hearty applause from the large congregation present. This is one evidence of many that the church people themselves, whom their pastors and masters have striven so industriously to whip into line, are not entirely a unit yet, on this question, by any means.

The Weekly News-Item of Antigo, Wisconsin, publishes a series of resolutions adopted by the Congregationalists of that place, asking that the "mayor and city officials see that our Sabbath laws are properly enforced;" and says of the petitioners:

It looks to us as though they do not recognize a man's right of liberty of conscience, except in so far as the man chooses to do what they think is right. It is a spirit of intolerance. . . . We are living in the year of progress, liberal ideas, and education—1892—not in the age of witchcraft, superstition, intolerance—1692.

Yes, it has been supposed that we were living in an age of civil liberty in religious things, but the events of the last three years have proved the fallacy of that supposition.

MAYOR WASBRUNNE, of Chicago, says that "it would be an outrage to close the Fair on Sunday and would deprive a large number of the poorer classes of an opportunity to visit it. A good deal of the opposition to Sunday opening came from Chicago saloon keepers."

So the testimony accumulates that in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair the Chicago saloons and dives have really gained an end they had in view. But why does Mayor Wasbburne speak only of these superficial points? Why does he not have a word to say upon the real issue at stake? No interview on this question, from any public man, has yet been published touching the real merits of the case. Is it because they do not think it "wise statesmanship" to be known as intelligent and candid men in this matter?

ALL the Adventists in Tennessee are not in Henry County, but there are several hundred scattered over the State. So far the most of the persecution has been confined in two counties, but if the preachers of the dominant churches can have their way, there will be persecution soon wherever there are Adventists. Some of the facts upon which this opinion is based are stated in a letter from a young Adventist preacher laboring in Eastern Tennessee. This young minister says:—

"The time is not far distant when Seventh-day Adventist preaching will be held responsible for all the mining out-breaks and incivility committed in Tennessee, as is shown by the following instances.

"While preaching recently at Emory Gap the writer was told by a Baptist gentleman that just such was the cause of such out-breaks as Coal Creek, etc.; and in the course of the conversation he said that a man who can not obey the law of the land ought to be whipped.

"And still another, a Rev. (?) Mr. Webster told his audience in presence of the writer that the Adventists were anarchists and he could prove it. Continuing he said, 'They are circulating petitions to Congress to open the World's Fair and the saloons on Sunday.' And said he: 'There have been anarchists hung in this country, and—Well, you had better send and get Frank James to teach your children.'

"It seems that the reverend gentleman would rather have a highwayman in his community than a class of humble Christians, though their only crime is, they teach that God's law is a rule of life and requires absolute obedience to every commandment. And because they teach that people 'ought to obey God rather than man' in matters of religion. Especially regarding the fourth commandment was the gentleman wroth, and gave his audience the wonderful piece of information that 'the Sabbath was never made for a man in the world but for Jesus Christ.' Yet he wanted men hung for not keeping Sunday, though he knows that Sunday is purely an institution of the Catholic Church and derives its authority from that source; and when Protestants compel people to obey that day, it is only compelling them to be Catholics, and Roman Catholics at that.

"It sounds bad to hear Baptists talk of whipping and hanging people for their conscientious convictions; they ought to read the Constitution of their country, and the history of the Baptist Church; and perhaps these pious (?) gentlemen would remit the punishment from whipping and hanging to life imprisonment at hard labor."
