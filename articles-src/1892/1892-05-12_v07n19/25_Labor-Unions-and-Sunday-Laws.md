THE Christian Statesman takes the laboring men to task thus, in its issue of April 23:

In some places in this country, as well as abroad, there is some talk of having the labor demonstrations associated with May 1st on the Sabbath (which is May 1st of this year), instead of Monday. Let labor unions not thus insult and alienate those most in sympathy with them, the churches, by a violation of divine and civil Sabbath laws.

It has always been claimed heretofore by the American Sabbath Union and its kindred associations, that laboring men and the labor organizations were anxious for the strict enforcement of the Sunday laws, and indeed, had petitioned Congress to that effect. It is not likely that they have been sildden so soon, but this warning and exhortation is evidence, rather, that the claim, that the laboring men and their organizations sympathized with the movement to enforce Sunday laws, was false.

The truth about the indorsement of the labor organizations is partly given in the publication by Mr. Crafts of advanced sheets from the new edition of his "Sabbath for Man." He says: "The petitions for the spring not having represented labor organizations, at the suggestion of Senator Blair, the writer visited such organizations—the Central Labor Union, and Letter Carriers' Association of New York City, the International Conventions of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and the International Assembly of the Knights of Labor," etc., and, as he claims there, they all committed themselves fully to the Sunday-law movement. The other portion of the truth about the position of the labor organizations was told by Mr. Willard F. Hobbs to the Committee of the House on the District of Columbia, when he said, "There are over thirty unions of Knights of Labor and there has been only one petition sent here. They have remained silent on the subject, and I think they want to remain silent upon it."
