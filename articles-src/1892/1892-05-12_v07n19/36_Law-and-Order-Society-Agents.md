SEVERAL of the agents or "detectives" of the Pittsburg Law and Order League have been getting into trouble with the police of that city. One of these men accused of wife-beating jumped his bail and is now in parts unknown; another is awaiting trial upon a criminal charge; while another, a creature named Flynn, alias Magee, is in custody awaiting the result of a criminal operation performed upon a woman whom he calls his wife. Commenting editorially upon these facts, the Pittsburg Press, of April 27, says:—

The high moral standing of the men who work for the Law and Order society is being illustrated more and more impressively as time goes on. The third Law and Order agent was arrested yesterday and will have to answer a most serious charge. The indications are that Thomas Flynn, or McGee (for the gentleman has pursued the questionable course of wearing different names at different times and places), is as bad as, or worse than, his fellow-rascals who beat and deserted their wives, and deceived other women. Flynn, alias McGee—is charged with a crime that may yet resolve itself into murder.

Agent McClure is reported to have said that the society has nothing to do with the morals and character of its agents. This is a weak excuse that will not weigh at all with a true moral sentiment. The dirty private character of the agents, combined with the dirty work they do for an inconsistent, fanatical society, has excited the disgust of all decent people, and the work of the Law and Order society must be injured by it. The fact appears to be that decent men cannot be induced to do the indecent work required by a Law and Order conspiracy, for boodle.

The fact is that the so-called agents or detectives of the Law and Order society are only disreputable spies with neither morals nor reputation to sustain, and so, utterly reckless and irresponsible. A law and order crusade managed by such men is worse, if anything, than White Cap outrages, because in this case the outrages are perpetrated under color of law.
