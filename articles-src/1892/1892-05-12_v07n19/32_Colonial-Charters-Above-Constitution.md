THE ARTICLE ON ANOTHER PAGE, "THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION BY COLONIAL GRANT and CHARTER," shows that the European sovereigns who claimed this country by right of discovery did seek to extend to this Continent the Church and State regime of the Dark Ages. And that for a time they were measurably successful is a matter of history. But that these charters were like the laws of the Medes and the Persians—forever unalterable—has not, until recently, been generally understood. Until the recent decision by the Supreme Court that this is a Christian Nation, because of these charters, etc., it was very generally supposed that the First Amendment to the Constitution terminated once and forever any influence that colonial laws, with a Church and State caste of countenance, might have previously had; but in the light of the wisdom (?) which now shines from the Supreme bench of the Nation, the old colonial charters are seen to be above the Constitution! Hence the importance of becoming familiar with those musty documents.
