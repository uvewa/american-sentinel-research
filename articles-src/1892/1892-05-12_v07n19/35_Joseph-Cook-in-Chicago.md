JOSEPH COOK is carrying the Sunday-closing war right into Chicago, the stronghold of the enemy. April 24 "he spoke at the Union Park Congregational Church, declaring that the Chicago that put down anarchy should not allow the Nation's Sabbath to be trampled upon, and that Sunday opening of the Exposition would double murders, make the saloons tyrants, and create anarchy and crime." Mr. Cook has a lively imagination; but it is not unlikely that his predictions of evil will be put to the test of experience. The indications are that the Fair will not be closed on Sunday, at least not entirely.
