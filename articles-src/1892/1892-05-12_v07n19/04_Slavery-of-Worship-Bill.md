THE Mail and Express says:—

Governor Flower has signed the Slavery of Worship bill. For the second time in recent years, by the hand of a Democratic governor, the Church and the State have been linked together through sectarian legislation. . . . The House of Refuge in this city proposes to fight the Slavery of Worship bill, signed by Governor Flower, and test its legality in the courts. This is right. Bring it home to the people that the purpose of the measure is to link Church and State and to turn the public institutions over to sectarian influences. Let the people know the truth, and they will see to it that a Legislature is elected and a governor, too, that will wipe the odious legislation from the statute books.
