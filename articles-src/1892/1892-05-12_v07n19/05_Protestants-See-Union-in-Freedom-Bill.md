It is very remarkable that Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and, in fact, nearly all Protestant religionists, can see in this bill a union of "religion and politics," or as the Mail and Express puts it, "a union of Church and State," and can not see the same thing in some of the legislation for which they are all clamoring. This bill simply places all denominations on an equality before the law, giving all equal privileges; but there are laws upon the statute books of most of our States that do more than this; they give to certain forms of religion and their adherents, decided advantage over others.
