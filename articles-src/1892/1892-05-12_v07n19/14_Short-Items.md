MR. WILBUR F. HOBBS to the Committee of the House on the District of Columbia, where he said: "There are only about four nights of Nightfall Labor and their has been only one periodic here went they have remained silent on the subject, and I think they want to remain silent upon it.

JUDGE HAYCRAFT has sentenced two saloon keepers to serve by the jury proclamation for fines noticed for Sunday liquor selling. In the course of his remarks while sentencing the men the Judge said:—

The Court has a right to ask you, to demand, the Legislature in its wisdom, to perform your their duty in this matter. That the Prosecutor of this county, and the Grand Jury of this county, shall, take at once such steps in this country to ask and require the to see that these violations herein. That this Court has the right, under the specific power conferred upon the Legislatures, to command their prosecution, is beyond dispute. The supreme public order authority of the whole county, and the strict authority of these people to uphold the laws conferred upon them by law. The attention of the Grand Jury is called to the fact that, under the heading of misdemeanor, in the subject of sale of liquor, variety shows are given on Sunday throughout the county.

The liquor traffic should be suppressed entirely. The use of the Sunday law against it is only a more crime against humanity than that of the saloon keepers themselves, for while the Sunday law is stand, it legitimatizes their business and puts it on the same legal footing with all other business occupations for the rest of the week, while acts upon equally demoralizing drunkenness and its attendant evils.

AT the United Freethinking Presbyteries meeting in Pittsburg, on April 13, resolutions were adopted showing on their part, a feeling of desperation in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and dealing in language of resolution and their demands toward the Columbian Commission. These were the resolutions:—

WHEREAS, The Columbian Commission, as we are informed, has made up its mind to submit this case to the very eye of the Fair, with the official recognition of its powers by the Columbian Commission, of making it impossible, as built up by the Commission of all in respect to the closing on Sunday it was supposed by its adoption by withdrawing from the Exhibition; therefore, be it—

*Resolved*, against "No attempt to describe by delay one side only the facts;" but that this Presbyterial body, meeting against the shame of jobs and passed away, the convention and assembly of the General Assembly, and further invite the civil and religious bodies that make up the general structure of Protestantism in this portion of this postponement, and its immediate and complete removal; and further

*Resolved*, That we propose the ultimate of this, we urge the Christian, law abiding citizens of this country, shall not sign a petition in case of an adverse decision in the form of a cowardly surrender of the rights and institutions as built which, under a management lacking moral courage, and upon a purely religious question that we suppose a complete withdrawal of all religious dissipation; and

*Resolved*, That we urge upon general assemblies and synods, and conventions in their judgment upon all religious conventions, all Christian exhibitions and associations, all religious organizations refuse to proceed with any proposed building or exhibiting at the World's Fair until after the United States Congress, and that all friends of the United States, everywhere, are to present resolutions to their acceptance, that the decision of the fair be made as permanent as. In the name of God, and in harmony with American institutions.

*Resolved*, That the sentiments embraced by this Commission, we hereby petition Congress, to decide this matter seriously by conductionary and further grant of public money to the Fair

the entire closing of the Exhibition every Sunday.

*Resolved*, That we ask all preachers' meetings and religious or professional associations and societies that are opposed to Sunday work and Fair day distribution to join us at once in these proceedings.

To characterize this language as restrained, is really dealing with its modesty. It is insolent and disheartening to the business management of the Fair. From a business and legal point of view it is unjust in a question as to whether it did not amount to coercion. No better evidence of the spirit which animated this movement is needed than the witness carries.
