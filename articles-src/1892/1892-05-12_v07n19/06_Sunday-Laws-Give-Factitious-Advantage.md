SUNDAY laws are of this character. Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, himself an intense partisan of Sunday and of Sunday laws, said, as most of our readers remember, that "by a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom." Yet many who see in the Freedom of Worship bill a union of Church and State, can see no impropriety whatever in Sunday legislation. Surely this is passing strange!
