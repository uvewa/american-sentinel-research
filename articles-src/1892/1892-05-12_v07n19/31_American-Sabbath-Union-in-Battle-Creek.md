THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION HAS EFFECTED AN ORGANIZATION IN BATTLE-CREEK, MICH., THE STRONGHOLD OF THE SEVENTH-DAY Adventists, and interesting times may be expected. The Adventists have in Battle Creek, a large publishing house employing over three hundred hands, a college, and one of the largest sanitariums in the world. The mayor of the city only a few years ago was an Adventist, but as a general thing they take very little part in political contests.
