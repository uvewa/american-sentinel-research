QUITE a strong effort has been made recently in Santa Rosa, Cal., to create sentiment in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The plan was to make a great demonstration, that would produce overpowering convictions in the community generally, and especially in the minds of a member of Congress and also of a World's Fair Commissioner, who reside in that city. Announcements were made in the papers that a minister of one of the churches would preach on the subject on Sunday. This he did; and at the close of the meeting he invited everybody to attend a general mass meeting on the following Tuesday to organize the effort. He made great promises of the demonstration that would be seen by the vast number of people that would be there, and said that they wanted to make such an impression as would show the strong sentiment of the country in favor of Sunday closing.

At the great mass meeting on the following Tuesday, about fifty persons were present. The chairman announced that their main speakers were absent, but called upon a brother minister to make a few remarks. In his talk he said that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that it is the original seventh day, and undertook to prove it conclusively. The hearers present seemed to be very much delighted with his arguments.

Just as he was concluding his remarks, and was about to take his seat, another minister came in, and was urged to come forward, and say something upon the Sunday closing question. He said he was not on the programme, and was not feeling at all well, but that he wanted to make use of every opportunity to speak in a good cause. The substance of his remarks was that there is no Sabbath in the Christian dispensation, and that there never was but one, and that was the seventh day, or Saturday, and that is the only day that can be called the Sabbath. "We simply keep the first day of the week in commemoration of the resurrection, and it is improper to call it the Sabbath day."

What a pity that these men could not have had an understanding, and not thus have devoured each other and their cause, by their own contradictory arguments; and they certainly should not feel hurt if persons looking on should not become all taken up with a subject, the advocates of which, cannot agree among themselves, and each, in presenting his arguments, overthrows the arguments of others who are interested in the same cause. The writer has heard speakers on this Sunday law question use arguments in a single speech that were quite as contradictory as the positions taken by these California gentlemen. Yet they go on with these so-called arguments, and advocating these so-called reforms, and seem to feel hurt if the people do not at once fall in with their ideas.

The minister who spoke on the previous Sunday, and also called the meeting at Santa Rosa, was asked to speak, but declined, saying that he had said all he had to say two days before; but that he felt chagrined that in that city of five or six thousand inhabitants, with ten or twelve churches, and from twelve to thirteen hundred church members, they could get but fifty people out to such a meeting. He said: "I hope that our Congressman, and World's Fair Commissioner, who reside here, will not learn anything about this meeting."

When Christian ministers, and the Christian people of this country learn that their power for good does not lie in securing laws for Sunday observance, or for any other tenet of the faith, it will prove a great benefit to the cause they are laboring to advance. God has told us that "it is not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord" that his work is to be done. Nothing is plainer in the teachings of Christ and the apostles than that Christianity is to be carried forward purely by persuasion, presenting the love of God to draw men, and never, in any instance, are individuals to be forced by civil law, to observe any tenet of religious faith. We trust that the understanding of many of these good people may be so enlightened that they will learn to turn away from the civil power entirely in their efforts to advance the cause of Christ, and trust solely in his almighty power.
