# Another Sunday Bill in Congress.

The process of grinding down the wedge of recognition of the propriety of Sunday legislation by Congress, and its committal to a course of religious legislation, still goes on. This time a very thin edge has been attained. The tenants of the city of Washington, either of their own motion or invited by those who are anxious for the passage of more stringent Sunday laws for the District of Columbia—because that will "commit Congress to a recognition of the need and authority of Congress"—as a meeting was held in which it was proposed to enlist the sentiments of the churches in the stoppage and a circular was sent out asking church support; and on Sunday evening, April 17, a special service in behalf of leisure was held in the Central Presbyterian Church, the pastor of which has been "to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday," endeavor now to have "the Sunday closing bill for the District of Columbia." At this service a score of representative ministers and laymen were present, the body of the church being filled with an attentive audience. "At the Baptist ministers' conference was an especially appealed to the subject, and why the sermon should have particularly suited for the consideration of Congress more than any others, is difficult to see, unless they were using under the advice of counsel who had told them that the Baptists were opposed to legislation upon religious matters, and who hoped through their influence to get the Baptist ministers committed to getting up this petition for the passage of Sunday laws for the District. This much was accomplished. It was provided, for the Baptist ministers conference, that all the proceedings in this matter, up to this point, as far as they had been made public, were such as would admit of their nation of being simply preparatory to asking the Baptists as a denomination to enter into a mutual agreement as to the non-delivery of ice on Sunday to all establishments or residences to which no remaining person could bring any honest objection; if they choose to abstain from receiving their ice among themselves of their chooser. But all this is too transparent. The real object, and that to which it was a prelude appears from the following from the *Post* of April 29, where, in the proceedings of the Senate for the day before, it is recorded under the title,—

"Joint resolution," Mr. McMillan (by request) introduced a resolution to limit the hours of delivery in the District of Columbia in the House record for the same day is this, under the head, "Petitions," by Mr. Hemphill: Petition of drivers and employees of private express companies, of the District of Columbia, asking the prohibition of the delivery of "Sunday" whatever, by any of the said express companies in the District of Columbia.

The proprietors of ice houses in the District also have had upon them for the past two years the enormous license tax of from twenty-five to fifty dollars, and it requires a pretty good business, either to ice dealers and their employers and saloon or supply stations. By ruling of an ice dealer and barkeepers are not allowed the same footing in the District of Columbia, and his and now with perfect sincerity main probable on Sunday. No provision whatever has yet been made. Some parties say the drug stores to go into the ice business on Sunday for the one of the ice, and so that is the legitimate outcome of all of this Sunday whiskey.

This present move will succeed in the House. It will go before Congress as the sentiments of the people of the District, the ingenuity of the District. It remains to be seen to what extent these men have been persuaded that they are not their own masters, and if they really are in support of such a belief, to whom they owe it.
