THE object of the Freedom of Worship bill is to secure the admission of Catholic priests to certain institutions receiving money from the State, but under Protestant control. To this end the bill provides that in case of a violation of any of the provisions of the act—

Any person aggrieved thereby may institute proceedings in the Supreme Court in the district where the institution is situated, which is hereby authorized and empowered to enforce the provisions of this act.
