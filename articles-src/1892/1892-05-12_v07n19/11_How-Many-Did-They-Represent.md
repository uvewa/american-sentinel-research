How Many Did They Represent?

AN item from an Indiana paper says: The Internal Committee of the House of Representatives at Washington, it is stated that he and his associates in this shaped that he and his associates in this have were to present petitions signed by congressional legislation for closing the sections of the entire religious establishment of this country, and placed his number at 6,000,000. He claimed to represent the Sabbath observance sentiment of this country. Now I should not care to say that Mr. Crafts lied. Perhaps I ought not to say that, but I am sure that the facts do not support him, for when looked at it there is a very great difference between the belief that the Fair should be closed on Sunday, and that it ought to be closed by an act of Congress. He who still thinks it his an act Congress would have Puritans close in line the States enforce under religious sentiments, there are a great many many who have great care and concern on this.
