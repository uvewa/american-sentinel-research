# Uncertainties Log - v07n19 (1892-05-12)

## OCR Quality Notes

The OCR quality for this issue was generally good. A few minor uncertainties:

1. **Page 1, masthead**: Address shows "No. 45 Boro St." - likely should be "Bond St." based on other issues. Transcribed as "43 Bond St." per standard masthead.

2. **Page 4, Article "Showing Their Colors"**: The word "ATTERIANCE" appears in the quoted text from Mrs. Bateham - this is likely meant to be "ATTENDANCE" but has been preserved as it appears in the scan.

3. **Page 6, Article by Dr. Millard**: The word "anduciously" appears - likely should be "audaciously" but preserved as scanned.

4. **Page 6, Article by Dr. Millard**: The phrase "law-uzholding" appears - likely should be "law-upholding" but preserved as scanned.

5. **Page 7, bottom**: Subscription pricing table was partially cut off/illegible in the scan - omitted from transcription as it appears to be standard boilerplate.
