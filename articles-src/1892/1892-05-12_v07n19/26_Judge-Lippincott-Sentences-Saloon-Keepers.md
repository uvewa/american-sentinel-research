JUDGE LIPPINCOTT has sentenced two saloon keepers of Jersey City to the penitentiary for three months for Sunday liquor selling. In the course of his remarks while sentencing the men the Judge said:—

The Court has a right to ask, yes, to demand, that the officers sworn to execute the laws shall do their duty in this matter. That the Prosecutor of the Pleas, with all the power of the State behind him, shall take at once such steps in this county as shall end at once this unlawful and demoralizing traffic on Sunday, and in this performance of duty, this Court has the right, under the specific power conferred upon us by statute, to demand that the chief executives of the cities in this county, and the police authorities of the whole county, and the Grand Jury, aid to the full extent of the power conferred upon them by law. The attention of these same officials must also be called to places in Jersey City Heights, where, in connection with the sale of liquor, variety shows are given on Sunday contrary to law.

The liquor traffic should be suppressed entirely. The use of the Sunday law against it is a greater crime against humanity than that of the saloon keepers themselves, for, while the Sunday laws stand, it legitimates their business and puts it on the same legal footing with all other business occupations for the rest of the week, while not appreciably diminishing drunkenness and its attendant evils.
