REV. NELSON MILLARD, of the First Presbyterian Church of Rochester, is reported by the *Advertiser* of that city, as saying in a recent sermon:—

"The question I propose to-day is 'Ought the State to regard itself as a religious institution?' It needs no words in any proper function in propagating distinction of religious or of Presbyterians or of any other sect. I take it that the State has no right to regard itself as an agency for furthering religious ideas. In saying this I am saying what I want to be understood as undertaking, to give the evidence of. All citizens are not religious. On the contrary I take the liberty of saying that the majority of our citizens are not religious. I wish religion were universally disseminated. But I do not think that the State is either the rightful, or can be the efficient agency in bringing about that object. All Christians want religion spread on all sides, but men may honestly differ as to the proper agencies for doing that work.

"When we came here to Rochester we were told at the pastors' union that it was agreed and agreed that the city needs an evangelistic work. It was said that we were proposed to commit the work of evangelization of this city of Rochester to the hack drivers and the barbers of this city, would you say that was absurd? And the agency proposed by rightfully constituted authority to do the work of evangelization?

"I object, not to the diffusion of religious instruction; but to making religion a State concern thereof, believing that it is the proper work of those divinely instituted agencies, the Church and the ministry. I maintain that the State has no proper or natural or efficient agency bearing a whole relationship to any and all religions and their promulgation either for their promotion and their mutual and impartial protection. Religion lies outside the province of the State. Human governments, being of men and by men, are restricted in the exercise of their authority to the relations that exist between man and man in this world. Religion, as distinct from morality, has to do with the relation between man and God. When, therefore, the Government undertakes to assume jurisdiction in religion they usurp the divine prerogative, overstep bounds and officiously attempt to exalt the scepter from its divine sovereignty. No human government arrogates to itself jurisdiction in religion, unless it can allege an independent charter and commission direct from the King of Kings, in which its particular people are, and I trust always will be, predominatingly Christian. But the Government is neither Christian nor antichristian; their neither religious nor anti-religious, but merely a secular institution established to care for the relations between man and man, but not to interfere in those between man and God.

"Constantine's Christianity was of such a nature that he could preside over the first general Council of the Catholic Church at Nice, A.D. 325, and in 326, the year following, have his eldest son, Crispus, put to death because he feared his popularity with the soldiers, Crispus being greatly beloved by them, also his nephew, the son of his favorite sister, whose man was his only crimes, and for whom his wife also plead. History relates that in the year his wife was 'suffocated in a bath which had been heated to an extraordinary degree of temperature.' Upon his death he gave to the bishop of Nicomedia his will to give to his eldest surviving son. It was of such terrible import the bishop would not give it to him, but placed it in the dead hand of Constantine. It directed his son to kill his (Constantine's) brothers and their children, as he suspected them of having poisoned him.

"It was done, of them being massacred.

"And this pretended Christian, this author of the first Sunday law in Christendom, was the author of the Sunday observance legislation, and for which they are still contending, and for which they will labor to its degree the fullest liberty. Persecution has not rested. The man who deprived the Christians of their liberty was deprived by God Almighty, and until the time of Moses, Lord's day of the Lord of which God said, 'Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt do no work,'—this man, whose cruelty, whose ambition, whose deep villainy, is still distilling to the free man of to-day. The Sabbath is observed by only three in this world,—the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and the Seventh-day Adventists.

"The above is the true origin of the observance of Sunday, instead of the seventh day. It was adopted, not as some have supposed, because Christ rose from the dead on that day. But the religious confusion still continued to arise. Rabboni Sabbath until forced against all his endeavors. And yet there appears in this first Sunday law, made by the 'first Christian emperor,' who embodied its real character in a most emphatic manner.

"It would be well for the ministers and the people to pause and reflect a little before they follow this custom, which is so often proven disastrous to liberty, of combining civil rights with both have State affairs and business matters? Precedents are most dangerous things."—*[N.Y.] Journal.*
