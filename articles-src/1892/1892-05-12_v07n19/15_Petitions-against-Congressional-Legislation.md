Petitions against Congressional Legislation.

ON May 1 petitions were presented in the House of Representatives, praying Congress not to enact the United States Government to an establishment of religion and the State by the passage of any legislation closing the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way commanding the Government to a recovery of religious legislation.

Petitions were presented from citizens of Illinois, Iowa, Galion, Ohio, Oregon, Virginias, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other places, from Booneration, Ill., Mercer County, Ill., Ogdensburg, N. Y., Moline, Ill., Vineland, N. J., Pottstown, County, Ark., Florence, Colo., New Hampshire County, Conn., Wis., Franklin County, Ohio, Huntington County, N. Y., Oswego County, N. Y., Hackensack, Colo., Lake County, Colo., Grand Detour, N. Y., Dixon County, Ill., other counties and Dakota County, Mich., Mora County, Ohio, Ingham County, Ala., Isabella County, Mich., Gratiot County, Colo., Arapahoe County, Colo., Baltimore Co., Md., Langlade, Wis., Buffalo, N. Y., New Castle County, Del., and Cattaraugus County as many places.

Not stated in the *Congressional Record*, from what individuals these petitions came, or were offered simply as from citizens, others from organizations, and others still from towns.

This and a continuation of this, should be good and sufficient evidence to the World's Fair Commission of the Senate of Illinois to which the petitions are referred, that their constituents are awakening to the fact that the advocating of a union of religion and the State, are striving to and then into, decrease legislative grafts, in the legislation session. Precedent makes it both compelling!

On the same day, in the Senate, Mr. Vest, of Missouri, presented the following:—

The committee for Sunday observance from the Evangelical Frankfort Lutheran Church, of St. Louis, Missouri, at its monthly conference, prepared a communication to be sent to Congress concerning the Sabbath. I want to call attention to this petition. It is addressed to all the members of Congress, printed and addressed, originating to the mission and the committee on Sabbath observance of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. The title of the petition is addressed to "Hon. F. M. Cockrell and Hon. G. C. Vest, St. Louis, Missouri."

*Resolved*, That we do hereby pledge ourselves members of the "Committee on Sabbath Observance" of the Evangelical Frankfort Lutheran Church, Senator or president of trust, any member of Congress, either Senator or Representative who may and shall be further off of any kind to the World's Fair, except petition to Congress to consider their further constitutional, religious or Sabbath, that our vote may be our vote upon the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday.

attention to this class of resolutions. I do not here discuss their merits; but their propositions are responsible, for they are very responsible people of a community of people who would not interfere without evidence. If this has attended this, the city of Washington should look at this and the sentiments of the people. If that kind of practice had not been done by the people, they would not place it under the pain and penalty of being put out of a nomination, or possibly defeated at the polls. It is time to realize that these people meant exactly what they said. I did not endorse or justify politicians for what they do; but I will tell you the political aspect of concern, I do not care much about falling.

The political band of the "Pittsburg Presbytery" says: "whose resolution members on this Columbian celebration is to be seen in this Columbian year celebration."
