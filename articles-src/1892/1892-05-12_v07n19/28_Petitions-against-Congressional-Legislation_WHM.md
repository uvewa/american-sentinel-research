On May 2, petitions were presented in the House of Representatives, praying Congress not to commit the United States Government to a union of religion and the State by the passage of any legislation closing the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation, from citizens of Louisiana; Corpus Christi, Texas; Gilman, Iowa; Galion, Ohio; Oregon; Virginia; Denver, Colo.; St. Clair, Mich.; and in the Senate from Bloomington, Ill.; Mercer County, Ill.; Ogle County, Ill.; Worcester, Vt.; Waitsfield, Vt.; Fulton County, Ark.; Florence, Colo.; New Hampshire; Green County, Wis.; Franklin County, N.Y.; Warren County, N. Y.; Oswego County, N. Y.; Hutchinson County, S. Dak.; Logan County, Ohio; Dakota County, Neb.; Mesa County, Colo; Hot Spring County, Ark.; Deer Trail, Colo.; Saguache County, Colo.; Arapahoe County, Colo.; Bates County, Mo.; Lehigh, Mo.; Butler, Mo.; Montgomery Center, Vt.; and Cattaraugus County, N. Y.

The number of individual petitioners represented is not stated in the Congressional Record, from which this is taken. Some of the petitions are offered simply as from citizens, others from organizations. Three different religious denominations are represented.

This, and a continuation of this, should be good and sufficient evidence to the World's Fair Committees of the Senate and House, to which the petitions are referred, that their constituents are awakening to the fact that the advocates of a union of religion and the State, are striving to lead them into devious legislative paths, in the legislation they are asking with reference to the World's Fair.

On the same day, in the Senate, Mr. Vest, of Missouri, in presenting a petition in favor of Sunday closing of the World's Fair, said:—

I present a petition of the St. Mark's English Evangelical Lutheran Church, of St. Louis, Mo., praying for legislation by Congress prohibiting the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition on the Sabbath. I want to call attention to this petition. It seems to have been a machine petition, printed and addressed originally to the senators from Ohio, "Hon. John Sherman and Hon. Calvin Brice." Those names are scratched out now, and the petition is addressed to "Hon. F. M. Cockrell and George G. Vest," from Missouri, and contains this remarkable resolution:—

"Resolved, That we do hereby pledge ourselves, and each other, that we will, from this time henceforth, refuse to vote for, or support for any office or position of trust, any member of Congress, either senator or representative, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind to the World's Fair, except it be on the conditions named in these resolutions."

I merely want to say as a senator, that whatever may be my vote upon the question of closing the Exposition on Sunday, I shall certainly pay no attention to this class of resolutions. I do not hold the people who sent the petitions to me entirely responsible, for they are very respectable people of that congregation and have signed this petition without scrutiny. It has obviously been prepared in the city of Washington, and sent out from this place as a sort of political blackmail on the representatives of the people. If that kind of practice is to continue, and if, when I believe a bill or joint resolution not constitutional, I am still to vote for it under the pain and penalty of being put out of public life, so far as I am concerned I do not want to hold office if I am to hold it under any such condition. If I can not exercise my judgment as a representative, as a senator of the people, without that sort of coercion, I do not care about holding office at all.

The fine political hand of the "Pittsburg preachers," whose resolutions THE SENTINEL publishes in another column is to be seen in this political blackmail.
