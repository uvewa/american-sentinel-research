HAD every American citizen understood the history of his country as he should have done, we need never have had the war between the States—that most terrible of all wars.

Did every American citizen understand (as he should do) the danger of any enactment in regard to any religion or religious observance whatever, the union of Church and State, that worst of all despotisms, would never take place in this free country.

There is an old proverb, "It is the first step that costs," and Americans are taking the first steps now.

In the World's Fair bill offered by Judge Lindsay is a paragraph proposing to close the Kentucky exhibit on Sunday, and he "incorporated it, simply because the preachers of the State sent me word unless it was done they would use their utmost endeavors to defeat the bill."

That religion which can be enforced is simply hypocrisy. That religion which needs to be enforced is no religion at all.

That State which controls the consciences of its people is a tyrant. Any people who will make laws to limit or control in any way the individual liberties of any of her citizens as regards matters of religious belief is forging the chain which will bind that people sooner or later in bonds that cannot be broken. Whenever the precedent is established that religious restrictions may be made, then that church which, as Napoleon said, "has the longest purse and the heaviest battalions," will force all the other churches to observe the religious observances and to pay respect to the mode of worship it may choose to employ.

It is amazing that the American people do not see this danger. Are they so weary of liberty that they must needs cast it aside of purpose?

A great many Christians sincerely believe they are honoring God in keeping Sunday as their holy day. A little reading of Church history would show them instead, that they are honoring the edict of a man who was the arch-hypocrite of all the ages, Constantine the Great, who deprived Christians of their true Sabbath, and forced upon them the day of worship of the pagans.

Constantine was ready to profess any religion that would further his ambition. So, after professing Christianity, in order to propitiate his pagan subjects, he issued an edict requiring the religious observance of the "Sun's day"—the day devoted by the pagans to the worship of the sun. The ceremonies of this worship as related by historians were most horrible, especially as regarded women. The sun, which was worshipped under many names—Apollo, Bacchus, and many others, was regarded by the sun-worshipers as the author of all being—and the principle of procreation became a divine thing in their estimation. And their women were sacrificed in a more cruel manner than were the victims on the bloody altars of the Druids.

Constantine's Christianity was of such a nature that he could preside over the first general Council of the Catholic Church at Nice, A. D. 325, and in 326, the year following, have his eldest son, Crispus, put to death because he feared his popularity with the soldiers, Crispus being greatly beloved by them, also his nephew, the son of his favorite sister, whose rank was his only crime, and for whom his mother wept and plead in vain. The next year his wife was "suffocated in a bath which had been heated to an insupportable degree of temperature." Upon his death he gave to the bishop of Nicomedia his will to give to his eldest surviving son. It was of such terrible import the bishop would not give it to him, but placed it in the dead hand of Constantine. It directed his son to kill his (Constantine's) brothers and their children, as he suspected them of having poisoned him.

It was done, six of them being massacred and only two escaping.

And this pretended Christian, this selfish murderer, this ambitious hypocrite, was the author of the Sunday observance for which the Christian world is now contending, and for which they are willing to destroy the fairest fabric Freedom has yet reared. This man who deprived the Christians of their Sabbath given them by God Almighty, amid the thunders of Mount Sinai, of that day of which God said, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt do no work,"—this man, whose cruelty was only equalled by his hypocrisy, is still dictating to the free men of America and requiring them to observe the sun's day. The Sabbath is observed by only three sects in America, perhaps in the world—the Jews, the Seventh-day Baptists, and the Seventh-day Adventists.

The above is the true origin of the observance of Sunday, instead of the seventh day. It was adopted, not as some have supposed, because Christ arose on that day, for his followers continued to observe the Biblical Sabbath until forced to resign it, but simply in accordance with the law, made by the "first Christian emperor," who united Church and State in a most emphatic manner.

Would it not be well for the ministers and the people to pause and reflect a little before they follow the example, which has so often proven disastrous to liberty, of mixing up religion with laws and State affairs and business matters? Precedents are most dangerous things.
