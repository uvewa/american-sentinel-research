# The Freedom of Worship Bill.

The Freedom of Worship bill, now in this State, provides that no institution, supported in whole or in part, by appropriations by the State, shall refuse to permit the private or ministrations of any denomination to hold services in its institutions for the benefit of such inmates as may desire the services of that particular denomination.

The object of the Freedom of Worship bill is to secure the admission of Catholic priests to certain institutions receiving support from the State, but under Protestant control. To this end the bill provides that in case of a violation of any of the provisions of the act—

> No person aggrieved thereby may institute proceedings in the Supreme Court in the district in which is situated the institution in which is asserted, and the court is authorized and empowered to enforce the provisions of the act.

COMMENTING UPON THIS provision, the *Examiner* says:—

> This appeal is allowed to convictions one of the chief objections to the bill. The secret appears to be intended to place under its jurisdiction certain institutions. It is an extraordinary precedent in legislation to allow questions of this kind to be settled by a court of equity, to join together things which God always has to keep separate, that is to say, church and State, to inject them in a very un-American manner religion and the courts.

*Mail and Express* says:—

> Governor Flower has signed the Slavery of Worship bill. Under this new measure, by the hand of a Democratic governor, the Church and the State have been linked together through certain legislation. The House of Refuge in this city already enjoys her privileges of worship. The bill, signed by Governor Flower, and test its legality in the courts. This is right. Bring it home to the people what a terrible thing it means to unite Church and State and to turn the public institutions over to sectarian influences. Let the people know the truth, and they will see to it that a Legislature is elected as a general one, that will wipe the obnoxious legislation from the statute books.

It is very remarkable that Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and, in fact, nearly all Protestant denominations, can see in this bill a union of "religion and politics," or as the *Mail and Express* puts it, "a union of Church and State," and can look on the same thing in some of the legislation for which they are all clamoring.

This bill simply places all denominations on an equality before the law, giving all equal privilege; but there are some States that do much more than this; they give to certain forms of religion and their adherents, decided advantages over others.

Sunday laws are of this character. Judge Hammond, of the United States District Court, himself an intense partisan of Sunday and of Sunday laws, said, as we have quoted on a previous occasion, that "it is a sort of factitious advantage, the observance of that day of rest being a part of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the claims for religious freedom." Yet it may astonish some that those who see in the Freedom of Worship bill a union of Church and State, can see nothing improper whatever in Sunday legislation really. Surely this should answer.

THE WHOLE trouble in regard to the Freedom of Worship bill arises from the appropriation of State funds for religious purposes. State supervision of religious worship is only the logical result of State support of religious institutions. If the State pays its money it has a right to say how it shall be used. The worst wish we have for those Protestants who see in the Freedom of Worship bill a union of Church and State and to turn the public institutions over to sectarian influences, is that they may consistently oppose the beginnings of the evil, and insist that the State shall have nothing whatever to do with religion.
