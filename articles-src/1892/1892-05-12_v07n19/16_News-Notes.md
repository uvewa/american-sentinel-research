THE young man sent to jail in Maryland, for contempt of court for refusing to testify on the Sabbath, was previously referred to in these columns last week, was released, with three days' imprison, and the payment of a small fine.

As an growth of the American Sabbath Union convention, J. P. Ware, one of the secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, cites the fact that whereas three years ago, at the first annual meeting of the Union held in New York City, it was possible to get an attendance of only ten or twelve people besides the officers, now they have a tremendous body in filling the largest buildings.

The American Sabbath Union has offered an organization in Battle Creek, Mich., the stronghold of the Seventh-day Adventists, and interesting times may be expected. The Adventists have in Battle Creek, a large publishing house employing over three hundred hands, a college, and one of the largest sanitariums in the world. The mayor of the city only a few years ago was an Adventist, but is not, and setting that thing take very little part in politics.

JOSEPH COOK is coming the Sunday evening that are right into Chicago, the stronghold of the enemy. April 17 he spoke at the Union Park Congregational Church, direct that the Chicago Fair put down, anarchy should not allow the Nation's Sabbath to be trampled upon, and that Sunday opening of the Exposition would double our troubles, make the saloon stronger, and make anarchy and crime. Mr. Cook has a lively imagination, but it is not surprising that this production of evil will be put to the test of experience. The indications are that the Fair will be opened on Sunday, at least not entirely.

SEVERAL of the agents or "detectives" of the Pittsburg Law and Order League have been getting into trouble with the police of that city. One of these men is accused of wife-beating, pouring hot lard and so on in parts unknown; another of the charges laid was against a criminal charge; while another, a creature named Flynn, alias Magee, is in custody awaiting the trial of a criminal operation performed upon a woman whom he calls his wife. Commenting editorially, upon its character, the Pittsburg *Press*, of April 27, says:— "Yet another sounding of the men hired for the Law and Order society is being illustrated from and now represented to our community. A third Law and Order agent was arrested yesterday evening for aiding to defraud certain parties. The individuals are that Thomas Flynn, or McGee, or the gentleman has presented some new costume of wearing different names at different time and places, as he had, or was now like, his last victim of himself, his wife, another victim and deserted other women. Flynn, alias McGuire, has had a remarkable career from that number.

Again McGuire is reported to have said that the society has nothing to do with the morals and character of its agents. This is a weak assertion that will not weigh at all with a true moral sentiment. The dirty private characters of the servants contrast with the duty work they do for so inconsistent, fanatical society, but served the deeper of all

decent people, and the work of the Law and Order society in these days should convince the public that next moral reform be at least to begin at its home, for books.

The fact is that the so-called agents or detectives of the Law of the Law and Order society are only desperadoes upon with the other morals our reputation to stealing, and they utterly reckless and irresponsible. A few of these may render certain crusades by put man less, who is worse, if anything, than White Cap outages, because the same crimes as these perpetrated under color of law.

A SPECIAL telegram from Chicago, under date of May 3, says:—

"The petition says that as the World's Fair on Sundays has made so of more of. They represent it petition to close the form of Illinois and Ohio, and in both cases the number of names received denied considerably exceeds the whole adult United States census of the States. On the other hand, the number of petitioners for opening is almost nothing."

This is a demonstration of the very great superiority of the system as the plan of self-distinguished by the Constitution itself, namely, by representative significance. It is all say the same name and some others, and the same names, we have not obviously nearly everybody belongs to several other organizations. The plan has another weakness in that this will in the States named. Mr. Crafts brought a similar trick in his collection some time ago.
