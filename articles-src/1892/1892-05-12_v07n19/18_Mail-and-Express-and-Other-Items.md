THE *Mail and Express* herewith the fact that the bill providing that the Park Department may provide in its yearly estimates an additional seventy thousand dollars to be devoted to the expenses of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has become a law, having received Governor Flower's signatures. By the terms of the bill, the Museum is to be kept open to the public six nights in the week and on Sunday and free of charge.

THE New York Sabbath Committee, so-called, has received from England a petition praying that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday. It has been sent to this country by a request that it be sent to the United States Columbian Commission. It is forwarded to Charlie Hill, Secretary of the Workingman's Sunday Rest Associations, and bears the autograph of such "horny-handed sons of toil" as bishops, peers of the realm, members of Parliament, etc.
