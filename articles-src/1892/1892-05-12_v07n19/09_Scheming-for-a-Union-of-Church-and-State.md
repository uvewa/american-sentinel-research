Scheming for a Union of Church and State.

THOSE "religious liberties" who are so fondly and absolutely on the principle of dimension of the complete in government and the union church ministers have been scheming and planning for a reunion. The plan to close the World's Fair on Sunday is a step in that direction. It is only a step in itself, but if accomplished will stand as a precedent and a platform from which to demand more for another, and so on until on. "Those who have any religion or other reasons for not going to the Fair on Sunday are at liberty to stay away. No law has a right to interfere with a man's liberty to find those who find it more convenient to rest on that day, or who choose to not have the right to do so. No one has a moral, nor does it have, a legal right, to close the Fair against them.

Those who wish to religiously observe Sunday are at liberty to do so. Those who do not wish to ought to have the same liberty not to do so. It is a very poor faith that does not work both ways. The

kind that says: "You shall have perfect liberty to do just as I do, or to do what I may be best and right just to do," is not liberty that this Country was founded on any kind of tyranny.

If these persons succeeded in securing the enactment of Sunday laws on religious grounds. The next step was in the direction of a union of Church and State. For they may planning to get the other foot forward onto forbidden ground for having the World's Fair closed on Sunday, not for physical, but religious reasons. If their plans having been this far, the programmes will be another and another. It is well enough to resist each step to its very first stage, its immediate importance or of itself alone. It is these steps adopted that must be arrested.
