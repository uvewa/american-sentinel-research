THE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION HAS just been informed that charges have been preferred against twenty individuals at Mt. Pleasant, Texas, for Sunday labor. The accused are observers of the seventh day. If these Sunday laws are designed simply to elevate and help the "poor laboring man," why is it that they are enforced so strictly against those who religiously and conscientiously observe the seventh day? Can not they rest on Saturday, and get just as much good out of it as those do who rest on Sunday? And if so, why undertake to compel them to observe a day that they do not regard as the Sabbath? It is simply some of the religious intolerance that has ever prompted men to be meddling with other people's religious convictions.
