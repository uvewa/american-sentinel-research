They Should Be Consistent.

QUITE a strong effort has been made recently in Santa Rosa, Cal., it seems to be in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday. The plea is that with a great demonstration, that would produce ever so very great an impression on Congress generally, and especially in this in the direction of the members from that State. The World's Fair Commissioner, who resides in a neighboring town, was invited to join in, and the papers had considerable to say about a minister who would preach a sermon on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, on the occasion, the meeting he invited everybody to attend. He had engaged an excursion on the evening Sunday to organize the effort. He promised that there would be something that would be seen by the vast number of people in attendance. And those who went said they wanted to make such an impression upon the Fair Commissioner that he would vote entirely in favor of Sunday closing. At the great meeting on the evening on following Tuesday, about fifty persons were present. The chairman discouraged speakers and discussions and called at random upon a brother minister to make a few remarks. The brother spoke, as he said, to the Sabbath, and that it is the original Sabbath of the divine rest, "and no other conclusively." The hearers present seemed to think differently. His thoughts were religious, and apparently different from the chairman's.

"Just as he was concluding his remarks, and was about to take his seat and thought the subject was about to go further forward, and say something more. Upon the platform, and say something more upon the subject of Sunday closing. He said he was a Seventh-day man himself, and that was all well, but that he wanted to make one more remark. Here he was called to order.

The substance of his remarks was that there is no Sabbath in the Christian dispensation, and that there never was one, and that as the seventh day, Saturday, and that is the only day that God set apart for the Sabbath. And further of it, why undertake to compel the observer of a day, when they do not regard or observe it, in a day the Sabbath is not the Sabbath? It is simply none of them practicing what they preach. They have devoured each other and their faults, and they certainly should not fail too soon in their necessity to reform themselves not certainly should not fail too soon for any second motion on should at least it takes with up a subject, the advocates of which, upon seeing among themselves, and each, in presenting its arguments, and in their congregation of arguments, who are interested in the same cause. The article was the best speech made on Sunday
