The Christian Advocate of this city, congratulates Tennessee on its "excellent" Sunday law. One of the provisions of that law is:—

If any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life, or of causing or permitting the same to be done by his children or servants, acts of real necessity or charity excepted, on Sunday, he shall, on due conviction thereof before any Justice of the Peace of the county, forfeit and pay three dollars, one-half to the person who will sue for the same, and the other half for the use of the county.

The premium which the law put upon espionage is, we suppose, specially pleasing to the Advocate. It was on this very provision however that a Justice of the Peace at Springville, Tennessee, came to grief a few years ago. This officer in his zeal to maintain the dignity of the law, and incidentally, of course, to earn fees, induced an impecunious individual in the neighborhood to enter a complaint for Sunday labor against five of his neighbors who were Seventh-day Adventists. The impecunious citizen who had probably not seen seven dollars and a half since before the war, was told that the aggregate fine would be fifteen dollars, and that half of it should be paid to him. The warrants were accordingly issued and served, and in due time the prisoners were brought into court.

But the Justice was as indiscreet as he was avaricious and allowed it to become known that he had instigated the whole matter. The five defendants of course demanded a change of venue. This occasioned delay and the case was not called in the court to which it was taken by the change until after the expiration of the ten days allowed for filing information in such cases. Having made sure that new warrants could not issue in the same case, the attorney for the defendants made the point, that the information upon which the arrests had been ordered had not been reduced to writing and sworn to as the statute required. This the Justice who issued the warrants was compelled to admit was the case. The prisoners were at once discharged, and the costs, which amounted to just fifteen dollars, were charged up to the Justice who had instigated the arrests. That gentleman still lives in Springville, but he is no longer an officer, and if Sunday work by others, out of his sight and hearing, now outrages his fine sensibilities he gives no sign.
