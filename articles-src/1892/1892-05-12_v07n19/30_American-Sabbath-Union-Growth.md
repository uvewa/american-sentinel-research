As an evidence of the growth of Sunday-law sentiment, F. W. Ware, one of the secretaries for the American Sabbath Union, cites the fact that whereas three years ago, at the first annual meeting of the Union held in New York City, it was possible to get an attendance of only fifteen persons besides the officers, now they have no trouble in filling the largest buildings at any time.
