THE whole trouble in regard to the Freedom of Worship bill comes from the appropriation of State funds for religious purposes. State supervision of religious worship is only the logical result of State support of religious institutions. If the State pays its money it has a right to say how it shall be used. The worst wish we have for those Protestants who see in the Freedom of Worship bill a union of Church and State is that they may be led by it to consistently oppose the beginnings of the evil, and insist that the State shall have nothing whatever to do with religion.
