AN English paper contains the following evidence of the widespread advancement of the movement toward religious persecution:

It is said that the Lutherans, and especially the Lutheran pastors in Finland, are trying to get a law passed to prevent all free religious services. If such a law were passed, scores (if not hundreds) of the best Christians of Finland would be thrown into prison.

This spirit of enforcing religion by law is not confined to the United States, it is everywhere making itself felt.
