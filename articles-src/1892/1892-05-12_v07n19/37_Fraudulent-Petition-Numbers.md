A SPECIAL telegram from Chicago, under date of May 3, says:—

The people who are trying to close the World's Fair on Sundays have made a sad mess of it. They turned in petitions to-day from the States of Michigan and Ohio, and in both cases the number of names is several hundred thousand more than the last United States census of the States. On the Michigan petition the number is 800,000 greater than the census returns.

This is a demonstration of the very great superiority of the new method of petitioning, advised by the Christian Statesman, namely, by representative signatures. In this way the same persons are counted again and again, as nowadays almost everybody belongs to several organizations. The plan has worked only too well in the States named. Mr. Crafts might as well add this to his collection of "pious frauds."
