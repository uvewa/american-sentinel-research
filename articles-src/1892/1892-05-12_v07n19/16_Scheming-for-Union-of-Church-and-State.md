Our liberties are founded almost absolutely on the principle of disunion of Church and State, and ever since that disunion churches have been scheming and contriving for a reunion. The plan to close the World's Fair on Sunday is a step in that direction. It is only a small step, but if accomplished will stand as a precedent and a pretext for another step, and that for another, and on and on. Those who have any religious or other reasons for not attending the Fair on Sundays are at liberty to stay away. No law has a right to force them to go. On the other hand those who find it more convenient to visit it on that day should have a perfect right to do so. No one has a moral, nor should he have a legal right, to close the doors against them.

Those who wish to religiously observe Sunday are at liberty to do so. Those who do not wish to ought to have the same liberty not to do so. It is a very poor liberty that does not work both ways. The kind that says: "You shall have perfect liberty to do just as I do, or to do what I say is best and right for you to do," is not liberty, but the narrowest and most fanatical kind of tyranny.

The churches have succeeded in securing the enactment of Sunday laws on physical grounds. That was one step in the direction of a union of Church and State. Now they are planning to get the other foot forward onto forbidden ground by having the World's Fair closed on Sundays, not for physical, but religious reasons. If they succeed, the next thing on the programme will be another step, and at each step liberty is weakened and the perpetuity of free institutions imperiled. It is these incipient steps that must be prevented.
