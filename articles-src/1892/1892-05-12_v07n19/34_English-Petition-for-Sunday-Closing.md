THE NEW YORK SABBATH COMMITTEE, so-called, has received from England a petition praying that the World's Fair be closed on Sundays. The petition is accompanied by a request that it be sent to the United States Columbian Commissioners. It is forwarded by Charles Hill, Secretary of the Workingmen's Sunday Rest Association, and bears the autographs of such "horny-handed sons of toil" as bishops, peers of the realm, members of Parliament, etc.
