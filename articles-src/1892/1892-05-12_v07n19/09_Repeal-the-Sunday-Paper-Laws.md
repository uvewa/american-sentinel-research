A NATIONAL Reform organ thinks "if there were no other reason for suppressing the Sunday papers, it would be enough that they are training fifty thousand boys in lawlessness." But why not rather repeal the laws against the Sunday papers? It is no more logical to argue that a thing is evil because it is contrary to law than that it is right because in accordance with law. In the case of the Sunday papers it is the law that is wrong. The law should be repealed.
