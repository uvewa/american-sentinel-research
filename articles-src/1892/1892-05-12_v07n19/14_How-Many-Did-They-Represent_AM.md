At a hearing before the Quadro-centennial Committee of the House of Representatives in Congress, Col. Elliott F. Shepard stated that he and his associates who were present to speak in favor of congressional legislation for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, represented the sentiment of the entire religious element of this country, and placed the number of Christian people at about fifty millions.

Now I should not care to say that Mr. Shepard had wilfully misstated this matter, but I am sure that the facts do not warrant the statement. In the first place, there is a very great difference between the belief that the Fair ought to be closed on Sunday, and that it ought to be closed by an act of Congress. While there are a few who still hold the old Puritan idea of using the State to enforce their religious sentiment, there are a great many more who have grown out of that narrow view, and have partaken of the spirit of religious liberty, which permeates the very atmosphere of this free country.

Now for the proof. The writer has often heard the statement made publicly, by Rev. Dr. McLean, Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, that from the office of that Association in Chicago, blank petitions had been sent to more than fifty thousand Christian ministers of this country, with the request that they secure signatures, and then forward them to members of Congress, and the Directors of the World's Fair. Those blanks were sent out more than nine months ago, and up to the present time, according to reports, less than three thousand of them have been returned. There are several whole denominations of Christians who have not returned a single petition, and those that have been returned are from a very few denominations. What has become of the other forty-seven thousand petitions that were sent out?

It does not appear that Mr. Shepard was justified in representing all these Christian people. Some of the ministers of the various denominations have spoken in a manner to leave no doubt as to their adherence to the principles of religious liberty, as opposed to an act of Congress closing the World's Fair on Sunday, which they believe to be religious legislation. Among the many who have made public declarations are found, Rev. G. W. Ballenger, of Chicago, and Rev. Dr. Lorimer, of Tremont Temple, Boston, men who represent a very high grade of the Christian people of this country.
