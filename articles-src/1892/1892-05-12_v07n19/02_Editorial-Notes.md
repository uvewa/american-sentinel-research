# Editorial Notes.

DR. PARKHURST, of unsavory notoriety because of his sensational methods for the "improvement" of vice in this city, has been invited to Washington by a number of prominent persons including Senators Cullom and Davis, Postmaster-General Wanamaker, Ex-Justice Strong, and Justice Brewer, to tell what he knows about the "duty of the Christian Church in its relation to the execution of the civil law." This is significant.

A NATIONAL Reform organ thinks "if the Sunday papers, it would be enough that they are insulting fifty thousand boys to lawlessness." But why not simply repeal the laws against the Sunday papers? It is no more logical to argue that a thing is evil because it is contrary to law than that it is right because it is in accordance with law. In the case of the Sunday papers it is the law that is wrong. The law should be changed.

THERE is absolutely no good reason why the State should prohibit the publication and sale of Sunday papers. A great many people, a very large majority indeed of the whole population, regard Sunday as a rest day, but the State has nothing at all to do with. That, however, is the only reason, and the only reason, for Sunday laws. Such legislation is an effort on the part of the majority to enforce upon the minority a tenet of the religion of the majority. It is, as Judge Hammond has confessed in so many words, the purpose of giving the observance of Sunday a sort of factitious advantage. A factitious advantage is an unearned advantage, one which nature has not given; it is therefore entirely out of place in this country, which guarantees to all people a factitious advantage over the other part without to this extent abridge the natural rights of the less favored class. The same principle would justify the giving of a similar advantage to Judge Hammond himself, Sunday laws against the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Independence.
