The Secretary of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Mrs. J. C. Bateham, says, in an article written for the Christian Statesman:—

Evidently unless Congress forbids Sunday opening, the Commission will not, and about the former our hopes and prayers now gather. The action just reported (the postponement of the consideration of the question) is on the presumption that friends of the Sabbath will sooner yield the point of Sunday closing than risk the chance of being obliged to forego attendance on the Fair and its religious Congresses; and the question is therefore thrust home upon us, should Congress take no action on this point, what is our proper attitude with reference to the Fair? Can we as Christian people consistently do otherwise than raise the banner, SUNDAY CLOSING VS. NON-ATTERIANCE?

The Woman's Christian Temperance Union will doubtless take this stand, probably inserting also—"and no intoxicants." Should the American Sabbath Union and similar bodies, the Christian Statesman and other leading religious papers also take this stand, without doubt the great religious organizations of the country would add their ponderous amen, and who can doubt that the deadened ear of the Directory would catch the ominous sound and transmit it to its governing money nerve and the desired edict would go forth? Nothing else will move them. Nothing else, I believe, will satisfy our own consciences. Let us gather and send up a million names pledged to this motto and add all indorsements, and we shall accomplish more for Sabbath observance by our attitude and the heroic self-denial involved than we could otherwise.

So the Woman's Christian Temperance Union nails the banner of the systematic, organized boycott to its masthead, and joins the Pittsburg preachers in a conspiracy to rule the World's Fair, or ruin it. This is Mrs. Bateham's word for it; but they will not do this. They will not commit themselves, as an organization to such a course as this. There are many members of the Union who understand these questions and realize what a fatal error is being attempted in the gaining of religious ends by coercive legislation. More thoughtful and capable women of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union read THE AMERICAN SENTINEL and agree with the principles it teaches, than Mrs. Bateham knows. She underrates too the native intelligence and Christian charity of thousands of her fellow society women, who will intuitively feel that this is not Christian justice. That fine sense of the fitness of things which characterizes the lady, to the manner born and bred, even in the absence of any other appreciation of the situation, will lead many to realize the unfitness and ineptness of such interference as this where they have no shadow of rightful authority. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union will not rally at any such call as this, and will not be led by any banner of the boycott.

In contrast with the Sabbath Observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the Pittsburg preachers who are flaunting the red flag of the boycott and the black flag of "no quarter," and calling for the "forlorn hope" to volunteer, are others whom the Statesman see preparing to run up the white flag of truce and peace. It says:—

And what are we doing to defend our heritage and save our country? Alas! alas! some of its defenders are growing faint-hearted and whispering their fears to their neighbors for their discouragement. Some are looking for a way of retreat, some are asking for terms of compromise, while some are even proposing to run up the white flag and surrender the citadel. Shame! shame! And this is the land of the Puritans and the Pilgrim Fathers!

Fortunately this is not and has not been for many years the land of the Pilgrim Fathers; while it was it was the abode of religious tyranny and civil injustice. Their only understanding of religious freedom was the full privilege of asking God to bless them and curse their neighbor, while civil liberty meant to them the unhampered opportunity to make themselves instruments to effectuate the curse.

If there is a white flag anywhere in the ranks of the followers of such as these it is a happy forecast of a possible change of heart on the part of some. But what is the ominous portend of the red banner and the black?
