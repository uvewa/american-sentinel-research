At the United Presbyterian Preachers meeting in Pittsburg, on April 11, resolutions were adopted showing on their part a feeling of desperation in reference to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and dealing in language of restrained insolence and threats toward the Columbian Commission. These are the resolutions:—

WHEREAS, The Columbian Commission, as we are informed, has, for a third time, postponed the decision of the question of Sunday opening, in this case to the very eve of the Fair, with the self-evident purpose, avowed privately by some of the Commissioners, of making it impossible, as buildings must be begun in May, for either friends or foes to express their disapproval of the final decision by withdrawing from the Exhibition; therefore,

Resolved, That we most emphatically protest again,— "vis attempt to deceive by delay one side or the other, or both sides in this controversy; and that we protest also against this political evasion of plain and present duty, this serious trifling with petitions of unprecedented number from the civil and religious bodies that make up the best citizenship of our land; and

Resolved, That we earnestly ask a reconsideration of this postponement, and an immediate and unequivocal decision of the question at issue; and

Resolved, That if this postponement is persisted in, we urge the Christian, law-abiding citizens of this land to take such postponement as a forecast of an adverse decision in the form of a cowardly compromise or otherwise, and as a ground for withholding all participation in an exhibition, which, under a management lacking moral courage, must become a mighty engine of evil, an aid to the lawless in the present conflicts with disorder and dissipation; and

Resolved, That we urge upon general assemblies and all other general conferences soon to meet, and upon all religious conventions, all Christian exhibitors, and especially all religious organizations, to refuse to proceed with any proposed building or exhibit or "congress" until this matter is settled, and settled right, by the Commission, or by the United States Congress, and that all friends of the Sabbath who have accepted "advisory" or other relations to any religious exhibit, make it a condition to their acceptance, that the decision of the pending question shall be in accord with the laws of God, and in harmony with American laws, customs, and precedents; and

Resolved, That on account of this evasion of duty by the Commission, we hereby petition Congress, whether the Commission reconsideres its action or not, lest it should again fall into moral cowardice, to decide this matter securely by conditioning any further grant of public money to the Fair on the entire closing of the Exhibition every Sabbath; and

Resolved, That we ask all preachers' meetings, and religious or reformatory associations, and all societies that are opposed to Sunday work and Sunday dissipation to join us at once in these protests and petitions; and

Resolved, That we urge the general assemblies and general conferences, and other religious conventions, to advise the churches, in case it is decided that any part of the Fair is to be opened for any part of the Sabbath for money making or secular uses, to meet and consider whether the members should not solemnly covenant with each other not to aid or abet such a foe of the Sabbath by exhibition or attendance; and

Resolved, That these resolutions be sent through the Reform Bureau, to the religious press of the country and as far as possible to the secular papers.

To characterize this language as restrained, is really dealing with it too mildly. It is insolent and threatening to the business management of the Fair. From a business and legal point of view it might be a question as to whether it did not amount to conspiracy. No better evidence of the spirit which animates this movement is needed than the witness of their own words.
