In the case of the Rector, etc., of the Church of the Holy Trinity vs. the United States, Mr. Justice Brewer quotes, in his opinion, what he designates as a "mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation." He begins with "the commission to Christopher Columbus, prior to his sail westward," from the King and Queen of Spain, refers to the colonial charters from King James, and says, "In language more or less emphatic, is the establishment of the Christian religion declared to be one of the purposes of the grant." In this connection Justice Brewer continues:—

The celebrated compact made by the pilgrims in the Mayflower, 1620, recites: "Having undertaken for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, and the Honor of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the first Colony in the northern Parts of Virginia. Do by these Presents, solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid."

This compact was made on board the Mayflower, November 11, 1620, and the introduction, preceding the words which Justice Brewer quotes, is:—

In the name of God, amen, We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord, King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc.

This was the very first governmental expression of the Pilgrim Fathers, and, according to Justice Brewer, as shown by the connection in which he quotes it, shows conclusively that their purpose was "the establishment of the Christian religion." Avoiding, at this time, the consideration of the question as to what authority an establishment of religion created, or purposed to be created by them should have over us now, it is, nevertheless, interesting to investigate the character of the religion established, as expressed in the laws which enforced it.

In 1818 the attention of the Legislature of Massachusetts being called to the historical value of the old legislative records of the Colony of Plymouth, a committee of three was appointed, one of them being a clergyman, to search out, arrange, and transcribe these records. After describing the condition in which the originals were found the committee says:—

The copies made from the above form eleven folio volumes, and are indexed like the originals. All the laws and legislative proceeding are copied, with as much of the other records as was thought to be useful or interesting to the public. The parts not copied are most of the private deeds, actions, wills and inventories.

In 1836 the Legislature ordered these old records published. The work was done under the supervision of William Brigham, counsellor at law, who says in his preface, after quoting the report of the committee of 1818:—

Such is the source from which this volume has been formed. The design of preserving the laws as near their original form as possible has been kept constantly in view, and for this purpose their chronological arrangement has been preserved, and the ancient orthography retained. This arrangement exhibits more fully than any other the progress of public opinion in legislation, and the changes which took place, from time to time, in the laws, corresponding to those in the condition, wants and institutions of the Colony.

It is explained further that the method followed throughout has been such as it was thought would best preserve "the spirit of the people as embodied in their laws," and give the work the highest "historical interest and value."

Again in 1889 there was published by order of the City Council of Boston, "The Colonial Laws of Massachusetts, reprinted from the edition of 1660, with the supplements to 1675, containing also the Body of Liberties of 1641," and reproduced from the original by the photo-electrotyping process. From such authorities as these it is not possible that any false impression can be received as to the matter or spirit of the early legislation of the Puritan Colonies.

The first recorded legislative proceeding to further the purpose of establishing religion under the Mayflower compact is found under laws passed in 1636, in which "solemn compaction or conversing with the divell by way of witchcraft, conjuration or the like," is declared to be a capital offense, punishable with death; and also "that it be in the power of the Governor and assistant to command solemn days of humiliation by fasting, etc., and also for thanksgiving, as occasion shall be offered." And again in 1639 the general court makes and confirms an act,—

That whosoever shall prophanely sweare or curse by the name of God or any of his titles, attributes, word, or works, upon proofs thereof made by sufficient testymony or confession of the party, he shall pay for every such default 12d, or be ret in the stocks so that it exceed not the space of three hours or putt in prison according to the natur and quality of the person.

It begins to be evident that Justice Brewer was right, it was the purpose of the grant to form an establishment of religion; and these loyal Puritans are beginning to carry it out, in a way that bodes some discomfort, it is true, to such as may be accused of witchcraft, and after a manner that may reduce, by a few pence, the well filled purse of the cavalier, from whose lips the aristocratic oaths of the day were wont to flow so fluently, while the uncouth curse of Hodge might put him in the stocks. The fact that this law is a respecter of persons, and the somewhat startling mystery of "compaction with the divell" and its capital penalty might rouse some natural suspicions already as to the character of this religion that has been established, but these must be stifled and not allowed to have any influence so early in the investigation. However Justice Brewer was certainly right, the compact and grant had in view the forming of an establishment of religion, and the Pilgrim Fathers have established a religion. It will be necessary to read these old colonial laws farther.
