THERE is absolutely no good reason why the State should prohibit the publication and sale of Sunday papers. A great many people, a very large majority indeed of the whole population, regard Sunday as a sacred day, but the State has nothing to do with that. That, however, is the reason, and the only reason, for Sunday laws. Such legislation is an effort on the part of the majority to enforce upon the minority a tenet of the religion of the majority. It is, as Judge Hammond confesses in his dictum, for the purpose of giving the observer of Sunday a sort of factitious advantage. A factitious advantage is an unnatural advantage, one which nature has not given; it is therefore entirely out of place, especially in religious things and under a Government established to secure to all their natural, or inalienable rights. It is impossible to give one part of the people a factitious advantage over the other part without to the same extent abridging the natural rights of the less favored part. It follows that even according to Judge Hammond himself, Sunday laws are not in harmony with the principles of the Declaration of Independence.
