DR. PARKHURST, of unsavory notoriety because of his sensational methods for the "suppression" of vice in this city, has been invited to Washington by a number of prominent persons including Senators Cullom and Dawes, Postmaster-General Wanamaker, Ex-Justice Strong, and Justice Brewer, to tell what he knows about the "duty of the Christian Church in relation to the execution of the civil law." This is significant.
