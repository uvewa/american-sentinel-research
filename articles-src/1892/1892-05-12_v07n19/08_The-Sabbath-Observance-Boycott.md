THE Secretary of the Sabbath Observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, says, in an article written for the *Christian Statesman*:—

Evidently unions Congress forbids Sunday congress sessions at present are not alive to the promise and use hopes and prayer now guides. The appeal was one that is calculated enough that our friends of the Sabbath will accept; and the point before Congress; and the question is therefore evidently determined to "close the World's Fair on Sunday in reference to the Fair." Can we as Christians SUBMIT CHURCH TO NOT ATTENDANCE? Every duty arises with the Christian churches "and no Invitations." Should the American Sabbath Union that stand, without doubt the great religious force of this country. We do not believe that the effort that stand, without doubt the great religious force of this country, and whoever doubt that the disloyal element, and the disloyal element therein will never succeed and the dissent shall world not fairly! Scoff, and send up a million names pledged to this months then the Fair management will come to their senses and best denial forced unless than we could otherwise.

So the Woman's Christian Temperance Union makes the blackest threat of a boycott, organized boycott to its mankind, and joins the Pittsburg presbytery in a scandal it says to rule the World's Fair, or ruin it. And Mrs. Bateham's word yet it—"if they will not do. They will not compete in any other organization to such forces as this. There are many members of the Union who conscientiously

questions and realizes what a final score is being attempted in the gaining of notice given up by coercion legislation. More of them ought to assert themselves. No woman in the entire membership of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union with the principle is teaches, than Mrs. Bateham. She undertakes to make the native intelligence and Christian charity of thousands of her fellow society women, who will instinctively feel that this is not Christian position. That attitude combined of things which characterize the follies, to the manner born, and became lost in the absence of any other appreciation of the shambles, which shall insure to calling the unfit can and insidious and insufficient of each other influence as this where they have no balance on any of their character. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union will not boycott the World's Fair, but they will not be led by any banner of the boycott.

It is in contrast with the Sabbath Observance department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the Washington preachers who are flourishing the red flag of the boycott and the black flag of "no quarter," and calling for the "reform contingency," we inform others whom Silverman are preparing to run up the white flag of truce and peace. It says:—

And what are we doing to defend our heritage and our constitutional right? Almost nothing. We prefer to be on good terms with our neighbors! We prefer them to our neighbors for their discontent. There appears to be a popular misconception that there are even proposing to run up the white flag this is the land of the Puritans and the Pilgrims.

Fortunately this is not and has not been for many years the land of the Pilgrims and the Puritans, for the end of the absolute of religious tyranny and civil liberty. For the child to live was the full privilege of the man. God has no lawful right to coerce his neighbor, while civil liberty meant to him an unfinished opportunity to make themselves instruments to effectuate tyranny.

If there is a white flag anywhere in this land, it is in the hands of such as these. It is a happy forecast of a possible change of heart on the part of the rest. But what will they do about the boycott of the W. M. S.?

It will be noticed, however, that it is only these religionists and dictates of divinity who offer with this persecution, people upon a purely religious question, that are putting forth this claim they are doing harm to the State. But this is simply the old charge, even once again. Thus the Jews accused Christ: "We
