# Sectarian Hatred Not Yet Dead.

If any one thinks sectarian hatred a thing altogether of the past, or that an institution nominally devoted to power in this country, whether under the name of Papacy or Protestantism, would not persecute if invested with the power toward dissenting religionists, let him read the following extract from a letter of the Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the State of Michigan to the Rev. Warwick, in the *Michigan Sabbath Watch-man*, for April, 1892:—

Some of the ministers of that State are a great deal of lasting harm, patriotism in this locality, and they seem to have been at it. Seventh-day Adventism has not a single redeeming feature—It is a menace to the community, a nuisance, a blight, and curse.

And note and egotisms, Seventh-day Adventism find no favor in the eyes of the American Sabbath Union, for that organization and "apocryphal voices," "horse," "nails," "blight," "curse," and all the vocabulary of words and scholarly men "should stand.

How familiar the same sounds and echoes. They have been weighed in the balance of candid, honest, public investigation and been found wanting. None of this hatred goes along with the merest round of the Lord Jesus Christ, even toward those in error. It would remind that we are in a deadly religious warfare.

Michigan is the hot bed, the leading ground, and the source from which has gone forth strong evidence, this destructive sect. The State needs cleaning out and it can be cleaned out.

The Seventh-day Adventists were born in a crowded country. As a body, they have no vices; they are at large, they are everybody to dare, have no conviction of their own merits, are modest, law abiding, and industrious in the extreme.

Good grief, Seventh-day Adventism is one of the worst.

Such are the utterances and sentiments of the Michigan representative of that organization which has taken upon itself the duty of enforcing the religious "Sabbath by law." But if he is not careful, something more than an offensive style must carry. Unless he is advised to hold in a little, and he a false horizon is put to the time, he will talk so plainly and reveal to all that irrational and inherent wickedness of the movement so clearly that no one can fail to see the object the subject of the thing. In the single issue of his paper from which we quote, he attacks a particular denomination, and all in the name of the religion whose motto is "Love your enemies."

If he is not a little more discreet in his attacks, and cover in his manner of attack, the American Sabbath Union may deem it necessary to call this one in, and abolish its Michigan Field Secretaryship, or it did its General Field Secretaryship a year or two ago. Mr. Crafts got to indulging too freely in the vilification of
