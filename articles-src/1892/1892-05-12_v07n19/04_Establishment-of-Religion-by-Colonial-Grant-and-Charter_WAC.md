# Establishment of Religion by Colonial Grant and Charter.

In the case of the Rector, etc., of the Church of the Holy Trinity *vs.* the United States, Mr. Justice Brewer quotes, in his opinion, what he designates as a "mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation." He begins with the commissions to Christopher Columbus, prior to his sail westerly, "from the King and Queen of Spain, refers to the commission from Henry VII. to John Cabot, quotes from King James, and says, "the celebrated compact made by the pilgrims, the establishment of the Christian religion declared to be one of their purposes." In this connection Justice Brewer declares:—

The reformed compact made by the pilgrims in the Mayflower, does indeed speak of the Christian Faith, and the Honor of our Country, and does mention the colony in the northern Parts of Virginia; Do by these Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine our selves together into a Civil Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid."

This compact was made on board the Mayflower, November 11, 1620, and the signers were as follows:—

> In the name of God, amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord, King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc.

This was the very first governmental expression of the Pilgrim Fathers, and, as consisting of Justice Brewer, as adduced by the United States Supreme Court, it should be conclusively that their purpose was "the establishment of the Christian religion."

Availing, at this time, the consideration of the question as to what authority any establishment of religion created, or purposed to be created by these colonial charters now is, it is, nevertheless, interesting to investigate the character of the religion established, as expressed in the laws made under it.

In 1636 the attending of the Legislature of Massachusetts being called to the historical value of the old legislative records of the Colony of Plymouth, a committee of three was applied, one of them being the Secretary of State, "to examine and transcribe these records. After describing the condition of the records as they found the committee says:—

> "In transcribing, the original orthography, names, and we indexed like the originals. All notes were also transcribed, which appeared to be useful or interesting to the public. The proper names in the index to be found in the general index of the volume."

In 1836 the Legislature ordered these old records published. The work was done under the superintendence of Nathaniel B. Shurtleff. No revision, commissioner at law, who was at the result of this work, no change in the original orthography has been retained.

It is also the case from which the volume of the original records has not been changed; their original form as possible has been kept in preserving them. The original spelling and antiquated arrangement has been preserved, and the only change that has been made is one of purely typographical arrangement in the margin, spelling in capitals, and the changes which have been found necessary in the translation of the records.

And it is presently farther observed:—

> "The same simple and consistent course followed throughout has been such as might have been expected from such men as the spirit of the people was as embodied in their original compact, though there were some liberal and restrictive views.

Alluding, in 1639 there was published, the order of the City Council of Boston,—

> "These are the original manuscript records from the edition of 1600, with the simple addition of notes, with citations of the 'Body of Liberties of 1641,' and reprinted from the edition of 1660."

> "The free enjoyment of all civil rights." He begins with the liberties of the "Body of Liberties" and so powerful was their far-seeing influence that it as potent and has also fairly impressive.

This is the real origin of the Puritan control of the early years of New England.

The first recorded legislative proceedings relating to the first establishment of religion under the Mayflower compact is—

> "It is enacted by the Court and the authority of the same;" that is to say an "adeum compulsion or conversing with the Indians" or "submitting to any legislation of the like," is declared to be a capital offense to "compound in any unlawful way and the assistance to command seldom and in conformity to all laws passed." It is further enacted that: "Whosoever shall be found to make or observe a similar thanksgiving, or occasions shall be afforded within the province, then they shall speak, and cause [detect the said transgression] and make and confirm as act."

This was not only the earliest, but was by the name of God or of any of the title, and therefore a direct, enactment of a religious nature, for every such details fall, if the above recorded original documents are to be believed, a matter of rules or part in prison according to the master and nature of the offense.

It would be interesting to note also that the courts in then took it upon themselves the grants in the form of an establishment of religious belief; and then loyal Puritans had at their disposal the same resources. In point that does some discomfort, it is true, to such as they were, an aristocratical and sectarian element that may now, by a few persons, whose lips the aristocratical smells of the courts and who want to live in power, willing in the strength of Hodge might justifiably in the stocks. The fact is that this is a respecter of persons, and the commands of God are not in conformity with the civil" and its capital, penalty might come some actual statute quite ready as to the character of this religion that has been established, but these must be stifled and not allowed to have any authority more than that of a mere memory. Ever Justice Brewer was certainly right, and his and the Pilgrim Fathers established a forming of an establishment of religion, and the Pilgrim Fathers established a religion. It will be necessary to read those old colonial laws.

The same charge was brought against Paul and his companions by those who stirred up the people, "these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also." The Jews which "believed not" were called "the baser sort," set the city in an uproar, and "assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people." Yet those who had embraced Christianity were "more noble" than those of Thessalonica. They received the word with all readiness of mind, and piety in those days, "the Jews which believed not" were called "the least fellows of the baser sort," with envy and jealousy in their hearts, and associated themselves for the purpose of persecuting Christians. And it has been so all contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. The teaching of Protestants has ever been repeated by Romanists and hurled at them as the teaching of Protestantism itself. Baptists, back in the colonial days when the established religion was the Puritan as disturbers of the State because they broke down in the minds of many their own cherished views of compulsion. Their success the harm done to the State was that they showed how it was possible for those which were in was necessarily more popular, and whose religious practices were thought to endanger the State, to live peaceably. In other words, the damage done to the State was that their tolerant and free principles put to shame the intolerant practices and religious leaders of the day.

And what, we ask in conclusion, has the establishment of religion by the State done to the benefited characters of the State, who are those who once their religious views, and who opposed it when it might have been well arrested? Let Dem, a question answer.

> Was a heretics rightly punished with death? Saint Thomas.

> "Heretics may not only be excommunicated, but also other destructors of the State, are justly punished with death." Saint Thomas.—"*Sum. Theol.* 2 (2). Q. 11. Art. 3."

> "He that is a heretic after the first and second admonition reject, for the State should . . . deal." *ibid.*—Dens. "*Th.* II. 83."

Such was the charge and the verdict of the ages against the followers of Christ, of the age against the attitude of Rome, of Rome against Paul and his companions, of Puritans against Baptists and Quakers, of Protestants against Christians who denied that the seventh day has the fourth commandment in it, and it will yet be against all who protest against that which is of Rome and would not yet be reversed. Revelation declares it. The prophecy awaits its fulfillment. God purposes to give life unto the image of the beast, which should both speak, and cause [detect the said transgression] that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
