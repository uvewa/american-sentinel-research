TENNESSEE has White Caps as well as very bad Sunday laws. Recent advices from that State say that the White Caps in Jackson, Sevier, and Knox Counties are said to be well organized under the direction of a capable manager, who was brought from Indiana, where he acquired considerable experience in the infamous business. So far, about fifty persons have been whipped by the White Caps, and some of the leading citizens have been warned. Ten women have received whippings, and one minister, the Rev. Jenkins. Several of those whipped are in a precarious condition. White Caps and indictments for Sunday work under the common law against maintaining a nuisance, require about the same soil.
