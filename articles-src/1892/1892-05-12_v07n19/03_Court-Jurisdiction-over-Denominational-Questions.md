COMMENTING upon this provision, the Examiner says:—

That such appeal is allowed constitutes one of the chief objections to the bill. The section quoted above confers on the court a very novel jurisdiction. It gives it jurisdiction over denominational questions. It establishes an analogy between our own supreme tribunal and the courts of the Inquisition. It joins together things which ought always to be kept asunder; that is to say, it identifies in a very un-American manner religion and politics.
