THE MAIL AND EXPRESS bewails the fact that the bill providing that the Park Department may include in its yearly estimates an additional seventy thousand dollars to be devoted to the expenses of the Metropolitan Museum of Art has become a law, having received Governor Flower's signature. By the terms of the bill, the Museum is to be kept open to the public two nights in the week and on Sunday free of charge.
