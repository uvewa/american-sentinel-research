The process of grinding down the wedge of recognition of the propriety of Sunday legislation by Congress, and its committal to a course of religious legislation, still goes on. This time a very thin edge has been attained. The icemen of the city of Washington, either of their own motion or incited by those who are anxious for the passage of more Sunday laws for the District of Columbia,—because that would give to the whole movement the support and authority of Congress,—at a meeting on the 30th of March resolved to ask the assistance of the churches in the stoppage of the Sunday delivery of ice. To this end a circular was sent out asking church support; and on Sunday evening, April 17, a special service in behalf of icemen was held in the Central Presbyterian Church, the pastor of which has been credited with the authorship of the bill "to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday," otherwise known as the "Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia." At this service a show of massing the employes of the ice companies was made, the body of the church being especially reserved for them. Besides this the Baptist ministers' conference was especially appealed to on the subject, though why the icemen should have particularly cared for the co-operation of the Baptists more than any others, is difficult to see, unless they were acting under the advice of counsel who had told them that the Baptists were opposed to legislation upon religious matters, and who hoped through this subtlty to get the Baptist ministers to commit themselves to the support of the passage of Sunday laws for the District of Columbia by Congress. This device succeeded, for the Baptist ministers passed this resolution:—

Inasmuch as at a meeting held in this city on the evening of the 30th of March, 1892, by the dealers in ice and their employes, action was taken for the purpose of stopping the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, we are in sympathy with the action, and that we will assist in the movement to observe the Lord's day, and thereby secure to the employes the opportunity of religious worship by a release from labor on Sunday.

All the proceedings in this matter, up to this point, so far as they had been made public, were open to the possible interpretation of being simply preparatory to asking all dealers and consumers to enter into a mutual agreement as to the non-delivery of ice on Sunday. A perfectly proper proceeding to which no reasonable person could bring any honest objection; for they have an unquestionable right to so agree among themselves if they choose. But all this was preliminary to something else, and that to which it was a prelude appeared in the Congressional Record, of April 26, where, in the proceedings of the Senate for the day before, it is recorded under the title,—

"Bills introduced,"—Mr. McMillan (by request) introduced a bill (S. 2994) to prevent the sale or delivery of ice within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday; which was read twice by its title, and referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia.

In the House record for the same day is this, under the head, "Petitions," etc.,—

By Mr. Hemphill: Petition of drivers and employes of the different ice companies in the District of Columbia, asking the prohibition of the delivery and sale of ice in the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day,—to the Committee on the District of Columbia.

The penalty which these icemen have asked to have laid upon them for the delivery or sale of ice on Sunday is fixed at from twenty-five to fifty dollars, and it extends to any sale or delivery of ice on Sunday whatever, either from wagons, depots, or supply stations. By this bill ice dealers and their employes and saloonists and barkeepers are put on precisely the same footing in the District of Columbia, and ice classed with whiskey, as main prohibition on Sunday. No provision even seems to have been made to permit the drug stores to go into the ice business on Sunday for the use of the sick, as if Sunday ice were even more deleterious than Sunday whiskey.

This bill is to be introduced also in the House. It will go before Congress as the special request of a worthy body of workingmen of the District. It remains to be seen to what extent these men have been persuaded that they are not their own masters, and if they really are possessed of such a belief, to whom they owe it.
