# "Excellent" Sunday Laws.

The Christian Advocate of this city, expatiating upon the "excellent" character of Sunday law. One of the provisions of that article reads:

If any merchant, artisan, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall upon the Sabbath, or Sunday, be found engaged in any labor, (works of charity and necessity excepted,) or practicing the same to be done by his-self, excepted, on Sunday, he shall, on the conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of twenty-five cents or be punished by a fine and work previously. But the premium which the law put upon religion, to the exception, as peculiar, if one that nobody should be exempt, the distinction between however that a Justice of the Peace, in the neighboring county, sought to enforce a few years ago. This officer in his capacity as a magistrate undertook to find out and individually, of course, to earn fees, induced an improper indicting of the individual to be bothered to enter a complaint for Sunday labor because of his neighbor who were Seventh-day Adventists. The impressions upon them, but probably not seven dollars and a half since the day was long, was told that the aggregate fine would be such and such a sum, and if it should be paid to him. The warranty was expressed however in somewhat similar, and in due time the prisoners were brought before the Justice for trial.

But the Justice was so indifferent as he was attentive, and allowed it to become known that he had instigated the whole thing. The few defendants of course law opinion has arguments in a single speech that were quite as contradictory as the justifiable by these California governors. Yet they go on with these so-called arguments, and advancing these so-called reforms, and seem to feel both if the people do not at once fall in with their ideas.

The minister who spoke on the previous Sunday, and also on the district of Santa Rosa, was asked to preach, but said, "I want to preach a plain Gospel sermon." He to say two days before, but that he felt there were preachers enough to speak to thirty thousand inhabitants, with two or twelve churches, and from twelve to thirteen hundred church members, they could get forty people to come out to such a meeting. Himself. "I hope that our Congressmen, at the World's Fair Commissioners, who are so busy, will not learn anything about this Sunday whiskey.

When Christian ministers, and the Christian people of this country learns that they have no right in the world to enforce on all people any law for Sunday observance, or for any other religions act, they will have gained a great benefit to the cause they profess to serve. God has told them that "if it is not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord" that his word is to be done. Nothing in plainer in the teachings of Christ and the apostles than that Christianity is to be carried forward purely by persuasion, presenting the love of God to draw men, and never, in any instance, are individuals to be forced to its standard to observe any form of religious rule. We trust that the understanding of many more may soon be opened to this truth, so that they will learn to turn away from all religious legislation, and do all they can to advance the cause of Christ, and trust only in his almighty power.
