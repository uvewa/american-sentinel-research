REV. DR. NELSON MILLARD, of the First Presbyterian Church of Rochester, is reported by the Democrat, of that city, as saying in a recent sermon:—

"The question I propose to-day is 'Ought the State to regard itself as a religious agency?' In other words, has it any proper function in propagating distinctively religious teaching? The position that I take is that the State has no right to regard itself as an agency for furthering religious ideas. In saying this I do not wish to be understood as underrating, in the least, the inestimable importance of religion. On the contrary I take the position I do, wholly in the interest of religion. I wish religion were universally disseminated. But I do not think that the State is either the rightful, or can be the successful, agency for accomplishing this object. All Christians want religion spread far and wide, but we may honestly differ as to the proper agencies for doing it. When our lawns here in Rochester are being parched under the midsummer sun we all agree that the city needs an additional water supply, but suppose it were proposed to commit the work of securing and introducing a new water supply to the back drivers and the barbers of the city, would any one who objected to the agency proposed be rightfully considered as objecting to the water supply?

"I object, not to the diffusion of religion, but only to the employment of State agency thereof, believing that it is the proper work of those divinely instituted agencies, the family and the Church. Now I maintain that the State has no proper function for propagating religion; that its whole relationship to any and all religions is exhausted in furnishing them equal and impartial protection. Religion lies outside the province of the State. Human governments, being of men and by men, are restricted in the exercise of their functions to the relations that exist between man and his fellow-man. Religion, as distinct from morality, has to do with the relations between man and God. When, therefore, human governments undertake to exercise jurisdiction in religion they usurp the divine authority and province. They anduciously attempt to snatch the seepter from the divine hand. No human government can arrogate to itself jurisdiction in religion, unless it can show an indisputable charter and commission direct from the Most High, in which he appoints it his vicegerent on earth, and delegates to it his own authority. No government can show that.

"I therefore maintain not only that human government has no rightful jurisdiction in religion, but that it commits a heinous and blasphemous usurpation of divine authority if it attempts such jurisdiction. I also maintain that the position which I take is the only one that is scriptural. Christ deliberately, explicitly, and repeatedly pronounced divorce between the Church and State. This he did in his famous words, 'Render unto Caesar, the things that are Caesar's; and unto God, the things that are God's.' He did it again in his declaration before Pilate: 'My kingdom is not of this world,'—a declaration which, would to God, the Papacy, so avid for temporal power, would hear and heed. Christ forbade his servants to take up the sword, the emblem of temporal power for the propagation of religion, saying, 'They that take the sword shall perish by the sword.' He paid tribute to the existing civil authorities. He refused to interfere with their prerogatives by deciding a business matter between two litigants, saying, 'Who made me a judge or divider over you?' When in his temptation in the wilderness Satan offered him the temporal power over all the world, he refused the devil's gift saying, 'Get thee hence, Satan.'

"The apostles obeyed even Nero, ruling in temporal affairs, but when his government attempted to interfere with their rights of worship, and of religion, they stubbornly refused obedience, bidding Caesar not to interfere with the rights of God. I maintain still further that any and every alliance of Church and State is not 'only wrong and unscriptural' but disastrously inexpedient. Scarcely any other thing has been such a prolific source of woe as this unhallowed alliance, resulting in religious persecutions, the record of which is one of the darkest and saddest pages of the annals of history. I believe that if Christ, who wept on earth, has ever wept in heaven it has been over his Church employing the horrors of religious persecution. It is objected to the position that I have taken that religion is absolutely necessary to good citizenship; that even more than morality is it indispensable, I affirm that this assertion is directly in the teeth of the facts. There are millions of men in this land, some of whom are agnostic, some indifferent, and some unbelieving in respect to religion, who are, nevertheless, patriotic, excellent, faithful citizens, law-abiding and law-uzholding. That they lose very much of the highest good of life by not being religious I believe, but their excellent citizenship it is absurd to deny.

"Another objection made to the entire divorce of Church and State is, that it will make the State a godless institution, and we hear it often said that the schools in which religion is not inculcated are godless institutions, and are from the devil. The sophism here is in assuming that everything that is not positively good is positively bad, which is assuming that whatever is godless is ungodly; that whatever is unreligious is irreligious. It is to say that because a man has not put sugar into water and made it sweet, therefore he has put acids into it and rendered it sour, because God has not been put in the school the devil has.

"Ours, I trust, is a nation of Christians, but it is not a Christian Government. Our people are, and I trust always will be preponderantly Christian. But the Government is neither Christian nor antichristian; neither religious nor anti-religious, but merely a secular institution established to care for the relations between man and man, but not to interfere in those between man and God."
