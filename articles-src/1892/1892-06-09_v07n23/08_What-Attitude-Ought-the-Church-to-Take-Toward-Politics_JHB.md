[Paper lately read by the Rev. J. H. Bruson, before the Methodist ministers' Monday meeting, of La Crosse, Wis.]

I present this line of thought because I believe that there is a special danger at this day that men will lose faith in the gospel as the means of saving the world, at least from certain glaring sins, and look to politics to accomplish the results. The danger is that politics will be promoted to the first place, and the gospel, if used at all, retired to a subordinate place. There can be no doubt that there is a tendency in these days to substitute political machinery and lodges and societies, open and secret, for the services of the church.

Civil and religious forces are not organically related in the United States. Each pursues an independent course in its own sphere. The religious life having to do with spiritual things, has free course in all that pertains to the kingdom of heaven. The civil power, having to do with social affairs, controls in all the functions that belong to civil government.

The Jamestown type of Colonies was planted largely under the conviction that the highest functions of the English Government was to propagate the gospel. Matters went along in this way for a period, but after a while the time came for federation for purpose of protection from the warlike spirit of the Indians, the encroachment of the mother country, and for commercial advantages. Only one thing appeared possible in this federation, and that was to give the social compact solidarity on a secular basis; and preserve simply the equilibrium of the religious forces without formal action concerning them.

It will be remembered also, that the Revolution accomplished for the Colonies more than independence: it gave freedom from the established forms of Europe, both political and religious. It produced a strong opposition to English methods and ways. In November after the Declaration in July, Maryland made a declaration of rights, with a purpose to dissolve all civil relation with the church. [Virginia made her Declaration of Rights, with a like purpose, June 12, 1776.—Editor Sentinel.] In December a dissolution was affected in Virginia. The same thing occurred soon after in the Carolinas. Forty years afterward the Congregational State Church of Connecticut was abolished. And, lastly, Massachusetts cut away the last excrescence of State support of religion. In a journey of eighteen centuries, the course of religious history has made a complete circle, and for the first time since the departure, we are in the apostolic succession.

After more than a hundred years of successful history in our country, in which man's civil life has had its largest expression, and his religious life its most glorious development, we are coming on the border days which may lead to perplexing complications. There are evidences of confusion in the multitude of issues before us. The relations between the religious life and the civil life are becoming so intricate and so vital that we fail to distinguish between the purely political, and purely moral and spiritual phases of the same questions as they appear. At present there seems to be much clashing and strife.

In a prosperous civilization, one of the first evidences of weakness in the social bond is the advocacy of short and easy methods for the cure of social evils. It is seen first in a slow giving away of that strength of character which has kept the moral truth in the foreground and brought a people to prosperity.

In the youth time of a nation's life there is such a necessity that things become so; there is the mastery of the physical forces, sparse populations, lack of means of luxury and of opportunity of ease, all of which conditions are builders of the sternier elements of character. With a new people, after the governmental forms have gone beyond the period of experiment, after they have become successful in material concerns, it is usual to find the second and third generations living under the fascinating temptation that the wrinkles and frowns have all been taken out of the face of Providence, and that moral issues can be faced and settled in some other way than the old proxy way of resistance of sin, man by man, and a daily life of self-denial, man by man.

Among social agencies there is a success which is quickly gained, but it is not worth what it costs. Superficial means only reach superficial ends. Immediate outside results regardless of consequences, are not satisfactory. Deliverance from social ills through the machinery of the law rather than by growth of character, is an impatient haste.

Civil and statutory regulation may fence about and lessen in some measure the opportunities and temptations, but the shutting off of these do not make men. We must have men before we can have desirable outside conditions. Men are not made by outside statutes, but by such social forces as in themselves build character. Is there any record of a lecherous man having been made chaste and virtuous by statute laws forbidding adultery and kindred sins? Human society may be protected by such laws, and thereby a good accomplished; but no one expects to banish licentiousness in this way. This vice can be cured only by something that shall purify the very springs of life.

Here is a strange fact which each one may interpret to his own liking. The sins that human legislation has most concerned itself with, are the sins that have been the least thoroughly eradicated in the lives of professed Christians. We have stringent laws touching licentiousness, Sabbath-breaking, dishonesty, and drunkenness; and now can we find four other sins, which the laws of the State have not tried to restrict, that have become so prevalent, and that have given the Church so much trouble? It looks on the surface of things as though human legislation was not helping Christianity very much in saving the world from these sins.

Reform by statutory enactments has three fatal weaknesses which must not be overlooked.

1. It attacks one sin at a time. But the divine method seems to be to save man from all his sins.

2. The statutory method of reforming men is faulty in that it makes use of compulsion rather than persuasion. Can human governments compel men to be virtuous when God does not think it wise to do so? We have the highest authority for saying that "they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." It looks very much as though the violent methods sometimes employed by Christians in these days were awakening the wrath of the ungodly and uniting them in a solid phalanx against all moral reform. The Church has invoked political power, and the ballots of the unregenerate have, in many instances, buried politico-moral measures out of sight.

3. Moral reform by political legislation is only a continuation of the multiplied efforts that have been made in all ages to save men from sin by human instrumentalities; but that such efforts, while praiseworthy, will come short of the mark, the history of the past compels us to believe. All heathen religions have vainly tried to save men from sin by human appliances; and modern reform agencies that ignore the gospel are doomed to like failure. The moral sentiment of irreligious people is extremely superficial and unreliable. They may be induced to vote for no-license one year, but if it be found that their taxes are increased a few cents thereby, they will wipe out all these reform measures at the polls the next year. They may be persuaded to keep the Sabbath for appearance's sake, but grain exposed to a coming thunder shower will be sufficient to convert them into Sabbath-breakers. But when a man is thoroughly saved from his sins by divine power, the question of moral reform for him is very easily settled. When there is a sweeping revival of religion in town, the sale of liquor, Sabbath-breaking, profanity, and other evils are correspondingly reduced.

From these facts I am led to believe that our work as Christians is in the religious, and not in the political fields. The gospel deals with the individual.
