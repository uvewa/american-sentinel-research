The law under which the Law and Order Society of Allegheny County pursues a special act passed in 1855 for Allegheny County alone. The 3d section of the law of 1794 is a fine of four dollars. That was found insufficient for the high-toned lawbreakers of that county; probably there was also trouble with some liquor dealers, for the act specially applies to them, and by its features a demand was made on the Legislature in 1855 for a more stringent Sunday law. The rest of the State, however, probably had troubles enough of their own and its indolence finally compensated the matter by passing a special enactment for Allegheny County. This act, after increasing the penalties for Sunday liquor selling, provides that:—

Any person violating the provisions of the first section of said and for the suppression of vice and immorality, or of any of the laws relating, and to enforce the criminal laws of this State. On Jan. 23, 1894, within the county of Allegheny, being on a Sunday convicted thereof, and to pay the same,

impose justice of the peace or alderman, shall upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay, with costs, and in default of payment, or of goods or chattels to satisfy the same and costs, shall be confined in the county prison not less than ten nor more than thirty days.

On this section the Pittsburg *Dispatch* remarks that:—

Not having any attorney on its advisory board, and not having thought of the propriety of taking the opinion of a legal authority to determine what "unlawful pursuit" means, the society has gone on to do with the complaint and delivery of the laws and thereby a result which has produced several results which conflict with the "suppression of vice or immorality."

Nevertheless, this in the section under which all violators of the Sunday law in Pittsburg are fined twenty-five dollars, or confined in the county prison for selling merely a bottle of whisky, or of beer, by a man at a soda fountain, or a street vendor of a single newspaper, or a glass of lemonade.
