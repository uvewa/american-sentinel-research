NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

At the Illinois district meeting of the Association held at Springfield, Ill., a resolution was adopted declaring in favor of opening the World's Fair on Sunday. These Prohibitionists are looking for us to work in favor with the National Reformers, the American Sabbath Unionists and all their following, through which to hold the balance of political power and control legislation, State and national.

A REPORT from the Postmaster General in session at Pittsburg, says earnestly:—

The United Presbyterian General Assembly have passed resolutions asking the entire membership of America as unthristian, unpatriotic, and a disgrace to a Christian nation.

The Frenchist's argument to reach a full stop at any particular line of church or State is merely a matter of position and should be expressed. "The most significant thing is the decision and legislative action for the Sunday closing, a valid caution for enforcing the recognition of the religious character in the political religion of our people."

This touches the key note of the political religion of which Justice Brewer's decision in the legal expression.

And this, from the *Mail and Express*, cuts the matter to the core, when speaking of the matter of closing the World's Fair on Sunday:—

"Added Endorsements."—"The spectacle of a handful of Chicago speculators, sustained by a few breweries, opposing their sordid interest to the united petition of the American people, must make every patriotic preference; he differs with them as is a Christian. In the name of every decent citizen he insists that Sunday's inherent rest divinely on the Church and upon the Government to see to it that every citizen of the Country shall enjoy a day of rest per week, even the outline of this Nation's dealing with the question."

This movement for Sunday closing of the World's Fair is attracting attention in France. A Protestant clergyman in Paris is quoted in the local press as saying:—

"The theological grounds, I do not think that opposition can be made to opening of exhibitions in the Fair Park on Sunday, and I don't believe Congress can afford to do it under the circumstances. If the majority of legal citizens are Christian or non-sectarian, this majority must rule. The right to secure the colonists their rights, but we respect speaking as a European, who has studied both sides the European institution of opening on Sunday the working classes, free from labor, can be seen in any art gallery there. It has done them immense good."

We deprecate any anticipation of the matter. Herewith is also stocked with reproaches.

A correspondent of the *Voice*, writing from the Columbian Exposition, asks that the national Congress, when asked should protect Sunday from desecration, "As a day of rest, the unlearned rest of the laboring people should be protected from desecration." "As it is not recognized by many all of America. It is not recognized by many as a religious institution, but by the great majority of all America."

Mr. A. R. French, of Clyde, Ohio, says:—

It is not recognized by many as religious institution only. It is recognized by the W.C.T.U., the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. It is estimated that New York spends $5,000,000 on Sunday in amusement and recreation. Chicago spends $3,000,000, and have invested in trade $37,247,000. When Philadelphia opens her libraries and museums the attendance will be increased to many millions. Moreover, we may safely say that our Fair should be opened freely to all without any distinction of class, or creed, or of any particular religious sanctity. To establish that should not be. To do otherwise would be to involve a voluntary regret the day or manner.

If the day was regarded half as highly as some people would have us suppose, those would be so few troubles that the question of closing the Fair. The fact that an attempt is trying to compel the congregation by the above a regard for Sunday which is not felt, is needed, to be felt, is useless to be legislated. The mere matter of the credit or criticise for the moral effect it would have on foreigners.

In answering the assertion that "Sunday should be protected from desecration," "as a religious institution, day of rest," etc., Mr A. R. French, of Clyde, Ohio, says:—

It would seem from this Amended First Article, that the Federation of Labor proposes to stand directly for the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, without reference to the principle of non-interference, which is the only sound basis for religious liberty.

It is, it does not follow that, although the *Gosport* circular is as represented, it does logically follow that although this representation is just, that Mr. Gomper would not advocate the Church and would come short of all the laws of Sunday-opening legislation.

THE United States has by no means a monopoly on Sunday-closing agitation; the fact being shown by the following cable to the New York *Herald* from Rome: "The Archbishop of Catania had a heated discussion to-day, lasting three hours, over the question of opening the Columbian Art Gallery on Sundays. Numerous petitions for such a result have been received from women's societies, and various other sources, while the protested that the proposed change was un-American from other quarters in great numbers. At to-day's meeting, when a vote was reached on Sunday, the ballot resulted in a tie vote; but this circumstance as to furnish a surprising proof of the progress of the movement for the entire abolishment of political and religious bigotry. The strong vote in the General Assembly, for opening that the action of the Archbishop of Canterbury in asking the municipal authorities to close Sunday of a picture gallery in the Whitechapel district, is coupled by papers here with the fact that the Bishop of Rochester is advocating the opening of museums and galleries to the public on the Sabbath. They agreed that a course of action which is clearly absurd on one side of the Atlantic as times could not be far wrong."

The Seventh-day Baptists of the United States have entered the following earnest protest against legislation by Congress in reference to Sunday at the World's Fair. The memorial has been into to both houses of Congress, and copies sent to each member individually:—

MEMORIAL AGAINST NATIONAL SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

In view of the fact that your honorable body is considering the question of compelling or not compelling the closing of the World's Columbian Exposition on Sundays by national law; and because there is now before Congress a National Sunday Law bill, under the title of a bill having the purpose of enforcing only "the Civil Sabbath." Therefore we, the Seventh-day Baptists of the United States, who are Seventh-day Christians, earnestly protest: We do well know that this memorial, we earnestly body do not thus enter upon the work of legislation

concerning religious questions. Your petitions we believe that such a law would, to its fullest extent, be a violation of the fundamental principle of Church and State, upon which the supporters of the National Constitution founded by our fathers rest. In the report to open a similar consideration shall not be engaged in church or religious exercises on Sunday. We ask your careful consideration of the following facts, which have a direct bearing on the subject:—

1. "If the principle is once established that the Legislature has the authority to appoint time for religious exercises, they may authorize religious tests."

In the corresponding report, also by Mr. Bassett, of the Twenty-first Congress, first session, upon the same subject, we find the following:—

2. "Congress shall by authority of law set aside for any portion of the people of these United States any particular day for rest or for religious exercises."

3. "We consider it a duty to resist every effort, even Christian efforts at any form of national or State legislation which may be adopted, especially of laws which will enforce any sort of religion or even voluntary, demands even religious recognition at this time, as contrary to the spirit of the Constitution."

We urge our prayer in the name of religious liberty: we protest against national legislation to enforce Sunday observance.

In behalf of the Seventh-day Baptists of the United States, presented by the committee on this matter.
