IN answering the assertion that "Sunday is the sacred day of America, and should be protected from desecration," by closing the World's Fair on that day, Mr. A. B. French, of Clyde, Ohio, says:—

The first day of the week is not the sacred day of all America. It is not so recognized by many, whose religious zeal is no less fervent than that of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. It is estimated that in New York City alone there are 250,000 Jews, who own real estate to the value of $209,000,000, and have invested in trade $27,388,000, yet it is not their sacred day. Nor is it the sacred day of the Seventh-day Adventists and many others. Moreover, we may safely say that in defiance of all statutes, three-fourths of the citizens of the Republic do not regard the day with any particular religious sanctity. To abstain from trade and labor in compliance with a statute is no evidence they regard the day as sacred.

If the day was regarded half as highly as some people would have us suppose, there would be no trouble about the question of closing the Fair. The fact is that a minority is trying to compel the majority to show a regard for Sunday which they do not feel, in short to be hypocrites for the moral effect it would have on foreigners!
