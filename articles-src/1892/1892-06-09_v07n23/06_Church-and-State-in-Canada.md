To the student of history and of politics the Province of Quebec, in the Dominion of Canada, furnishes a modern object lesson in the re-adoption of the process of an established institution: Church in the life of the State, to develop its ecclesiastical political functions in the development of its spiritual designs unchanged, as well as to all the means and ends employed for promoting and controlling the political action of the submissive. The Vaticanism within American States furnishes such an example of complete spiritual unity, which is the synonym of national unity.

By the census of 1881, the population of the Province was 1,359,027; of this number, the Roman Catholic claimed 1,170,718, and then contributed all other sects nearly a million. Of the smaller population

of the Dominion, 4,324,810, nearly two million belonged to Protestant communities. With such a preponderance of Catholic population, we can see the religious situation in Quebec, and be able to direct and control legislation in the Province. It is said that the Roman Catholic Church in the Dominion of Ontario, as well as in some, if not all, of the neighboring provinces. The facts are (1) that temporal power is best indicated by what is claims to have accomplished in legislation as the most important factor in the conservative and loyal element.

Among the measures in which the particular pride are: (1) The new standard of the system of education in the Province of Quebec is controlled by the hierarchy. The bounty of the State is bestowed upon religious institutions and upon religious orders from abroad, as nowhere else in Canada and other countries. (2) The law authorizes the civil erection of parishes as well as civil corporations having a legal existence, in which the civil influence of the citizen is controlled by Church and State. (3) There are exemptions, ecclesiastical and educational, exemption of religious and educational corporations from taxation, provincial and municipal. Said property in the Province of Quebec as supposed to be the annual value of over a million of dollars, is put under the immediate control of a religious corporation, namely, the Roman Church, and which was obtained by their control.

This, with the law establishing in Canada's Province of Quebec, has simply brought backward towards the days of religious vassalage. And the religious organization has fully dug since cast off, including large amounts of money out of public coffers, going to any religious body. In complete thus, the ultramontane party in the Catholic Church in the Province, passed in 1888, giving to the Jesuits the sum of $400,000 as a national trust for their maintenance by the British Government, of which any bills would pass only to maintain the standing from the old treasury; and the Archbishop would be able to satisfy the opposition.

These indications of what has been done is quoted by Goldwin Smith as "a rampart against Protestant ascendancy," and likewise by the endowment, out of a public fund, of the seminary of St. Sulpice, and the restoration of Protestantism, and the assemblages in acceptance of the Pope as the successor of St. Peter, and the recognition of the absolute authority of his successors in the running of a strictly religious history, dating the Dominion Parliament by the Province of Quebec's endowment of religious or charitable purposes, such associations being in the enjoyment of the most ample civil law of the Dominion. But these are facts that are worthy of attention in this Imperial. With the consent of Great Britain, the Act of 1867, which is consistent with her language and law (the Code Napoleon being the civil law of the Province), has as her own arrangements; the former still in practice; with a full rather larger measure of the still richer and still.

Among the most significant features within this educational legislation, what is the most intolerant of the hierarchical claims. The Church gets control of the school fund. The effect of this division of the school fund is that considerable racial prejudices and interesting necessary, has been for a long time an evil and indirectly moral feeling, and sectarian causes them the way in the present condition. The division of the school fund in its entering wedge of social disintegration.

Ultramontanism is in the ascendant.
