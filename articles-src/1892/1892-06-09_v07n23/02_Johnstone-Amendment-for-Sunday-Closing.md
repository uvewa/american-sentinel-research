ON May 25, the House of Representatives being in Committee of the Whole, with Mr. Lester, of Georgia, in the Chair, and having under consideration the sundry civil appropriation bill and especially the items in reference to the Government exhibit at the coming World's Fair, salaries of the United States Commissioners, Lady Managers, etc., Mr. Johnstone, of South Carolina, with the fact in view that the House had, on the second day preceding, voted that Sunday was the Sabbath, offered an amendment to the bill appropriating funds for the Government exhibit, which read as follows:—

Provided, That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday.

The House of Representatives having in due form created a Sabbath for itself, and having decided to begin its legal enforcement in the District of Columbia, naturally objects to the desecration of the day in Chicago which it has declared holy, and to be kept holy in Washington.
