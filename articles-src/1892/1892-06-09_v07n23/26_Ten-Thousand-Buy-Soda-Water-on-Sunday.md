THE Pittsburg Dispatch publishes, under the display head, "Sunday Soda Water Sold to Ten Thousand Persons in a Market Street Drug Store," this article, which is very suggestive of the intensity which this controversy is already attaining, even from a point of view measurably outside of its religious aspect:—

"Ten thousand people slaked their Sunday thirst at a Market Street drug store yesterday, and Law and Order Agent McClure was powerless to punish them or the plucky dealer. The proprietor William T. Espy, did not shut off the soda-water fountain, nor the cigar cases, at midnight on Saturday, as has been the custom, and never a moment from that time until Sunday midnight was the clerk behind the counter idle.

"During the early Sunday hours there was a continual coming and going of the thirsty ones, and after nine o'clock, when the people began to turn out to the churches and elsewhere, it became necessary to increase the force of clerks to five men, including the cashier. Mr. Espy himself. From that time until after midnight the store was continually crowded. Several barrels of soda water, and many boxes of cigars were sold, besides the regular sale of drugs permitted by the Blue Laws. People of all classes of society were among the thirsty patrons, and as he had announced through the newspapers and by large placards on the store windows that he was selling, people went squares out of their way to show by their presence the support they were willing to give. Business and professional men of all branches seemed happy to avail themselves of the opportunity to slake their thirst on Sunday, and at least a dozen preachers were among the crowd that thronged the store during the day. At times the crowd was so great that the capacity of the store was taxed to hold them, and well-known business men of high standing were observed waiting for from ten to fifteen minutes to be served.

"In order to prevent a vexatious suit by the highly moral young men who go around for the Law and Order Society, a friend of Mr. Espy's went before a down-town alderman at midnight and entered a suit against him for violating the Blue Laws by selling soda water, cigars and other prohibited articles on Sunday. The suit was entered and notice served inside of five minutes after the clock had turned the hour of midnight. By this the Law and Order Society is out off from any of the fines and costs they so dearly love to rake in, as only one suit can be entered for the violations of one day.

"Mr. Espy last night said: 'I do not defy the Law and Order Society. I appreciate the necessity of giving the people some refreshment on Sunday. The fact that ten thousand people patronized my place to-day shows that such a place is a necessity, and I have been assured by hundreds of the best men in the city to-day of their entire support. So long as my receipts are as large as they were to-day I will continue to sell and pay my fine regularly, and if any pressure is brought against me I have money enough to take the case to the Supreme Court.'"
