The following editorial is from the *Sunday-School Teacher*, for May. It correctly represents the logical result of governmental action in closing the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, not for our own Union, but that it has crossed the lines and made the demands of the domain of the Dominion.

A request from the Ontario Sabbath School Association, consisting of officers of the various Sunday-schools of all denominations in the Province, has come to the Dominion of Canada, at Ottawa, to urge that the "Lord's Day" be not desecrated at the World's Fair. On Feb. 1, 1892, he established that the gates be closed on Sunday, and after a respectful letter from a committee of the Department of State, department be closed; and after a respectful hearing that Canada will exhibit at the World's Fair. And also will enter a respectful protest against any display on Sunday, and especially the running of railway trains, the Dominion having a close contiguity to and easy border. No doubt the Fair will especially prove that Christianity, and profess Christianity, and they have a considerable exhibit, in which the United States of America, as a Christian Nation, can not afford to indulge in practices contrary to, "The Discovery of this Exposition will close the eyes of the world to the claims of Christian sentiment, if these open Sunday doors and desecration are said to be right."

This passion is a profound and natural. Where will this crave for governmental recognition of religious conviction end?
