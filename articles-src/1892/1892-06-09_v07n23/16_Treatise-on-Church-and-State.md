TREATISE on another paper of this subject, "Church and State," is an essential element in a union of Church and State is formal action requiring recognition of the State or the Church. This is not true in Quebec, yet in the language of Mr. Brewer, "The Government of Quebec is as clearly a hierarchy as was that of Rome during the temporal power of the Pope, or as the Government of Massachusetts during the early half century." The reason of this is that while there has been no formal action making Romanism the State religion, it so completely dominates the Government as to amount to the same thing.
