THE following "special" from Racine, Wis., is an evidence of the activity which is everywhere being infused into the "Sunday-law war" by the recent utterances of court and Congress at Washington.

"The Citizens' League was victorious in its first case against the baseball players to-day. Peter Herman, catcher for the Racines, was found guilty and paid a nominal fine. Mayor Case was the first witness. The district attorney asked him if he was present at the ball game last Sunday. The Mayor refused to answer, for the reason that it might have a tendency to criminate himself. The justice said that he might answer, but he still refused, when the district attorney asked that he be committed to jail for contempt. Then Mayor Case left the court room, but was soon brought back by the sheriff and answered some questions that would in no wise criminate him. Two detectives employed by the Citizens' League from the Illinois Detective Agency, then testified that they had been present at the game and had secured the names of the players.

The other ball-players under arrest will plead guilty and pay their fines in the morning. After the trial the detectives were insulted on the street and threatened with violence, and are now under the protection of the officers. It is also learned that the detectives visited saloons last Sunday and that several arrests will follow in a few days.

"The Sunday-observance law war is expected to be more exciting than last summer, as outdoor sports and picnics will be strictly prohibited within the city limits on the Sabbath day."
