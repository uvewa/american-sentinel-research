[*Paper read before the Methodist ministers' Monday Meeting, of Hoboken, N. J., by Rev. H. H. Brandt.*]

I REMARK this line of thought because I believe that there is a special danger at this day that men will lose faith in the gospel as the means of saving the world, at least from certain glaring sins, and look to politics to accomplish the results. The danger is that politics will be permitted to the first place, and the gospel is used of

all, retired to a subordinate place. There is no doubt that there is a tendency abroad in these days to substitute political machinery as a means of moral reform; to resort, in short, to the political machine expert, for the services of the church.

Now religion and politics are very closely related in the United States. Each pursues an independent course in its own sphere. The religious life having to do with spiritual things, has free course over all that pertains to the kingdom of heaven. The civil power, having to do with social affairs, controls in all the functions that belong to civil government.

The Jamestown type of Colonies was started largely under the conviction that the highest functions of the English Government was to propagate the gospel abroad. There may have been some selfishness at first, but after a while the time came when the love of gain seemed to prevail, from the warlike spirit of the Indians, the settlements were maintained chiefly for and commercial advantages. Only now and again a prayer would be held; ambition to do its commercial duty rapidly became dominant, and this was to give the social compact its solidity or constitution, so that laws were merely to supply the equilibrium of the relations of the people.

It must be remembered also, that the Revolution accomplished for the Colonies more than independence; it gave freedom and wider range and scope to intellectual, both political and religious. It produced new constitutional forms, bills of rights, and ways. In November after the Declaration of Independence was published, a system of rights, with a purpose to dissolve all civil relations with the church. (Virginia made her Declaration of Rights, on the 12th of June in August, 1776.)

In Savannah! In December a constitution was formed. And soon after the Georgia constitution soon after it the Connecticut and New York States followed, and still others followed. And, lastly, Massachusetts sent their constitution ten years afterward. But all of religion. In a journey of eight hundred years from Pope Hildebrand, history has made a complete circle, and for a second time a Pope becomes a power in the apostolic succession.

After more than a hundred years of successful history in our country, in which men are led by this fact to believe that Christianity has a natural connection with its Government, and his religious life is the most glorious development, we are coming at the close of the century to a curious and difficult complication. These are evidences of complication in the relation of church to State. The relation between the religious and the civil functions, or what is equally important, between the purely political and trivialities are so vital that we fail to distinguish between the purely politics, and purely moral and spiritual phases of the great questions of the day. In fact, there is at present there seems to be much clashing and confusion.

In a prosperous civilization, one of the first evidences of weakness in the national bond is the advocacy of short and easy methods for the cure of social evils. A weakened moral tone, a lowered standard of strength of character which has kept the nation in prosperity, a willingness to trust a people to its prosperity.

In the youth fixed a nation's life there is such a necessity that things become secure, in the manner of the physical forces, a sparse population; lack of means of luxury and opportunity of ease, all contribute to the building up of strong character. In the course of ages, of which conditions are builders of character elements. Deliberateness still

saves men from sin by human appliances; that a church or a ministry satisfied with the gospel are doomed to idle failures. The first impressions of the enterprise are extremely superficial and unreliable. They had waited for ten or even twenty years, but if it be found that their taxes are increased a few cents thereby, they will wipe out all these reforms material on at the polls the next year. They may be persuaded to keep the Sabbath for appearance's sake, but gossip has forced a coming thunder shower will be sufficient to convert them into Sabbath breakers.

But when a man is thoroughly saved from his sins by divine power, the question of right is settled in his heart forever. When there is a sweeping revival of religion going on there will be found no hash-breaking, profanity, and other vile deeds. From these facts I am led to believe that the mission of the Christian is in the religious, and not in the political, fields. The gospel of Christ is always in season.

new people, after the governmental forms gave stability to the period of expansion, the second and third generation living more at their ease, in the fruitfulness, after they have become surrounded by newer society. Wrinkles and furrows have all been taken out of the face of Providence, and that moral issues can be faced and settled in a manner that then saved this prospect for themselves of sin, may by man, and a daily life of meddling, by man.

Among social agencies there is an enormous wealth to be proudly guarded. It is not in the world what it costs. Superficial means which only occasionally a thought could be given to needs resultant from its evils and consequences. The people and the governments of these communities, Deliberateness still disintegrated from evil spirit, are led to new life rather than by growth of religion.

Now, church and statutory regulation may appear to help and sustain one another to some extent, ... and these considerations of opportunities and temptations, that the strength of these do not make men. We must have time before we can have much right to guard the morals of the land. Restrictions to personal liberty, when made by outside statutes, but by each making his own restrictions within his character. In there any record of a saloonkeeper being more than a man at heart has reformed because of a change in the statute on our statute laws forbidding adultery and theft in Illinois society may have a very good history. But I think Horace may say a good thing accomplished; but no one expects a statute against adultery or theft to make men pure and honest of themselves. This vice can be cured only by something that goes deeper than political legislation. Here is a strange fact which will bear repeating. It is stated that human legislation that most concerned has that human legislation has most concerned itself with the personal habits of the people, most thoroughly embittered in the lives of the people by the interference.

Now look at the list of subjects of moral laws touching Intemperance, Sabbathkeeping, lotteries, dishonesty, and drunkenness; there is one outstanding fact that the laws of the State have not tried to do anything for the people, but the measures that have given the Church so much trouble. The state has been careful to see that through legislation was not helping the church. After a hundred years of history the results are in—religion is saved from the world! From this we can easily draw the lesson.

Now history, by statutory enactments has covered its first fatal weaknesses which must not be repaired.

1. It attracts men at its side, as if it needs the political method to save the world. The alliance is degrading and weakening.

2. The statutory method of reforming men from sin is superficial. It leads to a mere polishing rather than purification. Can history produce a single community redeemed and regenerated from sin by human legislation? Only when God does not think it was so low that there was no hope. Reason for saying that "they that take the sword shall perish by the sword." Our churches to-day very much as though the violent methods of political reform were the best, these days were awakening the sinning, wraith of the taxpayer and melting them in the crucible of debate against all the reforms and good causes; shall we not fear that the Church has invoked political power, and made herself responsible? Have we not in many instances, hurled politico-moral questions into politics which belong to the church?

3. Moral reform by political legislation is only a confession of the inefficient methods of that have been made in all ages to save men from sin by human instrumentality; but should effects and their probable causes be thought upon this fully, the history of the past compels us to believe.
