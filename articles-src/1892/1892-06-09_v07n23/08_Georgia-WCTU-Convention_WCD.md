The Georgia State Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has just closed a five days' session at Milledgeville, Ga. The Georgia Division of the tenth annual convention, "was the most delightful and interesting session held." However this may be, from the resolutions which were framed and adopted during the session, it is certain that the Georgia Woman's Christian Temperance Union is in understanding about everything worth her for which the society was formed.

This is one of the resolutions which the society adopted at its meeting May 14:—

*Resolved*, That the department of Sabbath observance petition Congress to close the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, and that our superintendent write to the proper officers of the Union of the Columbian Exposition on this subject.

It will be noticed that this resolution does not ask that Congress take this time to "demand" Sunday closing in words the less, but in spirit it is the same.

Their next resolution read:—

*Resolved*, That the department of Sabbath observance be recommended to revise and revive and their work be enforced by systematic study.

The convention to go to work at it.

W. C. DALBEY.

*Lock, Ga.*
