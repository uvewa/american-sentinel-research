The House of Representatives, in Committee assembled, on May 13, upon a division being taken, decided by deliberate vote that the day of the week commonly known as Sunday is the Sabbath. Incidentally, in connection with this, it was ordered that no ice should be sold or delivered in the District of Columbia, upon the Sabbath which the House of Representatives had created or distinctively and legislatively the United States Sabbath, except within certain specified hours.

On May 19, the House of Representatives, in Committee of the Whole, with Mr. Lester, of Georgia, in the Chair, and having under consideration the sundry civil appropriation bill and especially the items in reference to the Governmental exhibit at the coming World's Fair, action of the United States Commissioners, Lady Managers, etc., Mr. Johnston, of South Carolina, with his face in view that the House, on the previous Friday morning, voted that Sunday was the Sabbath, offered an amendment to the bill making certain grants for the Government exhibit, which read as follows:—

*Provided*, That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Exposition shall be closed to visitors on Sunday.

The House of Representatives having from its own motion set a Sabbath for itself, and having decided to begin its legal enforcement in the District of Columbia, naturally objects to the desecration of the day in Chicago which it has established holy, to aid to help it to accomplish this elegant work of legislation.

The presentation of this amendment created such a scene in the House as was not equalled by the wildest moments of excitement in the contest over the silver bill. A correspondent who has been present in the House nearly every day during this session, writes, "I have never seen such confusion as it produced." The proceedings, as published in the *Congressional Record*, show that the members crowded the aisles and the area around the Speaker's desk, and the tumult was such that the Chairman was obliged to suspend proceedings and demand order before gentlemen addressing the Chair could be heard. When the devil would destroy he first makes mad seemed to be exemplified on the floor of the House; for there were occasional flashes of reason, sense, and sanity, noticeable, as for example, the following urged by Mr. Culberson, of Texas, Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. Culberson said:—

Let me ask whether this whole subject is not regulated by the laws of the State of Illinois?

Mr. JOHNSTON, of South Carolina. I am aware, as the gentleman has stated, that the act of the legislature of the State of Illinois does provide that no exhibition shall be open on Sunday in Illinois; but what harm can there be in the American Congress signifying by this amendment its disapprobation of the laws of the State of Illinois?

Mr. CULBERSON, from his place as Chairman, further observed:—

I have just been informed that there is such a law.

Mr. CHAIRMAN. I do not understand that this is a question of moral conduct. It is a question to enact and regulate the conduct of an Illinois corporation.

Mr. JOHNSTON, of South Carolina. That is so. But why has the Congress been requisite a right to withhold its aid from the Illinois corporation unless that corporation is willing to accept its terms?

The calm and correct legal sense of a sound jurist in a strong contrast however with the frivolous appeal and shallow fallacy of the zealot pleading for the establishment of a religious test of Congress.

Mr. JOHNSTON asks, "What harm can there be in the American Congress signifying by this amendment its approbation of the laws of the State of Illinois?" Certainly that is a proper question. What harm? By the First Amendment to the Constitution, Congress is prohibited from making any law towards an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Shall Congress approve in the State of Illinois of that interference with religion which is prohibited to Congress? Shall Congress force upon Illinois the revival and application of laws which are contrary to the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State itself, which says that no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship?

But it may be Mr. Culberson realized that the previous action of the House in deciding that Sunday was the Sabbath, and forbidding ice to be sold on that day, had estopped them to be so bold that they had estopped him from making that plea.

Perhaps Mr. Johnston comprehended that the First Amendment according to the latest action of Congress only means—

"Congress may make laws respecting an establishment of religion, *etc.*, and may require obedience to religious laws on the part of the several States."

Another instance of sound views, and a willingness to express them, was given by Mr. Eikles, of Cass City, who said:—

Mr. Chairman, I hope that this amendment will not prevail. I am not willing that this body should commit this Congress to a line of policy which would be violative of the principles that have always been recognized in the Illinois Corporation in the act of incorporation.

They have done absolutely nothing to indicate that they will in any point disregard the laws of the State of Illinois or of the United States; and in case they do not violate any strictly mandatory law in Illinois, and it is barely possible that the law, so-called, requiring close on Sundays, has under the law of that State, while in the present session of this Congress, would have served the necessities in this connection for discussion on a matter with which we have nothing to do as a Nation or as a State. It is dragging into the subject the question of a Sabbath, which I do not wish to consider, and I hope it will not be entertained.

At the close of Mr. Eikles's remarks an amendment was offered, providing for Sunday closing of the Fair, which was only cries of "Vote!" "Vote!" and "Mr. Chairman," and in this chaos Mr. Morse tried a strenuous attempt to shut off further discussion.

Everybody understands this question. Every man has thought about it and every man has made up his mind and knows how to vote. There make up my mind how fast this House is to spend in this reckless and random debate.

If it is true, as Mr. Holman says, that all congressmen understand this question, it is surprising how many made such varied words contrary to their convictions.

But Mr. Holman found that the question would not go down, and Mr. Hooker, of Mississippi, offered an amendment, in these words:—

*Provided*, That in no event shall the exhibit be open on Sunday, where the same is prohibited by law.

Mr. Johnston objected to this because Mr. Hooker's amendment would destroy his own, which was designed to make the Exposition close on Sunday, although the complaint was,

That the appropriation of money of the American people should not be expended at all unless the people on the other side of the question should agree.

Mr. Hooker expressed himself as concurring with Mr. Johnstone in the idea that the Fair should be closed, but that it should be modified so as to leave it wholly a matter of law in the hands of the country, on the part of the Congress of the United States, to say whether a people should be permitted to have it open contrary to the laws of the State and saying further:—

Mr. Johnston observed that the two amendments referred to the same thing, namely:—

*Provided*, That the Columbian World's Fair Exhibition shall be closed on Sunday. *Provided also*, That the local board shall provide that all the concessions granted shall be operated on the same day.

Mr. Johnston continued to urge the adoption of his amendment and was interrupted by Mr. Durborow, who said:—

Suppose that we should declare that this Exposition should be closed on Sunday. On the other hand the law of Illinois says that it shall not be opened on Sunday; but, if it were opened, the friends of the Sunday convention, if they had the evidence, could take it before a court and the religious credit for some action would all go to them.

[Laughter.]

Mr. HAINER, of South Carolina. I do not give my vote on this.

Mr. JOHNSTON, of South Carolina. Conditions.

There followed a scene of great disorder and intense excitement which was not equalled until the Committee was for a purpose of limiting debate; the Speaker rearmed the Chair and called upon the Sergeant-at-Arms to request members to take their seats and maintain order.

After a motion to adjourn was lost, consideration was resumed by the committee of the whole House on the State of the Union with Mr. Lester, in the Chair; consideration of the same question with a limitation of five minutes to each speech. Mr. Breckinridge of Georgia still in the Chair.

Mr. William A. Stone, of Pennsylvania, offered a substitute, which read:—

That before any money appropriated by the Government is paid, the managers of the Columbian World's Exposition must pass a resolution, or the Treasury a resolution, or agreement to close the Fair on Sunday.

Mr. Patterson, of Ohio, then obtained the floor, and said:—

It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that there has not been any real or earnest consideration of this question. The United States is a peculiar country, different from any others on the face of the earth. It is known as the American Sentinel. It is the only Government among all the civilized nations of the world, but the fourth or fifth, ever as undertaking to publish to the world the American Sabbath. To us the Sabbath day stands as the sabbath of every creed that is alive, of every religious sect in the world. Religion, in the correct sense of every State Constitution that I know anything about, is recognized as the spirit permeating every article of the Constitution and of the laws. Sunday, or the Sabbath day, is recognized and is beloved and held in the hearts of the American people as was the 4th of July or any other commemorative day; and the sentiment of the American people, in all sections of the country, where we declare in this the grandest country the sun shines upon, and that the World's Fair shall not be open to the public on the American Sabbath. What on earth have we to do, as the great American Congress, to have to do with these people who have Saturday for their Sabbath and keep their worship on their own, and while they venerate the religious idea of another day they cannot ask this Congress to legislate for them.

Mr. MORSE, of Illinois. But their constituents compose a large constituency of the people of Illinois.

Mr. HAINES, of Illinois. But their constituents who want the doors to be closed on Sunday compose a still larger constituency of the people of Illinois.

This cavalcade are the different objects, often a trend, objections that are founded in reason and a just conception of the limits of congressional action; and yet between the lines of Mr. Patterson's remarks, Mr. Holman says these men all understand the question; but every man has already made upon it in his own minds. Considering that last part of his assertion the best.

Mr. PAYNER, of Kentucky, then offers as an amendment to the substitute of Mr. Stone, the following:—

That none of these buildings or constructions, constituting the Government exhibit, shall be in operation on Sunday.

This amendment was voted upon and rejected. Without division then, without anything further, the Committee arose reported that no conclusion had been reached.

Thus closed, for that day, the most remarkable discussion of a religious question in the Congress of the United States, but to be renewed with still further remarkable features, as the readers of the SENTINEL have already learned from the reprints from the *Congressional Record*.

On the next day, May 20, the House being again in the committee of the Whole, with Mr. Lester, of Georgia, in the Chair, a long and unsuccessful effort was made to postpone the decision of the Sunday-closing question until the remainder of the bill had been considered and passed. There was a repetition of the disturbance of the previous day. Mr. Serel offered an amendment to provide against Sunday opening, which was before the House, reading as follows:—

All buildings containing the exhibit under the control of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday, and an intoxicating liquor shall at any time be sold within the grounds.

This was rejected. Great confusion ensued, in the course of which Mr. Serel,

moved that each member "be allowed an opportunity to record his vote" "on this subject." This, it was impossible to grant, the question having been settled. If, however, it would have succeeded, it would probably still give practically a big majority for a majority of the members in the House being in a state not unlike assemblage places which the statutes of all States describe as "disorderly."

The confusion and disorder increased rather than diminished. Mr. Durborow moved that the House consider all the business until order was restored. The Chairman then read the full text of the resolution and amendment before the House, as follows:—

*Resolved*, That upon proper application being made to the managers of the Columbian Exposition, the Secretary of the Treasury shall order the Treasury a resolution and agreement to close the exhibit on Sunday.

*Provided*, That the amount shall not be available until the Board of Managers shall have made a satisfactory agreement with the World's Columbian Commission to close the Fair on the grounds of said Exposition.

This being put to vote, was carried, on a division, ayes 127, noes not counted; and on a second vote, ayes 148, noes 36.

Mr. Dockrey, of Missouri, then offered, as a substitute for the amendment as offered by Mr. Johnston, this proviso:—

*Provided*, That none of the money herein appropriated shall be paid until the Directors of the World's Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday.

This was carried, ayes 131, noes 32.

Then the House rose and, in the House, a vote of about four to one, committed itself to the Sunday-closing position of the religious lobby, and, if Mr. Holman can be believed, these votes were cast upon the conviction of a question that had already been studied by the representatives.

A motion was included, however, which allowed this decision of the Sunday-closing question to be re-opened in the full House, by getting to the House, evidently, the other members who had not been present. Mr. Lester, Mr. Bowers, of California, offered a resolution which was agreed to, with the accompanying remarks as follows:—

Mr. BOWERS. This is a religious question, and Sabbath is a religious institution, and should not be legislated upon by this body.

The question was being taken, the statement was contested by Mr. Bowers, who said:—

A private letter from Washington says that on that resolution this will likely bring a consideration of truth and fact and a contemplation of principle into scorn, derision, laughter, and contempt, by every religious paper in the country. It is the proposition that is Christ is dead, and has no vote,—hence cannot be expected to have votes.—*Sioux City (Iowa) Tribune.*

A similar letter was given to Mr. Wilder, of Wisconsin, that he would call up this motion and ask to lay the House in order to open it in order to close the Government exhibit on Sunday, which had been voted by the Committee. Mr. Bergan, of New Jersey, then, offered a further amendment, as follows:—

*And provided further*, The conditions for closing on Sunday shall also apply to the Mid-Winter Exposition to be held in the city of San Francisco.

This was rejected, and nothing further was offered in reference to the Sunday closing of the Fair, other business being then resumed.

The report of the second day's proceedings in regard to Sunday at the World's Fair occupies a full column of the *Congressional Record*.

The day following this action of the House the General Assembly of the representative William A. Stone, of Pennsylvania:

The Presbyterian General Assembly, in session sitting at Portland, Ore., took up the matter and read between the lines in full recognition. This is the telegram:—

Dr. David MacMillan, Moderator U. P. Assembly; Dr. Witherspoon, Moderator Assembly, both at Portland, Oregon, send congratulations of their respective bodies on special bill appropriating $2,500,000 for the World's Fair Exposition, in appreciation of votes for Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition on Sabbath. Yeas and nays are called.

"Only a preliminary test but it shows the way."

"Yeas and nays can then be called," these are the methods that representatives of Church, congregations who object to the levy of ecclesiastical taxes upon their members; —and who intend to place themselves on record—thus the yeas and nays;—and we are standing for civil liberty and equity, and religious truth and right, are bound to and should note carefully those phrases and study their meaning.

If this is only a break on the skirmish line, it may perhaps be hoped that in the contest to which this is preliminary there may be a full and fairly open hearing in which thought should govern Congress in regard to its right to strike at this, if they understand this question, "may then be more clearly enlightened to the end that, if the wrong be chosen, it be not chosen blindly."

The sentiment of those who have charge of matters pertaining to the World's Fair, in the Senate, has been expressed by Senator Pettingrew, of South Dakota, Chairman of the Committee on the Columbian Exposition. In an interview, to a reporter, Senator Pettingrew said:

I never suggest. I do not think that opposition can be made to opening of exhibition in the Fair Park on Sunday, and I don't believe Congress can afford to do it under the circumstances. If the majority of legal citizens are Christian or non-sectarian, this majority must rule. Speaking as a European, who has studied both sides, the European institution of opening on Sunday the working classes, free from labor, can be seen in any art gallery there. It has done them immense good.

As an expression of views in this is especially Paris, whose people have gone there evidently not in an equal alliance with both parties, or of parties, in this contest.

The following "special" from Racine, Wis., is an evidence of the activity which is everywhere being followed or, "Sunday law or no" by the recent attention of court and Congress at Washington:—

"The Citizens' League was to-day defeated in its first case against the baseball players to-day. Peter Hermann was discharged after a hearing by Justice Carpenter, he being the defendant in the first witness. The district attorney asked him about his feelings in regard to the Sabbath. The Mayor refused to answer, for the reason that it might have a bearing on relations himself. The justice said that he might answer, but he still refused, and whereupon the justice refused to let him be committed to jail for contempt. Then Mayor came in the court room, but was called right back by the sheriff and answered some questions that were put to him. The county court the payment to paid, the managers of the Columbia World's Fair, both in the district school at the foot of the channel in civil government and constitutional law. He is a Catholic, and has his peers both in the House and the Senate."

The food gates are about to open. We shall see the whole set, and we may expect to see it soon.
