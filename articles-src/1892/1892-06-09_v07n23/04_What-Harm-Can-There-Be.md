MR. JOHNSTONE asks, "What harm can there be in this American Congress signifying by this amendment its approbation of the laws of the State of Illinois?" Certainly that is a proper question, What harm? By the First Amendment to the Constitution, Congress is prohibited from making any law towards an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Shall Congress approve in the State of Illinois of that interference with religion which is prohibited to Congress? Shall Congress force upon Illinois the revival and application of laws which are contrary to the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the State itself, which says that no preference shall be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship?

But it may be Mr. Culberson realized that the previous action of the House in deciding that Sunday was the Sabbath, and forbidding ice to be sold on that day, had estopped him from making that plea. Perhaps Mr. Johnstone comprehended that the First Amendment according to the latest action of the House now reads, "Congress may make laws respecting an establishment of religion, etc., and may require obedience to religious laws on the part of the several States."

Another instance of sound views, and a willingness to express them, was given by Mr. Little, of New York, who said:—

Mr. Chairman, I hope that this amendment will not prevail. It seems to me that it is an attempt to commit this Congress to a line of policy which we have no right to undertake. Congress has already recognized the Illinois Corporation in the act of April 25, 1890, as the proper body to manage this Fair. . . . They have done nothing to indicate that they, on their part, intend in any manner to violate the law of the State of Illinois or of the United States; and, as has been said here there is a strict Sunday law in Illinois, and it is hardly possible that the law-abiding corporation, incorporated under the laws of that State, which has received the sanction of this Congress, would exhibit an intention of violating the statute law of their own State. It is dragging into the subject the question of religious matters which we have no right to consider, and I hope it will not be entertained.

At the close of Mr. Little's remarks, there were, as also several times previously, cries of "Vote!" "Vote!" and Mr. Holman, of Indiana, in the course of a strenuous attempt to shut off further debate on this question, said:—

Everybody understands this question. Every gentleman has considered it, and has made up his mind how to vote. I have made up my mind how I shall vote in regard to it, and I presume every other gentleman has his mind made up.

If it is true, as Mr. Holman says, that all congressmen understand this question, it is surprising how many must have voted contrary to their convictions.
