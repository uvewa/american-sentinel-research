THE United States has by no means a monopoly of the discussion of the Sunday question, as is shown by the following cable to the New York Sun.

"The members of the corporation of London had a heated discussion to-day, lasting three hours, over the question of opening the Guildhall Art Gallery on Sundays. Numerous petitions for such action has been received from trade unions, Sunday societies, and various other sources, while protests against the proposed change have come from other quarters in great numbers. At to-day's meeting, when a vote was reached, the petitions for Sunday opening were rejected, but by a majority so narrow as to furnish a surprising proof of the growth of liberal ideas, for the corporation is the embodiment of political and religious bigotry. During the debate those who favored Sunday opening cited the action of the Archbishop of Canterbury in personally attending the opening on Sunday of a picture gallery in the Whitechapel district some time ago. They also pointed to the fact that the Bishop of Rochester is advocating the opening of public art galleries, museums and libraries on the Sabbath. They argued that a course of action approved by such eminent lights of religion as these could not be far wrong."
