A CORRESPONDENT of the Voice, writing from Glasgow, Ky., complains that the Herald of that place, whose business manager "is a Baptist preacher, In good standing with his church," and who "has regular preaching appointments on Sunday in the country;" "through the week, for a moneyed consideration, advertises the devilish product of a man who also has a good standing in one of our city churches." A portion of the advertisement complained of runs thus:—

Four years in the Revenue Service, and three years as a practical distiller, have given me superior information in regard to making good whisky. I advertise no whisky or apple brandy that I do not make; and sell nothing of the kind except that of my own make. The utmost care taken to make a pure article, and will sell my whisky on its own merits. Will tell the truth as to its age. I do not at all times keep the oldest whisky in Barren County; it would be falsifying to say I did. My whisky is not for sale on Sunday (sickness excepted).

Probably it is the assurance that the whisky is not for sale on Sunday that reconciles the Baptist elder to running the "ad." It was candidly stated some years ago in the California Prohibitionist that "if the saloons will only close on Sundays it is about all we can ask." Does the Voice correspondent ask more than that? If so he is in advance of very many of his party.
