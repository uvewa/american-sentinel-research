REV. W. F. CRAFTS professes that it is not his purpose to interfere with people's own private reading on Sunday, but only to prevent the Sunday work of preparing and circulating the Sunday papers; never to place the person who finds it in violation. "The Sabbath for Man," "those words by which the Sunday institution is defended: the legality of Sunday observance."

He says: we do not propose to suppress Sunday newspapers. A man who reads one privately in a Sunday newspaper, or sifting a person's conduct with reference to any matter on a Sunday newspaper. We do not wish to make it a crime on Sunday; but buying and selling are a very unreasonable use. We are not unwilling to let the case be told. It is a matter that concerns a community, not a single individual. For its effect upon the community as a whole, not so much upon the individuals, the business of issuing newspapers in what is wanted. (S. Hart, 99.)

If this decision does not look very much like the direction of State supervision of Sunday reading for the individual, we wish they'd take it to know something. Yet Mr. Crafts approves it. It is only bad enough to be a matter of law this far. Sunday is not the Sabbath; he had not sold any, and something over or something about selling advertising during the day as well as the disposition of paper.

A National Reform organ says,—

There is something radically wrong in our day with day papers contain, keeping the mind in the week-day bustle and rattle, when even the secular thought of a nation shall be expressed through these columns. But the very reading was said on Saturday we could not, why not, consistently, forbid it on Sunday?

And why not prohibit it on one day as well as the other? If these men have the moral right to guard the morals of the country on one day, why not on every other day? If it is the people who are working on Sunday that are disturbing "good" people, it is not the working people but the day that is to be guarded. It is the Sabbath that these people want the law to be thrown. It is the religion of these people that is to be guarded. And if the "religious" day is injured or worse for the people is a minor consideration for these people. Don't they stand for the religious day, and the day is exalted a place above other days, and so acts of mere human beings, no matter how holy other days are forbidden, and declared to be evil and harmful on one day, for no reason but because of this supposed sacred character of the day?

Why not control Sunday reading? It is on the other hand the Church-enforced observance of a religious institution, and involves the whole subject of Sunday-law, character of this. For the religious character of the day.
