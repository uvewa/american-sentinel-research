THE Seventh-day Baptists of the United States have entered the following earnest protest against legislation by Congress in reference to Sunday at the World's Fair. The memorial has been introduced in both Senate and House, and copies sent to each senator and congressman.

## A MEMORIAL AGAINST NATIONAL SUNDAY LEGISLATION.

To the Honorable, The Senate of the United States:

In view of the fact that your honorable body is urged to forbid the opening of the Columbian Exposition on Sundays by national law; and because such legislation is sought in order to protect Sunday as a religious institution, under the deceptive plea of enforcing only the "Civil Sabbath", therefore the undersigned, officers of the American Sabbath Trust Society, which represents thousands of citizens who are Seventh-day Baptists, earnestly petition and respectfully urge, that your honorable body do not thus enter upon the work of legislating concerning religious questions. Your petitioners believe that such a law would be contrary to the principles of religious freedom, and the entire separation of Church and State, upon which the national Government of the United States is based.

In support of this we beg leave to recall attention to the report upon a similar question made to the second session of the Twentieth Congress, and communicated to the Senate by Hon. Richard M. Johnson on the nineteenth of January, 1829, in which report it was truthfully said:

"If the principle is once established, that religion or religious-observances shall be interwoven with our legislative acts, we must pursue it to its ultimatum."

In the corresponding report, also by Mr. Johnson, made to the House of Representatives, at the first session of the Twenty-first Congress, March fourth and fifth, 1830, it was further said:

"If Congress shall be authority of law sanction the measure recommended, it would constitute a legislative decision of a religious controversy, in which even Christians are at issue."

Your petitioners submit that the correct position taken at that time, with reference to the mail service, demands even fuller recognition at this time, and in the matter of the Columbian Exposition.

We urge our prayer in the name of religious liberty, and the non-interference of Congress, directly or indirectly, in religious matters.

In behalf of the Seventh-day Baptists of the United States, and of all lovers of religious liberty,

We have the honor to remain, your obedient servants.

ARTHUR L. TITSWORTH,
Rec. Sec'y.

CHARLES POTTER,
President.
