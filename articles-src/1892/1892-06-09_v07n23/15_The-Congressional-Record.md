THE *Congressional Record* now regularly contains, in the columns of petitions and memorials, a record of the presentation of memorials from the Seventh-day Baptists, the same discrimination against Congress on religious matters. The full text of these memorials in respectful objections. The language of the petition is dignified and elevated while the reference to the report of Hon. Richard M. Johnson on the question of the Sunday mail service, in the *Twentieth*, and now the *Twenty-first*, Congress, should draw the members to the Fifty-third Congress to the same constitutional position on this subject, the publication of which must here either be upheld or demolished.
