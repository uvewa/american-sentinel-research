Go tell it to Colonel Shepard, Mr. Crafts & Co., that those who want Sunday enforced as a civil institution and wish to pass a law that no church shall be allowed to hold services on Sunday. Sunday cannot be both a "rest day," or "civil rest day," popularly called Sunday? This would of course be purely "in the interest of the laboring man."

And why not? If the State may properly guard Sunday against the encroachment of labor, why not against the encroachment of too numerous church services? If it is a "civil rest day," then surely the State has the right to protect and regulate it to any extent deemed necessary for the public welfare. But some will say why not? If not,

But in practice Sunday is not the kind of a "civil rest day" to be regulated by legislation. In its popularity its character as a "civil" rest day is only the character of enforced by civil law. In every reasonable way, it is religious, and nothing would be wanting to destroy its usefulness for any civil purpose. It can not be used for religious purposes unless Indeed, the demand for the civil Sabbath is simply an excuse to seize its character as a day of civil purpose of the day.

The religion of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is clearly shown by the witnesses who asked: "Do you know anything of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" Another was asked, "Do you know any members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" "Is it the habit of Seventh-day Adventists to work on Sunday?" This prosecution was of a class or church, was further shown by the fact that in the case the Judge objected to the Attorney-General trying to show the injunction to the practice of the individual defendants, yet in his reply to the Judge's objection, the Attorney-General returned to the inquiry in respect of the denomination and said: "I want to find out what the laws are among this class of people."

with the people that this day [Sunday] shall be universally respected.

Each of the five defendants declined to plead to the indictment and the court entered for each the plea of not guilty. The strength of the defendant for not pleading was that they felt that their convictions were right, and truthfully and without evasive reasoning,
