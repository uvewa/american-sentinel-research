A CORRESPONDENT of the *Voice*, writing from Glasgow, Ky., complains that the "friends of God's day, whose business management" "is a Baptist preacher, is good deal." "It was only his cheekiest, who said "the church" and who "has the regular preaching appointments on Sunday as his business." He continues—

"throughout the week has a good standing in one of our city churches, . . . a portion of the advertised church fund."

Four years in the place have made my acquaintance extensive. I am reliable in my information in regard to making good whisky. I know the best corn-whisky makers, who make, and sell nothing of the kind except that is of a superior quality. But this old Kentucky article. We'd tell the truth as to its use. I do not drink and sell whisky on any day but Sunday, to wit: it is for sale on Sunday, do you say why whisky is not for sale on Sunday that would be bad enough, but here it is not only whisky is not for sale on Sunday that church officials are making it and selling it wholesale on other days of the week, but the "act." It was candidly stated some months ago by the local Presbyterian Pastor, that "all the saloons will only close on Sunday it is alcohol safe all the week." Does the *Voice* correspondent ask more than the *Voice* correspondents ask? Does the work of many of his party?
