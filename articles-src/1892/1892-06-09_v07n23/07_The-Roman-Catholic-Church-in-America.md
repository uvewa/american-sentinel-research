The hostility and preponderance of the Romanists and their interference of Protestant England is not ceasing.

The New England of the Puritans is rapidly becoming the New England of the Romanist. The French Canadians swarm in our northern manufacturing villages, and it is their hope and belief, carefully nursed by their leaders, that, at a time not far distant, the Roman Church will not only dominate New England, but the whole of Canada eastward of the Ottawa.

The Government of Quebec is so closely a hierarchy as was that of Rome during the temporal power of the Papacy. But two inconsiderable Protestant ridings are left, not even, says the writer of these articles in an *Andrew Review, May, 1889.*
