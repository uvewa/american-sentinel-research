THE movement for Sunday closing of the World's Fair is attracting attention in France. A Protestant clergyman in Paris is quoted as expressing the following views:—

On theological grounds, I do not think that opposition can be made to opening of exhibitions in general. Local considerations, however, may make it preferable that the Chicago Exposition be closed on Sundays. If the majority of pious citizens are scandalized by the opening of the Fair on Sunday, it certainly ought not to be opened that day. Speaking as a European, who has studied both theology and political economy, I point out that on Sunday the working classes, free from labor, can visit the Fair without loss of money. Sunday opening is not really opposed to piety.

As an expression of views this is exquisitely Parisian. It antagonizes no one, and delicately and gracefully sides with both parties, or all parties, to the controversy.
