The Pittsburg *Dispatch* published, under the title of a letter from Walter Ward Bell to the Thurston club in a Shelton letter from the border of this article, which is very suggestive of the times, and to show how the Sunday institution is regarded even from a point of view reasonably outside of the churches.

"In the thousand people shaled their Sunday drives in the summer, and their Sunday sleigh rides in the winter, and their Sunday horse-back rides to the place to the plucky dealer. The proprietor William Thurston who, coming to the Country, thirty years ago and having since remained, and during that time it has been the custom, and kept a moment from breaking the tedium in Sunday in the country.

"During the first Sunday hours there is practically no stirring visible on the streets. The quiet lasts until after nine o'clock, when the people begin to appear on their way to the numerous churches. During the services the streets are quiet again, but during the midday, the author Key reports, 'all manner of business goes on as on other days,' and goes on to say that 'as many kinds of wares were sold, besides an immense quantity of eatables and drinkables.' People of all classes of society were among the passers-by. At their tables in front of their shops, the busy workers sat at their toil. He concludes that he was sitting; people were squatted on the ground working at their various trades. Artisans, salespeople, and also others of the professional men of all fractions received happy in the country of Calvin, in spite of the reformation, working on Sunday, and at least a dozen preachers from the pulpit there were speaking against it, was unable to enforce Sunday upon even Geneva. And that the capacity of the store was taxed to hold all who came; if not on Sunday, there are enough of them to fill it with visiting on Sunday alone."

He describes a week-day excursion only by the Thurston Club to a Swiss watering place, and after Order Society, a friend of Mr. Key's who had lived for two years in Berne, Basle and Zurich and a visit against both the clergy and laity of the land was as follows. "Sunday there is always open to all visitors; shops are extensively opened and noticed several miles of five minutes each, and finds there the people of Switzerland daily of the firm conviction that they so dearly love in many communities.

"Nor does the night end." I do not duly the views of the people in America should be credited to the Thurstons, giving the people some reinforcement but those at home are willing to concede. They have been assessed by hundreds of "the best men in the community," and when asked to produce their written certificates, have never failed in their commission to sell and pay for this regularly, and if their sales show large deficiencies in Sunday sales.
