The Georgia State Convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has just closed a five days' session at Milledgeville, Georgia. It is said that this, the tenth annual convention, "was the most interesting and enthusiastic ever held." However this may be, from the resolutions which were framed and adopted during the session, it is certain that the Georgia Woman's Christian Temperance Union is undertaking almost everything but that for which the society was organized.

This is one of the resolutions which the society adopted at its meeting May 24.:

Resolved, That we heartily endorse the action of Southern women in voting to close the doors of the Columbian Exposition on Sunday, and that our superintendent of petitions memorialize the Directors of the Columbian Exposition on this subject, and demand the closing in the name of our Christian civilization.

It will be noticed that this resolution authorizes their superintendent of petitions to "demand" Sunday closing in their memorial. Will it then be a petition?

Their next resolution read:—

Resolved, That the department of Sabbath observance be emphasized by each local union, and that we ourselves enforce it by example.

Thus the temperance (?) work goes on in Georgia.
