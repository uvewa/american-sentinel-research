As the readers of THE SENTINEL are aware, the Grand Jury of Henry County, Tenn., at the January term of Court, found indictments against five Seventh-day Adventists, residents of that county, for maintaining a "nuisance by working" on Sunday. Four of these persons, viz., J. H. Dortch, W. S. Lowry, J. Moon, and J. W. Lewis, have been tried. The following is a verbatim copy of one of the indictments which differed only in names and dates:—

*State of Tennessee,*
*Henry County.*

The Grand Jurors of the State of Tennessee, elected, empanelled, sworn and charged to inquire in and for the body of the county of Henry, in the State aforesaid, upon their oath, present:—

That ......., late of said county; laborer, heretofore to wit on the 8th day of Nov. A. D. 1891, that day being Sunday, did unlawfully, and in pursuance of a custom so to do, engage in the regular vocation of his usual avocation in doing and performing his ordinary calling of secular work on said day, to wit: by felling trees and cutting and splitting wood, openly, publicly, notoriously and seasonably, and did engage in his secular business, and did not observe and follow the common avocations of life on that day by working on the farm, plowing, clearing, chopping, hauling wood, making rails, and doing all manner of work upon said farm, such business and work not being necessary or a matter of charity, but did it was to do the same general and particular disturbance of the people, to the evil example of others, prejudicial to public morals and a public nuisance, against the peace and dignity of the State.

*Sess. Court.*—And the Grand Jurors aforesaid upon their oath aforesaid, do further present: that the said W. B. Lowry, on the days and dates above described in the first count of this presentment, was guilty of a public nuisance to wit working on Sunday as described in said first count against the peace and dignity of the State.

None of the defendants had actually done all the kinds of work mentioned in the indictments, nor was it necessary to prove or show that this was the case, the particular phraseology employed being only a stereotyped way of saying that the parties indicted worked farm work and that instead of resting on Sunday they worked as on other days of the week.

The point in the glad of the charge was that the work "was and is to the great hindrance" of those professing Christianity, and "a public nuisance to the citizens of the county." It naturally would be strange that the indictments were found at the instigation of people living in the neighborhood, and that some at least of those who were so greatly injured by this Sunday work of these who are Seventh-day Christians did not the witnesses for the State; but each case was the same. Every witness in each of

the cases was asked if the work disturbed them in their worship or at their devotions; and the witnesses, without exception, testified that they found that it did not.

As would naturally inquire, if those living in the immediate neighborhood were not disturbed, how were the people of the county at large likely to be disturbed by it, and if the indictments were found at their instigation, why were they found at all? The facts, so stated by one of the attorneys who prosecuted them, are as follows: A man named Reynolds, not an Adventist but an acquaintance of one who was, happened to be in Paris, the county seat of Henry County, at the time of the sitting of the January term of Court. He was summoned before the Grand Jury and asked if he did not know of certain persons who worked on Sunday; he answered, first, if he did or did not, in a manner which showed that he had not been thinking about it, and then that he did. He was then asked if they were not Seventh-day Adventists, and he answered in the affirmative. The witnesses were then brought in to give their evidence, and as before noted were chiefly, if not exclusively, five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in that neighborhood, who did, giving the names to the Grand Jury, and the indictments were accordingly found.

So far as the writer is able to learn, the testimony before the Grand Jury and the testimony before the court in the trial of these defendants at their several trials was substantially identical, and upon this testimony the court said to dismiss the cases. The manager of the Seventh-day Adventists, and upon this evidence the indictments were found. The writer was informed that the statement was made by the Attorney-General himself that they did not intend to put a stop to "that Sunday work," but that he simply wanted to "test" "the extent of the law," and that he might be the same if necessary. This was denied by the Adventists, who said that no one had ever before taught them to work on Sunday. This denunciation was admitted to be true, but no resilient point.

The cases came on for trial in regular order, the jury was impanelled and the trial began. The manager of the prosecuting side, keeping with his way in which the indictments had been found, stated that it was the religion being tried, not as individuals, but as a class, or, in other words, a church. The religion of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is clearly shown by the witnesses who asked: "Do you know anything of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" Another was asked, "Do you know any members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" "Is it the habit of Seventh-day Adventists to work on Sunday?" This prosecution was of a class or church, was further shown by the fact that in the case the Judge objected to the Attorney-General trying to show the injunction to the practice of the individual defendants, yet in his reply to the Judge's objection the Attorney-General returned to the inquiry in respect of the denomination and said: "I want to find out what the laws are among this class of people."

None of the defendants had actually done all the kinds of work described, and all declined to permit the case to be appealed to the supreme court. They said that they were being tried for their religious convictions, for their honest observance of what they believed to be the word of God." "And when they told you they had nothing to say when the Judge put to them the usual question, their silence said in volumes what no words or arguments on their part could say: 'We have nothing to say;' how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say; for the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say."

Each of the five defendants declined to plead to the indictment and the court entered for each the plea of not guilty. The strength of the defendant for not pleading was that they felt that their convictions were right, and truthfully and without evasive reasoning, and that religious convictions did not constitute a nuisance. As already noted, the defense in each case was substantially identical, the evidence showed that

bored on Sunday was true, but that they had by any proper cause for not doing it were guilty of a nuisance they felt was not a matter of civil or criminal law; and further over they felt that the very Scriptures that were made the criterion in the hands of the Lord forbid them to close their own mouth being a plea of guilty, and that all they could do was to let his trial its regular form, each in that of the proper time they might have opportunity of all that pertained to the kingdom of heaven.

As a matter of course there was in these cases no quibbling as to the admissibility of evidence. Except for the restricting of the Court the Attorney General had all the liberty that he wished to take. Consequently every stone evidence was introduced from outside that could be by the prosecution, did not, however, affect the result.

In the four cases in which verdicts of guilty were rendered, Sunday work was clearly proved by the State and was not denied by the defendants but, as before stated, not only was there no evidence to sustain the charge that the work constituted a nuisance, but every witness testified that he was not annoyed by it. This point was emphasized by J. H. Dortch, one of the defendants, when asked if he had anything to say before the judgment of the Court was pronounced. The result of each case was a verdict of guilty, with no consideration, and as a final judgment Dortch was fined the nominal fine of one dollar and costs. The costs were, in some of the cases, including the cost for the witnesses, were instructed to be on hand at all four of the trials. In this way the witnesses' fees were about four times what, in the usual course, they would be; and in his trial, but in no way concerned in them, appeared to be his writer the opinion that the court would either impose a very light fine for each one of the defendants or would give each of the defendants another trial.

The feeling in the court room and also among business men in Paris was very manifestly in favor of the Adventists, yet the convictions were denounced by some as religious; and some of the prisoners were heard and heard to remark: "If they would only let these Sabbath-keepers alone and put them to working, they would be more in the line of their duty."

While each of the several defendants was speaking there was absolute silence in the court room. The whole court seemed to feel it all a case. The judge and the attorney-General both seemed to be impressed by the simple, earnest, yet not studied, presentation of the Adventist view, both frankly acknowledging not only that they were honest men, but that they acted as their habits, asserted their God-given right to rest on the seventh day and to work on the seventh day according to the letter of the fourth commandment. The judgment of the Court is awaited with interest.
