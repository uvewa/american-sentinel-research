A DISPATCH from the Presbyterian Assembly in session at Pittsburg, says:—

The United Presbyterian General Assembly here to-night, by adopting the report of its committee on reform, characterized the exclusion of Chinese from America as unchristian, unpatriotic, and a monstrous injustice.

The President's signature to such a bill was pronounced to be an evidence that he was not a Christian. In reference to the events of the past year it said: "The most significant thing is the decision of the United States Supreme Court that we are a Christian Nation. The President has no longer a valid excuse for refusing the recognition of Christianity in his annual Thanksgiving proclamation.

This touches the key note of the political religion of which Justice Brewer's decision is the legal expression.

And this, from the Mail and Express, runs the whole gamut of "religion is politics":

Stupid Intolerance!—The spectacle of a handful of religionists sitting at Pittsburg pronouncing Benjamin Harrison "not a Christian" because, perchance, he differs with them as to a Chinese policy, would be shocking were it not also amusing. Such incidents cast discredit on the Church universal. Probably not one in twenty of the men and women who voted on the resolution, know even the outline of this Nation's dealing with the Chinese.

The Mail and Express has led in the movement to secure the Celestials their rights, but we respect honest opinions, we recognize the exigencies of statecraft, and we deprecate any anticipation of the differentiation of sheep and goats, especially when so enlightened and earnest a Christian as Benjamin Harrison is side-tracked with reprobates.

This is politico-religious consistency.
