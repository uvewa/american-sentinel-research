As the readers of THE SENTINEL are aware, the Grand Jury of Henry County, Tenn., at the January term of Court, found indictments against five Seventh-day Adventists, residents of that county, for maintaining a nuisance by working on Sunday. The parties indicted were J. H. Dortch, W. S. Lowry, J. Moon, James Stem, and W. H. Ward. The following is a verbatim copy of one of the indictments which differed only in names and dates:—

State of Tennessee, } Henry County. } Jan. Term, A. D., 1892.

The Grand Jurors of the State of Tennessee, elected, empanelled, sworn and charged to inquire in and for the body of the county of Henry, in the State aforesaid, upon their oath, present that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

late of said county, laborer, heretofore to wit on the 8th day of Nov., A. D. 1891, that day being Sunday, and divers other Sundays before that date and up to the taking of this inquisition, in the county of Henry, aforesaid, then and there, unlawfully, openly, publicly, notoriously and unceasingly did engage in his secular business, and did perform and follow his common avocations of life on Sundays by working on the farm, plowing, hoeing, chopping, hauling wood, raauling rails, and doing various and divers other kinds of work on Sundays, said work not being necessary or a matter of charity, and it was and is to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of society, prejudicial to public morals and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county and against the peace and dignity of the State.

J. W. LEWIS, Att. Gen.

Sec. Count.—And the Grand Jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further present that the said W. S. Lowry, on the days and dates aforesaid, and in manner and form as aforesaid, was guilty of a public nuisance by said working on Sunday, to the prejudice of society, and against the peace and dignity of the State.

J. W. LEWIS, Attorney General.

None of the defendants had actually done all the kinds of work enumerated in the indictments, nor was it necessary to prove that such was the case; indeed the particular phraseology employed was only a roundabout way of saying that the parties indicted were farmers and that instead of resting on Sunday they followed their ordinary pursuits upon that day.

Inasmuch as the gist of the charge was that the work "was and is to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people" "and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county," it naturally would be supposed that the indictments were found at the instigation of people living in the neighborhood, and that some at least of those who were so greatly annoyed were among the witnesses for the State; but such was not the case. Every witness in each of the cases was asked if the work disturbed or annoyed him? and each witness testified that it did not.

The reader will naturally inquire, if those living in the immediate neighborhood in which the work was done were not annoyed by it, and if the indictments were not found at their instigation, why were they found at all? The facts, as nearly as the writer has been able to ascertain them, are as follows: A man from the neighborhood in which the work complained of was done, happened to be at Paris, the county seat of Henry County on business at the time of the January term of Court. He was summoned before the Grand Jury and was asked by the Attorney-General, first if he did not live in the "Advent" neighborhood. He said that he did. He was then asked if they worked on Sunday. This too, was answered in the affirmative. The witness was then required to give the names of five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in that neighborhood; which he did, giving the names of the two elders, the deacon, and of two prominent lay members.

So far as the writer is able to learn, the only evidence before the Grand Jury was the general statement of this one unwilling witness, that the Adventists worked on Sunday; and upon this evidence the indictments were found. The writer is also informed that the statement was made by the Attorney-General, that he was determined to put a stop to "that Sunday work," that he would prosecute the Adventists to "the extent of the law," and that he wanted if possible to get the preacher who taught them to work on Sunday. This was not done, however, as the church has no resident pastor.

The manner of the Attorney-General in conducting the trials throughout was in keeping with the way in which the indictments were found. In his mind those on trial were being tried, not as individuals, but as members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This is clearly shown by some of his questions; for instance, one witness was asked: "Do you know anything of the workings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" Another was asked, "Are you a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church?" "Is it the habit of that church to do secular business on Sunday?" This question was asked of every witness until the Judge objected to it and told the Attorney-General to confine his questions to the practice of the individual defendant. However, in his plea to the jury the Attorney-General returned to the same idea, saying, "I am sorry that we have among us this class of people."

None of the defendants employed counsel, and all declined to permit the court to appoint counsel for them. They felt that they were being tried for their religious faith, and so chose to stand upon the word of God: "And when they shall bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take you to thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say: For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say."

Each of the five defendants declined to plead to the indictment and the court entered for each the plea of not guilty. The reason of the defendants for not pleading was that they felt that they could not consistently and truthfully either acknowledge or deny every allegation of the indictment. That they had habitually labored on Sunday was true, but that they had in any proper sense of the word been guilty of a nuisance they felt was not true; hence their refusal to plead. Moreover they felt that the very Scripture which bid them rest their cases in the hands of the Lord forbid them to close their own mouths by a plea of guilty; and that all they could do was to let the trial proceed in regular form, that at the proper time they might have opportunity to speak for themselves.

As a matter of course there was in these trials no quibbling as to the admissibility of evidence. Except for the restraints of the Court the Attorney General had all the liberty that he wished to take. Consequently some evidence was introduced which should have been excluded. This probably did not, however, affect the result.

In the four cases in which verdicts of guilty were rendered, Sunday work was clearly proved by the State and was not denied by the defendants; but, as before stated, not only was there no evidence to support the charge that the work constituted a nuisance, but every witness testified that he was not annoyed by it. This point was emphasized by J. H. Durich, one of the defendants, when asked if he had anything to say before the judgment of the Court was pronounced. The result was that the Judge said he wished time for consideration, and so final judgment was deferred for one week, and the defendants were instructed to be on hand at that time. An attorney present at the trials, but in no way concerned in them, expressed to the writer his opinion that the court would either impose a very light fine or else set aside the verdicts and give each of the defendants another trial. However that is only conjecture.

The feeling in the court room and also among business men in Paris was very favorable to the defendants. The prosecutions were denounced by some as religious persecution, and an attorney was heard to remark: "If they would only indict men for not working instead of for working, they would be more in the line of duty."

While each of the several defendants was speaking there was absolute silence in the court room. The whole court seemed to feel ill at ease. The Judge and Attorney-General both seemed to be impressed by the simple, unvarnished, yet straightforward pleas of the accused, who, while frankly acknowledging not only that they had worked on Sunday, but that such was their habit, asserted their God-given right to work six days after having observed the seventh day according to the letter of the fourth commandment. The judgment of the Court is awaited with interest.
