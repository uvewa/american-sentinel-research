But Mr. Holman found that the question would not down, and Mr. Hooker, of Mississippi, offered an amendment, in these words:—

Provided, That in no event shall the exhibit made by the Government be opened to the public on Sunday.

Mr. Johnstone objected to this because as he said the point that he desired to emphasize was,—

that this appropriation of money of the American people should not be expended at all unless the institution upon which, or in connection with which, this fund is to be expended shall be closed on Sunday.

Mr. Hooker expressed himself as concurring fully with Mr. Johnstone in the sentiment of his amendment, but considered that it should be modified so as to be—

an expression of the legislative sentiment of the country, on the part of the Congress of the United States, and in respect to the Christian sentiment of the civilized world.

and saying further,—

I am in favor of accomplishing the object, and of giving a legislative construction to the sentiment of the people of this country, as the representations of the people, that the Exposition should be closed on the Sabbath day.

It was agreed between Mr. Hooker and Mr. Johnstone that the two amendments should be joined, so as to read:—

Provided, That no part of the amount of this appropriation shall be available unless the doors of the Exhibition shall be closed on Sunday; Provided further, That in no event shall the exhibit to be made by the Government be open to the public on Sunday.

Mr. Johnstone continued to urge the adoption of his amendment and was interrupted by Mr. Bland, who said:—

Suppose that we should declare that this Exposition shall be open on Sunday, and suppose on the other hand the laws of Illinois say that it shall not. The State of Illinois not having granted jurisdiction to Congress, what right have we to interfere with the laws of that State upon the subject?

Mr. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. I had given the gentleman credit for more acumen than his question indicates.

Mr. BLAND. I am after your acumen, and not mine. [Laughter.]

Mr. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. I do not for a moment contemplate—[Cries of "Vote!" "Vote!"]

Mr. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. Gentlemen, you shall not howl me down!

Then followed a scene of great disorder and intense excitement which was not quelled until the Committee rose for the purpose of limiting debate; the Speaker resumed the Chair and called upon the Sergeant-at-Arms to request members to be seated and maintain order.
