The foundation upon which this Government is built, is that recognition of God is the best Government on the earth, is in civil religion. These principles are in fact the only true foundation for civil government. When individual rights are respected and guarded, we are properly; but the morass of this where these same are transacted under made, by any means that may happen to be in point.

These principles require, absolutely, whether Jew or Gentile, Christian or infidel, that when in matters of conscience, the most frivolous freedoms as guaranteed to all, by its fundamental law. This is perfectly just; for a law to be just must treat all alike, and civil government must not recognize any one religion, but give freedom and protection to all alike; and taking the pace that the same civil or religious status shall go beyond and infringe upon the right or another of religion.

Civil government can not decide as to what is true or right in matters of religion to make the attempt, it would, as in the case already cited, inevitably happen that a wrong decision would be made. But to avoid the recognized issue a possible error, the next logical steps would be to decide that the power that made the decision was infallible. This is just what Rome did. Government can not decide in matters of religion; for religion is purely a matter of the heart and conscience of the individual. Each must be left perfectly free to decide in this important matter as between his own soul and his Maker. If at any time any power intrude into these moral rights, it should be warned off the track; for religious liberty is gone; for if it may invade conscience in one particular it may in all. There is none. It is a grand thought underlying all the provisions of our national Constitution. Article VI., last clause, and the First Amendment.

So religion not only can not be required as a condition of citizenship, but the exercise of the right of religion on the part of the citizen must also be guaranteed.

George Washington when asked if he thought religious rights were sufficiently guarded by the Constitution,—made the statement that if there were defects, he was sure that a more liberal interpretation would be more willing that it should be left open.

It is a remarkable fact that the very first addition ever made to the national Constitution adopted the following as the First Amendment:—

Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Thus we see it was the studied intention of the framers of the Government, in the formation of that document, that the utmost latitude compatible with liberty, and ever enjoyed by all the subjects of the Government, should be provided. This we have now carried, this most desirable of all objects, our constitution about religion, been adopted at that very time, prohibiting all the care necessary about religion, but very work. It is a most humiliating contemplation for the American lover of liberty, that almost every State in the Union has laws upon its statute books that are, in fact acts being, made the cause of much suffering. In the name of the Church, in matters of religion, partaking of the spirit of the Dark Ages; which, in the fact are facts being, made the cause of much suffering. In the name of Christianity, these laws are just so much a tearing in the guarantees of religious rights of each citizen, and each State in this respect. They are a blot upon our national record, and a disgrace to the American name.—*Goldwin Smith's Tribune.*
