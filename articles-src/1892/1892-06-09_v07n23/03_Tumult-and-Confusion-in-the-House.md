THE presentation of this amendment created such a scene in the House as was not equalled by the wildest moments of excitement in the contest over the silver bill. A correspondent who has been present in the House nearly every day during this session, writes, "I have never seen such confusion as it produced." The proceedings, as published in the Congressional Record, show that the members crowded the aisles and the space about the Speaker's desk, and the tumult was such that the Chairman was obliged to suspend proceedings and demand order before gentlemen addressing the Chair could be heard. Whom the devil would destroy he first makes mad seemed to be exemplified on the floor of the House; but there were occasional flashes of reason, sense, and sanity, manifested, as witness the point urged by Mr. Culberson, of Texas, Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Culberson said:—

Let me ask whether this whole subject is not regulated by the laws of Illinois?

MR. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. I am aware, or at least am informed, that an act of the Legislature of the State of Illinois does provide that no place of public amusement shall be kept open on Sunday; but what harm can there be in this American Congress signifying by this amendment its approbation of the laws of the State of Illinois?

MR. CULBERTSON. Does the gentleman know what the laws of the State of Illinois are on this subject?

MR. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. I do not, but I have just been informed that there is such a law as I have stated.

MR. CULBERTSON. I do not understand that Congress has any right to go into the State of Illinois and regulate the conduct of an Illinois corporation.

MR. JOHNSTONE, of South Carolina. That is correct. But this Congress has certainly a right to withhold its aid from the Illinois corporation unless that corporation is willing to accept it under the limitations.

The calm and correct legal sense of the sound jurist is in strong contrast here with the frivolous appeal and shallow fallacy of the zealot pleading for the establishment of a religious rite by act of Congress.
