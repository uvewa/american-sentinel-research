The following is clipped from the Iowa Sunday-School Teacher, for May. It certainly shows that the mania for securing governmental action in closing the World's Fair on Sunday is not alone confined to our own Union, but that it has crossed the line and invaded the domain of the Queen.

A deputation from the Ontario Provincial Sabbath School Association, consisting of officers of the Association and other influential clergymen and laymen, waited upon the Government of the Domain of Canada, at Ottawa, to urge that the appropriation for the Canadian exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in Chicago, Ill. 1893, be conditioned that the gates be closed on the Lord's day, or at least the Canadian department be closed; and after a respectful hearing the Premier, Hon. Mr. Abbot, replied that the wishes of the Association would be carried out. Surely out of respect to Christianity, and precedents at Philadelphia, Paris, London, and Vienna, as well as the acknowledgment of the God of nations, in whom the United States of America professes to trust, see American coins, "In God We Trust,"—the Directors of this Exposition will close the gates on the Lord's day, and thus objectively teach the people of the assembled nations to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.

The question is pertinent and natural. Where will this craze for governmental recognition of religious institutions end?
