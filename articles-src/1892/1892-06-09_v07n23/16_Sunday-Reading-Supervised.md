Rev. W. F. CRAFTS professes that it is not his purpose nor wish to prevent by law certain reading on Sunday, but only to prevent the Sunday work of preparing and circulating the Sunday paper; nevertheless he quotes approvingly in his book, "The Sabbath for Man," these words by a New York judge, in a decision against the legality of Sunday advertising:—

In any view of religious obligation, it would be difficult to contend that the reading of advertisements in a Sunday newspaper, or aiding a person to do so, is a work of either necessity or charity. The mind, certainly, on that day needs no such sustenance, and even as a mere matter of taste, it must be admitted that common advertisements of mere buying and selling are a very unsuitable outfit for a feast of reason. Six days, at all events, of such a diet are enough. Thought perpetually running in one channel, like matrimony in one family, dwarfs the intellect. It is rather a work of charity in such cases to withhold than to give. Abstinence, not sustenance, is what is needed. (19 Barb., 281; 24 N. Y., 353.)

If this decision does not look very strongly in the direction of State supervision of Sunday reading for the individual, we would like to know what would. Yet Mr. Crafts approves it. It is only just to state, however, that the Legislature did not, and something over a year ago made advertising in Sunday papers legal in this State.
