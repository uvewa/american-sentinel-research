It would seem from this Associated Press dispatch, that the Federation of Labor proposes to stand directly for the Sunday opening of the World's Fair, without reference to the principle of non-interference, which is the only sound basis of protest:—

The American Federation of Labor has come out flatly in favor of the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday. Samuel Gompers, the President of the Federation, has addressed a circular letter to all the trades unions in the United States, urging them to use whatever influence they each may have to secure the opening of the Fair on Sunday. He claims that this is the only day on which a large majority of workingmen can visit the great Exposition.

However, it does not follow that, because Mr. Gompers' circular is so represented, it does ignore the real question at issue. Indeed, it is very certain that Mr. Gompers would not advocate the antithesis of Sunday-closing legislation and ask for Sunday-opening legislation.
