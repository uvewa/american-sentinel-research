The law under which the Law and Order League of Pittsburg is operating, is a special act passed in 1855 for Allegheny County. The penalty for the violation of the law of 1794 is a fine of four dollars. That was found insufficient to stop the running of a certain omnibus line. There was also trouble with some liquor dealers, and under cover of the sentiment aroused by this feature a demand was made on the Legislature in 1855 for a more stringent law. The rest of the State, however, protested against any such move, so the Legislature finally compromised the matter by passing a special enactment for Allegheny County. This act, after increasing the penalties for Sunday liquor selling, provides that—

any person violating the provisions of the first section of said act for the suppression of vice and immorality, and of unlawful gaming, and to restrain disorderly sports and dissipation, approved April 22, 1794, within the county of Allegheny, being summarily convicted thereof before any mayor,

burgess, justice of the peace or alderman, shall forfeit and pay the sum of twenty-five dollars, with costs, and in default of payment, or of goods to levy upon to satisfy the same, shall be committed to the county prison for not less than ten nor more than thirty days.

Of this section the Pittsburg Dispatch remarks that—

it would puzzle a mind not having the advantage of a legal education to determine what "unlawful gaming, disorderly sports and dissipation" have to do with the completion and delivery of the news of the hour, or in what the running of a street car or omnibus, or the sale of a glass of soda water conflict with the "suppression of vice or immorality."

Nevertheless, this is the section under which all violators of the Sunday law in Pittsburg are fined twenty-five dollars, no matter if the offense has been only the sale of a single newspaper, or a glass of soda water.
