AFTER a motion to adjourn was lost, the House again resolved itself into a Committe of the whole House on the State of the Union, and again took up the consideration of the same question with a limitation of debate to two minutes, Mr. Lester of Georgia still in the Chair.

Mr. William A. Stone, of Pennsylvania, offered a substitute, which read:—

That before any money appropriated by the Government is paid, the managers of the Columbian Exposition shall pass and file with the Secretary of the Treasury a resolution or agreement to close the Exposition on Sunday.

Mr. Pattison, of Ohio, then obtained the floor, and said:—

It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that there has not been a more important question before the House this session than the one now before the Committee. The United States is a peculiar country. The Sabbath of our country is a peculiar Sabbath. It is known as the American Sabbath all over the wide world.

The Sabbath day is recognized in some way by every civilized nation of the world, but the Sabbath, as we understand it, is peculiar to the United States alone, and hence we can very properly call it the American Sabbath. To us the Sabbath day was a part of our very being. It came with the Magflower; it came with almost every band of Pilgrims; it was the corner stone of every State. It was in the web and woof of every State Constitution, its spirit permeates every article of the Confederation of States, and when the Constitution was adopted the American Sabbath was as firmly established in the hearts of the American people as was the spirit of liberty itself, and we but voice the sentiment of the many millions of Christian people in all sections of the country, when we declare in favor of the American Sabbath, and by our votes say that the World's Fair shall not be open on the Sabbath day. [Cries of "Vote!" "Vote!"]

Mr. HOPKINS, of Illinois. What would the gentleman do with those people who have Saturday for their Sabbath?

Mr. PATTISON, of Ohio. There are very few of those, and while they remerate the religious ideas of their own people, they respect American institutions.

Mr. HOPKINS, of Illinois. But their conscientious scruples are as sacred to them as those who desire the doors to be closed on Sunday.

Mr. PATTISON, of Ohio. Certainly, and as such they are entitled to consideration.

Thus cavalierly are the different objections treated, objections that are founded in reason and a just conception of the limitations of congressional action; and yet Mr. Holman says these men all understand this question, and are fully determined upon it in their own minds. Certainly the last part of his assertion is apparent.

Mr. PAYNTER, of Kentucky, then offers as an amendment to the substitute of Mr. Stone, the following:—

Provided, That the building, or buildings, containing the Government exhibit, shall not be open to visitors on Sunday.

This amendment was voted upon and rejected. Without having accomplished anything further, the Committee arose and reported that no conclusion had been reached.

Thus closed, for that day, the most remarkable scene ever witnessed in the Congress of the United States, but to be reopened the following day. The report of this day's proceedings on this question occupy more than eight full columns of the Congressional Record.

On the next day, May 26, the House, being again in the Committee of the Whole, with Mr. Lester, of Georgia, in the Chair, a long and unsuccessful effort was made to postpone the decision of the Sunday-closing question until the remainder of the bill had been considered and passed upon. There was a repetition of the wild and disorderly scene of the previous day. Mr. Stout offered an amendment to the substitute for the original amendment which was before the House, reading as follows:—

All buildings containing the exhibits under the control of the United States shall remain closed on Sunday, and no intoxicating liquors shall at any time be sold therein.

This was rejected. Great confusion ensued, in the course of which Mr. Williams moved that each member "be allowed an hour to read the Illinois statute on this subject." This, it was impossible to grant, probably because, outside of parliamentary reasons, it would have necessitated a full course in civil government and religion for a majority of the members in order to their comprehension of the anomalous place which the statutes of this character hold in our law.

The confusion and disorder increased until the Chairman was obliged to suspend business until order was restored. The clerk then read the full text of the substitute and amendment before the House, as follows:—

That before any money appropriated by the Government is paid, the Managers of the Columbian Exposition shall pass and file with the Secretary of the Treasury a resolution and agreement to close the Exposition on Sunday.

Provided, That no part of this appropriation shall be available until the Board of Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition shall give satisfactory assurances that no intoxicating liquors will be sold on the grounds of said Exposition.

This being put to vote, was lost, on the first vote, 37 to 122, on a second vote, tellers being ordered, 43 to 124.

Mr. Dockery, of Missouri, then offered, as a substitute for the original proposition, offered by Mr. Johnstone, this proviso:—

Provided, That the Government exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday.

this was carried, ayes 131, noes 36.

Thus the House of Representatives, by a vote of almost four to one, committed itself to this acknowledged religious legislation, and, if Mr. Holman can be believed, did so deliberately, and after due consideration.

A NOTABLE incident immediately followed this decision of the Sunday-closing question. As the quickest way of suggesting to the House, evidently, the utter impropriety of the action it had just taken, Mr. Bowers, of California, offered an amendment to this action, and made the accompanying remarks as follows:—

Resolved, That the Government exhibits at the World's Fair shall not be opened to the public or the Sabbath day; which is Saturday.

Mr. BOWERS. This is a religious question, and Saturday is the only Sabbath day. It was the Sabbath day when Christ was on earth, and it is the Sabbath day now. [Cries of "Vote!" "Vote!"]

The question being taken.

THE CHAIRMAN said. The noes seem to have it.

Mr. BOWERS. I call for a division.

The question again being taken, the amendment of Mr. Bowers was rejected; there being ayes 11, noes 149.

A private letter from Washington says of the reception which this nobly outspoken expression of truth and fact received in the House: "It was met with derision, laughter, and contempt, by every member in the House. I suppose the proposition is that Christ is dead, but there are a great many living men who have votes—hence the derision."

Notice was given by Mr. Lynch, of Wisconsin, that he would call for the yeas and nays in the House on the proposition to close the Government exhibit on Sunday, which had just been passed. Mr. Bergen, of New Jersey, then offered a further amendment, as follows:—

And provided further, The employes in the service of the Fair during the week shall be relieved from service and others employed in their places on Sunday.

This was rejected, and nothing further was offered in reference to the Sunday closing of the Fair, other business being then resumed.

The report of the second day's proceedings in regard to Sunday at the World's Fair occupies six full columns of the Congressional Record.

The day following this action of the House in Committee of the Whole, Representative William A. Stone, of Pennsylvania, sent a telegram to the United Presbyterian General Assembly, in session at Pittsburg, which conveys some information, and read between the lines is full of suggestions. This is the telegram:—

DR. DAVID MACDILL, Moderator U. P. Assembly. Telegram received. House action yesterday only a preliminary skirmish to the battle that will be fought on special bill appropriating $3,000,000. We think it can not pass without proviso closing Exposition on Sabbath. Yeas and nays can then be called.

W. A. STONE.

"Only a preliminary skirmish," the "Yeas and nays can then be called," these are not phrases without meaning. The congressmen who object to the levy of "political blackmail"—which this means,—and who intend to place themselves on record, when the yeas and nays are called, as standing for civil liberty and equity, and religious truth and righteousness, should note carefully these phrases and study their meaning.

If this is only a brush on the skirmish line, it may perhaps be hoped that in the contest to which this is preliminary there may be so full a presentation of the principles which should govern Congress in regard to such legislation as this, that Mr. Holman's assertion that "Everybody understands this question," may then be true, before the final vote is cast; so that, if the wrong be chosen, it be not chosen through ignorance.

The sentiment of those who have charge of matters pertaining to the World's Fair in the Senate, has been expressed by Senator Pettigrew, of South Dakota, Chairman of the Committee on the Columbian Exposition, in an interview, to a reporter for the Mail and Express. The interviewer says:—

The Senator has taken a positive stand against deserening the Sabbath by opening the Exposition on that day. "The action of the House yesterday, when sitting as a Committee of the Whole," he said, "insures, I think, the closing of the Exposition on Sunday." The Senator said that the Senate Committee, of which he is chairman, was in favor of closing the Exposition on Sunday. "I have no doubt," he added, "that the sentiment for closing the Exposition on the Sabbath will be successful.

Not long ago our Committee had protests against Sunday opening from over five hundred and twenty thousand persons, and now the number has doubled. Only a few Adventists, who think our Sunday is not the Sabbath, have proclaimed themselves in favor of Sunday opening."

Then you think the action of the House means Sunday closing? "I do not see how it can be interpreted otherwise."

If the reporter has represented the Senator fairly, what Mr. Holman said of the House is not true of the Senate, for here is, then, one senator, and that too, Chairman of the World's Fair Committee, who does not understand this question. No one with the least comprehension of the principles at stake in this matter would say that the "Adventists have proclaimed themselves in favor of Sunday opening." They are intelligent enough to understand that they have no more right to petition for Sunday opening than others have for Sunday closing. Their petition is that Congress should avoid legislation upon that over which it has no jurisdiction, either to close or to open. If the reporter has been just to Mr. Pettigrew, his place is not in the United States Senate, Chairman of the Committee on the World's Fair, but in the district school at the foot of the classes in civil government and United States history. But Mr. Pettigrew has his peers both in the House and the Senate.

The flood-gates are about to open. We shall see what we shall see, and we shall see it soon.
