THE House of Representatives, in Congress assembled, on May 23, upon a division being taken, decided by deliberate vote that the day of the week commonly known as Sunday is the Sabbath. Incidentally, in connection with this, it was ordered that no ice should be sold or delivered in the District of Columbia, upon the Sabbath which the House of Representatives had created as distinctively and legislatively the United States Sabbath, except within certain specified hours.
