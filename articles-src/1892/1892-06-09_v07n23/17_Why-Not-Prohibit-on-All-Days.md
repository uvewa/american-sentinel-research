A National Reform organ says,—

We believe the reading of such matter as the Sunday papers contain, keeping the mind in its week-day ruts of fashion and politics and business, is unhealthy for the mind as well as the soul, but if this reading was sold on Saturday we could only protest; we could not prohibit.

And why not prohibit it on one day as well as on another? Has not the State as much right to guard the morals of the people one day as it has to guard them on another day? If it is the people who are to be protected, why not protect them alike on all days? It is not however the people but the day that is to be guarded. It is the day about which the safeguards of the law are to be thrown. It is the day that is to be honored. Whether it is better or worse for the people is a minor consideration. Sunday must be exalted to a place above other days, and so acts not only harmless, but even necessary on other days are forbidden and declared to be criminal on Sunday, for no other reason than because of the supposed sacred character of the day. Sunday laws have no other object than to compel the observance of a religious institution, and would have no existence but for the religious character of the day.
