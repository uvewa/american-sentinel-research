Or the five Seventh-day Adventist defendants tried in Henry County, Tenn., for working on Sunday, we say established before the jury by their trials, the Judge was particularly fair and reasonable. The other four were found guilty, and after one's being convicted of that nature, Judge Swiggart was affixed the nominal fine of one dollar and costs. This in order "the offence stands, virtually, an arraignment of the religion of these men, as a church and was not unwisely to remain on the statute books."

The *Congressional Record* now regularly contains, in the columns of petitions and memorials, a record of the presentation of memorials from the Seventh-day Baptists against the same discrimination against Congress on religious matters. The full text of these memorial is respectful objections. The language of the petition is dignified and elevated while the reference to the report of Hon. Richard M. Johnson on the question of the Sunday mail service, in the Twentieth, and now the Twenty-first, Congress, should draw the members to the Fifty-third Congress to the constitutional position on this subject; the publication of which must here either be upheld or demolished.

In the course of the trial of the Adventists, in Henry County, Tenn., referred to on another page, the Attorney-General was usually trying to get a witness to say that he had seen the defendant at work on Sunday, asked rather unguardedly,— "Well, what does he do on Sunday; does he go to church?" The question was apparently

meant. If the defendant was not in the habit of going to church on Sunday the inference would be clear as to how a person's habitual absence from church on Sunday will be taken as *prima facie* evidence of Sunday desecration.

How long will it be before habitual absence from church on Sunday will be taken as *prima facie* evidence of Sunday desecration?

In Adventist cases, in Henry County, Tenn., both the Judge and the Attorney-General insisted that it was not a question of religious belief and practice but of obedience to a civil law; yet the Attorney-General treated it as a matter of religious belief by asking witnesses as to their church relations, the character of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and by seeking to make it appear that one of the defendants did not work on Saturday, because he did not go to church on that day. A quest mentioned in the Sunday itself?

"The time has come," says the *Mail and Express*, "to call a halt in the use of public money for purely sectarian purposes." Why not say that the time has come to call a halt in the use of public money for religious purposes and to confine the operations of civil government, both State and national, to its legitimate purposes? Simply because that is not what the *Mail and Express* means. It means to keep religion in politics. And to keep religion what is its friends wish it to mean, it is only a skillfully arranged bait to catch the credulous and unsecured.

REV. MR. MCGILL, of Allegheny, said, in the Pittsburg Sunday Convention, "Are we going too far in this matter? No, we are asking only obedience to the law, we are going to stand by it. If the law is bad, let it be enforced as the best way of repealing it." The same argument might have been used, in its exact detail form two hundred years ago in Massachusetts in justification of the witchcraft craze. They only enforced the law; and as the law was not bad, the outrage continued under cover of it did finally arouse the people to a sense of the enormity committed. Are we really so blind to the lessons of history, that besides the luckless victims of the faith is exorcised. The fury of the bigot has spent itself, has the violation of their human rights was dead. The best thing to do with a bad law is to repeal it; the next best thing is to allow it to fall into "innocuous desuetude." The worst thing in the world that can be made of a bad law is to enforce it.—*Mr. McG., at the Pittsburgh Sunday Convention, for worse.*
