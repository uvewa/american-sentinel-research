To the student of history and of politics the Province of Quebec, in the Dominion of Canada, furnishes a modern object lesson in the exhibition of the power of an established dominant Church to control the State, to develop its ecclesiastical polity, and to carry out its temporal and spiritual designs unchecked, as well as to maintain and perpetuate itself by influencing and controlling the political action of its adherents. No modern European or American State furnishes such an example of complete spiritual unity, which is the synonym of national unity.

By the census of 1881, the population of the Province was 1,359,027; of this number the Romish Church claimed 1,170,000, and thus outnumbered all other sects nearly a million. Of the entire population of the Dominion, 4,324,810, nearly two millions were members of the Roman communion. With such a preponderance of numbers it is master of the politico-religious situation in Quebec, and is able by its powerful organization and influence to direct and control legislation in its behalf in the Dominion Parliament at Ottawa, as well as in some, if not all, of the neighboring provinces. The extent of this power is best indicated by what it claims to have accomplished in legislation, as an important factor in the conservative party since the federation.

Among the measures in which it takes a particular pride are: (a) The law establishing religious orders, under which the bounty of the State is bestowed upon religious refugees from persecutions in France and other countries. (b) The law authorizing the organization of canonical parishes as civil corporations having a legal existence: a law which emphasizes the close relation of Church and State. (c) The law exempting ecclesiastical and religious educational property from taxation, provincial or municipal. Such property in the Province of Quebec is supposed to be worth a hundred million dollars. (d) The law by which the education of all classes is put under the immediate control of a body ruled by the bishops of the Roman Church, and which was obtained by their influence.

This, with the law establishing in Canada foreign religious orders, marks a long step backward towards the days of religious propaganda, whose shackles even Italy long since cast off, declining longer to yield the control of its public schools to any religious body. In complete harmony with this legislation is the Act of the Province, passed in 1888, giving to the Jesuits $400,000 as compensation for their estates confiscated by the British Government; of which sum $60,000 was assigned to Protestant educational purposes to satisfy the opposition.

This act of the province has been described by Goldwin Smith as "a rampant assertion of Roman Catholic ascendancy, by the endowment, out of a public fund, of an order formed especially for the subversion of Protestantism, and at the same time a recognition of the Pope as the ecclesiastical sovereign of Quebec."

Another instance of this ascendancy is the granting of a special lottery charter by the Dominion Parliament to the Province of Quebec for church or educational or charitable purposes; such associations being classed as criminal under the general law of the Dominion. But these are but modern additions to a power almost imperial. With the consent of Great Britain, Canada was allowed to retain, with her language and law (the Code Napoleon), the dime ecclesiastique and the dime seigneuriale; the former still survives in full vigor, the latter having been extinguished in 1834.

Among the most significant victories of the Church, and, to an American, one of the most intolerant of its hierarchical measures, is the division of the public school fund. The effect of this division of the school fund instead of softening racial prejudices and increasing social harmony, has been to increase intolerance and intensify social feeling, and to create them where they had no previous existence. The division of the school fund is the entering wedge of social disintegration.

Ultramontanism is in the ascendant. The hostility and preponderance of the Romanists and their intolerance of Protestants are rapidly driving out all opposing elements.

The New England of the Puritans is rapidly becoming the New England of the Romanists. The French Canadians swarm in our northern manufacturing villages, and it is their hope and belief, carefully fostered by their teachers, that at a time not far distant, the Roman Church will not only dominate New England, but the whole of Canada eastward of the Ottawa River.

The Government of Quebec is as clearly a hierarchy as was that of Rome during the temporal power of the Pope, or as the Government of Massachusetts Bay two and a half centuries ago.—George R. Stetson, in Andover Review, May.
