THE Observer complains that—

while tens of thousands of Christian people all over the land have been protesting against the opening of the Chicago World's Fair on Sunday, the managers have thrown open the Fair grounds on that day to all who care to pay a small admission fee. This is letting the camel's head in with a vengeance. It is evident that measures more vigorous than any yet taken will be needed to induce the management of the Fair to so far conform to American customs, and the truest American public sentiment, as to close the institution on Sunday.

That is, the boycott must be invoked, simply because the people of Chicago are now permitted to go for pay where they formerly had the privilege of going free of charge—namely, to one of the parks of the city? How long will it be until the demand will be made that the people be excluded from the parks altogether?
