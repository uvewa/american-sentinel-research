The complaint that the conscience of Christian people all over the land is being shocked because Sunday opening agents have thrown open the Fair grounds on that day is not in accordance with the facts. This is letting the camel's head in with a vengeance. The boycott of the whole Christian people of America involves forcing the rest of the Fair to so far conform to American ecclesiastical requirements, no matter what the voluntary regrets the day or manner.

That is, the boycott must be invoked, simply because the people of Chicago are not as penurious as for we go where they formerly had the privilege of going free of charge—namely, to one of the parks of the city? How long will it be until the demand will be made that the street cars be excluded from the parks altogether?
