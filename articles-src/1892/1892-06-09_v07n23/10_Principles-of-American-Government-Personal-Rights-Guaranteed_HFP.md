The foundation upon which this Government is built, and which has made it the best Government on the earth, is civil and religious liberty. This is, in fact the only true foundation for civil government. Where individual rights are respected and guarded, we see prosperity; but the reverse of this where these are trampled under foot, by any class who may happen to be in power.

In this country as in no other, all, whether Jew or Gentile, Christian or infidel, stand before the law upon a level, while in matters of conscience, the most perfect freedom is guaranteed to all, by the fundamental law. This is perfectly just; for a law to be just must treat all alike, and civil governments must not recognize any one religion, but give freedom and protection to all alike; and taking the care that no one class of religionists shall go beyond and infringe upon the rights of another class of religionists.

Civil government can not decide as to which is the true religion; for should it make the attempt, it would, as in the days of Constantine, be a human decision—a wrong decision might be made. But to avoid the conclusion of a possible error, the next logical step would be to decide that the power that made the decision was infallible. This is just what Rome did. Governments can not decide in matters of religion; for religion is purely a matter of the heart and conscience of the individual. Each must be left perfectly free to decide in this important matter as between his own soul and his Maker. If at any time governments invade these sacred rights, the realm of conscience in any one person, true liberty is gone; for if it may invade in the one person where is the limit? There is none. It is a grand thought that these rights are guaranteed by our national Constitution. Article VI., last clause, reads:—

No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.

George Washington when asked if he thought religious rights were sufficiently guarded by the Constitution—made answer that if he thought they were not, no man would be more willing that it should be changed than himself.

It is a remarkable fact that the very first Congress that ever met under the Constitution adopted the following as the First Amendment:—

Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

Thus we see it was the studied intention of the founders of this Government, in the formation of that document, that the utmost freedom of conscience should be forever enjoyed by all the subjects of this Republic. However, to have forever secured this most desirable of all objects, one more amendment should have been adopted at that very time, prohibiting all and every State from engaging in this very work. It is a most humiliating thought with all our boasted claims of liberty, that almost every State in the Union has some law more or less stringent in matters of religion, partaking of the spirit of the Dark Ages, which, in the hands of bigotry and superstition, can be, in fact are being, made the cause of much suffering to quiet, inoffensive citizens. These laws are just so much a union of Church and State in this country. They are a blot upon our national record, and should be repealed at once.—H. F. P., in Labor's Tribune.
