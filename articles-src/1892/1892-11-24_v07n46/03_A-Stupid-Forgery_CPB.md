# A Stupid Forgery.

WE have received several copies of what purports to be a letter of the Pope of Rome to the Jesuits of the United States. There are various other "letters" similar in character, and doubtless of similar origin, which claim that the "encyclical letters" are being widely circulated throughout the country. We have no particular purpose in referring to this, as it is difficult to say since they are evidently common forgeries; but we give a paragraph from one of these "letters" as a sample:

> Moreover, we proclaim the people of the United States of America to have forfeited all right to rule said republic, and also all dominion, dignity and privileges appertaining to it, and we likewise declare that all who assist in this usurpation of the government of the United States, and every individual who has taken the oath of loyalty or allegiance to the government of the United States of America, or who in any way assists, whether it be voluntarily or not, or acts, as also from all duty, fidelity or obedience, or whatever other responsibility we may owe.

This is enough to brand the production as a forgery, but the next paragraph contains a literary blunder, which conclusively shows that it never came from the Pope, or from any authority to speak for him; for the writer makes the Pope say that with him is the management of the church and its temporal possessions. The blunder of this production is a blunder of the worst character—a blunder which an educated man would never make.

When the feast of Ignatius Loyola occurs in the calendar of the church, perhaps the document will be set at rest.

No modern Pope ever wrote, "We shall religiously observe that or our accession from all usurpations," etc., meaning thereby, "religiously observe or maintain them," etc. Nor is this the only glaring evidence of forgery in the document.

The other and longer "letter" contains even more extravagant things than the one from which we have quoted. In its addressed, "To our beloved children in the faith," and among other absurd things contains this paragraph:—

> We are opposed to any system of schools that produces thinking not in accord with the Catholic Church, and to all schools wherein their children are taught that that accursed system of liberty, a waste of time and money, when the body perishes it has no more claim than an animal for this world. Therefore we call upon you our faithful children to lend your efforts against all these systems, the work of Protestantism, which have compelled us to set up and maintain at our expense our own system of schools.

Anybody who can believe that the above is a genuine papal deliverance is quite capable of believing anything. The Pope has many faults, it may be admitted; but her Pope and her bishops are not fools; and no man in his right mind who had had they sent out such letters as it is claimed these are.

Our object in referring to these so-called "papal encyclicals" is not to defend the Catholic Church nor the Catholic faith; we have merely called the attention of our readers against that false Protestantism that is so destitute of genuine principle, trickery and falsehood (doing evil that good? they say may come) as to resort to such flat stupidity as that exhibited in these forged "letters" from the Vatican.

C. P. B.
