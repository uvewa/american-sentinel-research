Every thoughtful person, on reading the recent decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that "this is a Christian Nation," well knew that the next step would be to raise the controversy as to what kind of a "Christian Nation" this "Christian Nation" is. As sure as like causes produce like effects, and as sure as Constantine's adoption of "Christianity" as the religion of the Roman Empire demanded an official decision as to which of the contending sects were entitled to be called Christian, so sure will the question now have to be settled in this country, what kind of a "Christian Nation" this "Christian Nation" is.

The movement to determine this has already begun, and begun by opposing elements. The Christian Statesman is contending for one kind of Christianity, the New York Independent for another. The Christian Statesman, the paper which has so long been working to make this a "Christian Nation" by national law, was the quickest to catch the decision of the Supreme Court and publish it to the world and to rejoice in the accomplishment of its long sought purpose. But now, just as was expected, this paper complains editorially, that notwithstanding this is a "Christian Nation," made so "by the highest authority in the land," nevertheless it is not a "Christian Nation" because Christian Statesman Christianity is not in control of the Government. Here are its words:—

You certainly believe that Christ is the king and head of this Nation. It has been declared, by the highest authority of the land, to be a Christian Nation. Of course it can be a Christian Nation only by virtue of a real relation to Christ as its king. No man or body of men is Christian that is not in subjection to him as Lord. On next Tuesday you will cast the deciding ballot. And in view of the personal character of the great majority of the present rulers, is there not a solemn call made upon you to pause and seriously consider the whole question before you cast another vote?

And is it not a matter for very serious consideration, in determining the question of casting your vote, on next Tuesday, that in neither of the platforms of principles put forth by the two great parties, which ask for your suffrage is the name of God mentioned, or the slightest deliverance given with reference to any of the great moral questions that are pressing to day for solution.

What a Babylon of contradictions: "This is a Christian Nation." "No man or body of men is Christian that is not in subjection to him as Lord." The "great majority of our present rulers" are not subject to him, therefore "turn the rascals out" and put third-party-Prohibition-Christians in and thereby make this a "Christian Nation." This is a Christian Nation now because it has been so declared "by the highest authority in the land," but it is not a Christian Nation and can not be until the Christianity we have nominated is elected.

The New York Independent does not endorse Christian Statesman Christianity, that is, third-party-Prohibition-Christianity, but electioneered for Republican Christianity, exhorting "Christian voters" to "rise early and pray before you vote" and "cast a ballot in approval of solid Christian character"—vote the Republican ticket. In the eyes of the Christian Statesman, Republican Christianity is anti-Christian. In the eyes of the Independent, Christian Statesman Christianity is anti-Christian. With this difference of opinion among Protestants as to which kind of "Christianity" should be professed by this "Christian Nation," and with the greater difference of opinion between Protestants and Catholics on the same point, which kind of "Christianity" shall this "Christian Nation" adopt? One thing is sure; the "Christianity" which this "Christian Nation" shall decide to endorse will not be Christianity any more than that was Christianity which was adopted by Constantine as the religion of his Empire, and which drenched the earth in blood.
