# The Churches and the Government.

IT is worth serious inquiry as to what will be the effect upon the churches of taking the Government of the United States in their hands, as they have done.

When we find out what will be the effect upon the churches, it can easily be seen what the effect will be upon the State. And especially the body of Christ and the State, it will be easy to know what the effect will be upon society, as a whole.

Now this is not at all difficult. The results of this procedure have already begun to appear in such measure as to present a perfectly safe criterion. The outcome can be known without any theorizing at all; all that is necessary is candidly to consider facts as they stand before us now and the people at the present moment.

The manner in which the churches succeeded in getting the Government into their hands is in itself a revelation as to what their attitude is as to what the effect will be upon the churches. The complete history of this has already been given in these columns. We shall not repeat this any further than to print again the resolution that was sent up to Congress from the "evangelical" churches in all parts of the country, which, after presenting what Congress should do with respect to the World\'s Fair, runs as follows:\u2014

> And your petitioners further pray each other, that we will from this time henceforth employ all the means in our power to promote the observance of the Sabbath as a day of sacred rest; any member of Congress, other representatives, who shall vote for any further aid of any kind for the World\'s Fair on conditions named in these resolutions.

As it is now universally known these threats succeeded, and both Senate and House yielded to this demand rather than to risk the threatened loss of votes and jeopardize their "coming back again," it is likewise well known that those who thus secured this legislation have repeatedly announced since that this demonstrates that they can have anything they want; if they will only stand together in demanding it; and that they do intend to make such demands for further favors and further subjection of the Government. Now we quote something worthy of the candid attention of every honest church-member in the land. If those who are already in Congress will thus play into the hands of the churches in order to "come back" there, then will not those who want to get there play likewise into the hands of the churches in order to get there? When, from this universal advertiser, it is understood that the churches hold within their gift the offices and places of trust of the Nation, then will not these same churches become the shielded objects of the courting and solicitation of the office-seekers of the land, and especially of the most unscrupulous of the office-seekers? And that the only fair answer that can be made to these questions is, *Yes, they will.*

THEN, in order to make their courtship and solicitation for office most effectual, these office-seekers will become church-members themselves. And having joined the Church for political purposes they will use their membership for political purposes. And as they are they corrupted the churches will be but so many political clubs and coteries to be "worked" for all that can be made of them. This is not theory, nor is it far-fetched. It is the plainly stated calculation of the leaders of the Sunday-law movement. For years it has been the calculation of the officers of the National Woman\'s Christian Temperance Union that "now when it is a question of power, merely\u2014of marshalling and guarding the homes which are the sanctuaries of Christ\'s gospel, we women believe that no day is for good, no place too consecrated, for the declaration of principles *and of the determining of votes*." And in an editorial notice of a Sunday-law meeting in this city, *The Evening Telegram* (Baptist) says:\u2014

> Congress may change its mind; the present is no time for jubilation, but it is bad\u2014we beg\u2014time for the phrases; a time for wire-pulling and hard fighting.

Now when it is so openly and so frankly announced by those who are occupying the leading positions in the churches that their "holy" and their sacred places shall be turned into political hustings, and that they will devote themselves to "wire-pulling and hard fighting"\u2014when things take the lead in this, is it not inevitable that the office-seekers who would court their influence and votes are at these declarations of theirs but an ask bid for such procedures on the part of just such classes as these?

Nor is political favor the only bid which these same churches hold out for the purpose of securing desirable results. We see "political churches hire out as vote." So publican are their financial transactions. In congratulating himself and his followers upon the success of their threatening efforts upon Congress, the president of the American Sabbath Union exclaimed:\u2014

> The fuss of the law is happy. It gives us a lever of 4000 miles so delicate, I press it over here and say that our goddess bank accepted it.

As these churches have in their power thus to put a money premium upon doing the will of the Church, it is self-evident that in the nature of things they will speedily secure large accessions to their members in rank "right" doing. When the Church is enabled thus to prove satisfaction, that "godliness hath great gain," it is inevitable that there will be speedily added to her numbers those who will be able to prove just as readily to their own satisfaction that "gain is godliness." And the deduction of these latter will be just as true and as honest as his boast that the Church has already succeeded.

Neither have they stopped with the attempt upon Congress, and the World\'s Fair Directors. They are applying the principle in general practice. Witness the financial bargain\u2014give their moral and financial support which the churches of the West Side of the city of Chicago have entered into with the managers of the theatre; the theatre, and the boycotting combination which the churches of the West Side effect speedily bore living fruit which is significant of the whole line of things which was being considered; to end which boycotting effect a meeting was held, and after considerable discussion it was decided to close on Sunday, was passed September 18. On October 11, another meeting of the same kind was held at a modest part of the city. The announcement and programme were printed on a large card which was about half filled with advertisements, among which the card put in this style:\u2014

More than this; we know of an instance whereby only last month, a money bribe was actually offered by the churches in a certain place, and the proposition was conveyed through a preacher, to secure the closing of a certain institution on Sundays. And in perfect consonance with this, if not actually suggestive of it, the *Union Signal* of October 20, 1892, publishes editorially, from Joseph Cook, the statement that "there is more wealth behind the churches and the respectable portion of society that stands behind all the opposition of Sunday closing." The statement is worth reproducing in full as it is made in the very connection in which we have used it. It is as follows:\u2014

> We believe that with the wealth of the churches behind the enforcement of Sunday closing [of the World\'s Fair], we believe that it should continue to be exercised vigorously by the Friends of Sunday rest, to secure complete enforcement. . . . Nothing but the organized force of churches and of the wealth, religion, intelligence, moral sentiment of the best elements of the population, and of the patronage of the press of the country favor them from obvious nefarious motives. So does the law of God as interpreted by the vast majority of the citizens of the United States. So does the law of the land, as interpreted to mean the enforced Sunday rest when contested, and are already triumphant in the preliminary contest.

YET more than this, they are actually wielding the saloons to secure Sunday closing of all other things. The *Christian Statesman* of October 29, quoting the *Sabbath Union* for October, 1892, reprints an article from the *American Sabbath Union* [the national organ of the annual sabbath law part.], called "The Richmond Experience," to which the Sunday-closing saloon is fairly declared to be "a reputable" and open of "good repute." It seems to be a report in the paper *Rencontre*, in this State, giving a flattering account of the progress of Sunday observance by the saloons. The article is long, and we can present only a few extracts. Here is one:\u2014

> If liquor sellers can make as much, or nearly as much, by working six days as they can in seven, the question is solved.

And here is another:\u2014

> The chief underlying consideration is that the liquor covering question is no action to place the business under the protection of law instead of making it contraband, as the opposite policy does. It is much easier to regulate it with a license than it would be to suppress it by prohibition.

And here is yet another, and stronger, too:\u2014

> The effect of Sunday closing has been to sharply discriminate the reputable from the disreputable saloon, and certainly to relieve the disreputable of their share. . . . Over the practical side of the question there is no dispute. The amount of business done by the reputable liquor dealers has not been reduced; hence Congress might have proceeded, etc.

And then the writer says: "there is considerably more liquor sold Saturday night and used at home on Sunday than before the saloons were closed on that day." Nevertheless he adds: "yet we are not losing these customers to get their supplies the day before, and keep their business closed."

And all these things are being done by the leaders and managers of the churches in the United States\u2014and professed Protestant churches at that. How much worse could they do if they made no pretensions to religion at all? But when these things are all being done, not only by professed religionists, but by the very ones who set themselves forth as the representatives of Christianity itself, how infinitely worse it is than it does by persons making no pretensions of religion! This is what the opponents of Sunday laws and Sunday observance get at a disadvantage. These Sunday law workers can, and do, and will, employ all their means of getting men out of employ and of impoverishing those who oppose them, against all who oppose them. They will literally stop at nothing. These churches have their way by all means. The observance of Sunday, however, they are demanding by law for these reasons, is not for religious rest by any means that can be employed to secure it. It is to extend the facts which we have here set down\u2014and that they are facts is patent to the whole people of the United States.

How exactly do these declensions and actions of these churches fulfil the prophecy that was spoken concerning them long ago: that they, as falling Babylon, would "become the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird?" Rev. 18:2. That hole is now prepared. That cage is set its doors are open. And she is to-day holding forth the luring baits that will inevitably draw into her every foul spirit and every unclean and hateful bird. And the Christians who continue to stay in these churches and under these leaders are making themselves responsible for their sins. There are Christians in these churches who should not be there, because of the evil and the abominations that are being wrought in them. And these now God sends the call, "Come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." And all who would really save their step to take before her sins shall have reached unto heaven and God shall remember her iniquities. Rev. 18:4, 5.

THERE is another scripture that describes the fulfillment of just such a state of things as it exists to-day. It is 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

> This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

Think of it! In a land of professed Christianity and Christians, where a form of religion is highest and all, carried to its most exacting demands, and of all of Congress has done by these professing reference to a people making profession to Christianity\u2014*Christianity is denied.* It was worse and worse deceiving and being deceived. It is men "having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof;" which are to accomplish it are being done before the eyes of the people of this land. It is not high time that whosoever would be the friends of Christ, of the truth and righteousness, should awake? May Heaven help the people to see.
