# The Mormon Question Again.

THE result of the recent election which gave the Democratic Party in possession of every branch of the Government, excepting the Supreme Court, has revived in a special manner the question of the admission of Utah to the family of States.

The question is even now before Congress, and it is thought by some that the leaders of the Mormon church would intrench themselves in power by quietly absorbing control of the whole Territory, regardless of their fitness to become sovereign States.

Each of these Territories has in it an anti-Mormon population, though it is very doubtful if either Arizona or New Mexico has Mormon majorities to even raise the balance of power between the two parties. The danger is in the Mormon church becoming a party powerful enough to seize the reins of civic government.

But be the case as it may with the other Territories seeking admission to the Union, certain it is that there is a majority, a large majority, of Mormons actually a fair, a live issue in Utah; and Congress has no right to neglect it. The whole matter of conferring Statehood on a people that is to-day actually subject to a theocracy hardly less arbitrary than the theocracy of Israel, with republican institutions, and so wedded to two kindred relics of barbarism, namely, polygamy and a union of church and state.

The right of the Government to prohibit polygamy can not be successfully questioned, and yet, strange to say, it has seldom been denied on correct grounds.

The right of the State to forbid the practice of plural marriage has been placed almost entirely on non-religious grounds, rather than for civil reasons—because polygamy lowers the moral tone of a community and destroys inalienable human rights. It is wrong, because it violates the equality of the sexes and the equal rights of all.

It is very true, as has been maintained, that polygamy is not religion of the moral law—the law of God—but that is not the the reason that civil government should prohibit it; it should be prohibited because it is destructive of natural human rights. The Government is not the judge of the divine law, and can never become such without assuming the most absolute form of tyranny. Congress should see to it that Utah's constitution be so framed as to bind the Constitution and statutes of a sovereign State; but it should also see to it that this question is not made the occasion of further committing the Government to the policy of defining and of establishing by law the boundaries of religious faith.
