[From the Christian Patriot, Morristown, Tenn., Sept. 15, 1891. For comment see last page.]

The Sunday laws are not at all religious. They have two objects: first to secure everyone his right to a weekly day of rest; and, secondly, to prevent the disturbance by worldly noise and business of those who rest on Sunday. Even infidels must admit that a weekly rest day is promotive of health and intelligence, and that it is just that those who wish to worship should be protected from annoyance.

Mr. R. M. King, of west Tennessee, is a Seventh-day Adventist. We regret his errors; but if reason can not convince him of them persecution will not. He is a farmer. He rested on Saturday and ploughed on Sunday. He was arrested and fined under the statute. He paid his fine and ploughed again. He is now prosecuted under the common law. The Seventh-day Adventists took his case up. It has gone through the State courts and has just been decided against him by the United States Circuit Court. It is to be appealed to the Supreme Court. We hope Mr. King will gain his case. For, first, he has complied substantially with the objects of the Sunday laws. He and his household rest one day every week. And his ploughing at a distance from any church is not an annoyance to worship. It is a shame that he should be punished while railroad companies and daily papers rob thousands of a rest day and disturb the Sabbaths of large sections and great cities.

The case calls attention to the importance of carefully amending the Sunday laws. They should forbid the employing of men to work on Sunday. No one except an idiot will work on Sunday unless compelled to do so. The penalty should rest wholly upon the employer. And secondly, those who conscientiously and really observe any other day as a Sabbath should be exempted from the law, provided they do their Sunday work in such a way and at such a place as not to disturb the Sabbath quiet of the first day of the week. The exemption would only apply to those who do rest on Saturday, and it would permit them to employ on Sunday only those who have rested on Saturday. Such a law should have the support of Seventh-day Adventists, Jews and infidels.
