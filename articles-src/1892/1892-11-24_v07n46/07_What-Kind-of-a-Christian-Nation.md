# What Kind of a Christian Nation?

EVERY thoughtful person, on reading the late decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that "this is a Christian Nation," must realize the fact that it is idle to raise the controversy as to what is the true intent of the words, "a Christian Nation." Is it, and are we like examples of a Christian "Nation?" and the title of the distinctive adoption of "Christianity" as meaning something more than the mere mandate an official decision on which it is founded and an official decree in which it has been included, are more words worthy to be called Christian, as sure will the question, what kind of Christianity is meant by the "Christian Nation?" question mark this distinction.

The controversy about this is not recent. It already began, and began by opposing the very decree itself; contending for the contending for one kind of Christianity, and against the decree which favored another. The *Christian Statesman,* the paper which advocates the express recognition of "Christian Nation" by national law, was greatly delighted with the decision of the Supreme Court and publish it to the utmost in the advancement and furtherance of the long sought purposes. But now, just as was expected, comes from another quarter a protest against calling this a "Christian Nation," made on the ground that while it is a "Christian Nation" in principle, nevertheless it is not a "Christian Nation" by law; that is that the Nation's Christianity is not in control of the Government.

> We certainly believe that Christ is the king and head of this Nation; but we believe this with the highest authority of the land. Yet we do not presently admit that this Nation is "a Christian Nation" by law; for neither the Constitution nor any law or State or body of men is a Christian that is not by the law a Christian people. We maintain that of course we believe that the law should be so interpreted, and the personal character of the great statesmen of the Nation should be what men of truth always expect; you to pause and seriously consider the question where such a position would lead in the case of any other religion gaining the ascendency, in determining the question of nationality. . . . We are not quite ready to accept a decree of the Supreme Court as a substitute for our political parties, which ask for your suffrage and for recognition as Christian.
