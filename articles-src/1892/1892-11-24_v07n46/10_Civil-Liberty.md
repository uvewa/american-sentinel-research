# Civil Liberty.*

THE general importance in that civil liberty and religious liberty are so often written, both voluntarily, and by a common purpose and actuated by a desire to promote those rights which are essential to the enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and to maintain, for all persons within its jurisdiction, the right to difference of opinion on matters political, and civil liberty that is as much right to differences of opinion on matters political, to the fullest extent compatible with good government.

After expressing religious liberty, however, are we not apt to overlook the rights of its twin sister respecting civil liberty? In a way a recognition of religious liberty recognizes the equal rights of all, also to a certain extent. It says to the civil power (to the statute), limits those rights to the civil law\u2014not the religious law. All of people have "liberty" to exercise their rights to civil liberty.

> Does freedom of religion carry with it freedom of all things? Does the theory of civil liberty mean that what is just for one is just for all? Does that constitute what has been called "civil liberty?" Civil liberty has been denominated "the power of doing whatever the laws permit." Civil liberty has been said to have "no right or rights" distinguishing a person's civil rights from his religious liberty, but not real liberty.

Noah Webster defines "civil liberty" as "the liberty of men in a state of society or of those connected in equal rights of law who have some with person, opinion or property only so far as is necessary for the safety of citizens. Taking this as his as true transcription of what constitutes civil liberty\u2014*actual*\u2014have we civil liberty in this land?

Have we that civil liberty which means exemption from "military impressment," and privileges from which all subjects are exempt; which means exemption from, and prohibition of, slavery; exemption from illegal imprisonment, and exemption from oppression, recreation and imprisonment?

Have we that civil liberty which demands exemption from compulsory contributions to the churches, or those obnoxious with our opinions when our children are required to observe holidays, and when school text-books which are denominational (or even partly so) are given religious instruction on our streets, and thereby caused irritation or hateful reproductions? A demonstration is drawn where testimony of a witness is compelled under the obligation of an oath, when the law dispenses of a certain obligation on the part of every citizen. There is a future state of punishment.

Have we that civil liberty which means exemption from arbitrary interference with or destruction of one's property for the purpose of building a church; the right by law to contribute our money (through taxation) to the support of churches or sectarian institutions; for payment of chaplains in our prisons, for Congress, in

the army and navy; and to supplement the amounts received necessary to results of the exemption of church property from taxation, which grants equal privileges and imposes equal taxes to all\u2014the rich and the poor, the just and to those who make no profession of religion?

The Constitution of the United States says: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion;" and yet, in the face of this section and its interpretations, the Government has aided the establishment of the Christian religion, as the religious services had at the opening of Congress.

The Constitution also says: "No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office;" and yet no person will be permitted to fill certain offices, unless they take a prescribed oath on a set of beliefs for a professional vow.

It would be quite as proper and as just had but the opponents of Sunday observance the power, for them to enact a law fining and imprisoning people for preaching and praying on Sunday, as it is now to fine and imprison for working or playing on Sunday that day. We may characterize as citizens of a class whom though thoroughly religious, who are not in favor of the Sunday and believe not in Sunday observance is an infraction of God's law as shown by the history records. Three Baptists (who observe religiously the seventh day of the week) have been for months languishing in a prison in Tennessee for the crime of attending to their gardens or performing some ordinary farm duties on Sunday. Think of this in this land which boasts of civil liberty!

There is no greater denial of civil liberty than to declare the Sabbath "the Sabbath." For millions of our citizens the only Sabbath or day of sacred rest they observe is not the first of the week they can visit it, because on Saturday certain religious fanatics require the observance of that day.

There is a sacred civil liberty in the absence of religious teaching in our public schools, and as a result the State has no right to dictate what religion it should teach. The late Rev. Howard Crosby, D. D., President of the Board of Education in New York, said in a public address that he held in non-sectarian (elementary) education.

The sentiment of all intelligent, reflective and just persons is that of a firm opposition to contributing, either directly or indirectly, to any Church by, in support of any religious institution. The system of exempting church property from taxation is in fulfilment of appropriating money for the support of places of worship\u2014a violation of the spirit of civil liberty as a principle; boldly denounce as a flagrant and inexcusable, without merit, violation. The late pastor of Christ Church, New York City, says that, that all church property should be exempt from taxation, and that this policy may be justified to be compensated. I would then be as well all church property throughout the land taxed to the last dollar, equally. The churches have right this question, but sooner or later the battle will be against it; and it shall be a contest to be only with desired armor but with fists.

Judge Story of the United States Supreme Court says that the First Amendment right not only to prohibit and exclude all rivalry, but to exclude any national preference, whether form, in substance, be an establishment of Christianity. Under the existing Constitution of 1835 expressly provides that no person shall be "compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent."

It must have been intended to extend civil liberty, whether they believe in Christianity or not, and whatever law or decree is made.

To the honor of those branches of the Christian Church known as Baptists and Quakers, be it known, that they have long declined to accept the money appropriated by the general Government for religious services of sectarian chaplains, on the ground that the Government has no business with religious affairs.

Sunday laws, appointments of religious and fast days; and of chaplains; the encouragement of oaths and religion in our public schools; sectarian appropriations of money and exemption

of church property from taxation\u2014all clearly interference with that civil liberty which grants equal privileges and imposes equal taxes to all\u2014the rich and the poor, to the just and to those who make no profession of religion.

Mrs. M. A. Freeman, Corresponding Secretary of the Woman's Liberal League, says:

> The people have permitted it various religious sects the right to dictate laws in accord with the granting of them and requiring those not of their faith to obey the same. It is not satisfied with the various grants from the State and the enormous budget. It also demands, demands for its own. . . .

The granting of religious liberty, after all, is the only sure safeguard against the exercise of evil liberty. In the day of Constantine Christianity became a recognized religion. "All kinds of Christians had the like freedom and liberty of their religion and professions and kill infidels of every kind."

> If there was ever a stronger argument in favor of civil liberty than the Christians had a right from the very first to offer to the world, what has secularism to present and to overthrow at the very summit of their movement even to the present time, during which it has been the scene of the blood of men. Is it not true history to say that civil liberty has been first destroyed by churchism? Christ said: "If you love me, you keep my commandments." Nothing in here about civil or political coercion.

We boast of civil liberty in this country; but there is yet an amount of effort to be had and things yet to be done until it shall happen that every citizen in this land shall have full right enjoy the equal blessings as the other citizen.

Will the Church grow wise enough, and the State independent enough, to maintain the constitutional guarantee of civil liberty? Will the Church grow wiser enough, and the State more independent, and cease its opposition thereof or will the power of the spiritual and temporal united, will demand the possession of the political power? This will be the test, the spirit of the great truths that have formed the fundamental principles of this Republic.
