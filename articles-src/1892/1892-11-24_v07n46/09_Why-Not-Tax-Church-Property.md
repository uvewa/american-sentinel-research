For the first time the United States census has secured the statistics of churches. There is a great deal of credit due to the census bureau, as it must have been very difficult and laborious work to obtain the accurate figures. There is much more than this which the census bureau has done; it has exposed an evil, and shown the injustice that is being done to every property owner in every State in the Union.

But the question, "Why not tax church property?" has been sadly neglected. There have been only a few men who have advocated it, and the press has been absolutely silent. If there was a State church and a national belief, it would be different, but as the United States recognizes no church, and has no belief, I hold that it is absolutely unconstitutional to exempt any church or churches from taxation. A church is a religious corporation, can own and acquire any amount of property, real or personal, without bearing the burdens of taxation. Why I call a church a religious corporation is, because in law it is called a private corporation, and "private corporations are such as are created for the private benefit of the collective members of the corporation, and are designed to regulate and promote their religious, social, or financial interests."

There are churches in every city of the United States that own property that is not used for religious purposes, but is used for various purposes which pay a good interest.

It was under the Spanish domination that the Catholic Church laid the foundation of its riches and power in Mexico. The small value placed upon land in Mexico enabled the church to become at an early day the possessor of vast tracts, which it acquired by various donations. The Inquisition, too, flourished during that period, and the lands of heretics who fell under its discipline were confiscated. The best agricultural estates belonged to the church, and in every town and hamlet it owned houses of every description. It also came in for a share of the products of the mines without incurring the risk of mining operations. But at last the rule of Spain became unendurable, and the people revolted.

When Maximilian was shot and Juarez came into possession, he and his government began at once to execute the laws of reform. The value of the church was estimated to be $300,000,000, and its revenues were greater than those of the Mexican Government. When the property of the church was placed upon the market, its actual value was sufficient to pay the national debt several times over. Most of it changed hands, but to what purposes the proceeds were applied is a mystery. The spiritual power of the church, however, remained, and it has resulted in restoring the church to its former position of wealth. Before the reform laws this wealth consisted principally in land. Now it is money.

"Concentrated capital is, in time of need, the most available species of wealth."

There are about one hundred and fifty denominations, besides many independent congregations. It is hardly possible for any one denomination in the United States to acquire so much wealth, although the Catholic Church owns property amounting to $118,000,000, but if ever there is church unity it would not only be possible, but quite probable for this unity to become a power, and the people should awake from their slumber and stop exempting church property from taxation.

In France the Catholic Church controlled and owned two acres of the best land out of every five, prior to the French Revolution. It was Henry VIII. who broke up ecclesiastical institutions and secularized their property, that is, stopped exempting it from taxation.

In Europe to-day a man is taxed either directly or indirectly to help support a State church, whether he be a Christian, infidel, or Jew. And where the church has the strongest hold, as in Spain and Italy, education is comparatively unknown. Italy is waking up and beginning to confiscate ecclesiastical property. . . .

Observe the conditions of Canada: and the church is one of the principal causes of the deplorable state the country is in. We do not want Canada until the hives of those ecclesiastical drones are destroyed.

Generals Grant and Garfield recognized the monstrous evil, and in their messages to Congress pointed it out. James A Garfield said in Congress, June 22, 1874:—

The divorce between the Church and State ought to be absolute. It ought to be so absolute that no church property any where in any State, or in the Nation, should be exempt from equal taxation; for if you exempt the property of any church organization to that extent, you impose a tax upon the whole community.

The United States is not a secular Government as long as it favors the institution of religious fanaticism.

General Grant in his message to Congress in 1875 said:—

In connection with this important question, I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the close of the nineteenth century. It is the acquisition of vast amounts of untaxed church property. In 1850 I believe the church property of the United States which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $97,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled. In 1870 it was $354,483,587. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say this property will reach a sum exceeding $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of the Government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country where real estate enhances so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of so vast a property as here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestration without constitutional authority, and through blood. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally.
