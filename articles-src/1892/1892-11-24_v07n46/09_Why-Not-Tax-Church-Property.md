# Why Not Tax Church Property?

FOR the first time the United States Government has aided in building churches. There is a great deal of credit attached to the present effort; but it has been very difficult and laborious work to get the concession out of Congress, and much more than the which the contour herein has done, it has exposed an evil, and above the injustices that is being done to every property owner in every State of the Union.

The question, "Why not tax church property?" has not been really neglected. There have been only a few men who have advocated it, and the press has been absolutely silent. If there was a time when no tax on church property would be different, but as the United States Government increases her debt has had to bring it forward; it is that it is absolutely unconstitutional to exempt any church or churches from taxation. A church is a religious corporation the same as any other business, holding property, real or personal, without bearing any portion of taxation. Why should a church a religious corporation is, be given a privilege that is denied to any other corporation; and "private corporations are such as are created for the private benefit," while the church that is created for a public purpose and are designed to regulate also and promote economy.

There are churches in every city of the United States that own property that is not used for religious purposes, but is used for various purposes which pay a good interest.

It was under the Spanish domination that the Church acquired the first foundation of estates to it. From then on, the influence of the church upon land in Mexico enabled the church to become owner of more than one-half of all the real estate in the country; and this enormous estate is supported by various donations. The Inquisition, too, contributed largely to the wealth of the church, by confiscating the goods of all the condemned. The best agricultural estates belonged to the religious orders, who received the largest share of the product of the union without incurring any expense of working, and paid no part of the rule of Spain because unnumbered, and the rule of the church.

When Maximilian was shot and Juarez was shot, one of the first things he said he must begin at once to execute the laws of reform. The value of the church was estimated to be $300,000,000, and its revenues were greater than those of the Government. Nearly one-half of the real estate of the church was placed upon the market and sold at incredibly low prices. For war purposes the proceeds were applied as a measure. The spiritual offices of the church, however, remained, and it has been faithful in restoring the church to its former position of wealth. Before the reform laws its wealth constituted principally land. Now it is money.

CONNECTED especially, in time of Congress, the most available special mention.

There are about one hundred and forty denominations, under many hundred religious institutions, and there are in aggregate more than in any one denomination in the United States, worth in all about seven hundred million dollars. The Catholic Church owns property amounting to this: but if there is in it of one church unity it would not only be possible, but useful for the safety that it might become a power, and the people should awake from their slumber and stop all exempting church property from taxation.

In France the Catholic Church controlled and owned two acres of the best laid out of every five prior to the French Revolution. It was Henry VIII. Will that man's record that their vast property be confiscated for the State; and the church was permanently exempted from taxation.

The Constitution of the United States says: "Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of the Christian religion, as the religion of the people and the Government; yet, in the face of this section and its interpretations, the Government has aided the establishment of the Christian religion, as that the churches have been planted as early in the religious services had at the opening of Congress.

The Constitution also says: "No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office;" and yet no person will be permitted to fill certain offices, unless they take a prescribed oath on a set of beliefs for a professional vow.

The State of New York (among other States have a law positively prohibiting appropriations of any money for sectarian purposes, and no such appropriation was made in addition to make indirect contributions for the support of churches by exempting church property from the exemption of a national tax, then the Government has exempted the church from civil liberty in this country? Every practical assumption of superior knowledge and superior goodness, has evolved in some new form of domineering.

When I speak of Christianity and of Christians, I make an exception in favor of many unpretentious, tolerant, liberal-minded and justice-loving believers in Christ. From such exceptions only have projects against civil invasion of civil liberty.

Rev. L. L. Williamson, in an article says: "That a civil Government, justly and exclusively, for jurisdiction over purely civil affairs, and no more than one government implies a State religion, should be enough and more than enough for the Christian religion alone."

There is grave danger in this mixing of politics with religion, under any circumstances, is fraught with manifest and multiform dangers. There is no tyranny as savage, no rule so ruthless, as priestly craft when vested with temporal authority and power. More political combinations, crimes and enormities have been committed in this name and on no account as theocratic and religious, and in all in all lands have attested their proofs of religious with temporal power.

Christ's injunction\u2014"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's"\u2014is the precept which the Christian daily should practice.

Howard I. of England caused taxes to be levied on the clergy to the like proportion that these who are protected by the State shall share in the burden.

J. L. M. Curry, in Johnston's *Encyclopedia,* under "Religious Liberty" says:

> "Unfortunately, Christian II., as it has done with all religions, identified itself with Austrian Christianity by law, and since then other Christians who have acquired a powerful temporal power, have allied their religion with politics."

The *Jewish Times*, in a recent article on sectarian exemption teaches an Article, oath and blasphemy laws) and of the religious influences and fanaticism which has injected them into our politics, says: "There is not one of those sectarian enactments that may not on any day be invoked

of church property from taxation\u2014all of which clearly interference with that civil liberty which grants equal privileges and imposes equal taxes to all\u2014the rich and the poor, to the poor and to those who make no profession of religion."

The Constitution of the United States says: "Congress shall make, no law respecting the establishment of religion," and yet, in the face of this section and its interpretations, the Government has aided the establishment of the Christian religion, as that the churches have been planted as early in the religious services had at the opening of Congress.

The Constitution also says: "No religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office;" and yet no person will be permitted to fill certain offices, unless they take a prescribed oath on a set of beliefs for a professional vow.

The State of New York (among other States have a law positively prohibiting appropriations of any money for sectarian purposes, and no such appropriation was made in addition to make indirect contributions for the support of churches by exempting church property from the exemption of a national tax.

The United States is not a secular Government as long as it favors the institution of religion financially.

General Grant in his message to Congress in 1875 said:

> In connection with the important question, I would also call your attention to the importance of correcting an evil that, if permitted to continue, will probably lead to great trouble in our land before the century is to a close. It is the acquisition of vast amounts of untaxed church property.... In 1850 the church property of the United States, which paid no tax, municipal or State, amounted to $87,000,000. In 1860 the amount had doubled; in 1875 it is about $1,000,000,000. By 1900, without a check, it is safe to say that this accumulation will reach $3,000,000,000. So vast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of the Government without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a growing country, where there is a constant demand upon the labor of the community to build up waste places in the United States. In a free country where there is a vast amount of real estate without taxation. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation, and not impose unjust taxation, and constitutional authority, and though Stock tax must be levied on the people.
