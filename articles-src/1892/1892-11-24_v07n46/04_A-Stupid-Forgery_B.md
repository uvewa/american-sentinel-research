We have received several copies of what purports to be a letter from the Pope of Rome to the Jesuits of the United States, or rather of two separate letters similar in character, and doubtless of common origin. Copies of these "letters" are being widely circulated throughout the United States, though for what purpose it is difficult to say since they are evidently clumsy forgeries. A sample paragraph from one of these "letters" runs thus:—

Moreover, we proclaim the people of the United States of America to have forfeited all right to rule said republic, and also all dominion, dignity and privileges appertaining to it. We likewise declare, that all subjects of every rank and condition in the United States, and every individual who has taken any oath of loyalty to the United States, in any way whatever, may be absolved from said oath, as also from all duty, fidelity or obedience, on or about September 5, 1893, at the convening of the Roman Catholic Congress at Chicago, Illinois.

This is enough to brand the production as a forgery, but the next paragraph contains a literary blunder which at once shows that it never came from the Pope, or from any authorized to speak for him; for the Pontiff and all who are associated with him in the management of the church are masters of language, while the author of this production is a blunderer of the first order. The paragraph runs thus:—

When the feast of Ignatus Loyola occurs in the year of Our Lord 1893, as we shall exonerate them (or our successor) from all engagements, as we expect to deprive Protestants of all pretended claims in the United States.

No modern Pope ever wrote, "We shall exonerate them (or our successor) from all engagements," etc., meaning thereby, "We (or our successor) shall exonerate them," etc. Nor is this the only glaring structural error in the Pope's (?) letter.

The other and longer "letter" contains even more extraordinary things than the one from which we have quoted. It is addressed, "To our beloved children in the faith;" and among other absurd things contains this paragraph:—

We are opposed to any system of schools that teaches the youth more than the Roman catechism, or that teaches the young to think—it is unnecessary, a waste of time and money, when the holy father has been deputed by God to do the thinking for this world. Therefore we call upon our subjects to do all possible to break down and destroy the free public schools of this heretical Nation, which have compelled us to set up and maintain at great expense parochial schools to defend our faith, thus greatly lessening the income of the clergy.

Anybody who can believe that the crafty Leo XIII. ever sent out such stuff is quite capable of believing anything. Rome is the foe of civil and religious liberty, but her Pope and her bishops are not fools in worldly things, as they must have been had they sent out such letters as those attributed to them.

Our object in referring to these so-called "letters" is not to defend the Catholic Church nor the Catholic faith; we have no sympathy with either; but to warn our readers against that false Protestantism, so-called, which, to unprincipled Jesuitical trickery and falsehood (doing evil that good (?) may come), adds such monumental stupidity as that exhibited in these forged "letters" from the Pope.
