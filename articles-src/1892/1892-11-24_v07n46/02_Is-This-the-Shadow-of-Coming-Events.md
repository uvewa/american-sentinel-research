THE Post-Intelligencer, of Paris, Henry County, Tenn., has in its issue of the 4th inst., this item of news:

REPAIRS ON JAIL.

Messrs. A. H. Lankford, N. S. Hicks and W. R. Collins, committee, have contracted with Messrs. Ed. C. Bates & Co., Clarksville, Tenn., to make needed repairs for the sum of $880.75, the county furnishing wood, nails, etc.

The contractors are to tear down the two old cells partially destroyed by fire, tear out the old joists and floor as far as the side of cells and replace same with new joists. Replace cells with new iron as before, cut doorway through wall and put in new door and frame. Also to furnish and put up an iron stairway. The hall is to be covered with No. 12 iron. The work began November 1.

Is this the shadow of the fulfillment of the threat of Attorney-General Lewis that he will "prosecute every man, woman, and child of them [the Adventists] until they stop" their private work on Sunday? The Springville Seventh-day Adventist Church has a membership of about fifty, if we mistake not. Fourteen of the number are understood to be under indictment now for the heinous offense of doing private work on their own farms on Sunday—work seen only by members of their own families or by their brethren in the church. Is it for the accommodation of these Adventists that Henry County is enlarging its jail?
