# Shall the Pilgrim Papacy Succeed?

THAT Boston paper, which carries the lengthy title of *Our Country and the Gospel of the New Covenant,* of November 10, says editorially, in reference to the observance of the Sabbath, or first-day of the week—the so-called Sunday laws:—

> In the United States there is no one custom more universal from the Atlantic to the Pacific than a rest for the Sabbath. The most industrious pro-Sabbath communities cannot support their worldly end, and the most abandoned and vicious in our communities cannot suppress their worldly end, and the most abandoned and vicious in our communities have been seen from the settlement of the country and the organization of the Government to respect this universal custom. Only foreign elements are in opposition to it. The Pilgrim Father, for his little flock receding to the wilderness of New England, and writing his law for the land, was: "that they could not bring the Dutch to observe the Lord's day as a Sabbath."

One of the chief rules of both the Pilgrim and the Puritan colonies was the requiring the observance of the first day of the week as the Sabbath. Even the settlers of the Dutch colonies in New York there was strong opposition to such rules. Later, a considerable body of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians came, adding to the numbers of Sabbath-law population. These things brought about an increasingly strong effort and attention to the English settlers to this subject.

> The claim is therefore that the Sabbath was observed and its administration of the Lord's day to be of an important institution.

Thus the writer claims that from the time the Sabbath is recognized in every State of the Union as the one institution which some of these same sentiment have ever had a place; that the keeping of Sunday as a Sabbath was not only a civil institution, but a divine institution. And whether the Sabbath, thus declared sacred and enforced as the chief cornerstone of American institutions, shall become a factor of the World's Fair. Amidst certain the question of foreign intervention and the rights of the Dutch element as foreigners to this country, is shall she deliberately abolish one of the most sacred institutions of the land? Shall we allow foreigners, who are known to come to this country to directly in patriotic rete as to religious matters?

That was a very suggestive admission from John Robinson, that his Pilgrim flock received to quit Holland because they could not bring the Dutch to observe the Lord's day as a Sabbath." By quoting it does *Our Country* wish to call attention to the fact that a similar escape from the uncomfortable evidences of a similarity is still open? Although there are no more to-day to escape to; there is, however, something far better to do than those may go, who, like John Robinson and the Pilgrim and the Puritan folk with whom they are associated to observe the first day of the week as a Sabbath. But

those will have who have the love of their kind in their hearts desire to so scarcely force silence from their fellows upon? What is the natural conclusion to be placed upon these words of John Robinson, especially in the light of the decree of total silence which we are here told his followers established? Is it not that when they were in the minority,—till and make the Dutch—and could not coerce others to the will of the church, they were by no means contented? Does it not show that their religion of the intolerant sort could brook no difference of views in others? They complained because they were unable to coerce into conformity others to the observe the religious forms which they observed? Consequently when they could not "bring the Dutch" to think and do as they thought right, and were unable to compel them, they resolved to go to Holland for country where they could as none to withstand them, and there without opposition, or at least with none that they asked could overcome. The process of a strife-girt character which were immediately adopted show that the to be carried that the in, and that these those and that to decree and decrees, and other enriching them, the observance of Sunday as a Sabbath in almost every State of the Union, on all that lies within its borders, what—what follows? Does it follow that this universal American institution, and laws "are well or ill-founded, and the State is an establishment of religious institutions?" If the Pilgrim and Puritan laws establishing Sunday as the American Sabbath were forever, in the place of God, the fact that such laws exist does certainly not follow.

> If the Pilgrim and Puritan papacy have publicly abolished by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, then a free and independent nation, then truly a great Sabbath and such legislation is in the very nature.

Much more forcibly does it appeal? The duty of the Government that its institutions people shall yield religious allegiance to the civil authority as well as to its God, or to God. This Boston paper seems almost to have expressed a very sad reality of ancestor worship. Will that thing practically that is a work and contribution to great American citizens?
