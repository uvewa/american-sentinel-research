The editorial expressions reprinted beneath have all had their origin in a consideration of the cases of persecution in Tennessee, which THE SENTINEL has recounted from time to time.

This is a matter upon which none can avoid the responsibility of an opinion. Sooner or later all must take sides, and will. It is a pertinent question, "On which side are you?"

### LIBERTY.

It is a piece of Sabbathic legislation and of religious persecution of which even the Dark Ages and the Spanish Inquisition might have been ashamed. That it could have taken place in America and in the last decade of the nineteenth century seems almost beyond belief.—The Golden Rule, Cincinnati, Ohio, October 8.

It seems incredible that at this enlightened age such fatalism should be allowed to exist. Religious conviction is a matter in which only individual conscience is concerned. No matter what faith a man may choose to worship, or if he chooses none at all, the responsibility rests alone with him. If a man chooses to observe a certain day in the week as his Sabbath and works on other days, it is no one's business except his own, and such a law as they have in Tennessee is an outrage against the Constitution of the United States.—The Pioneer Grip, Alliance, Nebr., September 29.

It is hard to believe that in this day and age there should be such religious persecution tolerated in a free country, and the sooner an appeal is taken to the highest tribunal and the liberty of conscience defined and supported, the better for all, and especially the State of Tennessee. It would be but an act of justice for the imprisoned men to sue for damages, and beary ones, for false and unconstitutional imprisonment. And they should be able to recover them, and the people of the State would learn that they can not go beyond certain limits in making their laws.—The Republican, Clinton, Ind., September 29.

It is allowed, in this country, to worship God as he chooses, provided he does not violate a statutory law in doing so. The Sunday law does not force him to work on Saturday any more than any other day, and he who works on Sunday violates a civil law and should therefore suffer its penalties; not in the light of religious persecution, but because the Sunday law is made for all alike, irrespective of religious convictions. Down with the idea that the Sunday law in this country has anything to do with religious liberty.—The Drug Times, Troy, Ind., October 8.

We have received from the National Religious Liberty Association, letters and circulars wanting us to condemn the action of punishing men for violating the Sabbath by working in the fields and elsewhere. When a man pretends to become a Christian, he knows what nine-tenths of the Christian world regard as the Christian Sabbath, and when he tries to defy the majority of nine to one, he is most likely seeking yesterday, and if he attains that notoriety by being sentenced to the chain-gang, he also serve out his sentence and then turn to be a Christian in deed and in truth.—Mack among Sentinel, Macclenny, Fla., October 5.

It is impossible to attempt the defense of religious laws without a display of either ignorance or bigotry, or both. This fact is made plainer than ever by these extracts. A most excellent purpose is served by this agitation. Those who express themselves bigotally or ignorantly may sometimes see their own errors when presented clearly before their eyes in cold type. Again, while they themselves may not, others will. Cry aloud, and spare not.
