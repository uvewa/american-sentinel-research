The Mail and Express says of the continuance of violence at Homestead, on Sunday, November 13: "The strikers violated the laws of both God and man by making an attack Sunday on seven colored men employed in the Carnegie mills."

It follows, then, that if the attack had been made on Monday only the law of man would have been violated. Does this mark the limit of comprehension of the Mail and Express as to the scope of the law of God?

The Christian Cynosure, in reference to the action of the World's Fair Board of Directors in asking Congress to remove the Sunday closing restriction, says:—

So far as the opening of the Fair on Sundays is concerned, it will require an act of Congress—the same Congress, too, that enacted the Sunday closing law—to remove the restriction. That august body may be cajoled into rescinding its former action, but no sane man can discover any reason why it should so signally disgrace itself.

That which is really difficult to find out is why it should have so signally disgraced itself as to have passed the proviso in the first place.

On Monday, November 14, two women and fourteen men were brought before Justice Duffy charged with having violated the Sunday law by sewing in Jacob Taylor's tailor-shop on Pelham Street. The report says that Justice Duffy discharged them with an "admonitory lecture for having violated the Sabbath law." This is the second wholesale arrest of this kind. Does it mean that systematic persecution for Sunday work has begun in New York City? These arrests have been entirely of Hebrews who respect the seventh day Sabbath of the commandment and not the first day American Sunday. There is something more than a coincidence in this.

In the Maryland Code, Volume 1, article 27, page 538, is this paragraph:—

Section 247. No person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday; and no person having children or servants shall command, or wittingly or willingly suffer, any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity always recopied), nor shall suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting, or unlawful pastime or recreation; and every person transgressing this section, and being thereof convicted before a justice of the peace, shall forfeit five dollars, to be applied to the use of the county.

To this there is no exemption for those who observe another day. Under this section of the Maryland Code Mr. John Jude find, a farmer, and a Seventh-day Adventist, living near Rock Hall, Md., has been arrested for husking corn on Sunday, and fined five dollars and costs, the extent of the penalty provided.

The prosecuting witness in the case was a Methodist minister named Roe, of the village of Rock Hall. Mr. Jude find was quietly husking his corn, several hundred yards from the road, when this Methodist minister, seeing him, went immediately before a justice and swore out a warrant for his arrest for "husking corn on this day (Sunday)."

The case has been appealed to the spring term of the Circuit Court, and will come up again in April.

The Mail and Express has this to say in regard to the expressed wish of the Board of Directors to open the gates of the Exposition on Sunday:—

The World's Fair Directors, in passing at their regular meeting yesterday, a resolution favoring the opening of the World's Fair gates on Sunday, have but bid defiance to public opinion. This action will be repudiated by the American people, and those who have been selected to represent them in this important matter will resolutely resist its consummation. This is a question that so vitally involves all that we cherish as most essential to our happiness and prosperity as a people, that to compromise in the least degree would be turning recreant to every dictate of duty and every obligation of honor.

What does the Mail and Express think is "public opinion"? Who does it think are "the American people"? What does it think is "duty" and "honor"? Such imperfect, erroneous, and arrogant ideas expressed with a simplicity which shows that they are the natural product of a mind where there is no room for anything else, it would seem, could only come from that poor man before whom both gods and men are powerless.

By a vote of twenty-six to four the Directors of the World's Fair have passed resolutions expressing their views upon Sunday closing. So far as they relate directly to this subject they are as follows:—

We believe that while the period of the Exposition is limited by law, the people should not be prohibited from visiting the same Sundays during the life of said Exposition.

It is our judgment that the Exposition should be open Sunday, under such rules and regulations as will prohibit the use of machinery, unnecessary manual labor, and all merchandising, and at the same time give opportunity for the study of the highest standard of artistic and mechanical science; that the Art Gallery, the Horticultural Building, and all other buildings in which exhibits of mechanical art are exhibited should be thrown open to the public on each and every day during the entire time of the Exposition; also that each employee should be given one day of each week for rest, study, or recreation.

We believe that the study on Sunday of such exhibits of science and art and of the skill and genius of the artisan, will not only be of inestimable educational advantage, but that the thoughts of the visitors will be lifted above these creative agencies to the great Creator of things useful and beautiful.

We further believe that on each Sunday afternoon there should be held within the Exposition grounds religious services so arranged that each of our religious organizations may have a Sunday set apart for its particular service, under the control and direction of its most prominent clergymen, with songs and anthems in the best form of sacred music. Our original plans embraced a large hall capable of seating 7,000 people for this use Sunday.

We believe that the closing of the Exposition Sundays will deprive millions of our people of these advantages.

We believe that the closing of the Exposition Sunday would, in many instances, be in violation of the spirit of hospitality which has characterized our invitation to foreign nations.

We further believe that the citizens of the several States should have the privilege of visiting, Sunday, the temporary buildings or homes within the Exposition grounds, erected by their respective States, for the free interchange of thought and social amenities. Therefore, be it—

Resolved, That the foregoing preambles and recitals be and are adopted by the Board of Directors as expressing its best judgment upon the matter of Sunday closing during the Exposition.

In the course of the discussion of the resolutions it was stated that of seven hundred replies to letters upon this subject, from the Directory to prominent people in the larger cities of the country, five hundred and fifty were in favor of Sunday opening.

In reference to the question, in its present situation, the Chicago Tribune says:—

As the matter now stands the Fair can not be thrown open to visitors on Sundays except by action of Congress. Some of the directors said yesterday that if Congress were invited to take such a step it was not improbable that antagonistic members would make a motion looking to the repeal of the entire appropriation bill. Other directors think, however, that Congress would not be so foolish as to vote in such a way. The appropriation already granted is regarded as a contract, and the Supreme Court, they say, would not uphold a law which would abrogate the obligations entered into because of the appropriation bill.

Already petitions have been circulated extensively asking for the repeal of the Sunday closing clause. Exposition officials of both the Directory and National Commission think that the last Congress did not act on conviction, but voted in accordance with the petitions of a vast number of Christian workers. Subsequently it has been shown that less than 25 per cent. of the people of the United States were represented in these petitions. The majority of citizens did not think it worth while to memorialize Congress, believing it would not take the step it did. Friends of Sunday opening say that the mistake in such a belief having been demonstrated, the people who did not act before are asserting themselves, and that the next Congress will receive petitions bearing millions of signatures, all asking that the Exposition be opened Sundays.

The question of the vitiation of contracts previously entered into is one which Congress and others should have thought of before ever considering the Sunday closing proviso at all. However, the first and necessary principles upon which this whole matter rightfully rests are totally ignored in these resolutions; as they are also by the association which has been formed in Chicago with the avowed object of promoting Sunday opening. It can not be possible that these men are unaware of the correct principles upon which they should take their position. Why do they avoid them?
