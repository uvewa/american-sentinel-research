The London Daily News seems surprised that there should be violent religious persecution in this day of enlightenment and liberality, even in a city like Vienna. Then the surprise is increased by the fact that the particular religions denomination made to suffer in this case is that of the Methodists, with all their primitive plainness and patience.

It was not until as late as 1869 that the first pioneer Methodist preacher arrived in Vienna. He began his work under the auspices of the Stuttgart Wesleyans, and soon collected a body of about one hundred Austrian and German coreligionists, who at once responded to the "higher spirituality" quality of the new movement. From the very start, however, they were subjected to the most offensive forms of government interference and restriction. A persistent and systematic persecution of this small body of earnest seekers after the "higher life" was inaugurated by the police authorities, amounting practically to the prohibition of all their religious rights.

Their congregations were broken up, their more private prayer services were interrupted and finally interdicted, and even their Sunday schools were closed. One instance is given in this connection, as follows:—

A little girl who attended these Sunday classes on one occasion quoted a text of Scripture in the hearing of a priest. "Where did you learn that?" he sharply inquired. The child returned a truthful answer, and the result was that very shortly afterward the school was summarily shut up by the police, acting under the instructions of the Roman Catholic authorities.

When the police authorities are asked for the reason of this forcible suppression of these Methodist churches, schools, and missions, their only answer is that the Methodist religion is not recognized in Austria. The courts of appeal, when resorted to by these persecuted people, declared that the meetings of the Methodists were too large to be tolerated under the right of private worship. Baron Gautsch, the Austrian Minister of Education, when appealed to, decided, on the other hand, that the Methodist body was too small to entitle it to State recognition.

Thus on all sides the Methodists are persecuted and proscribed. They dare not gather even for a service of prayer, the minister dare not give public religious advice to the living, nor private spiritual consolation to the dying, and if even a member of the flock calls upon the clergyman, he does so under police surveillance.

This is the true picture of religious liberty in Austria, and that, too, in the midst of our glorified nineteenth century civilization. It is evident that Austria has not taken one step in advance of that savage system of religious and political despotism which Kossuth so graphically pictured, so eloquently condemned, and so heroically combatted nearly half a century ago. Austria can never grow in true greatness, nor elevate her people in the elements and principles of useful, virtuous and prosperous citizenship, until she rejects the dim light of Roman candles, and accepts the clear, open sun-light of God's universal truth and justice.—Mail and Express.
