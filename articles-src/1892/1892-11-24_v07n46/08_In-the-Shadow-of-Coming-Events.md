# In the Shadow of Coming Events.

Then on all sides the Methodists are persecuted and proscribed. They dare not gather even for a service of prayer, the minister nor yet give public instruction: the attorney not give private spiritual advice to the living, nor private spiritual consolation to the dying; and if even in instances of the flock shall call upon the clergy, he must not outdo police surveillance. He has also to furnish and put up his door and fences. Also to furnish and put up his fences. The words Nonconformist have their fine.

In this the shadow of the fulfilment of the threat of Attorney-General Lewis that this State will prosecute every man, woman, and child of them (the Adventists) until they quit keeping people rest on Sunday! The Springfield Seventh-day Adventist Church has a membership of about fifty, let us understand to mean a considerable size; and yet are understood to be under indictment for Sunday violation. Many of them are men who wake on their own farms on Sunday for the want of a hired hand to do the work on their own families or by their brethren in the church. If one may rightly judge the character of these Adventists that Henry County is most successful at that.

In another column our paper publishes news of the arrest in Kent County, Md., of a Seventh-day Adventist for quietly husking corn in his own field on the sixth day of the week.

---

THIS man was arrested on complaint of the Methodist minister who has become, the past year, lost a number of his members to the seventh-day Church.

The Adventist church at Rock Hall has a membership of over eighty. Some of them were formerly Methodists, but quite a number made no profession of religion until they became Adventists. Some of the men were addicted to the intemperance use of liquors, and nearly all are free from both these moral failings; and tongues formerly used to blaspheme God, and to curse their fellow men, are now employed in sounding his praise for deliverance from the bondage of sin. The power of God to save from sin has proved more attractive to the people of Rock Hall than the ministrations of the Methodist preacher, hence the arrest of Mr. Judefind and threats of other arrests for Sunday work.

BUT while such Methodists are persecuting Adventists in this country by means of the civil law, Roman Catholics are now pressing the Methodists in Austria,\u2014and in both cases, both with Adventists in Tennessee and with Methodists in Austria, the civil law is simply being enforced. An article from the *Mail and Express* printed in another column, gives the facts in the persecution of the Methodists in Austria.

---

It is a little inconsistent, however, that while the *Mail and Express* is so quick to cry out against religious persecution in foreign lands, it apparently knows nothing of the outrages being perpetrated upon God-fearing men in the Southern States the color and form of civil law. Is Mr. Shepard opposed to persecution from principle, or does he oppose it only when it is directed against those whose favor he would curry for political purposes\u2014the Jews, for instance, or with whose religious views he is in sympathy? It looks very much as though the latter is the truth.
