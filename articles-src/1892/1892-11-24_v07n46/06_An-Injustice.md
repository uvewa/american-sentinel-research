# An Injustice.

[From the *Christian Patriot*, Morristown, Tenn.]

The Sunday laws are unjust at first on general principles. They have two objects: first to assist the church with its weakening grasp upon the people, by enforcing the observance of rest; and, secondly, to prevent the disturbance and annoyance of those who rest on Sunday. Even infidels should concur in those laws which protect the notions of health and intelligence, and that it is just that those who will to worship should be protected from annoyance.

But this law has been used to punish a Seventh-day Adventist. We regret his errors; but if he means not disturb any, or him of them persecution will not be. Is it harmer? He rested on Saturday, a day pronounced on Sunday. He was arrested, tried under the statute. He paid his costs, and refused to pay the fine, preferring to stand the common law. He appealed. It has gone through the State courts and all have affirmed the lower judgment. The United States Circuit Court. It is to be appealed to the Supreme Court. We hope

Mr. King will gain his case. For, first, he has complied substantially with the object of the Sunday laws. He and his family household rest one day in the week, and his ploughing at a distance from any church did not annoy any worshiper.

—It is a shame that he should be penalized to thousands of a rest day to secure to the Sabbatists of large sections and great communities.

The case calls attention to the impolicy of Sunday laws as compulsory laws. They should forbid the employing of a profitable Sunday as it is understood, not an idiot will work on Sabbath or Sunday, and leave the matter of rest wholly upon the employer. And so others observe Saturday or other day as a Sabbath they should be protected as the law provides they do their Sunday work in a quiet and constitutional authority, and though those who break the sabbath quiet of the first day of the week were to be punished, it would be unjust to those who to rest on Saturday, and it should permit them to enjoy their Sabbath who those who have chosen to. Seventh-day people, who have not made the choice of first-day Adventists, Jews and all who observe Saturday.
