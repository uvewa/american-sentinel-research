That Boston paper, which carries the lengthy title of *Our Country and the American Transfer*, in its issue of November 10, says editorially, in reference to the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday—

In the United States there is no one custom more fixed and distinctive than the almost universal regard for the Sabbath. The most industrious people in the world—perhaps the most avaricious—by common consent suspend their worldly toil, and millions of them resort to the temples of religion and their children to the Sabbath school. It has been so from the settlement of the country and the existence of our Union. One of the principle reasons assigned by John Robinson, the pastor of the Pilgrim Fathers, for his little flock resolving to quit Holland, their adopted country—whither they had fled ten years before from England—for America, was "that they could not bring the Dutch to observe the Lord's day as a Sabbath."

One of the chief cares of both the Pilgrim and the Puritan Fathers on their arrival here was the observance of the "sacred rest." In the earliest records of the Dutch colonists in New York there are decrees of the most stringent character, intending to guard the infant community against the demoralizing tendencies of Sabbath profanations. There are still earlier records of attention on the part of the English settlers to this subject.

Whether they established themselves in New Plymouth, Salem or Cambridge, they alike felt the sanctification of the Lord's day to be an important matter.

Seeing then, that this sentiment of reverence for the Sabbath is recognized in every State of the Union, and on our statute books laws embodying this same sentiment have ever had a place, the question is not whether these convictions are well or ill-founded, not whether the Sabbath is or is not a divine institution, but whether the Sabbath, thus entrenched in the affections, usages and laws of the American people, shall not be respected by the directors of the World's Fair. America invites the world to examine her institutions. One question is, shall she deliberately abolish one of the most fundamental of these, impelled by the greed of gain? It is a great question, and one which appeals as directly to patriotic pride as to religious principle.

That was a very suggestive admission from John Robinson, that his Pilgrim flock resolved to quit Holland because "they could not bring the Dutch to observe the Lord's day as a Sabbath." By quoting it does *Our Country* wish to call attention to the fact that a similar escape from the uncomfortable evidence of a similar inability is still open? Although there are no more worlds to conquer there are still unoccupied lands in plenty where those may go, who, like John Robinson and his fellows, can not bring all with whom they are associated to observe the first day of the week as a Sabbath. But will those who have the love of their kind in their hearts desire to so separate themselves from their fellow-men? What is the natural conclusion to be placed upon these words of John Robinson, especially in the light of the decrees and statutes which we are here told his followers established? Is it not that where they were in the minority,—did not make the laws, and could not coerce others to conform to their religious practices,—they were not contented? Does it not show that in their stern pride of opinion they could brook no difference of views in others? They could tolerate no failure in others to observe the religious forms which they observed? Consequently, when they could not "bring the Dutch" to think and do as they thought right, and were unable to compel them, they resolved to quit Holland for a country where there were none to withstand them, and they could set up a theocracy of their own without opposition, or at least with none that they could not overcome. The "decrees of a stringent character" which were immediately adopted show this to be so. Seeing that this is so, and that these statutes and decrees, and others embodying the same sentiment, are now recognized in almost every State of the Union, on their statute books and in their local laws,—what follows? Does it follow that the question is not whether these statutes and laws "are well or ill-founded, not whether the Sabbath is or is not a divine institution"? If the Pilgrim and Puritan Fathers stood to this country, and its citizens forever, in the place of God, that would follow. If they did not, it would not follow.

This Pilgrim and Puritan papacy was really abolished by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. Whether it shall survive is then truly a great question and one which appeals "directly to patriotic pride." Much more forcibly does it appeal "to religious principle" whether the American people shall yield religious allegiance to the Pilgrim and Puritan Fathers, or to God. This Boston paper seems satisfied that the question is solely one of ancestor worship. Will that suffice to satisfy the mind and conscience of intelligent American citizens? W. H. M.
