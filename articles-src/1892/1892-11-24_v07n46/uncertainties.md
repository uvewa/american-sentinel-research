# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 46 (1892-11-24)

## General Notes
This issue was transcribed from Mistral OCR output. The following uncertainties and corrections were noted during the splitting and categorization process:

## Page 1
- Line 23: "BORN ST." appears in the masthead - this may be "BOND ST." (Bond Street is the known address). This is likely an OCR error.

## Page 2
- Lines 130-131: "biasphemers" appears in the 2 Timothy 3:1-5 quotation - this should likely be "blasphemers"
- Line 131: "despiaces" appears in the quotation - this should likely be "despisers"

## Page 3
- Line 152: The text appears to flow continuously from page 2 without a clear article break at the top of page 3.

## Page 4
- Line 338: "deated" appears in the Rev. Dr. Shipman quote - this should likely be "defeated"

## Page 5
- Line 412: "recopied" in the Maryland Code quotation - this should likely be "excepted"
- Line 414: "Jude find" appears as the name - subsequent mentions use "Judefind" which is likely correct

## Page 6
- Line 330: The text contains "recopied" again in another quote, same issue as above

## Page 7
- Line 466: "beary ones" appears - this should likely be "heavy ones"
- Line 470: "Mack among Sentinel" as newspaper name - this may be "Macclenny Sentinel" (OCR error)

## Page 8
- Line 484: "Icora" appears as a section heading - this should likely be "NOTE" or similar

## OCR Quality Assessment
Overall OCR quality: GOOD
- Most proper names transcribed correctly
- Some unusual spellings may be original (archaic) rather than OCR errors
- Biblical quotations contain some errors that should be verified against source
- Newspaper names and personal names generally accurate
