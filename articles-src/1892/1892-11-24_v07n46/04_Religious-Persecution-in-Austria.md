# Religious Persecution in Austria.

THE London *Daily News* seems surprised at learning about a case of religious persecution in this day of enlightenment. It seems that the Austrian denominationalists made to suffer in this case were not the Methodists, as all their primitive practices and customs It was not until as late as 1870 that the first pioneer Methodist preacher arrived in Austria. In 1884 the general conference of the Stuttgart Wesleyans, and some smaller Methodist bodies, gathered Austrian and German coreligionists, organized into districts, and are now practically qualifying the latter for local self-government.

The first to oppose this very start, however, was the Austrian Government, in the form of government interference and restrictions. The preaching, setting and buying of religious publications to the little congregations of the small body of earnest Christians is reported to have been inaugurated by the police authorities. Meetings and services conducted in private houses were broken up, not only of the Methodists, but apparently of all religious sects.

Their school assemblies were broken up, their private worship and Bible study and their carefully and totally intentions were not received. Their Sunday schools were closed, for instance to give them a chance.

A man and girl who attended these things were summoned to court. The girl was accused of an immorality—the having of a print. "Where did you learn this doctrine?" inquired the magistrate; and when the girl attended the school was summarily shut up by the police on the ground that it was an unlicensed one.

When the police authorities are asked for the reason of this forcible suppression, the answer always is that the Methodist religion is not recognized in Austria. The council of appeal, when applied to by those persecuted, decides against them. The Methodist meetings were too large to be tolerated under the existing Austrian law. And subsequently the Austrian Minister of Education, when this case was decided, on the other hand, that the Methodist body was too small to entitle it to State recognition.
