The result of the recent election which placed the Democratic Party in possession of every branch of the Government, except the Supreme Court, has revived to some extent the agitation for the admission of Utah to the family of States.

The Mormons are largely Democrats, and it is thought by some that the leaders of that party will seek to entrench themselves in power by speedily admitting Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, regardless of their fitness to become sovereign States.

Each of these Territories has in it a considerable Mormon population, though it is very doubtful if either Arizona or New Mexico has enough Mormons to even hold the balance of power between the two great parties, to say nothing of themselves becoming a party powerful enough to seize the reins of local government.

But be the case as it may with the other Territories seeking admission to the Union, the "Mormon question" is certainly a live issue in Utah; and Congress would do well to move very slowly in the matter of conferring Statehood on a people who have shown themselves so out of harmony with republican institutions, and so wedded to two hateful relics of barbarism, namely, polygamy and a union of Church and State.

The right of the Government to prohibit polygamy can not be successfully disputed; and yet, strange to say, it has seldom been defended on correct grounds. The right of the State to forbid the practice of plural marriages has been asserted almost entirely on moral grounds, rather than for civil reasons—because polygamy is immoral rather than because it invades and destroys inalienable human rights, and is of necessity a negation of the equality of the sexes and the equal rights of man and woman.

It is very true, as has been maintained, that polygamy is in violation of the moral law—the law of God—but that is not the reason that the Government should prohibit it; it should be prohibited because it is destructive of natural human rights. The Government is not the judge of the divine law, and can never become such except by usurpation—the sure forerunner of tyranny. Congress should see to it that polygamy does not become entrenched behind the Constitution and statutes of a sovereign State; but it should also see to it that this question is not made the occasion of further committing the Government to an attempt to define and administer the law of God.

But while civil government has no right to prohibit any thing simply because it is unchristian, Christianity has nevertheless a very marked and a perfectly legitimate influence upon legislation. It is true that the State may not forbid anything simply because it is morally wrong; but it by no means follows that it may not forbid that which in the light of Christian civilization is seen to be an invasion of inalienable rights. Christianity has had an influence in the world such as no other religion has ever had; its influence is to civilize and to Christianize; it civilizes all with which it comes in contact; it Christianizes all who accept it, and who from the heart obey its teaching. As a nation becomes civilized through the influence of Christianity upon the people who compose that nation, its laws become more humane and the rights of the people are more fully recognized and adequately protected. As men become imbued with the principles of Christianity they will the more readily perceive and acknowledge the rights of their fellows; and this change will be speedily manifested by more liberal laws and by a more equitable administration of justice. But true Christianity never leads to a disregard of the rights of others. Those who are made free by Christ never seek to enslave their fellows.
