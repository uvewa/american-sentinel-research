The French Senate has adopted a resolution, by a vote of four to one, which declares that Romanism is dangerous to social peace and the rights of the State. How long will it be before Congress or the Supreme Court will be asked to decide, by some such measure, that this is not only a "Christian Nation," but a "Protestant Christian Nation"? This time is likely to come soon. When it does come it will not result in a separation of Roman Catholicism from the State and the Government, but quite the contrary. It will result in a coalition of the three.
