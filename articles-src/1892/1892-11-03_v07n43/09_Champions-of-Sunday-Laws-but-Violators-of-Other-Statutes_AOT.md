Champions of Sunday Laws but Violators of Other Statutes.

PERHAPS there is no class of individuals who spend more of their energies dwelling upon the importance of obeying the laws than the representatives of the several organizations that have sprung into existence in the last few years for the purpose of enforcing Sunday laws. A favorite argument with these people is that these Sunday laws should be enforced because it is subversive of good government to allow statutes so plain as the Sunday laws in most of our States, to be trampled upon with impunity. They insist that the people must be compelled to obey the laws, and rest on Sunday. Just how much this talk is actuated by the true principles of patriotism and a desire to observe laws that are generally admitted to be good, may be seen quite clearly by giving a little attention to some things that are now being done in Chicago by these Sunday closing advocates.

On Sunday afternoon, September 25, a mass-meeting was held in Chicago for the purpose of creating sentiment that would induce the merchants on the "West Side" to keep their stores closed on Sunday. The Chicago papers in reporting the meeting made the fact quite prominent that it is proposed to boycott all the merchants who would not close their places of business on the "American Sabbath." That the papers were not unjust in making these statements may be seen from the following preamble and resolution which was adopted at the meeting:—

WHEREAS, It is contrary to the laws of Illinois and against the express wish of the people of Chicago, propagated through the churches and labor organizations through the agency of the daily press, for the clothing stores to open their doors on the Sabbath day; and,

WHEREAS, The citizens of the West Side, in mass meeting assembled, on this Sunday, September 25, do earnestly protest against the continuance of this evil; therefore, be it

Resolved, That it be the sense of this meeting that we, the purchasing public of this, the West Side, do agree not to purchase any goods sold by any store that may keep open its doors on the Sabbath.

This resolution in the most express terms declares a general boycott. They combine together "not to purchase any goods sold by any store that may keep open on the Sabbath. No matter what may be thought or believed in regard to the sanctity of Sunday, and whether or not it be a Christian institution, it must be admitted that the boycott is not a Christian method of compelling the merchants of Chicago to keep the day, in order to give some of their clerks an opportunity to obey it without losing their job. The individual who does not have enough faith in the principles of the Christian religion to lead him to observe the day without having it fixed so that he can do it without the risk of losing his job, has not learned the first principles of Christianity.

But notice that the first preamble to this resolution starts out with a tribute of respect to the laws of Illinois, of course reference being made to the laws in regard to Sunday. If these champions of law have read the statutes of Illinois very extensively, they have without doubt observed the following, taken from the "Revised Statutes of Illinois," Chicago Legal News Co., edition of 1887, edited by Harvey B. Hurd, page 438:—

If any two or more persons conspire or agree together, or the officers or executive committee of any society or organization or corporation, shall issue or utter any circular or edict as the action of or instruction to its members, or any other persons, societies, organizations or corporations, for the purpose of establishing a so-called boycott or black list, or shall post or distribute any written or printed notice in any place with the fraudulent or malicious intent wrongfully and wickedly to injure the person, character, business, or employment, or property of another, or to obtain money or other property by false pretenses, or to any illegal act injurious to the public trade, health, morals, police, or administration of public justice, or to prevent competition in the letting of any contract by the State, or the authorities of any counties, city, town, or village, or to induce any person not to enter into such competition, or to commit any felony, they shall be deemed guilty of a conspiracy; and every such offender, whether as individuals or as the officers of any society or organization, and every person convicted of conspiracy at common law, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not exceeding five years, or fined not exceeding $2,000, or both.

Now we submit the question in all candor, whether it is not just as wicked to trample under foot this law of Illinois against boycott, as it is to obliterate the Sunday statute; or will these Chicago people who are holding these mass-meetings in favor of the Sunday law insist that it is all right to trample under foot every other law of the State if need be, in their frantic zeal to enforce the observance of Sunday. And we would continually hold the matter up before all the people that such methods of procedure are anything else but Christian. No one should allow himself to be ensnared into such wickedness and folly.

A. O. Tait.
