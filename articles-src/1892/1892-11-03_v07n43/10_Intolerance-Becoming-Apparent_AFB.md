Intolerance Becoming Apparent.

It is every day becoming more apparent that there exists in this country in the hearts of men, an intolerance which few supposed could co-exist with the culture, enlightenment, and Christian sentiment of our Republic. The surprise at the discovery of this intolerance is only equaled when the apologies of its defenders are examined, as the following correspondence will prove.

The correspondence resulted from a document sent out by the National Religious Liberty Association, narrating how three Seventh-day Adventist farmers of Henry County, Tenn., were imprisoned for forty-five days, and afterwards worked in the chain-gang on the highway, for the crime (?) of performing common labor on their own premises on Sunday, after observing the previous day as the Sabbath.

Cincinnati, Ohio, Oct. 4, 1892.

"Mr. A. F. Ballenger,
Chicago, Ill.

"Dear Sir: The observance of Sunday as a day of rest is required by our civil ordinances, enacted by our people in self government.

"Any one who can not keep our laws should be punished, or he should go to some other country where the laws suit him.

"The observance of Sunday as a day of rest from ordinary labor, does not exclude the enjoyment of rational and healthy recreation, and has nothing to do as a civil institution, with the worship of God. Any one is privileged to worship God in his own way, on Sunday or any other day of the week, or every day in the week.

"There is no persecution, nor any abridgment of religious liberty in our civil laws relating to the keeping of Sunday as a day of rest from the performance of common labor.

Yours truly,
D. W. Miller,
Editor Carriage World."

"Chicago, Ill., Oct. 6, 1892.

"Mr. D. W. Miller,
Editor Carriage World,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

"Dear Sir: Your communication of the 4th inst. just received. It is a frank statement of your views of the justice of placing Christian farmers in the chain-gang, and working them on the streets as a punishment for performing farm labor on their own premises on Sunday, after having observed the previous day, as the fourth commandment enjoined.

"Your frankness is commendable, notwithstanding your views are most tyrannical. Doubtless there are others who hold with you on the subject, but up to date, no one has had the courage to declare in favor of persecution as you have done. I take it for granted that you have no objection to my publishing your letter. It will be of great service to the cause of religious liberty, since it will awaken some to the fact that intolerance exists outside of Tennessee. One great trouble in enlisting broad minded public men in this question is that we are unable to convince them that the intolerant spirit, manifested in your letter, can be found outside a few benighted neighborhoods in the South.

"We do not question your sincerity in advocating punishment in the chain-gang, or banishment, for people who differ with you in religious practice, for Christ himself said to his disciples, 'The time cometh when whosoever killeth you will think he doeth God service.' However, Judge Hammond, of the United States Circuit Court, though deciding against these persecuted Christians in Tennessee, says:—

"It is a somewhat humiliating spectacle to see the Sunday advocates trying to justify the continuance of Sunday legislation, and thereby reaping its advantages to them as sectarians, upon the argument that it is not in conflict with the civic dogma of religious freedom. It surely is, and the economic value of a day of rest can not take that contention out of the category of being insincere as well as illogical.

"My belief in your sincerity leads me to attempt to enlighten you on this point, and for this purpose, I enclose a tract, entitled 'The Civil Sabbath.' Please give it a careful reading, and believe me,

Yours with respect,
A. F. Ballenger."

"Cincinnati, Ohio, Oct. 8, 1892.

"Mr. A. F. Ballenger,

"Dear Sir: In response to your favor of October 6, I will say I have no objection to your publishing my reply to your former letter, but I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am in accord with your views as expressed in the Articles 1 and 2 of your Constitution and the Declaration of Principles, but I do not regard the breaking of our present laws, the proper way to bring about a reform in them. We have other, more peaceable and effective means of reforming our laws—if they are wrong. I said nothing about placing Christian farmers in the chain-gang, as you infer. But, inasmuch as there is nothing in our present laws prohibiting any one from worshiping God in his own way and time, and having a Sabbath every day in the week, if he wants it, I fail to see the justice of your argument on that point. I believe the seventh day to be the divinely appointed Sabbath, but in a religious sense, it is immaterial what day of the week you count from. It is only possible to have a general rest-day by common agreement and to insure such a day once in every seven, it was necessary to enact civil laws to insure its observance. This was not done solely on religious grounds or for religious purposes. Other purposes equally important, make a rest day once in seven a necessity.

"Having once agreed on a day, it is difficult to conceive of any good reason for changing it, and those people who can't abide by our laws, ought to go to some other country. We suggest the Desert of Sahara as a place favorable to the carrying out of their plans without interruption.

"The idea that liberty means the privilege of doing as you please without regard to others, is anarchistic. The obedience to the powers that be is just as divine in its essence as that in observance of the seventh day of rest. Quibbling about the calling of a day seventh or the first is childish at this period of the world's history.

"If imprisonment and the chain-gang is too severe a punishment in the judgment of Tennesseeans for its citizens who break its Sunday laws, that is a matter which its citizens are competent to alter, but it would be easier to comply with the laws as they are.

Yours truly,
D. W. MILLER."

"Chicago, Ill., Oct. 17, 1892.
"MR. D. W. MILLER,
"Editor Carriage World,
"Cincinnati, Ohio.

"Dear Sir: Your favor of the 8th inst., written I take it, to prevent your former letter being 'misunderstood,' has been received, and its contents noted. If there was any danger of your position, as presented in your first letter, being misunderstood, that danger is wholly removed by your second communication. I fear, however, that you misunderstand your own position, for I can not conceive how you can understandingly hold the views your letters contain.

"With a view to converting you from the error of your way, I will state your position in its true light. This letter is inspired with a brother's interest in you, but I shall be frank, for I believe your case requires 'heroic treatment.'

"You believe (1) 'the seventh day to be the divinely appointed Sabbath'; and (2) that 'it is immaterial what day you count from' in ascertaining which day is the 'divinely appointed Sabbath.' You believe (3) that after you, with the majority, have done the counting, and 'divinely appointed' the first day to be the seventh day, that it is 'necessary to enact civil laws to insure its observance'; and (4) after you have 'divinely appointed' the first day to be the seventh day, and secured the enactment of a law enforcing your opinion, 'it is difficult to conceive of any good reason for changing it.' You further believe that 'those people who can not abide by our laws (laws made to enforce the observance of the seventh day on the first day) ought to go to some other country.' You 'suggest (5) the Desert of Sahara (not an oasis in that desert where human life might be preserved, but the uninhabitable waste of burning sand) as a place favorable to the carrying out of their plans without molestation.'

"You believe (6) that when Christians refuse to accept your 'divinely appointed' count and prefer to obey the command of God, 'Six days shall thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work,' and patiently suffer the penalty of your law in the chain-gang, that their conduct is 'anarchistic.'

"You believe (7) that 'obedience to the powers that be (when you are in power and desire to enforce your views of the fourth commandment on others) is just as divine as the commandment requiring a 'seventh day of rest.' You do not believe with the Apostle Peter that 'We ought to obey God rather than men'; but on the contrary you believe (8) that we ought to obey men rather than God.

"You believe after your 'childish' 'quibbling' by which you come to the conclusion that the seventh day of the Bible, the almanac, and all history, is the first day of the Bible, the almanac, and all history, that (9) 'quibbling about calling a day the seventh, or the first, is childish at this period of the world's history.'

"You do not favor even the modification of the laws which place Tennessee Christians in jail and work them in the chain-gang for laboring on their farms six days according to the commandment; but believe (10) 'it would be easier to comply with the laws as they are.' You believe (11) in religious liberty(!)

"Hoping that this frank statement of your position may lead you to discover its medieval tyranny, and as a result, effect your conversion, I am,

Yours for religious freedom,
A. F. BALLENGER."
