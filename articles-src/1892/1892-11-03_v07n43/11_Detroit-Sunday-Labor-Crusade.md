## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

A COMPLAINT against street pavers, in the city of Detroit, Mich., for working on Sunday in the neighborhood of a church has developed into an organized crusade against all Sunday labor. The opportunity has also been taken, in one pulpit, to antagonize that clause of the commandment which says 'the seventh day is the Sabbath,' and also those who observe that day.
