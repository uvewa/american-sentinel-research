THERE is a phase of the Sunday legislation by Congress that has not been set forth as it deserves to be outside of the record of the proceedings of Congress itself. We refer to that phase of the position of interpretation of the divine law.

In the Congressional Record of July 10, 1892, page 6613, in the following:—

Mr. QUAY—On page 35, line 14, after the word "act," I move to insert—

"And no further payment shall be made by the president until the authority for the closing of the Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, shall have been obtained."

The reason of the amendment I will not be able to give to the Senate at this time, as it will be necessary for me to read from the Book of Law 1 and to explain why, that part involved in the legislation.

THE VICE PRESIDENT—The part italicized shall be read.

Mr. QUAY continued:—

"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed Saturday day, and hallowed it."

The foregoing is all that was said or done in relation to the question that day.

That legislation day, however, the question was taken up and discussed. This debate was opened by Senator Manderson of Nebraska. And in the Record of July 12, pages 6694, 6693, 6701,—

The language of the announcement is that the Exposition shall be closed on the "Sabbath day." I submit that if the senator from Pennsylvania desires that the Exposition shall be closed upon Sunday this language will not necessarily meet that idea. The Sabbath day is not Sunday.

"The Sabbath" does not "simply mean that it is a rest day, and it may be Saturday or Sunday, and it would be subject to the discretion of those who have the control of the management whether they would close the Exposition on the last day of the week, commonly called Saturday, and known by the Israelites and the Seventh day Baptists, or on the first day of the week, generally known as the Christian Sabbath. It certainly seems to me that this amendment, if adopted by the senator from Pennsylvania, and, if he proposes to close this Exposition, that it should be closed on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Therefore I offer an amendment to the amendment, which I hope may be accepted by the senator from Pennsylvania, to strike out the words "Exposition on the Sabbath day," and insert instead thereof, the following:—

"Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Mr. QUAY—I accept the amendment, so far as it changes the phraseology of the amendment, because it more clearly defines the day of the week on which the Exposition shall be closed.

THE VICE PRESIDENT—The senator from the private secretary the reports in part:

Mr. HISCOCK—Let the amendments of the senator from Pennsylvania, as modified, be reported.

THE VICE PRESIDENT—It will be again reported.

Mr. HARRIS—Let the amendments of the senator from Pennsylvania, as modified, be reported.

The Vice President—It will again be reported.

Senator COLQUITT.—On page 113, line 5, after the word "act," it is proposed to insert the following as a condition of the continuance of this appropriation:

"That no part of the money hereby appropriated shall be applied to the management of said Exposition on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

This amendment was afterwards further amended by the insertion of the proviso that the managers of the Exposition should sign an agreement to close the Fair on Sunday before they could receive any of the appropriation; but this which we have given is the material point.

Acts of this the House confirmed in the conference report by the Senate amendments. Besides this, the House had already, on its own part, by a vote of 131 to 30, declared that Sunday is the "Christian Sabbath," and by a vote of 149 to 1 that the seventh day is not the Sabbath. And thus did the Congress of the United States, not only take sides in a religious controversy and discuss and decide a religious question. But put itself in the place and assume to itself the prerogative of authoritative interpreter of the divine law. For, from the official record of the proceedings it appears:

1. The divine law was officially and in its very words, adopted as containing the "reasons" and forming the basis of the legislation. In other words, the legislation proposed only to enforce the divine law as quoted from the Book.

2. Yet those to whom the legislation was directed, and who were expected to execute its provisions were not allowed to read and construe the divine law for themselves; and this for the very reason that, "the discretion" of the management might take the divine word as it reads and as it was actually quoted in the official proceedings, and close the Exposition on the day plainly specified in this divine word which was cited as the reason and authority for the action taken.

3. Therefore, to preclude any such possibility, Congress assumed the prerogative of official and authoritative interpreter of the divine law, and declared that "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, is the Sabbath of the fourth commandment of the divine law, and not the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." In other words that the seventh day mentioned in the commandment is not the seventh day but the first day, and that the Sabbath of the Lord thy God!

That is what the Congress of the United States has done. And in the doing of it, has violated every rule and every principle that governs in the interpretation of law. And a rule for the interpretation of law is this:—

"A law is the best expositor of itself; and the whole of the law is to be considered in determining the construction of any of its parts."

What then was the intent of the law-giver when the Sabbath commandment was given? Did the Lawgiver declare, or show in any way, his intention? He did. He declared his words in his Book to

served. Nor did he leave them to decide for themselves which day they would have for the Sabbath. He did not leave it to the people to interpret a law for themselves, nor to interpret it at all. By forms unknown to themselves, kept, by continually for forty years, the Lord showed his intent in the law. The people were fed with manna for forty years in the journey between Egypt and Canaan. The manna fell six days in the week but it never fell. On the sixth day of the week a double supply was gathered, and that which was gathered on the sixth day would keep over the seventh day, while it could not be made to do on any other day of the week. By this means the Lawgiver signified his intent upon the subject of the day mentioned in his law quoted by Congress. And by keeping it up so continuously and for so long a time be made it impossible for the people to misunderstand his intent, and he left all future generations who have the record of it, without excuse in gathering anything else as to what the commandment refers to in the Sabbath. Therefore when Congress legislated upon "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday," as the "Sabbath of the fourth commandment— the seventh day is the Sabbath," it set itself against the divine word and intent of the Most High.

ANOTHER ESTABLISHED RULE is this:

"Statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed, and they are not to be extended by implication, and if not so in aid to construction, they must be followed to the exact letter." Story on the Constitution, 186.

Are the words of this commandment quoted by Congress, plain words? They are nothing else. There is not a difficult, not an ambiguous word in the whole commandment. The sentence reads them— there is no room for any construction; much less is there room for any such construction as would make the expression "the seventh day" mean "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday." Fitting to this exactly is the still more established rule of interpretation. "When the words of a Statute are plain," or of the Testament they are given to us "there is no room for construction." A rule is, In Mark 16: 1, 2, are these words—

"And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun."

These people arose very early in the morning of "the first day of the week," yet the Sabbath was past. Now Congress has declared that the first day of the week is the Sabbath on "the first day of the week," because Inspiration has declared that the Sabbath is past before the first day of the week comes. It matters not how early that Christians and devout Christians and the World's Fair Commission, lay out and around on "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday," they will not be to take to find the Sabbath there, for the Lord says that it is "past."

And if in the Sabbath according to the commandment, too, that is past before the first day of the week comes the Sabbath according to this very commandment which Congress has officially cited. Here only remains the question of construction.

And they examined and proposed spices and ointments; and "on the Sabbath day rested according to the commandment. But upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher, and the stone rolled away from the sepulcher." Luke 23: 56; 24: 1-2.

In this plain view of the Word, stating plainly and proving conclusively that the Sabbath and the observance of the day to the satisfaction of the intent of the commandment which Congress has officially cited, is the day before the first day of the week, commonly called Saturday; and not that commonly called Sunday; and that the last day of the week, commonly according to this commandment, is put before "the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday," comes at all, no matter what early day set up to the first day of the week.

It is true that the churches are at the head of all this, and that Congress did it at this dictation and under the threats of the churches. It is true that the churches have put this false interpretation upon the commandment, and this adds nothing of force upon Congress. This is all true, but that does not relieve Congress from the guilt of perverting the law of the Most High, of forcing into that law a meaning which does not even belong there, and of putting itself in the place of the supreme authority in the interpretation of his laws. Congress had no business to engage in any such proceeding upon any consideration. Judge Cooley—"Constitutional Limitations."

A court or legislature which should allow a construction to be put upon an instrument in a written Constitution a construction not warranted by the intention of its authors would be justly chargeable with a reckless disregard of official oath and public duty.

For Congress gave to the Sabbath commandment a construction which was not warranted by, and was contrary to, the intention of the Author of the commandment, and this adds nothing of force to the demand with threats that it allow it to be so influenced, by ecclesiastical interests and sentiments and political threats, to give to the written Constitution of the Government of the living God, a construction which it is in no way warranted by the intention of the founder of that Constitution, and all sound and legislative construction, Congress is justly chargeable in doing that very thing. Such a thing Congress has done. By its own legislative statute, being justly chargeable to reckless disregard of official oath and public duty, what must be chargeable against those who put such a construction upon this Constitution and the heavenly law? The National Legislature—the Congress of the United States—has allowed the churches to dictate to the commandment of an act with reference to the Constitution and laws of the Infinite God, which if done only with the laws of men would be reckless disregard of official oath and public duty. And both Congress and the churches are without excuse in the matter.

By this legislation, at the dictate of the churches, Congress has distinctly and absolutely put itself and the Government of the United States into the place where it has established, and proposes to enforce, the observance of an institution as sacred, which never was established by the law of the Lord; the Lord has neither established nor required the observance of that institution; the plain word of the Lord upon the subject of his own institution makes no such claims as due to the Lord. And in the doing of this Congress has also assumed to itself the prerogative of authoritative interpreter of Scripture for the people of the land and for all who could be reached; and this in the land and the place of God by authoritatively deciding a religious question. Properly the question as to the respective claims of the State, and what each, if not both, belongs to the Lawgiver. And the Lord, the Lord, is the Lord's indeed, although of a certainty he is also that of God.

It thus submitting to the dictates of the churches, and making itself the official interpreter of the divine law and the "properly" definitions and interpretations of the divine law, the Congress of the United States has given over the Government of the United States into the hands of the combined churches. A former formation where time long ago stated the principle thus:—

This is precisely what has been done before the law of the people of the United States in this Sunday legislation of the Congress. If it were to be confined to the "Catholic" Church, as a union of the body with the legislation, and still further church Congress did, and still further church under this law shall be passed. Congress did not stop with merely assuming the prerogative and in so doing it did deprive the people of the right of private judgment, which they had retained in their own hands by the provisions of the First Amendment, and make the churches the governing power.

"Government of the Church, by the people, for the people, means simply that there has been established in the state, a comprehensive and complete union of churches, and for the churches."

That is the Congress of the United States has been left by the churches to do. And in the doing of it, he has assumed the place of the infallible interpreter of the divine Nation, the example and glory of all the world, the nations do please God by the world, to assume the place and to exercise the prerogative of the Papacy of the Middle Ages in enforcing the dogmas and interpretations of the church instead of the Scriptures, and the arbitrary and despotic will of the Church in place of the Constitution.
