EDITOR CORRIDOR WORLD,

Chicago, Ill., Oct. 1, 1892.

D. W. MILLER.

EDITOR CORRIDOR WORLD,

Cincinnati, Ohio.

Dear Sir: Your composition of the 4th inst. just received. It is a frank statement of your views of the justice of placing Christian farmers in the chain-gang, and working them in the streets and roads of Tennessee for doing quiet work on their own premises on Sunday, after keeping another day as the Sabbath, the fourth commandment enjoined.

"Your frankness is commendable, so is your sincerity, but your 'childish' publishing by which you come to the conclusion that the seventh day of the Bible, the almanac, and all history, is the first day of the Bible, the almanac, and calendar, is not by anything called either a day, a seventh, or the first, is childish as this period of the world's history.

"You do not favor even the modification of these Sunday laws that put Christians in jail and work them in the chain-gang because they rest the other six days according to the commandment; but believe them (it) to be wrong to comply with the laws as they are. You conclude:—

"'Hoping that this frank statement of your position has laid you to discover of incidental tyranny, and as a result, offer some relief.'

"You believe 'after your childish' publishing by which you come to the conclusion that the seventh day of the Bible, the almanac, and all history, is the first day of the Bible, the almanac, and calendar; that 'by anything called either a day a seventh, or the first, is childish as this period of the world's history.

"'You do not favor even the modification of these Sunday laws that put Christians in jail and work them in the chain-gang because they rest the other six days according to the commandment; but believe them (it) to be wrong to comply with the laws as they are.' You conclude:—

"The idea that liberty means the privilege of doing as you please without regarding others, is unscriptural. The obedience to the powers that be is just as direct in its evidence as that its observance of the seventh day of rest. Quitting about the calling of a day seventh or of the first and children at this period of the following:—

"'If imprisoned and the chain-gang,' the people by the consent of the department of Tennessee for its citizens to work on Sunday. 'And that quiet work done in the fields of a farm, in which the citizens are competent to alter, in law is neutral in its matter to comply with the laws as they are.'

Yours truly,

MRS. D. W. MILLER."

Chicago, Ill., Oct. 1, 1892.

*Editor Corridor World*,

Cincinnati, Ohio.

Dear Sir: Your favor of the 5th inst., written I take it, to prevent your former letter being misunderstood, has been received, and its contents noted. If there was any danger of your position, in your second communication is more clearly shown by your second communication. I fear, however, that you misunderstand your position, that danger is wholly removed by your second communication. I fear, however, that you misunderstand your position so that you can understandably hold the views you express.

With a view to convincing you from the error of your ways I will take your position statement by statement in the hope that I shall be frank, for I believe your case requires very heroic treatment.

"You believe (1) 'the seventh day to be the divinely appointed Sabbath.' You state (2) that 'it is immaterial what day you rest,' and it is immaterial which day is the 'divinely appointed Sabbath.' You believe (3) that after you, with the majority, have done the trampling, and the minority appointed the first day to be observed, that man should not be 'forced by civil laws to insure its observance;' and (4) yet you say that 'the majority has spoken' and 'the first day to be the seventh in enforcing your opinion, 'it is difficult to conceive of any good reason for charging it.' You further believe that 'those people who are not able by your own laws of this country,' were made to enforce the observance of the seventh on the first day ought to go to some other country.' You argue 'that the liberty of the United States.' I then replied: 'Does not the State of California have upon it some provision and also some law against assault upon a State that desert where human life might be preserved, but the unchristian-like matter of murdering and a place favorable to the safe carrying out of their plans without interference?'

WHEREAS, it is contrary to the laws of Illinois for any employer or corporation to require employees to enter into an agreement not to join or become a member of any labor organizations through the agency of the daily press, we condemn this thing in our State on October 21, demonstrating against the condition.

WHEREAS the citizens of the West Side, in mass meeting assembled and the representatives of the Board of Trade and the Board of Aldermen, her 21, earnestly protested against the continuance of this condition.

WHEREAS the Sunday Alliance has ascertained that we, the purchasing public of this, the West Side of Chicago, a municipality of about 350,000 people, that may upon its doors on Sunday.

This declares a general boycott. They declare a refusal to purchase their goods and by any store that may have purchased of this resolution. Whatever may be thought or believed in regard to the sanctity of Sunday and whether or not it be a Christian institution, it must be admitted that the boycott is not a Christian method of compelling the observance of Sunday. To try it on the plan, in order to give some of their clerks an opportunity to close up their businesses and compel them to rest on Sunday. The individual who does not have enough faith in the principles of the Christian religion to observe the Christian day without having it forced on him to that extent, by the taking away of his job, has not learned the first principles of the religion of Christ.

But notice that the first preamble to the resolution starts out with a tribute of respect to the laws of Illinois, of course referencing being made to the law as to Sunday. If these champions of the observance of Sunday law have read the statutes of Illinois extensively, they have without doubt observed the following:—

"Revised Statutes of Illinois," Chicago Legal News Co., edition of 1887, edited by Harvey B. Hurd, page 458:—

If two or more persons conspire or agree together, or any society or organization or corporation, shall adopt any rule or regulation, commanding or instruction to its members, or any other persons, to boycott or threaten to boycott, or withhold their patronage, or to refuse to deal with, by any firm, or shall post or distribute any written or printed notice in any place, threatening to boycott. against any person, character, business or employment; or any firm or partnership, corporation, or other property by false pretenses or by any legal means any person, firm or corporation so as to hinder or prevent any person from carrying on, or to prevent competition in the selling of any article, commodity or thing or to prevent or shall conspire or agree together or cause to extort that not to enter into such competition, or to quit or leave the service of such employer or company; and every such offender, whether a corporation, or otherwise, or every person so participating, and every person convicted of conspiracy, or other common law, shall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not exceeding five years of time had passed.

Now we submit the question in all candor, whether it is not just as wicked to trample upon the good law of Illinois against boycott, as it is to obliterate the Sunday statute, or will these Chicago moralists have but one side to their morality? If in favor of the Sunday law insist upon its enforcement, and so say we of every other law of the State if need be, just so good a law as the law for the observance of Sunday. And we would confidently hold the matter up before all the people that such methods of procedure as anything else but Christian. No one should allow himself to be assumed into wickedness and folly.

A. O. TAIT.
