The following extract from a private letter written by an old man of about seventy-five, a member of the Springfield Seventh-day Adventist Church, at Springfield, Henry County, Tenn., tells its own story:—

"I would like to write a good long letter explaining our situation; it would take a book to tell what we do, and if I should be sent to jail for it, it would be a shame to this county and State, and I am an old man, being seventy-five years old, tried for Sunday work. I presume we would have no trouble if it was not for the Sunday law; I would not be arrested, but we have to go to court, one case, one; and further, if I am imprisoned for working on Sunday, as they call it, our property will certainly be taken from us. I have had serious trouble on account of these things, and getting into jail on account of my religious faith; but God will provide, and I hope I may have strength to go through with it all, and be a good soldier of the cross; and pray for me and mine, that all that we may overcome through the blood of the Lamb."

Four days later another letter from the same writer says:—

"I am indicted along with some thirteen others of our people, on the charge of Sabbath-breaking, and I do not know when the trials will come off, and indeed we do not exactly know. The sheriff says it may come off this week, or it may be it would be arrested either this week or next. But be that as it may, let it be as it will be. My case is set for the next term of court, the first of next February, which I think begins next Feb. 1, 1893, as conditions we are to give bond or go to jail. This is what we must all do, and God knows we are not guilty of crime, and we are sorry that we had to come before the court."

But for our appearance in court.

The two together tell their story. What is the charge? "Sabbath-breaking!" What is the effect of the enforcement of just laws, is harder and more unjust than that of a kind neighbor as thyself? It is a story of peacefully loving neighbors. There is no inquisition. Is it right that here, in this land of the free, quiet and exact justice is meted out to all? Or does it mark as the "Sabbath day's" approach, that our land and our boat has become a mocker's justice hole for its shame. Equality before the law is at an end. Persecution region. Children are called before grand juries to criminate their parents. Professors of their religion face all the shame of public trial and the danger to their liberty. Old men are in dread of the county jail, or labor in the chain-gang on public roads. Neighborhood inquisitors
