REFERRING to the recent trials and imprisonments of Seventh-day Adventist Church in Tennessee for labor on Sunday, the *Baltimore Sun*, under the head, "Are These Blue Laws in Under the Lord," says:

There has been a strong sentiment for some time in Massachusetts where people had there difficulties over the question of what constitutes the practice the cause of religion. To put the Seventh-day Adventists in jail for following the plain precepts of the Old Testament and engaging in an industry that is both harmless and useful, which can not disturb the rest of other people, is certainly very far from presenting the true face of religion.

The *New York Independent of October 6*, thus expressed itself on a similar case of the Seventh-day Adventists arrested for common labor on Sunday:

A shameful outrage was recently committed at Dayton, Rhea County, Tennessee. A number, a dozen or more, of four Seventh-day Adventists for performing labor on Sunday, were imprisoned. After being in jail over six weeks, three of these men were convicted by a jury, and sentenced to a fine and costs, or in default thereof to work on the streets in company with some common criminals. Of the men convicted, one was an old man of about sixty years of age, another a man of five and another sixty years of age, and all of them are men of blameless lives and of good standing in the community.

The *New York Independent* of October 6, thus expresses itself:—

These have been for some years, and we many years, had occasion to express our profound indignation at the persecuting laws of Tennessee as applied to some country farmers belonging to the Seventh-day Adventist or the Seventh-day Baptist churches, who after resting from their labor during the week, worked in their field on the first day of the week. We have once more to express the same indignation.

A *Chattanooga* (*Tenn.*) *Times*, October 9, prints the article in the Baltimore *Sun* from which we have above quoted, styling it "a scathing arraignment of the authorities in our War Temperance counties, for proceeding against citizens of those communities for working in their fields on Sunday." Continuing, the editor of the *Times* says:—

The citizens in question are Seventh-day Adventists, whose religious belief compels them to observe Saturday as their Sabbath. In order to disturb their Sunday keeping neighbors, work was done in secluded fields by the men and women who were arrested. The Adventists regard the seventh day of the week—Saturday—as the day of rest. The *Sun's* attorney who investigated the case found that the pleas for morality were above reproach; that they had selected the most secluded and the most lonely country districts, which closely borders with certain forms of religious persecution in other sections of the world. They said they did not wish to be disturbers of the peace. They said they had no desire to labor; but that they had deliberately broken an unjust law to test its constitutionality. In a few cases, they had worked on their own farms, plowing and doing other work. In other cases, they had done simple, quiet, household work about their houses, such as feeding and doing a little of the lighter kinds of work. In every instance they were in secluded districts, quiet and retired, and acted out their sentences. One emissary of an organized persecution went from county to county to find and report on those who worked on Sunday, and by the evidence of one man alone, in many cases, these convictions were obtained. It requires the piece attorneys and innumerable reports of evidence to convict in such a case. But none of this persecution can stand. The men who are its tools are known by all men in their communities, and will be known hereafter as persecutors kind. Ought not this nation, already great and powerful, to show a nobler aspect of its vaunted freedom?

The Seventh day Adventist is a considerable and well organized denomination, with churches and congregations in every part of the country, with its busy intelligent and progressive adherents in many parts of the world. It has an important college at Battle Creek, Mich., and owns and controls publishing interests and mission stations in different parts of the world. It is one of the largest and most prosperous of strictly American institutions of this kind in the South. One of its largest churches is at Graysville, in this State. Its members contributed largely to the building, and also contributing to the church the founding of a college in that village. While most of the denomination are in the Northern and Western States, Tennessee and its West Tennessee has given them pause. The cases will be appealed to the State Supreme and the courts, in one grand division, and prosecuting attorneys general, etc., of the churches and the Sunday-keepers are urged to come and to bring and keep alive the Spanish Inquisition in America.

Passenger trains run regularly on Sunday, as if it were a week day. The post-offices open. The mail is carried. Every mill and factory does its hardest and most profitable day's work on that day. Hotels are kept open and they do their heaviest cooking on that day than on any other. The newspaper offices work night and day on Saturday and deliver papers on Sunday morning. The farmer is in a certain conditions as before. The factories permit a lot of bigots to haul up and punish in the name of the law a few Adventists who can not afford to lie idle two days, and their one only offense is the exercise of their inherent rights of conscience.

Repeal that miserable relic of the Blue Laws, they say, and set these people free. There is nothing else to be done.
