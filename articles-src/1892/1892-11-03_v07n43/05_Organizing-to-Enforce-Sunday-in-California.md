A CORRESPONDENT writes from Santa Barbara, Cal., of the formation there, October 1, of a County Sunday Law Union. In the course of the meeting these resolutions were adopted:—

*Resolved*, 1st, That this organization be called the County Sunday Law Union of Santa Barbara County.

2d, That it is our conviction, that it is the absence of a Sunday law that is the cause of the desecration of the day.

3. We pledge our fealty to co-operation with all other like organizations in the State of California.

4. We urge upon pastors the necessity of making our churches centers of influence in behalf of a better observance of the Sabbath.

5. We urge upon Sunday school teachers and those who have the training of the young the importance of inculcating upon the young minds in our instruction regarding rest on the seventh day.

6. We earnestly recommend the desecration of this day by ball playing and other forms of popular amusement.

7. We urge upon all our Christian citizens the observance of the existing Sunday laws on our statute book, and earnestly recommend to our pastors to preach on this subject.

Short addresses were made by different ministers present, in favor of the resolutions, in which it was held to be in effect, that unless California should soon have a Sunday law on her statute book she could not retain the name of a Christian State as justification. Another said, "the worst class of opposition comes from the Seventh-day Adventists." Another said that "the saloon-keepers were not unwilling to submit to the law, but Seventh-day Adventists thought it would hurt their business in open defiance to the law of the land in reference to proper Sunday observance."

The matter of exemption clauses was raised by this question, which was handed about in the meeting, and it provoked a clause in favor of those who conscientiously keep another day as the Sabbath; but another said it would not do; it would be entering a wedge, and the Seventh-day Adventists, and the law is a nuisance, and that class of exemption clauses were made so that no trouble need be anticipated from that source. How well it was shown, through the people of the community present at the meeting, that they are conscientious in profession of religion.

Another minister thought the discussion of that question useless, "For," said he, "Are those Seventh-day Adventists—why there is only a handful of them; are they any, and for one, I waste no time on them. I don't believe there are worth the powder and shot to blow them up." All seemed as this was not of this opinion, for a Presbyterian minister, the last speaker, seemed to be very apt in behalf of these seventh-day people for citizens, and just as good Christians as there are in this town and county, or anywhere else.

This called out from the minister who had already been most prominent in the meeting a dissertation upon this Sabbath question, in which he attempted to show that Sunday was really the seventh day, prefacing his argument by the assertion that it was through ignorance that many were deceived in this matter.

At this point, a Seventh-day Adventist who was present, surprised the assembly by furnishing a few facts, and reproducing a few of the expressed sentiments of noted men of civil and religious liberty, but had no effect upon those who had advocated the measures. The meeting was closed promptly. "It is a fact that Church and State are becoming closely united, but few people are aware, in the enforcement of existing laws of their own State," that Sunday laws are now no longer a matter of abstract discussion, but are matters to be settled that question in its late decision." He then read extracts from a sermon of Justice Brewer to the Trinity Church congregation of that city.

That this considerable dissent from the positions taken by the resolutions should have been provoked was shown by the remarks of laymen, and proved the absolute futility of the effort to force the closing of the meeting when they acknowledged that they believed of the measures of this law to be enforced.

Further discussion of the resolutions and of the particular subject about which our correspondent has recorded these facts are not in this instance of very great significance. It is worthy to be noted that Sunday observance has now become the canon law of the Church and the law of the land the Church law, and neither law is sufficient to compel inquiry to require. This is a
