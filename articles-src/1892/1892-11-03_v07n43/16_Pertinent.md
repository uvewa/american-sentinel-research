PERTINENT to this subject is the following notice which the Pittsburgh *Dispatch* of October 10, makes of a sermon delivered on the previous day in that city:—

Rev. J. H. Patterson supplied the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church yesterday. Taking his text "Be thou faithful unto death," as his text, he delivered an eloquent plea for the Columbian observances and faithfulness to duty. Illustrating his theme under two heads, the second head of which was that when the Roman emperor came to the throne he issued an edict that the subjects of his empire should either renounce their faith and that Christianity is a deist.

The question is not one of vital importance; it may not be known, however, to say that while, technically, Paine was a deist, it is shown in the last text that he was no infidel. Webster says:—

*Infidel*, a. One who does not believe in the prevailing religion. "Faithless"— one who is without religious faith.

Paine was not a believer "in the divine origin and authority of the Christian religion," he was, therefore, an infidel, though more definitely and specifically, he was a deist.

In his prayer in connection with the dedication of the World's Fair buildings, at Chicago, on the 21st inst., Rev. Bishop Charles E. Fowler, D. D., LL. D., said:—

We thank Thee for a free conscience, by a free Church, of the last Sabbath day of rest, and hallowed it.

It must be that the Bishop has not heard of the persecution of Christians men in Tennessee for serving God according to the dictates of their own conscience, or possibly by saying the Cardinal Gibbons in his defining freedom of conscience as "freedom to do trivially according to the dictates of a right conscience," and thinks that the Adventist conviction is not a "right" Adventist conviction. But who is to be judge? of the convention? Who also can make them the conscience? Who also can know the secrets of the heart?

A LADY writing to the Cincinnati *Post* that makes her experience in arriving in that city by rail on Sunday as follows:—

"Dear Sir: In response to your favor of the 15th, in your letter stating the fact in your publishing and my reply to your letter shall be a reply to my copy of the former, but I did not come to the idea of the Grand Central Depot, in Chattanooga, into the reception room when the lamps were dark, and for the first time saw the clock, and saw, and said, and said, 'Is it time to go home?' In reply to my question, he said, 'No, not till midnight.' Were they preparing for grate change? No step, say, not even a carpet, not even a carpet on the floor, I got on my feet and walked to the platform, sat down in the cool air, and waited for the train's exhaustion, and the waiting of the passengers continued. Sunday, I pet down at one station, Sunday, I got down at next station, Sunday, I pet on my waist and found the waiting room to be cold. I asked the depot master if a room could not be had. He said, 'They are rooms and have a stove and I see a coal,' I went into a room and asked, 'Is there a fire?' and he said, 'no,' and I found that the office was not open, and was refused to be close on God's day! Travelling on Sundays is very disagreeable and ought to be prohibited. What hardship there is in the lives of those making long trips. If religious sentiment could prohibit all railroad travel on Sundays and change some vital points in these plans. If I were a minister, I would have a sermon on that subject every Sunday."

This is only another instance of a nonsensical Sunday regulation, and another example of a practice of strict and genuine, leaving a camel. The Sunday excursion trains are all right, but Sunday snap and levelheadedness.

A GENTLEMAN writing from Imlay City, Mich., says:—

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: In your issue of October 21, under an article headed "Was Thomas Paine a Christian?" I notice you make the statement that the "Paine was 'a Christian Deist' November 7 Sentinel," I notice that you in the foregoing: "Paine's religion, no matter what it was," is incorrect. It seems to me that the man who says "I believe in one God and to obey God and to love my neighbor as myself and not the worship of the congregation in this capacity or as a belief," of the arrangement of the congregation to God's people, of the belief in the divine government should be brought as make the positive statement that Paine was a deist.
