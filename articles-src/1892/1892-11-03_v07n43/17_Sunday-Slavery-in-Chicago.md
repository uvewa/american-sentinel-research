SUNDAY slavery is a favorite theme of the Chicago ministers just now. The time was when, if a man was converted to God, he turned away from following the world, and became a servant of his new and divine Lord to do his will and pleasure regardless of the customs and opinions of the time-serving and money-loving people around him. But not so nowadays according to the statement of some of the leading divines. But on the contrary, after the church has converted them, then it has to undertake a work of liberating them by removing every cross so that the convert will have no sacrifice to make in becoming a Christian and taking upon him the obligations of church membership.

SOME of these church members are clerks, and are employed by men who are Jews and Liberals, who keep their places of business open on Sunday. They have been induced to join the church, but they have not left off their Sunday work, although they know it is contrary to the law of the land, and the church teaches that it is contrary to the law of God. When men who happen to be Liberals or secularists do the same things, they are called Anarchists; but when the members of the church are involved, they are "slaves to a custom."

AN eminent clergyman of the city of Chicago recently in his Sunday evening discourse said, "There are many worthy members of my charge who never hear their pastor preach, except occasionally on Sunday evening they get excused by their employers at eight o'clock so that they can attend church." He said that it had been suggested to him that discipline would be a good thing in their case, but said he, "Before I would resort to that I would go out of the church myself, body, soul, and breeches." So these violators of the laws of God and man will be retained in the church until the proprietors can be compelled to release them by closing their places of business on Sunday, for the only remedy suggested by the reverend gentleman was agitation and boycott until these "slaves" should be released.
