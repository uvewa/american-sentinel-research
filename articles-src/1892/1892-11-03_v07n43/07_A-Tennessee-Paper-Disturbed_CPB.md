**A Tennessee Paper Disturbed.**

The Christian Patriot, published at Morristown, Tenn., is disturbed by the attitude of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and says:—

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL is continually yelping and snarling that our Sunday laws, which if enforced would secure to every laborer a Sabbath of rest, is religious legislation; because these laws are founded upon the fourth commandment and the religious convictions of the people.

Let us see. The laws forbidding murder and felonious assaults are founded on the sixth commandment and the religious opinions of the people. The laws forbidding lewdness are built on the seventh commandment and on Christianity. The laws forbidding stealing are founded on the eighth commandment. The laws forbidding perjury are founded on the ninth and third commandments. The law punishing bigamy is established on the first chapter of Genesis.

We trust that no unbeliever will be misled by the ill temper displayed by the Patriot, and imagine that Christianity is in any sense responsible for the unkind thrusts contained in the first paragraph of the quotation. All such things are due not to Christianity but to the lack of it.

THE SENTINEL does maintain that Sunday legislation is religious legislation; and this the Patriot virtually admits, and attempts to justify it. It is, however, an error to say that laws forbidding murder, lewdness, stealing, perjury, etc., are founded on the law of God as revealed in his word. Such laws existed long before the Scriptures were written, and have always existed among people totally unacquainted with divine revelation. Every offense mentioned by the Patriot has been punished by civil law in heathen nations and tribes with absolutely no reference to any divine law, but simply because the practice of any of these things is subversive of civil order and destructive of the most obvious natural human rights.

We learn from Gen. 12:18, 19, that over nineteen hundred years before Christ and almost five hundred years before the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, the king of Egypt recognized the right of Abraham to his own wife. And according to Miss Amelia R. Edwards, and George Rawlinson, both noted Egyptologists, the ancient Egyptians had a social code little behind our own. This does not detract in the least from the law of God as revealed in the Scriptures; it only shows the wisdom of the Creator in implanting in man such a sense of justice as would make existence not only possible but also enjoyable, to a certain extent, even under the darkness of heathenism.

That eminent moral philosopher and Christian, John Locke, thus sets forth this principle in defending the perpetuity of the marriage relation:—

The end of conjunction between male and female, being not barely procreation, but the continuation of the species, this conjunction betwixt male and female ought to last, even after procreation, so long as is necessary to the support and nourishment of the young ones, who are to be sustained by those who got them, till they are able to shift for themselves. . . . Wherein one can not but admire the wisdom of the great Creator, who having given to man foresight, and an ability to lay up for the future, as well as to supply present necessity, hath made it necessary, that the society of man and wife should be more lasting than of male and female amongst other creatures.

The principles thus applied to marriage by Locke, are equally true of all natural social relations; they are indicated by, and the rules that should govern them may readily be deduced from, the very nature of the relations themselves. We are not dependent upon revelation for a knowledge of the mutual obligations resting upon intelligent, social beings; for the Creator has written the laws that should govern human intercourse in the great book of nature, as well as in the volume of his revealed will. This truth is recognized in the Declaration of Independence, in the words: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The principles of God's moral law are not self-evident. It is true that they appeal to man's better nature when brought home to his conscience by the divine Spirit, but it is nevertheless true that man can not "by searching find out God." It is, therefore, upon the law revealed in nature, and not upon the law revealed in holy writ, that all just civil laws are based.

It is obvious from the principles stated that God could never commit to man the administration of His written law. That law being spiritual is vastly more than a civil code; it is a moral law; and God as the only moral Governor must administer it himself or else abdicate his throne. For if it were the province of the State to interpret and administer the law of God, the subject of that law would ask, not, What does God require? but, What does the State require? Not, What does the law of God say? But, What does the State say about the law of God? Thus, man's thought and loyalty would be diverted from God to his vicegerent, the State.

And not only would men seek merely to know the will of the State, caring little whether or not it was also the will of God, but the State being the divinely ordained interpreter and administrator of the divine law, God himself would be bound by the action of the State. That which the State prohibited would be sin; and that which it permitted would be virtue, regardless of the real purpose of the divine Lawgiver. For it is not supposable that God would clothe the State with authority to define and enforce his law and yet hold the subject responsible for the errors of the State.

But that mistakes are made when the State attempts to define the divine law is admitted. The Patriot says:—

We have no laws which are not based directly or remotely on the Bible. Some of them are bad laws; because our exegesis is bad, and they do not truly represent the teachings of the Bible.

And yet men must be governed by such laws under civil penalties even when they believe that they are contrary to the law of God, and when to obey them is to violate their conscientious convictions of duty toward God! Does any man in his sober senses believe that God ever ordained such a system? Does it not the rather bear the impress of "that man of sin, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God"?
