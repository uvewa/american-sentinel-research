IN his prayer in connection with the dedication of the World's Fair buildings, at Chicago, on the 20th ult., Rev. Bishop Charles H. Fowler, D. D., LL. D., said:

We thank Thee for a free conscience, by a free Church, in a free State, for a free people.

It must be that the Bishop has not heard of the persecution of Christian men in Tennessee for serving God according to the dictates of their consciences; or possibly he agrees with Cardinal Gibbons in defining freedom of conscience as "freedom to worship according to the dictates of a right conscience," and thinks that the Adventist conscience is not a "right" conscience. But who is to be the judge of the conscience? Who alone can judge the conscience? Who alone knows the secrets of the heart?
