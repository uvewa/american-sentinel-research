A GENTLEMAN writing from Imlay City, Mich., says:—

EDITOR AMERICAN SENTINEL: In your issue of date October 13, under an article headed "True Christianity Never Persecutes," I notice that you use the following language: "Paine, infidel though he was," etc. Is this correct? It seems to me that the man who wrote: "I believe in one God and no other and to do good is my religion," can not by any stretch of the imagination be called properly an infidel. I find that "Appleton's Encyclopedia" makes the positive statement that Paine was a deist.

The question is not one of vital importance; it may not be amiss, however, to say that while, technically, Paine was a deist, it is none the less true that he was an infidel. Webster says:—

Infidel. n. One who does not believe in the prevailing religious faith; especially, one who does not believe in the divine origin and authority of Christianity; a Mohammedan; a heathen; a free-thinker.

Paine was not a believer "in the divine origin and authority of Christianity;" he was, therefore, an infidel, though more definitely and specifically, he was a deist.
