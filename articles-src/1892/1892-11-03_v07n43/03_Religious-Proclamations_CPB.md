**Religious Proclamations.**

An interesting question arose recently, in this State, in regard to the President's Proclamation declaring October 21st a legal holiday. The Governor of New York issued no proclamation; and the question that arose was, "Does the President's Proclamation make the 21st of October a legal holiday in New York?" The law of New York makes New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Christmas, and every general election day, public holidays; also any other day appointed or recommended, by the governor of the State or the President of the United States, as a day of thanksgiving or fasting and prayer, or other religious observance.

The view of the matter generally taken in this city was thus expressed by a leading lawyer:—

The President of the United States has appointed or recommended that Friday, October 21, 1892, be set apart as a holiday, and in that proclamation the President recommends that the people cease from their daily vocations and devote themselves to such exercises as may best give honor to the discovery of America. He further recommends that the people assemble in the churches, and by religious exercises, in a fitting manner, give expressions of gratitude to Divine Providence for the divine care which has directed our history and blessed our people. By this proclamation the President has set aside this day especially for religious observance, and by so doing he has brought the day within the provision of the New York statute as being one set aside for religious observance. It seems to me there can be little doubt that the President's proclamation makes October 21, 1892, a legal holiday in the State of New York.

It does not seem necessary that the Governor of the State of New York should make any proclamation upon this subject in order to make to-morrow a legal holiday any more than it would be for the Governor to make a proclamation making New Year's Day a legal holiday, for the New York State statute makes any day set apart by the President of the United States for religious observance a holiday just as much as the same statute makes New Year's Day a legal holiday.

It has so long been the custom in this country for the President and the governors of the several States to appoint an annual thanksgiving day that very few people think strange that it should be so, and never stop to inquire as to the propriety of a civil ruler setting apart a day for religious purposes. But the way in which this has been put in the foregoing legal opinion, presents this matter in a little different light. In this opinion it is said, and correctly so too, that the day was "set apart by the President of the United States as a day of religious observance." This leads to the inquiry, What right has the President, or any other civil officer, to set apart a day for religious purposes?

The framers of the Constitution certainly had no thought of conferring upon the President the power to set apart days for religious purposes. President Jefferson, who certainly understood the real intent of the Constitution as well as any man, refused to issue any religious proclamation, and in a letter to Rev. Mr. Miller, near the close of his second term, gave his reason thus:—

I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, disciplines, or exercises.

Under the rule laid down by Chief Justice Waite, namely, that to ascertain the meaning of the First Amendment to the Constitution, we must go "to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision was adopted," religious proclamations are clearly excluded. Of this amendment Jefferson said that it directly precluded the United States from assuming an authority over religious exercises.

To the plea that a thanksgiving proclamation was only a recommendation, Jefferson said:—

But it is only proposed that I should recommend, not prescribe, a day of fasting and prayer. That is, that I should indirectly assume to the United States an authority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly precluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is to carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty, on those who disregard it; not, indeed, of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree of proscription, perhaps, in public opinion. And does the change in the nature of the penalty make the recommendation less a law of conduct for those to whom it is directed?

Concerning the effect of such proclamations on religion itself, Jefferson said:—

I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the general Government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the enjoining them an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.

Jefferson and Madison were the two men mainly instrumental in securing the First Amendment to the Constitution, and both regarded it as interdicting any official recognition of religion whatever. Mr. Madison in a letter to Edward Livingston, July 10, 1822, said:—

There has been a deviation from the strict principle in the executive proclamations of fasts and festivals.

If it be urged that Madison himself issued such proclamations, it will be sufficient to answer that in this same letter to Mr. Livingston, and directly upon this subject, he said:—

Whilst I was honored with the executive trust, I found it necessary, upon more than one occasion, to follow the example of my predecessors.

Mr. Madison offers an excuse but no justification for his action. But we now see that what was then only a custom has now come, especially in the light of the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, to be regarded as law. But this only illustrates the danger in such customs.

Jefferson boldly maintained that the First Amendment prohibited the issuing of religious proclamations; Madison assented to the proposition but yielded to the custom under protest, but now our President assumes without scruple to set aside a day especially for religious observance and directs the churches how they shall observe it, and everybody meekly and unquestioningly accepts his action as all right. The Nation or at least those religiously inclined in it worship as their high priest—such at least for the occasion—directs. And such direction is clearly in violation of the intent of the framers of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
