**Sad Words from Tennessee.**

The following extract from a private letter written by an old gentleman of seventy-five, a member of the Springville Seventh-day Adventist Church, at Springville, Henry County, Tenn., tells its own story:—

I have been thinking to-day a good deal about what we would do if I should be sent to jail the latter part of January, as I certainly would be if tried for Sunday work. I presume we would have to hire a boy to take care of our little stock. I can hardly see how the family would get along without some one, and, further, if I am imprisoned about February 1, it would prevent me getting any crop in next season. But perhaps it is wrong to borrow trouble on account of these things, and perhaps I may not be among the arrested ones. The Lord will provide, and I hope I may have sustaining grace for every trial. Let us hear from you when you can find time to write, and pray for us all that we may overcome through the blood of the Lamb.

Four days later another letter from the same hand says:—

I am indicted along with some thirteen others of our church, for working on Sunday. Brother Ward told me so yesterday evening. Just who are indicted we do not exactly know. The sheriff told the person who told Brother Ward that we would be arrested either this week or next.

Now what we shall have to do will be to shape ourselves as best we can for my imprisonment somewhere near Feb. 1, 1893, as conviction is sure to be the result of trial for working on Sunday. I suppose we may be allowed to go on one another's bond for our appearance at court.

The first extract told its own story. The two together tell their story. What is the story which they tell? Is it a story of the enforcement of just laws, in harmony with the injunction, "Love thy neighbor as thyself"? Is it a story of neighborly loving kindness. Does it emphasize the boast that here, in this land of the free, equal and exact justice is meted out to all? Or does it mark as with the thunder clap of approaching doom,—that all our boast has become a mockery? Justice hides her face in shame. Equality before the law is at an end. Persecution reigns. Children are called before grand juries to criminate their parents as to their non-observance of a religious doctrine. Old age is threatened with the shame of public trial and the danger to life and health in confinement to the county jail, or labor in the chain-gang on public roads. Neighborhood inquisitors insinuate that there is no reason why women also should not suffer equal penalties for their loyalty to conscience and their courage to protest.

It would be no wonder if such things as these should cause the heart to grow weak and language to fail. But this must not be; those who, in truth, love God and neighbor and native land, must speak, and that immediately, with heart of courage and no uncertain voice. W. H. M.
