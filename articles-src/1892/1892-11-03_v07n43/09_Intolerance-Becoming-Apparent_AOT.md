In every day becoming more apparent that there exists in this country in the hearts of men, an intolerance which few supposed could co-exist with the commission and the general enlightenment of our Republic. The surprise at this intolerance is all the more increased when the apologies of its defenders are examined, as we trust the following documents will prove.

The following has resulted from a document sent out by the National Religious Liberty Association to Seventh-day Adventist farmers in Henry County, Tenn., were imprisoned for forty-five days, and afterwards worked in the chain-gang in company with common criminals (3) of performing common labor on their own premises on Sunday after having observed the preceding day as the Sabbath, serving the previous day as the Sabbath.

Cincinnati, Ohio, Oct. 1, 1892.

MR. A. J. BALTZORE.

"Dear Sir: The observance of Sunday as a day of rest is required by our civilization.

"No one can not keep what every person should be punished, or he should go to prison.

"The observance of Sunday as a day of rest from ordinary labor, does not establish the supremacy of religion and is healthy recreation, and has nothing to do as a civil institution, with the worship of God. Any one is privileged to worship God in his own way on Sunday or on any other day of the week, or every day in the week.

"The observance of the law as to one day as a day of rest from the performance of ordinary labor is not an abridgment of religious liberty and that any person who will not keep the Christian Sabbath for self-denial to keep Sunday, but that a Sunday-keeper will have a positive advantage. The Sunday-keepers evidently do not want any of the blessings promised to those who are persecuted for righteousness sake; they want no cross-bearing with their religion, the self-denial they demand to be confined to the minimum and be limited in fact to abstaining from those humble things which are enforced by the more moralists as well as by the Christian.

The Sunday people are, however, determined that there shall be persecution, and that somebody shall get the blessing of those who are persecuted for righteousness sake. The crosses shall be borne but that they shall be heavy enough to be felt; and so they insist upon Sunday laws and then enforce those laws, as they are doing in Tennessee and as they threaten to do elsewhere, upon those who conscientiously dissent from the prevailing religion; and thus Christian Churches are persecuted by other Christians, for institutions, and principles.

A. O. TAIT.
