On the first day of last February, the *Most* and the rest of this, published the Detroit *Journal's* report from Chicago:

THE DETROIT JOURNAL'S REPORT.

In an address before the convention at the offices of the United Society, known as the Reform Bureau, held in the city of Chicago, on the 11th of February, several of the active workers expressed the opinion that Sunday lovers to be proposed and enforced the same which have been adopted in the State of Illinois, they were heartily in sympathy with the move in favor of Sunday closing of the Fair, though they were not united in their methods. They now, however, will unite with them in making a united fight against any Sunday opening.

Now the major purpose denounces the statement as a lie, and has devoted considerable space in the effort to disprove it, in order to know the truth of this matter, the secretary of the National Reform Bureau, a letter to the secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association, of course asking him to ascertain if possible, the real position of the saloon-keepers of that city in relation to the Sunday closing, and to communicate to the result of investigation.

C. P. BOLLMAN.

*Detroit, Oct. 14, 1892.*

The enclosed reply is herewith given:—

"In reply yours of the 5th inst. I would say that the saloon-keepers of this city are not in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, in this, I think, undoubtedly true that many of the saloon-keepers have been solicited to sign a petition for the closing of the Fair. Some of them have been opposing congregational action closing the Fair on Sunday. As near as I can learn some of the saloon-keepers have signed petitions having different signatures from saloon keepers, but they did not represent the sentiment of the majority. In many cases the men who signed were ignorant of the purpose of their saloons, and in many cases were told they were signing a petition for the opening of the Fair on Sunday. I have talked with many saloon-keepers in this city who signed several times that they were in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, and all acknowledge they were misrepresented, and that they had been told that they were signing a petition for the opening of the Fair. I sent out several circulars to the leading saloon-keepers in the city, and found that more, and that he found that some of the men who were reported as having signed, after it was explained that the principles involved were seen to be the same as those that they were opposed to, repudiated the petition."

It thus appears that the saloon-keepers like the church-members are divided upon the question of Sunday closing of the great Exposition. Doubtless there are other matters which may affect the closing. But we of the churches have been unable to close in favor of permission as you have only to point out to them what a petitioner of all parties of perception or even close them there is no objection to my publishing your letter.
