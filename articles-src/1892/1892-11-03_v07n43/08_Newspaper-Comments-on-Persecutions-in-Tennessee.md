Newspaper Comments on Persecutions in Tennessee.

REFERRING to the recent trials and imprisonments of members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Tennessee for working on Sunday, the Baltimore Sun, under the head, "Are There Blue Laws in Tennessee?" says:—

A story comes from Tennessee which recalls the old times in Massachusetts when people had their ears cut off, and were branded with hot irons, to promote the cause of religion. . . . To put the brand of a felon upon good citizens merely for obeying their consciences by observing the Sabbath of the Old Testament and engaging in an occupation in a remote field on Sunday, seems to bring back the old days of witch-burning and branding for heresy.

The Des Moines weekly News, of October 4, comments upon the same as follows:—

A shameful outrage was recently committed at Paris, Henry County, Tenn., in the trial and punishment of four Seventh-day Adventists for performing ordinary farm labor on Sunday, after having observed the seventh day as the Sabbath. After lying in jail over six weeks, three of these Christian men were, on Monday, July 18, marched through the streets in company with some criminals, and put to work shoveling on the common highway. All three were men of families, one fifty-five and another sixty-two years of age, and all are vouched for as good citizens. Tennessee ought to make haste to make such outrages legally impossible.

The New York Independent of October 6, thus expresses itself:—

We have again and again, during the last few years, had occasion to express our profound indignation at the administration of Tennessee law as applied to some country farmers belonging to the Seventh-day Adventist body, who, after having faithfully kept the Sabbath on the seventh day of the week, worked in their field on the first day of the week. This prosecution has been renewed, and three men of families, one fifty-five and another sixty-two years of age, were convicted, and have, during the summer and autumn, been working out their fine, being set to work with criminals at shoveling on the common highway. They refused to pay their fine, declaring that it was unjust, and that they were liable to be arrested again as soon as they were released. We have said before, and we say again, that this is bad law, bad morals and bad religion.

The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times, of October 9, prints the article in the Baltimore Sun from which we have above quoted, styling it "a scathing arraignment of the authorities in our West Tennessee counties, for persecuting good citizens of those communities for working in their fields on Sunday." Continuing, the editor of the Times says:—

The citizens in question are Seventh-day Adventists, a church that observes Saturday as its Sabbath, and, when able to do so quietly and so as not to disturb their Sunday keeping neighbors, work on that day at their usual vocations. The men who were arrested, fined and imprisoned in the cases noticed by the Sun, were found to have worked in fields remote from the highway on the first day of the week. The State's Attorney, who prosecuted them told the jury the defendants were good, orderly, thrifty citizens; that their records for morality were above reproach; that they had been guilty of no offense save the violation of a mouldy statute, which clearly meddles with citizens' religious convictions and practices; that they had only labored when they thought it their duty to labor, but that they had nevertheless violated the law; and on this admission of theirs he demanded their punishment. They were, as we have said, fined and flung into a dirty jail, the detention station of vile offenders, where they served out their sentence. One amiable old man, an Adventist, a farmer named King, for a like "offense," was fined, jailed, pursued and worried by the pious attorneys and immaculate courts of West Tennessee until he sickened and died; and his persecutors testified, with one voice, that Mr. King was a good man, and in all, save his working on Sunday, a law-abiding citizen of the most scrupulous kind. Ought not this absurd, injurious, disgraceful law to be repealed! We think it ought.

The Seventh-day Adventist is a considerable and growing religious denomination over the country. It has many intelligent and progressive adherents in this State, Hon. W. P. Tolley being of the number. It has built, and for many years conducted, a great school at Battle Creek, Mich., and owns and conducts at the same place one of the most successful sanitariums in the country, and one of the largest. It has two similar institutions in northwestern States. Its directing body desires to build institutions of this kind in the South. One of its prominent ministers and other members of the church, have hoped they might be justified in recommending to the church the founding of a college and sanitarium on Lookout Mountain, near this city; but the miserable persecution of their brethren in West Tennessee has given them pause. The State will probably lose this large investment, since its courts, in one grand division, and prosecuting officers, have displayed toward their fellow-citizens of Adventist faith the spirit that brought into being and kept alive the Spanish Inquisition.

We allow the railroads to haul tens of thousands of tons over the State on Sundays every year. Passenger trains run regularly on Sunday, so do our local trains of transport, and the latter do their best and most profitable day's work on Sunday. Hacks are busy on the first day of the week in all the towns. Our wives or servants do rather more cooking on that day than on any other. The newspapers find it the most profitable day of publication. All these are secular affairs; and yet we permit a lot of bigots to haul up and punish inoffensive Christians, because they feel they can not afford to be idle two days, and their conscience demands that they devote the seventh day to the worship of God.

Repeal this miserable relic of the Blue Laws, that we inherited from North Carolina, on whom it was imposed by bigots of the last century.

The Chicago Herald of Oct. 15, says:—

It seems as if a deep laid scheme were entered into to crush the Adventists.
