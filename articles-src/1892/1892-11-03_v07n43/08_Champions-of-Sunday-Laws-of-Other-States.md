IF PARTIES there is no class of citizens depending more than Sunday-law-keepers do, calling upon the importance of obeying the laws by which trade people close their work on Sunday that the saloons shall close. Several organizations that have sprung into existence in Chicago having, as they say, the purpose of enforcing all the laws, are a favorite arrangement with these people, as well as the Christian people who believe the observance is subservience of good citizenship. Sunday laws in most of our States, to be sure, have been trampled upon with impunity. They insist that the people must be compelled to obey the laws, and rest on Sunday. Just previously not exceeding five years of time had passed.

Now we submit the question in all candor, whether it is not just as wicked to trample upon the good law of Illinois against boycott, as it is to obliterate the Sunday statute, or will these Chicago moralists have but one side to their morality? If in favor of the Sunday law insist upon its enforcement, and so say we of every other law of the State if need be, just so good a law as the law for the observance of Sunday. And we would confidently hold the matter up before all the people that such methods of procedure as anything else but Christian. No one should allow himself to be assumed into wickedness and folly.
