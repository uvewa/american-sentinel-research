Religious Legislation.

[The St. Paul Daily News has expressed its editorial views upon the effort to secure, in the coming session of Congress, a reversal of the action of the last session in the passage of the Sunday closing proviso attached to World's Fair appropriations. The editorial expression of the News is republished below.]

CONGRESS has been rather freely criticized for its action in attaching to the World's Fair grant, a proviso that the Fair must not be open on Sunday, and a movement has been started to secure the abrogation of this provision at the December session. It is felt, and not without considerable reason, that the recent action of Congress is inconsistent with the principles of individual liberty of conscience, upon which our Government was founded, and may be looked upon as a direct movement in favor of the union of Church and State. Prompted by this sentiment, the promoters of the new movement call on the people to hold meetings all over the country, and pass resolutions requesting and instructing their representatives in Congress to vote for the repeal of the Sunday closing condition in the World's Fair appropriation.

This appeal will scarcely be without some effect, and many meetings of the kind desired will doubtless be held as soon as the presidential election excitement is over, when there will yet be time left to take action on the other matter. The condition imposed by Congress appears on its face to be in direct violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that Congress shall pass no laws respecting the establishment of any religion or prohibiting the exercise of any religion. Judge Storey, one of the ablest judges, declared that the object of the framers of the Constitution was not alone to prevent the establishment of a national religion, but also to prevent any religious legislation. Now a minority of the population of the country come forward and say they want legislation and Congress yields to them, utterly ignoring the vast majority who have protested against any such interference with their constitutional rights.
