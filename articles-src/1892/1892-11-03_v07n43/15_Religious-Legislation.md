The *St. Paul Daily News* has expressed its editorial views upon the Sunday-closing question of the World's Fair at some length. The result in the passage of the Sunday law of rest, the editorial concludes in the following:—

Congress has been rather rudely and somewhat unnecessarily reminded of late of the World's Fair grant, a provision that the Fair must not be open on Sunday, or of convention has been passed at this particular legislature at the same time the abrogation of this provision and this December consideration.

The objection is not one of vital importance, for probably the question will be of considerable remark, that the most recent act of religious legislation in Tennessee is evidence of individual liberty and freedom, and may be looked upon as a direct violation of a sacred rule of the union of Church and State. Prompted by this movement call on the people to hold meetings.
