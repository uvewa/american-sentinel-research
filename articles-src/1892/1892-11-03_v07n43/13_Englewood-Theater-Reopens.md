The Marlowe Theater, at Englewood, the Chicago suburb, where the Sunday closing excitement raged so hotly some time ago, is again open on Sunday evenings, and unmolested. The managers of the theater give as their reason for opening Sunday nights, that the church people did not live up to their agreement to patronize the theater six nights in the week, and they were, therefore, not bound to keep their part of the contract to close Sunday nights. Now, perhaps, the Sunday closing faction of Englewood will deny that this agreement and alliance was ever made.
