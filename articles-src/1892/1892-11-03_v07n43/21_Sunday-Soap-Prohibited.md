A LADY writing to the Cincinnati Post thus relates her experience on arriving in that city by rail on Sunday:—

After a long, dusty day's travel, I entered the toilet room of the Grand Central Depot, in Cincinnati, thinking with relief of the fresh water, towel and soap, which would make my skin white again and my relatives able to recognize me. Wearily, I put down my satchel and doffed hat, gloves and waist, preparing for presto change! No soap, no towel was there to be seen. I immediately concluded that the lateness of the hour was the cause for the soap's exhaustion, and the waiting woman had probably forgotten to replace the towel. Hurriedly, I put on my waist, and found the waiting woman seated outside the ladies' parlor (it was also closed), and with extended hand said, "Please let me have some soap and a towel!" A slow shake of her head and a half grunt, "Not on Sunday," was the response to my need. Are people not expected to be clean on God's day? Traveling is not always avoidable on Sunday, especially when making long trips. If religious extremists are to run the toilet and waiting rooms of a depot, the corporation had better begin at the beginning and change some vital points in these plans. If it is from a moral standpoint, why are so many excursions run on Sunday?

This is only another instance of a nonsensical Sunday regulation, and another example of straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel. The Sunday excursions are all right, but Sunday soap and towels—horrors!
