PERTINENT to this subject is the following notice which the Pittsburg Dispatch of October 10, makes of a sermon delivered on the previous day in that city:—

Rev. J. H. Patterson supplied the pulpit of the First Presbyterian Church yesterday. Taking, "Be thou faithful unto death," as his text, he delivered an eloquent plea for Christian steadfastness and faithfulness to duty. Illustrating his theme with the example of constancy, he related how, when the Roman emperor came to the throne he issued an edict that the subjects in his employ should either resign their positions or renounce the Christian religion. The larger part resigned. The next day he reappointed all those who had done so to their old positions and banished those who had disclaimed their faith in the hope of winning his favor. He went on to state that Christians are to be faithful to their vows and that it is a Christian's highest privilege to be persecuted. This was the Christian's reward, and was the distinguishing feature of Christianity. No other religion was to be compared with it. God's light could illumine a mountain as easily as a mole hill.

IT is not easy to see how Mr. Patterson could reconcile his sermon with the demand of the churches for Sunday laws. One ground on which such laws are demanded is that those who desire to keep Sunday may be enabled to do so without loss of position or business. In other words, the State is asked to so arrange things that not only will it require no self-denial to keep Sunday, but that the Sunday-keeper will have a positive advantage. The Sunday-keepers evidently do not want any of the blessings promised to those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake; they want no cross-bearing with their religion; the self-denial must be reduced to the minimum and be limited in fact to abstaining from those hurtful things which are eschewed by the mere moralist as well as by the Christian.

THE Sunday people are, however, determined that there shall be persecutions, and that somebody shall get the blessing for enduring them; and not only that crosses shall be borne but that they shall be heavy enough to be felt; and so they insist upon Sunday laws and then enforce those laws, as they are doing in Tennessee, and as they threaten to do elsewhere, upon those who conscientiously dissent from the prevailing religion; and thus Christians are persecuted by other Christians, so-called.
