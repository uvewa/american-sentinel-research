The Leader, of Altus, Texas, referring to the Sunday laws of Tennessee under which the late prosecution of Seventh-day Adventists has been held, says:—

The same law encumbers the statute books of nearly every State in the Union, while the Constitution of each guarantees to every man the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Such prosecutions can only be classed as persecutions.

And they are persecutions, pure and simple—nothing more, nothing less.
