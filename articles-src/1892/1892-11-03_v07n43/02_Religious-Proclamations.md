An interesting question arose recently, in this State, in regard to the President's Proclamation declaring October 21st a holiday. The question is this: The President lately issued no proclamations; and the question also arose, "Does the President's Proclamation make the 21st of October a legal holiday?" We answer, No. The law of New York makes New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Christmas, and every general election day, public holidays; any other day appointed by the president, by the governor of the State, or by the legislature of the State as a day of thanksgiving or fasting and prayer. The question does not end in the lawyer's mind.

The view of the matter generally taken is this: No proclamation of the United States has approved or recommended that Friday, October 21, 1892, be observed as a holiday by the people abstaining from their daily vocations and devote themselves to a set of exercises. Every religious society has a right to appoint its own time, place, and manner of worship. No further recommended that the United States government gratitude to Divine Providence for the divine care. In view of his position, surely it is befitting the president of this great Nation to set aside this day especially for religious observance. But we have called the attention of our readers to the provision of the New York statute as being one of special significance. The question arises, How can an act of legislation or an act of the executive make October 21, 1892, a legal holiday in the State of New York?

How can a proclamation of the President of the State of New York should make any proclamation a legal holiday any more than it would be for the President of France or England to do so. The law does make any day a legal holiday that the State makes not any day set apart by the President that day a legal holiday.

But note, a law of this State sets apart for the country for the President and the governor to name a day which will be observed as an annual thanksgiving day that very few people observe as a day of religious exercises, and never stop to inquire as to the propriety of a civil ruler setting apart a day for religious purposes. But the way in which this has been put in the foregoing besides requesting and instructing their employees in Congress to vote for the repeal of the Sunday closing condition in the World's Fair appropriation. This appeal will scarcely be without some effect, and many meetings of the kind destined will doubtless be held as soon as this presidential election excitement is over, when there will yet be time left to take action before the matter. The encroachment imposed by Congress appears on the face to be a direct violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of any religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Justice Storey, one of the ablest judges, declared that the object of the framers of the Constitution was not alone to prevent the establishment of a national religion, but also to prevent any religious legislation. Now a minority of the population of the country comes forward and say they want legislation, and Congress yields to them, utterly ignoring the vast majority who have appealed against any such interference with their constitutional rights.

Under the rule laid down by Chief Justice Waite, namely, that to ascertain the meaning of the First Amendment to the Constitution, we must go to "the history of the times in the midst of which" it was framed, and then notice that the amendment Jefferson said it that directly "Congress shall have no authority over religious exercises."

But it is only proposed that I should recommend. It is proposed that I should indirectly assume to the United States the authority of recommending religious exercises. What does the Thanksgiving recommendation amount to? It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is a "recommendation of the direct and the principal form, a power, a dangerous and obnoxious form." Of all that and furthermore, of all the recommendations of State and federal Executive powers that have since been made of any description. And thus the change in the nature of the penalty and the recommendation of Jefferson in time.

Concerning the effect of such proclamation on religion, itself, Jefferson said:—

I do not believe it is for the interest of religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its discipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the General Government should be invested with the power of effecting any uniformity of time or manner among them. Fasting and prayer are religious exercises. The enjoining them, an act of discipline. Every religious society has a right to determine for itself the time for these exercises and the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.

Jefferson and Madison were the two first mainly instrumental in inserting the principle of the First Amendment into the government of Virginia. That was the free and perpetual protection of religion; whatsoever therefore must be left alone. In the Virginia legislation, July 10, 1832, said:—

If it be not easy to define the exact limit up to the executive in the proclamation of fasts and thanksgiving.

If it be urged that Madison himself issued a proclamation, I will be satisfied to answer that in this same letter to Livingston; and precisely, and directly upon this subject, he said:—

Whilst I was honored with the executive trust, I found it necessary on more than one occasion to follow the example of my predecessors.

And that is to say, Madison himself had given justification for his action. But we now have President Harrison's proclamation. This must now come, especially in the light of the Supreme Court decision of February 29, 1892, to be regarded as law. But this really illustrates the danger in such an official regulation, presents the matter in a little different light. In this opinion it is said, and correctly so too, that the day was "set apart by the President of the United States as a day of religious observance." This leads to the inquiry, Has the right has the President, or any other civil officer, to set apart a day for religious purposes?

The framers of the Constitution certainly had no thought of conferring upon the President the power to set apart days for religious purposes. President Jefferson, who certainly understood the real meaning of the document he was so largely instrumental in framing, and who, like President Miller, near the close of his second term, for his reasons then as now.

I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from with such religious institutions their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.

It is true that the churches are at the head of all this, and that Congress did it at this dictation and under the threats of the churches. It is true that the churches have put this false interpretation upon the commandment, and this adds nothing of force upon Congress. This is all true, but that does not relieve Congress from the guilt of perverting the law of the Most High, of forcing into that law a meaning which does not even belong there, and of putting itself in the place of the supreme authority in the interpretation of his laws. Congress had no business to engage in any such proceeding upon any consideration. Judge Cooley—"Constitutional Limitations."
