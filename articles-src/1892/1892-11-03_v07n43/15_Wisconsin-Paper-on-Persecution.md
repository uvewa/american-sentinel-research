The Centralia Enterprise, of Centralia, Wis., commenting, editorially, upon the imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, says:—

Wendell Phillips used to say that persecution is but a confession of lack of faith in one's own convictions. It really seems that way, when one sees a brutal majority enforce laws which, on their very face, violate the plainest dictates of right and reason.

It is true that religious laws do violate the plainest dictates of right and reason. The Enterprise can see this to be a fact. Who can tell what blinds the mental vision of Sunday-law advocates and hardens their hearts, that they should be willing to do these things which are so clearly unjust and cruel!
