The *Murfreesboro Free Patriot*, published at Murfreesboro, Tenn., is disturbed by the last number of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and says:—

THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, a continually crying organ of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is trying to create a religious excitement over what it calls the arrests in the passage of the Sunday law of rest, is religious legislation; because those laws are old and have been in existence for some hundred years.

Let us see. The law forbidding murder and larceny and forgery are old also; and the sentiment and the religious opinion of the people. But the law forbidding working on Sunday has no foundation except in a religious custom. Notwithstanding arising and founded on the Sabbath, and the authority of the Fourth Commandment. The law punishing larceny is established in the eighth commandment.

We trust that no unbeliever will be so unkind as to believe the *Free Patriot*, and imagine that Christianity is to be maintained by law. We trust the threats contained in the first paragraph of the article quoted are not directed against us Christianity, but to the lack of it. For do Christians really find it necessary this day to legislate to enforce religious observances? If so, what becomes of their boast of Christianity to justify it. It is, however, as the paper says that the laws forbidding Sunday work "have been in existence for some hundred years, and have been the subject of considerable remark, that the most recent act of religious legislation in Tennessee is evidence of individual liberty and freedom, and may be looked upon as a direct violation of a sacred rule of the union of Church and State. Prompted by this movement, the National Religious Liberty Association sends out its circulars to the people to hold meetings.

Let us see. The laws forbidding murder and larceny and forgery are old, also; but are they based upon a religious custom? Is there an intelligent person in all the land who does not know that the Sunday laws are purely religious? And are they not founded on the Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment? The law punishing larceny is established upon the eighth commandment.

We trust that no unbeliever will be so unkind as to believe the *Free Patriot*, and imagine that Christianity is to be maintained by law.
