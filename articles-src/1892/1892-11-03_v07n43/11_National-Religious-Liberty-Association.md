A COMPLAINT against street paving, in the city of Elrich, for working on Sunday in the neighborhood of a church has resulted from an original crusade against all Sunday labor. The opportunity has been taken, too, in one place, to seize upon the chance of the commandment which says "the seventh day is the Sabbath;" and also that no money might come from

According to its Lex and Leader, the Mayor of Oakland, Iowa, has just issued the following proclamation:

"You are hereby requested to keep your public places of business closed on Sunday, and before and after the pleasures of this nation, or before the penalties of the law are brought to bear upon you."

The Matthews Theater, at Englewood, the Chicago suburb, had to put some of the laws of our city upon its notice some time ago, is again open on Sunday for amusement and entertainment, in spite of law and order. And it is announced that other places of theatre give as their reason for opening Sunday night, the churches and the schools are doing just as bad in this respect, the churches and the schools are trying to get agreements to sell theatre tickets at their stands and more themselves are booking to keep part of the contract to close Sunday nights. Now, perhaps the Sunday closing fanciers of Englewood will agree that they had this agreement as an alliance were on an equal footing.

The same law the amusement the statute books is invoked to close up the saloons and for the execution of each gentleman to every room the rights of a man.

The *Leader*, of Alma, Texas, referring to the Sunday law of Tennessee under which the class of Seventh-day Adventists are now being persecuted, says adding more, nothing else.

The *Cristobal* *Enterprise*, of Columbus, Wis., in speaking of the persecution of the class of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee, says:—

The persecution of these people is a disgrace and a confession of lack of faith in one's own conviction. The moral sense and judgment of every upright, decent person must rebel against it. Sunday blue laws violate the plainest dictates of right and reason. The champions

of civil order and destructive of the most obvious natural human rights. We learn from Gen. 12: 19, that over nineteen hundred years before Christ and almost five hundred years before the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, the people of Egypt recognized the right of Amos Amelia B. Edwards, and George L. Edwards, and not only hold Egyptians, the ancient Egyptians had a moral code little removed from our own. This does not detract from our belief in the law of God as revealed in the Scriptures; it only shows that God implanted the sense of right and wrong in man such a sense of justice as would have entitled him to all the rights and privileges enjoyable, to a certain extent, even under the code of heathenism. Under this law no thief or murderer could escape.

That eminent moral philosopher and Christian, John Locke, nevertheless, thus sets forth its principles in defending the perpetuity of the marriage relation.

The end of separation between male and female being not barely procreation, but the continuation of the species, the conjunction betwixt man and wife ought to last, even after procreation, so long as is necessary for the nourishment of the young ones, who are to be sustained by those that got them, till they are able to shift and provide for themselves. This rule, which is not salutes the wisdom of the great Creator, is well followed by all inferior creatures, and to lay up for the future, as well as to supply provisions for the present offspring. All the obligations for maintenance and education of their offspring, are the natural obligations of male and female amongst other creatures.

These reflections, familiar to marriages, by Locke, are equally true of all natural obligations between men individual, and the rules that should govern them may readily be deduced from the very nature of the relations themselves. We are not dependent upon the revealed knowledge of the mutual obligations resting upon husband and wife. The same Creator who has written the laws that should govern human relationships in the book of nature as well as in the witness of men implied to the "independent" government in the world. "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The principles of God's moral law are not self-evident. It is not for us to point out the precise point and the occasion at which they came when the truth of this principle to his notice. The course was by the divine Spirit, but it is true that man can not "by searching find out God." The moral law of God as revealed in nature, and not upon the law revealed in holy writ, that we have to depend for our knowledge of God and his will concerning us and the administration of His written law. That is not the same thing as establishing a civil code: 'it is a moral law; and God as a moral governor enforces it as such.' He himself or else abdicate his throne. If it were the province of the State to interpret and administer the law of God, the subject of that law would be God. What does God require? but, What does the State require? not, What does the law of God say? but, What does the law of the State require? Again, much thought and inquiry would be diverted from God to his vicegerent, the government. Men would at least think that they knew the will of the State, caring little about the will of God. We have no doubt, but the State being the divinely ordained interpreter and administrator of the divine law.
