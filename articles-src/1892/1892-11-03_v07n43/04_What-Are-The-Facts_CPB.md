**What Are The Facts?**

On the first day of last February, the Mail and Express of this city, published the following dispatch from Chicago:—

**THE INFIDELS' SCHEME FAILS.**

**SALOON-KEEPERS IN CHICAGO FAVOR CLOSING THE WORLD'S FAIR ON SUNDAY.**

CHICAGO, Ill., Feb. 1. The efforts on the part of the officers of the Infidel Society, known as the American Secular Union, to enlist the aid of saloon-keepers in the proposed mass-meeting to oppose the Sunday closing of the World's Fair have failed. Nine-tenths of the saloon men said they were heartily in sympathy with the movement to close the Fair on Sunday. Nearly all of the Turner Societies and labor organizations in town, however, will unite with them in making a plea for a mass-meeting to be held at Central Music Hall two weeks hence.

Now the same paper denounces the statement as a lie, and has devoted considerable space to "nailing the lie." In order to know the truth of this matter, one of the editors of this paper addressed a letter to the secretary of the National Religious Liberty Association in Chicago, asking him to ascertain if possible, the real position of the saloon-keepers of that city upon the question of Sunday closing, and to communicate to us the result of his investigation. His reply is as follows:—

Chicago, Ill., Oct. 19, 1892.

C. P. BOLLMAN.

43 Bond Street, New York.

Dear Sir: Your letter asking in regard to the statement that the saloon-keepers of this city are opposed to an open Sunday Fair has been received. It is, I think, undoubtedly true that many of the saloon-keepers are opposed to Sunday opening of the Fair. When we were securing our petitions here opposing congressional action closing the Fair on Sunday, we found this to be the case. None of our regular workers made a business of soliciting signatures from saloon-keepers, but they did ask some whom they found standing at the doors of their saloons, and in many cases were told that they did not care to sign a petition that would interfere with the prosperity of their business. A gentleman in this city who secured several thousand names to the petition, told me that he worked among saloon-keepers as well as among other business men, and that he found that some utterly refused to sign the petition; others signed it after it was explained that the principles involved were of more value than their temporary gain from a closed Fair would be; and others signed willingly.

Truly yours,

A. F. BALLENGER.

It thus appears that saloon-keepers like church-members are divided upon the question of Sunday closing of the great Fair. It seems very likely that the proprietors of those saloons adjacent to the Fair grounds would like an open Fair, trusting to be benefited by the increased Sunday traffic that might reasonably be expected to come to them. Those in other parts of the city doubtless feel that they would do a better business on Sunday if the Fair were closed. This is the reasonable view of the matter, and clearly indicates that a large majority of the Chicago saloon-keepers are not in favor of keeping the great Fair open on Sunday; for comparatively few of them could hope to be benefited by anything that would regularly attract people to one particular part of the city.

This conclusion corresponds also with statements made by others. In a letter to the Boston Investigator, of October 19, Mrs. M. A. Freeman, Corresponding Secretary of the American Secular Union, says:—

When the American Secular Union mass-meeting was held last winter, the saloons were visited by members of the board. Not a saloon-keeper would contribute toward the effort to secure an open Fair on Sunday. Every one declared in favor of Sunday closing. They wouldn't endorse a movement, they said, that was so plainly opposed to their own interests.

The conclusion seems irresistible that in this matter of Sunday closing a large majority of the saloon-keepers of Chicago, and the Sunday preachers are of the same mind—they expect to be mutually benefited by excluding people from Jackson Park one day in the week. C. P. B.
