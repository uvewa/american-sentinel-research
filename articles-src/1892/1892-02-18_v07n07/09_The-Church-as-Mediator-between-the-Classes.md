The Medieval Church dreamed of being a universal peacemaker, when the Pope would settle in his court questions between kings or nations. The churches of to-day are haunted by the same dream. Each little flock hopes to inherit the kingdom, and its ministers aspire to settle questions between labor and capital. Things in dreams are not as they seem, but dreams now as in old times have their interpretations, and are sometimes guides to truth. The churches may, perhaps, help to solve the labor problems, but not by putting up their ministers to hear evidence and to give judgment. Their part is rather to teach than to judge, and to give than to take evidence.

The public is the only potentate who can fill the place at which the Pope grasped, and from its opinion there is no appeal. It is for the churches so to inspire the public that its judgment will be sound, and then to offer the evidence on which it may exercise that judgment.

The chief duty of the churches to the world is to set forward an ideal of life, and to draw out admiration for noble, generous and honest conduct, and to show the penalties which surely follow all forms of lying and selfishness. This duty has special applications according as different subjects arise for the judgment of the public.

The labor problems, the rate of wages, the length of the working day, the rights of trades unions, the treatment of the unskilled, the weak, and the old, press for settlement. A man once came to Christ saying, "Command my brother that he divide the inheritance with me." If labor and capital come to the churches urging that they command a different division of profits, the answer of the churches must be the answer of Christ: "Who made me a judge or a divider over you? Beware of covetousness." It is covetousness on both sides which hinders the solution of the labor problems, and the special duty of the churches at the present juncture is to convince both capitalists and laborers of the covetousness which, like the proverbial mote in the eye, prevents fair judgment of others. David could not believe that he was the man who had taken a poor neighbor's one ewe lamb, and there are thousands of upright capitalists who would not believe that they are spoilers, and thousands of well-disposed laborers whom covetousness has so blinded that they say of every capitalist, as Satan said of Job, "Doth he serve God for naught?"

The public whose opinion has ultimately to settle the labor problems is made up of capitalists and laborers. To the public, therefore, the churches must repeat Christ's message. Their ministers must show the failure of covetousness, the havoc it works in character, the misery, the poverty it brings in its train. But, chiefly, they must hold up for admiration the human life, which makes every one who is human turn from greed as from something foreign to his humanity.

The churches have done much, but they have not educated public opinion in this direction. They have rather been ambitious, sometimes for the triumph of the doctrine they represent, sometimes for their ministers. They have seemed to the people to be anxious only to make proselytes, or to get the reputation of being peacemakers or arbitrators, "advertising parsons or peripatetic philanthropists," which are the titles their ministers have earned.

The churches have not educated public opinion to beware of covetousness or to understand the facts of life. They have often rather themselves illustrated the force of covetousness. They have introduced class into places of worship, and have made charity a barrier and not a bond. They still, however, hold the field as educators, and with them it largely rests to solve the labor problems. They are still supreme in many departments of life, and each church can show a record of work which must command attention. They are still the outward expression of the small voice which speaks in every man, and they still bear in them the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The churches (or as I would rather say, the Church) are, therefore, powerful, and when they make their buildings meeting-houses of rich and poor, their highest services a communion, and their chief doctrine the preaching of Christ, they may so educate public opinion as to forever settle on a stronger foundation than on a decision of an arbitrator, or even on a law, the rate of wages and the hours of labor.
