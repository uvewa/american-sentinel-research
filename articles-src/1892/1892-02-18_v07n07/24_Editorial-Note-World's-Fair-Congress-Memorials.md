THE Washington correspondent of the Sioux City Journal chronicles the presentation in the House, of a memorial against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, by Representative Hayes of Iowa, and reports that it is the second document of the kind protesting against Sunday closing presented in Congress this session, while every member of both houses has probably offered from one to twenty memorials asking that the gates of the Fair be closed on Sunday. Congress has no power to open or close the World's Fair on Sunday, and no doubt the majority of those who are opposed to legislative interference in religious matters know this. If Congress should attempt to assume any such authority insulted Christian voters everywhere would make their protest known against any such usurpation of authority.
