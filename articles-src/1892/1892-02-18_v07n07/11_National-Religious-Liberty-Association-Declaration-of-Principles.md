## RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION

### DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion of the Bible as taught by Jesus Christ and his apostles; but we hold as a fundamental right that *the right of every citizen to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, or not to worship at all, is an inherent right, with which civil government has nothing to do.*

*We believe that legislation on the subject of religion is a perversion of the rights of the citizen.*

No. 43 Bond St., New York City.
