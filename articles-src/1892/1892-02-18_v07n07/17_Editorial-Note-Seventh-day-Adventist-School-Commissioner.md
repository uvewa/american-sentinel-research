THE daily papers contain a dispatch in regard to a Seventh-day Adventist of Houston County, Ga., who has resigned his position as school commissioner, rather than violate the Sabbath. He shows in this that he does not need a civil law to compel everybody to rest on the day he wants to keep, in order that he may observe it himself. Would not the same rule hold good in regard to those who really desire to keep Sunday? If a man has a conscience in the matter, he will find a way to keep the day, and a situation or job of work will not long stand in the way.
