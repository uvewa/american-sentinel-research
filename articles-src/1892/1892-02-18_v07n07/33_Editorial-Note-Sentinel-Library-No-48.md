The latest number of the Sentinel Library which has come to our table is No. 48. "Religious Toleration vs. Religious Rights." This tract is a brief but forcible presentation of the fact that "toleration implies the power of jurisdiction" and is therefore opposed to rights. Everybody should read it. Price 1 cent.
