IN the New York Legislature, Senator Hunter has introduced a joint resolution urging the representatives of the State in Congress to use their influence with the World's Fair Commissioners to close the Fair on Sunday; and asking that they favor no measure in further aid of said enterprise, except it be coupled with a condition that the Fair be closed to visitors and suspended as an exposition on the Sabbath day.
