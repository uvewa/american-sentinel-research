At a recent State meeting of the Indiana division of the American Sabbath Union, among others the following resolutions were passed:—

> *Resolved,* That we view with alarm the growing tendency to eliminate from the first day of the week all that is sacred and to make it a day of common labor and amusement, and especially do we deprecate the secularizing of the day by members of the church.

> *Resolved,* That we earnestly recommend to all workingmen that they co-operate with all proper efforts to secure for themselves and their families, the Lord's day, as a day of freedom from unnecessary toil.

> *Resolved,* That Christian ministers and laymen should not be entangled with Sabbath-breaking corporations (such as railways, street-car companies, newspapers, etc.) by owning stock in the same, thus reaping a harvest from the Sunday toil of the laboring classes.

One of the strong points set forth by many of the leaders of the American Sabbath Union, is the necessity of securing a "civil Sabbath." It is hard to conceive just how anything that is a purely religious institution can, also, at the same time be quite as fully civil. But our Sunday-law friends tell us that we must have a "civil Sabbath" enforced by civil law. Now if they make a "civil Sunday" by law, will not that very act secularize the day? For are not civil things secular? Then why deplore the "secularizing" of the day when the very leaders of the movement are trying to secure a "civil" rest day, which could not be anything but secular?

But note the fact that it is the members of churches who are complained against as casting their influence toward secularizing the day. And again, the last resolution quoted charges even "Christian ministers," as well as laymen, with accepting profits from Sunday toil. Since the various auxiliaries of the American Sabbath Union, in so many of their meetings, find it necessary to speak and resolve against ministers and church members for failing to observe Sunday, it must be that they find much that they consider wrong in this respect. And where is the consistency of asking a civil law to compel Sunday observance, when those who profess to believe it do not keep it themselves? If the ministers and people who are thus laboring to secure the compulsory observance of Sunday, would only study their Bibles more closely they would find that law does not make men better. We may have the best laws that can be devised, and hope thereby to make men moral, but the power of Christ alone is able to give ability to the individual to conform to moral precepts; and laws looking toward the enforcing of morals, only furnish an opportunity for malicious men, under the guise of Christianity, to oppose their fellow-men who do not believe with them. The records of the centuries attest this fact, and there is no evading it. The State should make and enforce laws, compelling men to be civil, but when it comes to making laws for the observance of Sunday, or any other religious institution, Christians above all others, should be the very first to call a halt.
