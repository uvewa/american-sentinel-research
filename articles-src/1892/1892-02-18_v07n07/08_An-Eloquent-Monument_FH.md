The Mansion House of London, the official residence of the Lord Mayor, is one of the finest buildings in the city, and is known throughout the world. But that the magnificent structure is a shameful monument of a shameful period is known to but few, even of Londoners themselves. It also stands as an eloquent protest against the folly of giving religious men full control of civil affairs to the disqualification of all others whose religious tenets do not harmonize with theirs. In 1740 the Corporation of London passed a by-law inflicting a fine of four hundred pounds and twenty marks ($2,000) on every person declining to stand for the office of Sheriff after he had been nominated, and of six hundred pounds ($3,000) on every one refusing to serve after being elected, making the fine $5,000 in all. The reason of this by-law was evident. The Corporation consisted of members of the Church of England and they knew that all Dissenters would refuse to act on account of the Test Act which had been passed years before in the profligate time of Charles II. This iniquitous act was a masterpiece of National Reform principles and provided that all persons filing public offices of whatever kind should not only take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, but also should take the sacrament according to the usages of the Church of England. Of course no conscientious Dissenter could hold office under such conditions. Then these dear "Christians" who composed the Corporation of London, knowing this, proceeded to elect Dissenter after Dissenter to the office of Sheriff. All these unfortunate men had to do was to pay up the $5,000 fines, which were devoted to the erection of the said Mansion House.

This went on for six years until the fines amounted to £15,000 ($75,000). At length the courts of law were appealed to for protection, and after years of litigation the House of Lords gave judgment against the "Christian" Corporation. It was then that Lord Mansfield delivered one of those judicial decisions which live in history. In scathing terms he denounced the attempt of the Corporation to make two laws—one to prevent men from serving, the other to punish them for not serving. "If," said he, "they accept, punish them; if they refuse, punish them. If they say 'Yes,' punish them; if they say 'No,' punish them. My lords, this is a most exquisite dilemma, from which there is no escaping. It is a trap a man can not get out of. It is as bad a persecution as that of Procrustes: if they are too short, stretch them; if they are too long lop them!" "Persecution," he added, "is against natural religion, revealed religion, and sound policy."

This little incident is of interest to lovers of religious liberty as it shows the actual working of the National Reform idea when logically applied. It is what religious men have always done under such circumstances, and always will do.
