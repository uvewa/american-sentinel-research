The State does not know religion. It does not know dependence on God, obligation, responsibility, duty, love, or obedience to God. These all are personal cognitions and relations between personal beings. Denominations of men may, and often do, organize upon these, and frequently do, organize on them a basis and for their cultivation. The Church is such an organization. But such a society the State is not. It is based on cognitions and experiences entirely different and for entirely other purposes. Persons who do not have these cognitions and experiences, and who deny the possibility of having them, belong to the State, hence a religious character is impossible for a nation.—*Rev. Owen James.*
