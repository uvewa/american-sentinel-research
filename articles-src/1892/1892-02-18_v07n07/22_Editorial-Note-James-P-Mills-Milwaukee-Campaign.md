REV. James P. Mills, field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, is conducting a campaign for his Association in Milwaukee,—the Sentinel of that city has this in reference to the peroration of his first discourse.

> In conclusion the speaker said that the questions he had outlined were those that the Sabbath Union proposed to agitate to a settlement, until the real status of the Sabbath should be fixed. The agitation was not confined to the United States. Some twelve foreign countries were discussing it. Among them were France, Germany, Austria, Holland, and Hungary.

The extent of this agitation, its purpose, and its result are clearly pointed out in prophecy, and there is no more important subject presented to the attention of the world at the present time. It will not be found that the true solution of the Sabbath question lies in the enforcement of Sunday observance by law.
