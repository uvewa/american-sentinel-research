A London paper has this bit of Sunday history which is not without interest in these days of agitation for more strict observance of the day:—

> The old English Sunday in the north of England appears, from Mr. William Andrews' curious work on "Old Church Lore," to have been characterized by some strange practices. Sunday announcements of forth-coming auction sales and other equally secular matters were in some instances made by the parish clerk in the church-yard, or even in the church itself. It seems moreover that at Wigton, in Cumberland, during the reign of Charles II., a Sunday meat-market was held. Butchers put their carcasses of meat at the church door, and customers actually took the joints they had bought inside the building and hung them on the backs of the seats till service was finished. The clergyman was, we are told, so disturbed by this irreverent custom that he made a journey to London, on foot, and secured the change of market-day to Tuesday.

This sounds odd to modern ears, but when we remember that the Sabbath idea of Sunday is of comparatively recent origin, it is not at all strange that even pious people made meetings held upon that day, occasions of traffic.
