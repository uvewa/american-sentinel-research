The Chicago Times has the following:—

> A Port Townsend doctor of divinity, according to the Spokane Spokesman, recently convened his Sunday school half an hour earlier than usual so that it might adjourn in time for the Sunday baseball game. The good doctor has precedents for his course in the action of the fathers of the church, who adopted the customs of the heathen and their festal days, and made them the customs, and the holy days of the Church. If Port Townsend will play ball Sunday the doctor is determined that Sunday ball-playing shall be made a part of the church service.

"The doctor," remarks the Sabbath Recorder, "would have good precedent for using a portion, at least, of Sunday for secular labor, if he were disposed so to use it. The edict which made Sunday in any sense a holy day gave permission to country people to work in their fields; and a bishop of the church, which established the Sunday festival, dismissed his congregation from the Sunday service to their several occupations. We have seen, in our day, devout adherents of the same church go to mass on Sunday morning, and thence to their potato fields and wash-tubs. The conduct of the doctor above mentioned is entirely consistent with the whole history and tradition of the church which gave us the Sunday festival."
