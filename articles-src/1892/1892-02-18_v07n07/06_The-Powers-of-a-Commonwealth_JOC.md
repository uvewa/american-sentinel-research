When the Roman Church, in the Middle Ages, united with the State and took charge of the conscience of the world, it announced its decrees as the voice of God. But who can now wish for such a condition of things? Yet he who would advocate that the State ought thus to punish whatever its representatives think to be sin, certainly never could, with propriety, censure the Papal Church for the bloody work it did during the Dark Ages. For it was through the proclamation of this very theory by which she was enabled to gain control of the civil power, and cause it to put to death all whom the Church counted incorrigible sinners; and every heretic was counted such. The New England Puritans manifested the same spirit; and so would every class of religionists, of like belief, upon whom might be thrust a like opportunity. The writer does not take this position because he lacks faith in God, or the power of his grace to help men to do right; but he has no faith in the power of men to control their passions or prejudices, when left to themselves. Besides, history has demonstrated, over and over again, the truthfulness of this statement, and also shown conclusively that the civil power has no right to legislate, in any degree, in the interest of religion and the Church. The truth on this point is very concisely stated by Faustin Helie, in the "Cyclopedia of Political Science," under the title "Law":

> Is it true that moral justice and human justice have a common origin? Is it true they both have the same mission to fulfill, although using different means and acting in different spheres? No; for what moral justice exacts is the expiation of the fault, that is to say, retribution made for the fault committed by the evil inflicted. Is this the mission of social justice? Has it been delegated by eternal justice to enforce its laws? Has it the power to exact the expiation of crime? It has not even the means of proving that expiation has been made; for its vision is short, and its means of ascertaining truth are limited. It can not enter the conscience of the guilty party; it can not see his motives or his remorse; it can measure neither the degree of the fault nor the degree of expiation; it apprehends the external facts alone. How, then, since it can not determine absolute criminality, can it act the part of divine justice? It proceeds against material acts, with the aid of material means; the exalted but mystic view of expiation does not belong to it; this view is that of the human soul; it can not be that of society. The principle of action which should govern society is to be found in the law of self-preservation inherent in it. This law which is the first of all human laws, obliges the social power to maintain order, that is, to secure respect for the rights of the State, and the rights of its members. Penal justice exists because society exists; because it is one of the attributes, one of the conditions, of its life. It needs no other title; its legitimacy rests entirely on social law. . . . Its mission is not to give a sanction to this divine law, and enforce the observance of its precepts. It concerns itself, and can only concern itself, with public order and social interests; it can have no other object than to maintain this order, and protect its interests. Chastisement, as has been very truly said, has no right except against crime; but to constitute crime in the eyes of human justice, does not suffice that moral order is disturbed; it is necessary that there should be a grievous attack upon social order, a serious breach of external peace.

The transgression of God's law is sin (1 John 3:4), and the penalty for sin is death (Rom. 6:23). To carry out this principle of justice in human government would, as before stated, be an assumption of divine prerogatives by an earthly power. But God reserves to himself the right of punishing infractions of his moral law. The nature of man itself asserts this. It is believed by all, who support the Bible, that man's passage to the grave does not settle his account for sin committed. They are well assured that after death comes the judgment (Heb. 9:27), when all men, without respect of persons, will have the thoughts of their hearts made manifest, and will receive from God the due punishment for every sin (1 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 2:3-11). No one ever supposed that civil punishment for crime would end the responsibility of the culprit. So, the murderer, who is punished with death, does not, in that, pay the penalty for the sin of murder. His sentence to death is not for sin against God, but for crime against his fellow-creature. To admit the principle of inflicting punishment by the State as retribution for moral evil, is to oblige the State to greatly enlarge its list of offenses. In other words, if it punishes for violence or fraud as a sin against God, rather than a crime against man, it obliges itself to punish for everything that is counted sin, whether it be a crime against man or not. This would be assuming infallibility, to that degree, at least, which would admit the divining of the thoughts; for even "the thought of foolishness is sin" (Prov. 24:9). Since all sin is reprehensible, it would follow that, under such a regime, one would be held answerable to an earthly tribunal for every passing thought. In short, there would be no end to the absurdities that would follow in such a train. One of the most abominable of the brood would be the establishment, in some form, of an inquisition. For how else could one human being learn of what another is thinking? It was done that way by the Papal Church when it controlled the State in the interest of its religious dogmas, and why would not the same result follow now, under the same circumstances? In past ages, when an inquisitor wished to know the thoughts of a suspect regarding the Church, all he had to do was to put his victim on the rack and torture him till, in his agony, he revealed everything. It was, of course, then legitimate to punish him for his thoughts. The Inquisition is but the natural outgrowth of such a theory.

Some, however, may be inclined to contend that to simply make God's law a basis of civil government need not cause such extremes. But that is just what it would lead to. The moral law extends prohibitions to the very thoughts and intentions of individuals. The law says, "Thou shalt not covet." This forbids immoderate desire,—an improper operation of the mind. It further says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." In enforcing this precept, Christ said: "I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matt. 5:28). Again: "Thou shalt not kill" is a part of the divine law, yet the inspired apostle, referring to it, says: "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer" (1 John 3:15).

It is plain, from these references, that conformity to the moral law requires purity of thought. Anything short of this is sin. Now, if the civil power were to attempt to make that law the basis of punishment to be inflicted on offenders, it must punish for every improper operation of the mind, whether overt wrong actions follow or not. True, God can punish for these things, and will, if the offender does not avail himself of the means of grace offered to expiate them; for God's authority over men extends beyond this life, even to the eternal judgment. But human law must stop far short of this, inasmuch as all the conditions upon which it operates are greatly modified. It has only the power that human force can give it, and can therefore only view the outward actions. It knows nothing of the state of the mind, because that is only understood by the inner consciousness of the individual. A man may, therefore, hate his neighbor, wickedly desire his friend's possessions, or think impurely of a woman, but so long as these matters are confined to the thoughts, the State can not punish him, sinner though he be, in the sight of God, for the reason that the State has no means of detecting the sin.

But if one is led to attempt injury to the subject of his hatred, either in person or reputation, the State properly punishes that. Let his covetousness betray him into theft, and the result is the same. Or if, failing to restrain his impure thoughts, he offers insult to a woman, the State justly applies the penalty. And yet, for none of these offenses is the sentence rendered because of immorality, but for incivility,—not for sin, but for crime.
