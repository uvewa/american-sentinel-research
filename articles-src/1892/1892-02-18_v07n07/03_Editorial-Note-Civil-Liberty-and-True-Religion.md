CIVIL liberty is the legitimate and necessary outgrowth of true religion. In just the proportion that false religion occupies the hearts and influences the minds of those who make and enforce the laws of a country, will legislative and judicial religion infringe upon the right of the citizen to worship and hold such religious belief as he will. God exacts heart-service of his followers, as little children,—not political support, as of party adherents. The failure to appreciate this fact and be governed accordingly is to give unmistakable evidence of the fact that true religion, as expressed in the gospel of Jesus Christ, has failed to find lodgment in the heart. To those who appeal to the decree of the judge, the club of the policeman, or the sword of the soldier, to uphold and enforce their views of religion, that is a sealed book in which it is written, "Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you do ye even so unto them."
