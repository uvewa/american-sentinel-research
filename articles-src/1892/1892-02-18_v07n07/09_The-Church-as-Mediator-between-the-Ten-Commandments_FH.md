The Medieval Church, instead of being a universal peacemaker, when the Pope would settle in his court, questions between kings and nations. The churches of to-day are haunted by the same dream. Each little flock hopes to absorb the rest of kindred, and its ministers aspire to settle differences between labor and capital.

Things in dreams are not as they seem, but in dreams as in real old times they have their interpretations, and are sometimes guides to truth. The churches may, perhaps, help to solve the labor problem, but not by putting up their ministers to make themselves heard as to give judgment. That would be a rather to teach men to judge, and to teach them to take true evidence.

The public is the only potentate who can fill the place at which the Pope grasped; and from its opinion there is no appeal. It is for the churches so to influence the public that its judgment on the whole sound, and then to offer the evidences on which it may convict that judgment.

The chief duty of the churches to the people is to set forward all that is true, and fair, in all of the set, in the art of life; and to draw out admiration for noble, gracious and honest conduct, and to show the penalties which surely follows all forms of lying and selfishness. This duty has special application according to different subjects arise for the judgment of the public.

The labor problem, the rate of wages, the condition of the unemployed, the tactics of trades unions, the treatment of the unskilled, the weak, and the old, gives the field for settlement. A man once came to Christ saying, “Command my brother to divide the inheritance with me.” And Christ’s reply to the man came to the churches to require that they command a different divorce, is to act as a judge or a divider over you? Because of covetousness. It is covetousness on both sides which hinders the solution of the labor problem, and the special duty of the churches at the present juncture is to convince both capitalists and laborers of the covetousness which, like the proverbial mote in the eye, prevents fair judgment of others. Envy could not be the result that but the man who would not believe that he was the man who had taken a poor neighbor’s one ewe lamb, and there was thousands of upright capitalists who would not believe that they are selfish; and thousands of well-disposed laborers whose covetousness has so blinded their nature. They say of every capitalist, as Satan said of Job, “Doth he serve God for naught?”

The public whose opinion has ultimately to settle the labor problem is made up of capitalists and laborers. To the public in its fullness, the churches must repeat Christ’s message. Their ministers must assert the failure of this, communities however it works in character, the misery, the poverty it brings in its train. This, chiefly, they must hold up for admiration the clean life, which means every one who is human turn from greed as from something foreign to his humanity. . . .

The churches have done much, but they have not cherished public opinion in this direction. They have preached benevolence, sometimes for the triumph of the collection they represent, sometimes for their own interest. They have seemed to the people to be stations only to make proselytes, or to get the reputation of being purveyors of philanthropies, “advertising agencies par of public philanthropy,” which was to be, while not like their military have earned.

The churches have not cultivated public opinion to beware of covetousness. They do not realize fully the covetousness that often rather themselves illustrated all these forces of covetousness. They have thrown their doors into places of worship, and a body. They still, however, do well to harbor a child and lead a body. They still, however, do well to harbor an education, and will them in regard to education, to solve the labor problem. Their only real influence is in every department and in what they represent, in the morals and conduct of which most command attention. They are still the outward expression of the creed which speaks in every generation, and they still dwell them to be found, and they still dwell them to be part of the daily life.

The churches of (or as I would rather say) Christianity, can make all the difference; and when they make their buildings centers of simple, clean, brave, and intelligent services a communion, and their chief doctrine the preaching of Christ, they may do an educated public opinion so far forever smile on a stronger foundation than in a shelter of an arbitration; or even as a law, the rate of wages and the hours of labor. “The wages of sin is death.” By all of the Prophets at Pushaw, *N. Y. Independent.*
