The German nation is very much agitated over the matter of primary education. Chancellor Caprivi says that the elementary schools in the empire have been in a chaotic condition. "We feel," he says, "that we are living in very serious times, amid forces against which we must rally all our resources of defense. We are developing within the State one of the most important means to this end. *Assuredly the school must aid us in this. It is equally certain that we can not dispense with religion in this work. It is beyond dispute that most schools need Christianity. The school, however, can not possess this without creeds; it must, therefore, be connected with the churches whence creeds emanate.*

The italics in the preceding paragraph are introduced for the purpose of calling attention to an important thought, namely, that the schools can not have religion without creeds. This is evident, for the simplest definition of "creed" is, "That which is believed;" it is simply an expression in words of the faith of one or more persons, and it is utterly impossible to teach religion without teaching a creed, for it is impossible to teach religion without teaching that which some body believes.

We hear in this country a great deal about unsectarian religious instruction in the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. But there is no such thing as unsectarian Christianity. If Christianity is to be taught in the public schools at all it can be done only as the Emperor proposes to have it taught in Germany, namely, by the churches. Caprivi is right, the schools can not possess Christianity without creeds. What then is more natural than that having determined that Christianity shall be taught in the public schools the State should turn to the churches whence come the creeds?
