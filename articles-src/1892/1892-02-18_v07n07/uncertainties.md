# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 7 (February 18, 1892)

## OCR Quality Notes

This issue was transcribed from a Mistral OCR output file. The OCR quality was generally good, but several issues were noted:

### Page 1
- Line 106: "SIX is the transgression" - OCR error, should be "SIN is the transgression" based on the biblical reference (1 John 3:4)

### Page 2
- Line 48: "50. EM MANUEL MUSIONARY CIRCLE" - appears to be OCR error/artifact; this seems to be a running header or page element that was misread

### Page 5
- Line 244: "STEELYVE WISHART" - uncertain spelling; may be "Steelye" or another variant
- Line 244: "PORTLY OF THE SABBATH" - OCR error, likely should be "purity of the Sabbath"

### Page 6
- Line 209: "three to society" - appears incomplete or OCR error; context suggests "curse to society" or similar
- Line 216: "in worship" - missing "to worship" (likely OCR omission)
- Line 219: "theatizable blessings" - OCR error, likely "inestimable blessings"
- Line 227: "26 COLLEGE STAKE" - uncertain if "STAKE" or "STREET"
- Line 256: "EIGHTHOLY" - OCR error, likely "frightful"
- Line 258: "CHARACTERizes" - unusual capitalization/OCR artifact

### Page 6 (continued)
- Line 262: "DEGREE TO KEEP" - likely OCR error for "DESIRE TO KEEP"
- Line 262: "COMPEL" - appears mid-sentence where it should be lowercase
- Line 266: "CONFINE ITSELF SIDES" - OCR error, likely "confine itself to the" or similar
- Line 270: "ABOUT THEM, EVEN" - context unclear, possible OCR error
- Line 274: "CHROMIDATIONAL" - OCR error, likely "denominational" based on context
- Line 278: "REORGANIZED" - likely "recognized" based on context

### Page 7
- Line 282: "PURPLENCE" - OCR error, likely "pumping" based on context
- Line 282: "PRESIDENTION" - OCR error, likely "United Presbyterian"
- Line 294: "APPRECIATIVE" - confirmed correct spelling
- Line 299: "Sought TO BE" - OCR error, likely "ought to be"
- Line 302: "CHRISTIANS" - OCR error in context, likely "chronicles"
- Line 302: "INSTALLED" - OCR error, likely "insulted" based on context

### General Notes
- Multiple instances of ALL CAPS text appear to be artifacts of the original page headers/running titles
- Some hyphenated words at line breaks may have been joined incorrectly
- Foreign phrases and proper names were preserved as they appeared in the OCR

## Attribution Notes
- W. E. Sanderson (article 5) - author initials "W. E. SANDERSON" appear at end of article
- J. O. Corliss (article 6) - author initials "J. O. CORLISS" appear at end of article
- All other attributions were clear from the OCR text

## Confidence Level
Overall confidence in transcription: HIGH for article content, MEDIUM for proper names and specialized terms where OCR errors were noted above.
