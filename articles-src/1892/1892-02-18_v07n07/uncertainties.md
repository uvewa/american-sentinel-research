# Uncertainties - American Sentinel v07n07 (1892-02-18)

## General Note
The text in this issue is printed in very small type across three columns per page. Many passages were difficult to read with confidence from the page images. The transcriptions represent best-effort readings, but numerous passages may contain errors due to the limitations of reading from scanned images at this resolution.

## Page 1
- **Article "Another Tennessee Case"**: The quoted court language near the end of the article (the block quotes from the court record) was very difficult to read. The exact wording of the court's opinion as transcribed may contain errors. Confidence: LOW.
- **"to the ticket that"**: This phrase in the Tennessee case article seems unusual; it may read "to the extent that" or similar. Confidence: LOW.

## Page 2 (EMMANUEL article)
- **Title**: The word "EMMANUEL" appears in large decorative type at the top of page 2. It is unclear whether this is the article title, a scripture motto, or a page header. Transcribed as the article title. Confidence: MEDIUM.
- **Overall text**: The long editorial spanning pages 2-4 was extremely difficult to read due to the small print size. Large portions of this article may contain transcription errors. The legal citations (Bishop's Criminal Law, Blackstone, Hawk, etc.) were especially challenging. Confidence: LOW.
- **"N. B., Saratovia"**: This attribution at the end of a section is uncertain. Confidence: LOW.

## Page 3
- **Continuation of Emmanuel article**: Multiple passages in the middle and left columns were hard to decipher. Legal citations and court opinion quotes are especially uncertain. Confidence: LOW.
- **"The Power of a Counterfeit"**: The boundary between the Emmanuel article and this article was difficult to determine precisely. Some text may be misattributed between these two articles. Confidence: MEDIUM.

## Page 4
- **"Queer Resolutions for Christians"**: The resolutions themselves were partially readable but some phrases may be inaccurate. Confidence: MEDIUM.
- **Article boundaries on this page**: The transition between "The Power of a Counterfeit" and "Queer Resolutions for Christians" was difficult to determine precisely. Confidence: MEDIUM.

## Page 5
- **"An Eloquent Monument"**: The specific monetary figures (£280, £600, £5,000, £15,000, £620,800) are best-effort readings. Some may be inaccurate. Confidence: MEDIUM.
- **"The Church as Mediator between the Ten Commandments"**: This article by Francis Hope was readable but some phrases in the middle sections were uncertain. Confidence: MEDIUM.

## Page 6
- **"Declaration of Principles"**: Only the header and partial text were clearly readable. The full text of the declaration was difficult to read. Confidence: LOW.
- **Various news items**: Multiple short news items on this page were partially readable. Confidence: LOW to MEDIUM.

## Page 8
- **"Blasphemy"**: The article text was partially readable. Some passages, especially the quoted material, may contain errors. Confidence: MEDIUM.
- **"Morality and Legal Purity in Politics"**: Only the beginning of this article was clearly visible; it appears to be cut off or continues elsewhere. Confidence: LOW.
- **Various short news items**: Multiple items on this page were difficult to read completely. Confidence: LOW to MEDIUM.

## Article Attribution
- **Article 08 "An Eloquent Monument"**: Attributed to A. O. TAIT based on initials at the end. Confidence: HIGH.
- **Article 09**: Attributed to FRANCIS HOPE based on name at end. Confidence: HIGH.
- **Article 06 "The Power of a Counterfeit"**: Attributed to A. T. J. (Alonzo T. Jones) based on initials at end. Confidence: HIGH.

## Article Boundaries
- The division between the "Emmanuel" editorial and "The Power of a Counterfeit" was particularly difficult to establish. These articles flow across pages 2-4 and some text may be misassigned between them. A careful re-reading with higher-resolution images would be beneficial.
