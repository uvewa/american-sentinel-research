One of the strong points set forth by all of the leaders of the American Sabbath Union is the necessity of securing a “civil Sabbath.” It is hard to conceive of anything that is a grander prophecy of its intentions than this statement, and at the same time serve the practical injunction can also, at the same time serve as guide as fully civil. But our Sunday friends as well feel like this, and well might they, for what is this “civil Sabbath” enforced by civil law. Not if Sunday were a “civil day” to be kept; but that very act secularize the day? For the remedy of one who voluntarily desecrates why deplore the “secularizing” of the day when the very leaders of the movement are trying to secure a “civil” rest day, which could not but secularize the day.

But note the fact that it is the earnest desire of churches and of individuals that is here described as casting their influence against the tendency of this secularizing of the Sunday. “The first day of the week is strictly a religious institution,” and the Christian has no need of any civil law to enable him to keep it. Neither does the Church need any civil law to enable it to discipline its own members. The remedy for Sabbath desecration is not civil but ecclesiastical. The churches have done much, but they have not cherished public opinion in this direction. They have preached benevolence, sometimes for the triumph of the collection they represent, sometimes for their own interest. They have seemed to the people to be stations only to make proselytes, or to get the reputation of being purveyors of philanthropies, “advertising agencies par of public philanthropy,” which was to be, while not like their military have earned.

The churches have not cultivated public opinion to beware of covetousness. They do not realize fully the covetousness that often rather themselves illustrated all these forces of covetousness. They have thrown their doors into places of worship, and a body. They still, however, do well to harbor a child and lead a body. They still, however, do well to harbor an education, and will them in regard to education, to solve the labor problem. Their only real influence is in every department and in what they represent, in the morals and conduct of which most command attention. They are still the outward expression of the creed which speaks in every generation, and they still dwell them to be found, and they still dwell them to be part of the daily life.

The churches of (or as I would rather say) Christianity, can make all the difference; and when they make their buildings centers of simple, clean, brave, and intelligent services a communion, and their chief doctrine the preaching of Christ, they may do an educated public opinion so far forever smile on a stronger foundation than in a shelter of an arbitration; or even as a law, the rate of wages and the hours of labor. “The wages of sin is death.”

What would the same result follow now, under the same circumstances? In just now, again an inquisition wished to know the thoughts of a suspect regarding the Church, all he had to do to get his victim on the rack and torture him till, at his option, he revealed everything. It is, of course, then legitimate to punish him for his thoughts. The Inquisition is but the natural outgrowth of such a theory.

Some, however, may be inclined to contend that to simply make civil law a basis of civil government need not mean such criticism, under existing the facts. But that is just what it would lead to. The normal law extends its prohibition to the very thoughts and intentions of individuals. The law says, “Thou shalt not covet.” This forbids certain sinful desires, an improper operation of the mind. It further says, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” Its enforcement, therefore, in the case of a man just after he has committed adultery would be saying this: “Thou shalt not kill.” Again: “Thou shalt not kill” is a part of the divine law, yet the inspired apostle, referring to it, says “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer” (1 John 3:15).

It is plain, from these references, that conformity to the moral law requires purity in the very thoughts and intents of the heart.

Now, if the civil power were to attempt to make that law the basis of punishment to be inflicted on offenders, it must punish for every improper operation of the mind, whether overt wrong action follows or not. Then, can punish for these things, what will it do that does not avail himself of the means of grace offered by the Gospel to bring his thoughts into obedience extends beyond this life, even to the eternal judgment. But human law must not fear of this. It assumes in all the conditions upon which it operates are greatly modified. It has only the power that human force can give it, and can therefore only view the outward actions, it knows nothing of the state of the mind, and still less of the thoughts and intents or inner consciousness of the individual. A man may, therefore, hate his neighbor, covertly envy there his friend’s possessions, or think impurely of a woman, but so long as these matters are confined to his thoughts the State not punish him, since therefore in his sin, in the sight of God, for the reason that the State has no means of detecting those thoughts.
