The Mansion House of London, the official residence of the Lord Mayor, is one of the finest buildings in the city, and is known throughout the world. But that the magnificence is also an eloquent statement of a shameful period is known to but few of our readers or citizens themselves. It also stands as an eloquent protest against the folly of giving religious men full control of civil affairs or the disqualification of all others whose religious tenets do not harmonize with theirs. In 1740 the Corporation of London passed a by-law directing a fine of four hundred and twenty marks (£280) on every person declining to stand for the office of Sheriff after he had been nominated, and of six hundred pounds (£600) on every one refusing to serve after being elected, making the fine £5,000 in all. The reason of this by-law was obvious. The Corporation consisted of members of the Church of England and they knew that if Dissenters and others who had been passed years before the prohibitory act on account of the Test Act which was a masterpiece of Church and State. This legislation was at a time when it was not a masterpiece of National Reform principles and provided all that the legal proscription of public offices of whatsoever kind should not only be large but the taking of oaths since upon adherence and supremacy, that also should take the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper in the Church of England. Of course no Dissenter or nonconformist could hold office upon such conditions. Then came those “Christians” who comprised the Corporation of London, knowing this, proceeded to nominate Dissenter after Dissenter to the office of Sheriff. All these Christians then had to do was to pay up the £5,000 fine, which enriched the treasury for the erection of that same Mansion House.

This went on for sixty years until the fines amounted to £15,000 (£620,800); at length the courts of law were appealed to for protection, and after years of litigation the House of Lords gave judgment against the claims of the “Christian” Corporation. It was thus that Lord Mansfield delivered one of those judicial decisions which stands in history. In scathing terms he denounced the attempt of the Corporation to make two laws—one to prevent men from serving, the other to punish them for not serving. “If,” said he, “they refuse, punish them; if they refuse, punish them. If they won’t, punish them; if they say ‘No,’ punish them. My lords, this is most unjust: a man is required from whom there is no escaping. It is a trap; a man can not get out of. It is as bad a persecution as that of Procrustes: if they are too short, stretch them; if they are too long lop them!” “Persecution,” he added, “is against natural religion, revealed religion, and sound policy.”

This little incident is of interest to lovers of religious liberty as it shows the results of such reasoning and the ruin when logically applied. It is what religious men have always done under such circumstances, and always will do.
