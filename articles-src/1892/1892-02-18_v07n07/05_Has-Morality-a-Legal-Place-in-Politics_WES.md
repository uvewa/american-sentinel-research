CARDINAL ARCHISHOP HENRY EDWARD has said, in his article entitled "Without God No Commonwealth," that "without a higher sanction, and the cohesion of a moral law, the whole political order would be disintegrated, the whole social order would be dissolved, and the whole domestic life would be confusion." Without questioning the truth of this statement, let us ask the question, Is it true that the genius of civil government requires a moral law to keep it from dissolution? If it is, there must be infinite advances for political science before us; if not, we ought at least to recognize the principle by which the moral code is barred from our political institutions.

Ideal government has for its end the protection of individual rights, and the promotion of national welfare. The highest attainment of civil law can never be the morality of a nation, nor of the individual; for morality is purely a personal matter, and the civil law has nothing to do with the individual as such, but only as he is associated with others. It has nothing to do with the man who makes an attempt on his own life, but only as he is found effecting his criminal intentions on another. The moral law lies farther back, recognizing the motive which has inspired the crime, and that alone.

Again, the civil law can not be said even to enforce good citizenship, except so far as good citizenship is coincident with justice. It is not good citizenship for one man to defraud another in a one-sided bargain, and yet the civil law demands the fulfillment of that bargain. In the same way it insures fidelity to an inconvenient promise. Another fact which has an important bearing on the relation which the moral law should sustain to civil government is, that the civil law is not, nor can it be, a prophylactic agency. In other words, it can have nothing to do with the criminal until his crime either has been actually committed or is believed to have been. The reason is obvious. It is manifestly unjust to argue that because malice in one person has led to crime, it will lead to crime in another. Neither can we always argue from what a man believes, to the good or evil in which that belief will terminate. We say that the practice of polygamy is injurious to the best interests of the State. So it is. Here then is the point where civil law can deal with this evil. The fact that a man is a Mormon, and that Mormons have always practiced polygamy, is no reason why Mormons should be considered criminal in the eyes of the civil law.

It was charged that the Russian Jews, as a sect, were injurious to the best interests of the Russian State; that they were a nation of usurers who exacted unjust returns, corrupted morals, and had a hundred other unlawful customs, and yet, Christendom regards their expulsion from the Russian Empire as no less than religious persecution, because, no matter how many crimes may have been committed by Hebrew individuals, it does not follow that all who profess their creed would have committed the same or like offenses. To the neglect of this obvious truth may be traced all the great religious and civil persecutions of history. Civil government finds its province only in meting out punishment for the actual offense; and when it has fulfilled its threats civil law has done its work.

Whether the man who steals the loaf from the baker's window be a hardened criminal of lifelong experience or the unfortunate father of a starving child, there can be no discrimination in the eyes of the civil law. There may be a moral distinction between the man who kills his neighbour in cold blood in hope of gain, and the one who desires by that act to relieve society of a dangerous fellow, and yet if there is such a distinction, civil law is blind to it, and justly so. It can not judge of the motives which have led to the crime, except when they are evidenced by action. And never, until our legislative bodies shall possess that wisdom, whereby, with the Almighty, they can read and judge the consciences of men; never, until with an infinite foresight, looking into an unknown future, they can predict unfailingly to what results the different temperaments of men and their diverse environments will lead them, can they throw away the evidences of guilt found in the injury itself, and on the principles of morality, convict the criminal before he has committed his offense.

There are two points of view from which we naturally regard a criminal offense,—the evil with which we associate it, and the personal injury which follows as its result. Obviously the former constitutes the sin of the action, and the latter we call the crime. In other words, the motive which would influence one to commit an offense, and the resultant act which that motive, right or wrong, will lead the individual to commit are two very different matters, which from a legislative standpoint may be considered the respective provinces of Divine and human wisdom. To illustrate this, take the case of a familiar instrument, the stereopticon. The simplest observer is able to judge the merits or defects of the picture which is cast upon the screen. With his sense of harmony he will detect its blemishes or recognize a perfect representation. But it requires a much higher wisdom to judge of the conditions under which the negative will produce a perfect or deficient picture; to tell what results will be obtained by the relative light and shade, or the distance of the negative from the lens through which the representation is to be cast. Thus between the thoughts and visible acts of man the lens of his disposition and environment may differ with every individual. The motive which in one case would result in a praiseworthy action, might under other circumstances, known only to the individual and his Maker, lead to a criminal offense; and when man presumes to regulate his penal code to condemn the moral side of life, his actions will find its terminus in nothing short of intolerance and religious persecution.

The moral law defines the duties of men to God. It regards the offense from the standpoint of the transgressor, and not from that of the one against whom the wrong has been committed. In other words, it is everywhere consistent with the words of the great apostle, "SIX is the transgression of the [divine] law."

Profanity is a sin, but who will presume to punish profanity except as it reflects a positive injury on a second individual? Sabbath desecration is a sin. Covetousness is a sin, but it has nothing to do with criminal law until this sin, cast upon the screen of action, results in the crime of actually taking what is not one's own.

Whatever place morality ought to have in molding the minds and opinions of men and statesmen, we can come to no other conclusion than, that, in politics and in the execution of civil law, morality and the law which governs it can have no legal place.
