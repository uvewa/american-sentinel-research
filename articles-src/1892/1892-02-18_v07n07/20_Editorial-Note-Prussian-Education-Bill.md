IN regard to the Prussian education bill, which the Examiner says "embodies the Emperor's solution of the burning educational problem, and aims to reorganize education in Prussia on a denominational basis, as denominationalism is understood by the Prussian State; that is to say, as embracing the Catholic and Protestant religions. The bill, accordingly, has been described by the Emperor as one to abolish atheism. Under it education is compulsory, and Christianity is so too. It allows a choice of denomination, and makes it possible for Protestant and Catholic children to be instructed in schools where their particular denominational truths are taught, except in the cases of the children of Jews, Mohammedans, freethinkers, and atheists, who must, under severe penalties, receive instruction in the orthodox Christian faith." The Emperor's educational bill seems, in one respect, to be more liberal than Mr. Blair's historic educational amendment to the Constitution, in that he puts Protestants and Roman Catholics on an equal civil footing, whereas the Blair amendment recognized only Protestants; otherwise the German bill is the same, only translated into the methods of monarchism.
