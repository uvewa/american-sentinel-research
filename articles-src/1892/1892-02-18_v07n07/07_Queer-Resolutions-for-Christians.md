A recent State meeting of the Indiana Division of the American Sabbath Union, among others the following resolutions were passed:—

*Resolved,* That we urge upon the proper tendency to eliminate from the first day of the week all unnecessary labor, and to give it such use and observance, and especially of proper devotion and sacredness of the ministry and worship of the churches.

That Christian ministers and laymen should not be entangled with Sabbath breaking or amusement seeking, by countenancing secular newspapers; or by viewing secular things on the same.

That we earnestly recommend to all of our churchgoers that they co-operate with all proper efforts for the promotion of good Sabbath observance in keeping the Sabbath and to unite with proper public and religious interests and means as they may be adopted.

That Christian ministers and laymen should not be entangled with Sabbath breaking or amusement seeking, by countenancing secular newspapers; or by viewing secular things on the same.
