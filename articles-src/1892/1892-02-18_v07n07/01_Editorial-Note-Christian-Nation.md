THE phrase "a Christian nation" is absurd. If every man, woman, and child in the State were a Christian, we should then not be a Christian Nation, but a Nation of Christians. Christianity is not a national characteristic; it does not run in the blood. No one is a Christian in virtue of his birth, of a certain race, or of citizenship in a certain State. Christianity is a personal and an acquired characteristic, and is not essential to nationality or to citizenship.
