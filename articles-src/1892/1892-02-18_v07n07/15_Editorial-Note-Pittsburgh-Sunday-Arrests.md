THE Pittsburgh Dispatch, of Monday, February 9, records that at the Sunday morning hearing, February 7, in that city, Judge Gripp disposed of fifteen cases; Magistrate Succop, twenty cases; Magistrate McKenna, twenty-seven cases; Magistrate Hyndman, six cases; Magistrate Leslie, one case. Here is an opportunity for the Pittsburgh Law and Order League to secure them a credit mark for punishing them.
