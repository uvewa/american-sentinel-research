ON the evening of Sunday, February 7, after the burning of the Hotel Royal where, under such frightful circumstances, so many human lives were lost, Rev. W. W. Atterbury, president of the New York Sabbath Committee, spoke at the Old Scotch Church in Fourteenth Street. The World characterizes his address thus:—

> "The speaker said that on his way to church his ears had been pained with shouts which he had never heard before on the streets of New York on Sunday. Everybody leaned forward in their pews eager to hear what had shocked the minister. Something like a look of disappointment passed over the faces of the audience when Mr. Atterbury said that what 'pained his ears' had been the 'cries of newsboys selling papers containing reports of the big fire.' Such things were against the law, he said, and should be stamped out. If boys are allowed to sell papers on Sunday, he declared, they will some day develop into troublesome criminals. Mr. Atterbury expressed no sympathy for the victims of the fire. The fact that newsboys were selling papers seemed to have impressed him more than the terrible loss of life."
