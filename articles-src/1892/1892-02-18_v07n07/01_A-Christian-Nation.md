The phrase “a Christian nation” is absurd. If every man, woman, and child in the State were a Christian, we should then not be a Christian Nation, but a Nation of Christians. Christianity is not a national characteristic; it does not run in the blood, it is not a thing of race; a man who is a Christian is a Christian by virtue of faith, not as a certain race, or of citizenship in a certain State. Christianity is a personal, not an acquired characteristic, and is not amenable to nationality or citizenship.—*National Baptist.*
