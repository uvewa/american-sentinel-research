Civil liberty is the legitimate and necessary offspring of true religion. In just the proportion that false religions occupy the hearts and influence the minds of those who make and enforce the laws of a country, will legislative and judicial regulation infringe upon the right of the citizen to worship and hold such religious views, as, upon proper investigation and study, he may be led to adopt,—not such as a county, a diocese, a presbytery, or a nation may dictate. To be the true follower of Christ, the Christian must be just what Christ was to the civil and political world of his time. He asked nothing of his followers, as little children,—not political support, as of party adherents. The failure to appreciate this fact and to be governed accordingly is to give unmistakable evidence of the fact that true religion, as expressed in the gospel of Jesus Christ, has failed to find lodgment in the heart. To those who appeal to the decree of the judge, the club of the policeman, or the sword of the soldier, to uphold and enforce their views of religion, that is a sealed book in which it is written, “Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.”
