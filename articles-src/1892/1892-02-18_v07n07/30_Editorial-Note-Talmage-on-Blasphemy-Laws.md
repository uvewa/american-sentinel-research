Referring to a recent infidel lecture in Brooklyn, Dr. Talmage said:—

> Is there any such thing as blasphemy? If there be, is there no law against it? These are tremendous questions which I ask of the legal fraternity, the judges of our courts and through them the Legislature of the State of New York. There is such a thing as blasphemy. Let the law against blasphemy be erased from the statute book or let it be executed. . . . It would have been the grandest drama that Brooklyn had ever seen if last Sabbath my friend Patrick Campbell, the Chief of the Police, who believes in God—in Jesus Christ—had walked on the platform, followed by a platoon of police officers, and had put his hand on the shoulder of the blasphemous lecturer and said to him: "In the name of the common law, in the name of the State of New York, and in the name of the city of Brooklyn, this infancy must stop—must stop here and must stop now."

Yes, there is such a thing as blasphemy, and the time was when Dr. Talmage, had he lived and preached as he now preaches, would have been adjudged guilty of it.

"Blasphemy," says Bouvier, "is to attribute to God that which is contrary to his nature, and does not belong to him, and to deny what does." It follows that every man who has a different conception of God from that which his neighbor has, blasphemes, in the estimation of that neighbor, if he gives expression to that conception. Thus, in the eyes of the Trinitarian, the Unitarian blasphemes when he denies the divinity of Christ and the personality of the Holy Spirit. Civil laws against blasphemy are dangerous things.
