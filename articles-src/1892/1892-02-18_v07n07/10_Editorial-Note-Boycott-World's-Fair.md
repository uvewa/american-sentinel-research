To those who threaten to boycott the World's Fair:—

"There was also a method of conversion used by our forefathers, consisting of two little pieces of iron attached at both ends by a screw.

"The man who to-day says, 'I will not trade with that man because his religion is different from mine,' has the same spirit that possessed the one who used the thumb-screw; all the wretch lacks is the power."
