A liquor traffic and Sunday labor Prohibitionist says in the Christian Patriot, that the Prohibition party is not a temperance society, but a political party which seeks for political success to be about them. The Field and Stockman, however, with innocent unconsciousness of its ludicrousness, the statement is made that, "The Polish prince is the American farm personified, and should be regarded as an important feature in the exposition designed to illustrate the advance of civilization. He has rooted many a poor man into a comfortable home, and those who have given him this power should have some influence in the matter whether he shall be put upon show on Sunday." Will this Christian nation ride "pig-a-back" into the kingdom of heaven?
