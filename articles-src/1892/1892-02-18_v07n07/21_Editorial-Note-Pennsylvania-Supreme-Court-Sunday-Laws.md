IF correctly reported, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has extremely expressed itself on the enforcement of Sunday laws. At the hearing of an appealed case, where the Law and Order Society of Allegheny County obtained the conviction of an oil well owner for pumping oil on Sunday, according to the United Presbyterian, the judge, "in respect to the habit of taking appeals for infractions of the Sabbath law, said with some impatience: 'It is idle, and a great waste of time to bring such questions up here upon a certiorari. There is no appeal, and, as we have said at least a hundred times, we can not review the evidence.'" Upon this the Sunday-law promoters consider themselves strongly intrenched in Pennsylvania.
