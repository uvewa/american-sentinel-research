The Denver *Times* very truly says that “no educational system has ever been devised, or ever will be devised, to which the objection of intolerance, and no legislation can ever make men moral.”

The *Nelson Miner* (British Columbia) remarks that the new Sunday law, which went into effect January 1st, “is not strictly obeyed, neither is it by the people as a people are constituted as they are.”

A French court has decided that the Pope is a sovereign, and is entitled to hold and treat property in France. Upon this, the *Catholic Review* remarks: “Thus it will come about in no small measure that is not so far of that when the Pope will regain his former rights and possessions.”

A London paper has found that bit of Sunday which is not in church informed of a few days of agitation for more strict observance of the day of rest.

The old English Sunday in the north of England appears, from Sir. William Andrew’s curious work on “Old Church Lore,” to have been characterized by a considerable disregard of all the forms which it forth coming auction sales and other equally profitable as the parish church meeting in the parish clerk to the church yard, or even in the church itself. It seems moreover that it was at Londonderry, during the reign of Charles II, a Sunday market was held. Butchers put their carcasses of meat at the church door, and customers annually took the pastry into church inside the building and hung them on the backs of those same till service was finished. The butchery was, we are told, so disturbed by this irreverent custom that he made a protest to London, on which the whole thing was promptly discontinued.

This sounds odd to modern ears, but when we remember that the Sabbath idea of Sunday is of comparatively recent origin, it is not at all strange that even some people made merriment held upon that day, occasions of traffic.

The German nation is very much agitated over the matter of primary education. Chancellor *Caprivi* says that the elements of our schools in the empire have been in a chaotic condition. “We feel,” he says, “that we are living in very serious times, and forces against which we must rally all our resources of defense. We are developing within the State one of the most important means to that end. Assuredly the school must aid us in this. It is equally certain, that we can not dispense with religion in this work. It is to be beyond dispute that most schools need Christendom. The school, however, can not possess this without creed; it must, therefore, be connected with the churches whose creed it counsels.”

The italics in the preceding paragraph are introduced for the purpose of calling attention to an important fact; namely, that the schools can not have religion without creed. This is evident, for the simplest definition of “creed” is this: “the beliefs of a religious denomination as it assumes in words of the faith of one or more persons, and it is utterly impossible to teach religion without teaching a creed, for it is impossible to teach religion without teaching that which some body believes.”

Woe is this country in a great deal of its reservations not religion in the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. But there is nothing so un-American as sectarian Christianity. If Christianity is to be taught in the public schools at all it can be done only as the Emperor proposes to have it taught in Germany, namely, by the churches. Caprivi is right, the schools can not possess Christianity without creed; that having determined that Christianity shall be taught in the public schools the State should turn to the chairman where come the creed?
