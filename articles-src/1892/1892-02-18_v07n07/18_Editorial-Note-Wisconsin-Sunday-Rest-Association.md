THE Wisconsin Sunday Rest Association in its late meeting at Madison, Wisconsin, reorganized as a branch of the American Sabbath Union, and adopted lengthy resolutions in regard to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and Sunday observance in general. This Association at its inception, attempted to confine itself to the "civil" side of the question, and prove the possibility of the enforcement of a civil Sunday as something separate and distinct from a religious Sabbath observed on the same day. The "civil" disguise will no doubt soon be dropped altogether by all the promoters of legal religion.
