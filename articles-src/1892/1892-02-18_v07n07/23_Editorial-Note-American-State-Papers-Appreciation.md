THE Galesburg, Illinois, Press and People has the following appreciative note on "American State Papers":

> "In these days, when the agitation of the question of compulsory Sunday observance, compulsory reading of the Bible in public schools, State appropriations for sectarian institutions, untaxed church property, and kindred questions, are agitating the public mind, an organization like the National Religious Liberty Association becomes a necessity.

> The society has already compiled and published in elegant typography, a comprehensive volume of three hundred and sixty pages, entitled "American State Papers bearing on Religious Legislation," with a thorough historical review and resume of the whole Sunday question. The volume ought to be in the hands of every free American citizen.
