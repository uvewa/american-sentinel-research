A CASE almost coincident with that of R. M. King, of Tennessee, is that of W. H. Parker vs. the State of Tennessee. Parker lived at Springville, Tennessee, and was convicted, in the Circuit Court of Henry County, of following his common avocation, that of blacksmith, publicly, upon Sunday, in the month of April 1885, and upon other Sundays previous to that,—in fact that it was his usual habit to work in his shop on the first day of the week; and to this accusation no demur was made. Conviction followed in the lower courts and the case was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, on an appeal in error from the Circuit Court of Henry County. There, although the statute of the State does not make Sunday labor an indictable offense, but only finalize in the sum of three dollars, to be recovered before a justice of the peace, it was held that the repetition of the acts of Sunday labor constituted a nuisance and thus became indictable. The decision of the lower court was sustained, and Parker subjected to fine and costs amounting to sixty-nine dollars and eighty-one cents. This fine he refused to pay, in the belief that the payment of the penal sum would be, on his part, a virtual acknowledgment of the justice of the conviction, and submission of his conscientious religious belief to the decree of the court. The only alternative left him was to serve out the amount in the common jail, to which he accordingly went under a sentence of two hundred and eighty days. After having served fifty-nine days he was taken with malarial fever and was released from confinement, on his bond to return upon his recovery; after the lapse of two months he returned to the jail and worked out the remainder of his sentence. However, the malarial poison there absorbed remained in his system and he finally died, as has been claimed by some, from the lingering effects of the imprisonment. The case of Parker was used as a precedent, under the ruling in which it was assumed that the court must find a similar verdict in the case of King, in which the precedent case was imitated by bringing an indictment upon the plea that King's farm labor, on Sunday, amounted to a public nuisance.

The case is reported on page 476 of volume 16 of Reports of cases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of Tennessee, reported by Benjamin J. Lea, Attorney General and reporter, in which it is said of Parker's labor that—

> The indictment avers said work was a disturbance and nuisance to the good citizens of said county, and it was averred that such work was not necessary, or a matter of charity.

> Another count charges that Parker was guilty of a public nuisance by such work on Sunday, to the prejudice of the public morals and contrary to the statutes, etc.

> The proof upon the trial was, that defendant was a blacksmith, having a shop near Springville, in said county, and numerous witnesses testify to having seen him at work at his trade in his shop upon different Sundays within twelve months before the finding of the indictment. One witness said that he knew the defendant worked at his business every Sunday. The defendant's counsel insists that although it is proved that the defendant worked at his trade on Sunday, there is no evidence to show that he disturbed or damaged any person thereby so as to constitute a nuisance, and unless it does appear by proof that some person or persons were disturbed or annoyed, the offense might be punishable under section 2289, of New Code, but is not indictable.

> It is held in 1 Lea, 129, 130, that hunting, or fishing on Sunday may be punished by indictment, and these offenses are declared punishable by the same penalties as those prescribed in Section 2289, New Code. See section 2290. So that the working at one's trade, under such circumstances, and to such an extent as is decided to a nuisance, is indictable.

> Judge McKinney says, in a case where a defendant had been indicted and convicted for the utterance of obscene words in public, and quoting from Blackstone's Commentaries, page 42, that the municipal law looks to more than the protection of the lives, liberty, and property of the people. Regarding Christianity as a part of the law of the land, it respects and protects its institutions, and assumes, likewise, to regulate the public morals and decency of the community. The same enlightened author distinguishes between the absolute and relative duties of individuals as members of society. He shows that, while human laws can not be expected to enforce the former, their proper concern is with social and relative duties; hence, however abandoned in principle, or vicious in practice a man may be, if he keeps his wickedness to himself, and does not offend against the rules of public decency, he is out of the reach of the law, but if he makes his vices public, they then become, by the bad example they set, of pernicious effect to society, and are punishable by the law; 1 Swan, 42, citing 1 Blackstone's Commentaries 124; 4 Swan, 41, 42.

> In an indictment for profanity, which is punishable under the statute by pecuniary penalty, like this case, it was held that when the vicious acts are public, they will be dealt with as crimes, because of their tendency to disturb and annoy others, and exert a baneful influence upon the morals and habits of the community. Generally any practice tending to disturb the peace and quiet of communities, or corrupt the morals of the people, are indictable as public offenses by the common law: 3 Sneed (Cooper's edition) 133, and cases there cited.

> In 7 Lea, 410, it is held that profanity, when it becomes a public nuisance, is indictable, but in that case it was held the case was not made out, but a single act being proved.

> In 1 Bishop's Criminal Law, section 946, it is said, public profane swearing and blasphemy have been held in this country to be indictable at the common law, yet less, according to some of the judges, as tending to sap the foundations of Christianity, than as disturbing the peace, and corrupting the morals of the community. In the next section it is said, but however uncertain may be the precise extent to which the common law protects Christianity, there is no question that it practically and fully cherishes the public morals, and it punishes, as a crime, every act which it deems sufficiently evil, and directly tending to impair the public morals, and while a single act of the class forbidden by the statute may be punished by a specific fine, as described by the statute, yet if repeated and continued, it becomes punishable by indictment at common law: 1 Bishop's Criminal Law, section 1055. See also section 939, 2 Bishop's Criminal Law where it is said that the doctrine has been laid down, in Pennsylvania, that though a single act of Sabbath-breaking is punishable by a fine, there may be such a succession of acts of the same sort as will amount to an indictable offense.

> The statute makes it unlawful for any one of the enumerated classes to follow his ordinary secular avocation on the Sabbath day, because it is immoral and is of pernicious effect, and, though it may be conceded a single offense may be liable only to the penalty prescribed by the statute, yet a succession of such acts becomes a nuisance and is indictable, such a succession and repetition of the acts are shown in this case, as one witness says, that defendant did work at his trade, as blacksmith, in his shop near Springville, every Sunday, and others testify to similar acts on many Sundays, within twelve months before the finding of the indictment. Nor is it necessary to a conviction that the proof should show that any person was disturbed thereby. It is sufficient that the acts, which the law holds as illegal and forbidden, have been done in such public manner as to have been open to the observation of the public. Their tendency is to corrupt public morals, and the example is pernicious and contrary to law, and the well-being and good order of society.

> The defendant offered to prove that he belonged to a "Christian sect," who kept the seventh, instead of the first day of the week as Sunday. "A general prohibition against doing worldly business on the Lord's day, extends to persons who conscientiously observe the seventh day of the week as the Christian Sabbath:" 1 Bishop, Criminal Law, section 268.

> There was therefore no error in excluding the offered testimony, nor in refusing to charge as requested. There is no error in the record for which the judgment should be reversed, and it will be affirmed.

The opinion of the court in this case is thus quoted at length in order that the lines of thought along which it runs may be fully seen. The first authority presented by the Judge is a precedent of his own making in a previous case, 1 Lea 129, where he had held that hunting, and fishing, on Sunday, were indictable offenses; and therefore working at one's trade, on that day, is also indictable. In support of the principle upon which he would base the right to thus judicially legislate and make that indictable which the Legislature only made finable before a justice, he quotes Judge McKinney, who makes his own the theory of Blackstone, that the municipal law has a broader sphere than the protection of life, liberty, and property; and that it must protect Christianity as part of itself, and so being itself Christianity it must protect itself and regulate the public morals of the community. The word regulate, here used, has had judicial interpretation in a very notable Tennessee case that of the Mayor and City Council of Nashville vs. Linck, 12 Lea 499, in which was considered the constitutional right of the Legislature to confer upon municipalities the right to compel cessation from secular pursuits on "the Sabbath day" and the "power to enforce observance of the Sabbath day." Here was another example of judicial legislation in which the legislative grant of power to the municipality to regulate by ordinance the carrying on of business within its limits, was construed to authorize ordinances prohibiting business on Sunday or "Sabbath-breaking." In the opinion in this case it is said:—

> The word regulate inevitably involves all that is meant by restraint, and more, as it carries with it the affirmative element somewhat of continued action in a defined direction. But this is restraint, so as to prevent other action than that desired.

The municipal law, therefore, having absorbed Christianity into itself must protect its Christian self by such municipal regulations as will prevent all other action than that it desires. Beyond this religious legislation or decree never went, neither does it need to, for the attainment of all its ends.

In the case in 3 Sneed 133, where profanity is held to be indictable, although punishable under the statute only by pecuniary penalty, and quoted to sustain the similar position taken in the case of Parker, the Judge says of profane swearing:—

> It is in violation of the second commandment, and the general injunctions and precepts of religion; it generates a contempt for holy things, tends to the corruption of morals, and the debasement of humanity. In all this the public have a deep interest, and may well enforce penalties to avert such consequences.

These are but examples, every case quoted, without exception, teaches the same lesson,—of a strained construction to permit the following of religio-legal precedents introduced into Tennessee law, through the provincial Church and State laws of North Carolina and derived from the Church and State theories of Blackstone, and ancient religious statutes of England. To follow the different authorities cited would only be cumulative on the same point, and there is not here sufficient space.

The quotation from Bishop's criminal law made by the Judge, in the next to the last paragraph of the opinion reprinted here, is well offset by another citation from the same source made by this Judge in his previous decision of the case against Gunter,—"Mr. Bishop says, 'unnecessarily to perform secular labor on Sunday, in such a way as to disturb the worship of others on Sunday,' is indictable." To disturb worship at any time is punishable. But this does not necessarily make Sunday labor in a shop indictable. A citation from Mr. Bishop, which is more apt to these cases would have been found in Section 344, Volume 1, where it is said:—

> And a court that felt itself bound by a statute, could not permit a defendant to show that he deemed it in conflict with God's law; because this would be equivalent to receiving from him a plea of ignorance of the law of the land, which we have seen is not permitted. Therefore a man can not make the defense in court, that there is a higher law than the one there administered forbidding him to obey the law of the court, further than it may tend to shake the legal validity of the latter. Upon this point Baron Hume observes, "the practice of all countries is agreed." The rule lies necessarily at the foundation of all jurisprudence; yet, necessary though it is, it has shed the innocent blood of almost all the host of martyrs who have laid down their lives for conscience' sake.

Accept this doctrine and human error will be found to have so entrenched itself behind legal precedent that there is no appeal, except to the final adjudication before the court of God.
