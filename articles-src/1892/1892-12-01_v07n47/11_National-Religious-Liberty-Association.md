## NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

A leading article in the Arena for December is entitled, "Religious Intolerance in the Republic: Christians Prosecuting Christians in Tennessee."

The Cincinnati Post of November 18 has the following:—

Maysville, Ky., Nov. 18.—The Mason County Grand Jury returned indictments Wednesday night against nearly all the barber shops, cigar stores, and clothing houses in this city for keeping open on Sunday.

Those who have back numbers of The American Sentinel, Signs of the Times, Review and Herald, Youth's Instructor, or Little Friend, can have these idle papers put to active use by sending them, post-paid, to A. D. Guthrie, Librarian Seattle Track and Missionary Society, 309 Poplar Street, Seattle, Washington. The society wishes these papers for its depot and ship work.

The pastors of the different churches of the city of Atlanta, Ga., met recently and organized an auxiliary of the American Sabbath Union. On the same day a bill was introduced in the Georgia Legislature to make the reading of the Bible in all public schools compulsory.

Such schools as fail to comply with this requirement are to be deprived of their pro rata apportionment of the public school fund.

In its issue of November 16, under the head, "New Jersey Blue Laws Enforced," the Daily Times of Middleton, N. Y., has this item from Hackensack, N. J.:—

"Mrs. Elizabeth Berry and Garry Storms were brought to the jail here to serve four days each for violating the Sunday law. They reside at Woodcliff, and were arrested on complaint of Martin J. Meyers, a farmer of that place, who charged them with husking corn on Sunday."

The Chicago Herald prefaces a report of an address delivered in the Marlowe Opera House, Englewood, on the afternoon of Sunday, Nov. 6, with this paragraph:—

"Rev. A. T. Jones is among the most ardent of the divines who oppose the action of Congress in ordering that the Columbian Exposition be closed on Sundays. He delivered a statesmanlike address on the measure at the Marlowe Opera House, Sixty-third Street and Stewart Avenue, yesterday afternoon. He treated his subject from the standpoint of constitutionality rather than directly from the assertion that the Exposition should be open."

A friend in Sierra Leone, says in a private letter that "the ministers of the various denominations and other gentlemen waited on the governor with a memorial, praying for a better observance of the 'Lord's day,' and more especially to prohibit vessels from landing here on Sunday, or to discharge or load their cargoes." What would be the result of the "praying" to the governor, our correspondent was not able to tell at the time of his writing.

So in far off Africa as well as in this country, the ministers, who above all others should be praying to the Lord for help in the work to which they have been ordained, are "praying the governor." Will so-called Christians ever learn that their strength is in God and not in governors?

The Chronicle, of Bath, England, on November 8, contained a column and a half report of a sermon from a rector of the established church in defense of church establishment. Following this was a full account of the annual meeting of the Bath branch of the Lord's Day Observance Society. Immediately succeeding these two articles, was a notice of an address by J. S. Washburn, delivered in the same public Assembly Rooms where the meeting of the Lord's Day Observance Society was held, on the Book of Daniel, in which the point "especially emphasized was this, that religion always does best when let alone by the civil law."

THE Board of Control of the Art Student's League, of New York, has brought up the latest phase of the Sunday question, by its proposition to throw open its studios and schools for the study of the nude on Sunday. The expressed intention of the League to give opportunity for its students to avail themselves of instruction seven days in the week, met with some opposition, but that Sunday should be especially devoted to the nude seems to have horrified many more. Why artistic nakedness should be horrifying on Sunday and quite sethetic on Monday is a question which only the artistically conscientious can solve.

THE Home Missionary in its issue for November makes an earnest plea for the extension of the circulation of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL. Among other things it says: "We are confident that those who have read the stirring articles in recent numbers of THE SENTINEL can not feel indifferent in regard to this matter, or rest content, until its subscription list has been increased by many thousands. Let every one now decide to do what he can for THE SENTINEL. Why should not this work grow until from individual subscriptions and clubs taken, there should be a demand for a regular weekly edition equaling that of the recent 'special' of September 22, a round 250,000?"

THE Sun's London letter, of November 12, contains this paragraph:—

The liberalism of the times has given rise to a new semi-religious institution known as Museum Sunday. The object is to secure, through church influence, the opening of museums and picture galleries on Sunday. The movement was advocated in many churches on last Sunday.

Are not the religious associations for the Sunday opening of museums and of the World's Fair, and the religious associations for their Sunday closing antagonistic to each other? Can a house divided against itself stand? How long will it be before these opposing forces will unite for the prosecution of seventh-day keepers only and let all others go scot-free?

THE "Pearl of Days" gives the latest baseball news as follows:—

Playing baseball on Sunday is a violation of the Nebraska law. The Supreme Court of Nebraska so decided November 11, in the case of the State against O'Rourke, a case originating in the arrest last year of the Lincoln baseball team while engaged in playing a game on Sunday at Lincoln Park. The players were not fined by the County Judge. The County Attorney filed exceptions and carried the case to the Supreme Court for an interpretation of the law, so that future controversies might be avoided in regard to the legality of playing baseball on Sunday. The court yesterday sustained the exceptions. The syllabus of Chief Justice Maxwell is as follows:—

"Under the provisions of section 241 of the criminal code, any person of fourteen years of age or upwards who shall on Sunday engage in sporting, etc., shall be fined in a sum of not exceeding twenty dollars or to be confined in the county jail not exceeding twenty days, or both.

"Playing baseball on Sunday comes within the definition of sporting and renders the person engaging therein liable to the punishment provided for in section 241."

There are a considerable number of young men in Lincoln, Nebraska, who know that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," and who faithfully observe it, to whom this decision will be of interest.

A GENTLEMAN from South Carolina, a lawyer, who has been reading literature on religious liberty put forth by the Association, writes the following:—

Dear Sir: I have perused with a great deal of pleasure and profit Mr. Jones' pamphlet upon the subject of religious liberty, and pronounce it a work of decided merit. His position is strong and tenable, and can not be gainsaid or controverted by the enemies of religious liberty. The great light and luminary in political and philosophic thought, Edmund Burke, has said that no man has a right to anything that is not reasonable. That is a great and fundamental verity, upon which all human systems are built, and out of which many great and important truths may be evolved.

Human systems and laws are the creatures of human rights. When mankind entered into the covenant and compact of civil government, they agreed to surrender everything that was unreasonable and nothing that was reasonable. If man had not covenanted and agreed to surrender those things that were unreasonable, his liberty would have been his greatest tyrant. He could have had no assurance that those things which he would preserve, cherish, and transmit would be protected. Religious liberty is a natural right, and government was intended to be a rock of safety and security to natural and reasonable rights. We live under two governments in this world, the moral and the civil. The civil is intended to check, restrain and punish any and every member of society who offends against the rights of his fellow-man. The moral is intended to direct, guide, and govern us in those things which belong exclusively, unreservedly, and absolutely to the individual. Conscience is the seat of the moral government, and whenever any earthly power or potentate undertakes to dictate to mankind in matters of conscience, it becomes a usurper; it dethrones and dislodges the rightful sovereign.

The union of Church and State is one of the most gigantic frauds and impositions that was ever practiced upon mankind, and it is responsible for some of the darkest and most diabolical crimes that have ever stained and stigmatized the history of the Old World. It was the union of Church and State that sent Cranmer, and Latimer, and Ridley to the stake. It was the union of State and religion that compelled Socrates to drink the poisonous hemlock.

Mr. Edwards is quoted as saying that he would not tolerate an atheist. Where did Mr. Edwards get his right to be intolerant of other people's opinions? I think the reverend gentlemen would do well to tone and temper his zeal with a little sound and wholesome reflection. Where did Mr. Edwards get his right to believe in a God? Was it the gift and grant of any earthly power? If so, that power is the keeper and custodian of conscience.

If the secular power can say that I shall believe in a God, then it follows as a legal and logical sequence that it can say that I shall not believe in a God, or any of the great and fundamental doctrines of Christianity. It is time that there should be a better understanding between the governed and the government. It is time that rulers and law-givers should learn that human systems are but the evidences of human rights, and that civil and religious liberty are the greatest and most important of human rights, and that government was made to protect and not trample upon them.

Do you know what the Sunday law of your State is? If not No. 42 of the "Sentinel Library" will tell you, and also give you the principal court decisions under it. Everybody ought to have this pamphlet. Price twenty cents.
