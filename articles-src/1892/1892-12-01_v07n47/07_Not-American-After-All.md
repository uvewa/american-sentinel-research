# Not American After All.

Northumberland, Pa.

NOTWITHSTANDING all that has been said about the "American Sabbath," the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has repudiated the qualifying word, and if considered the labels of this organization one hereafter use only the term, "the Sabbath," to denote the first day of the week regarded as sacred to rest and devotion.

This action, which was taken at the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Convention in Denver, October 28 to November 2, was one of particular interest. It was under discussion which related to the retention of the word "American" as a qualifier for the word "Sabbath" used as relating to the saloon; for the enfranchisement of women; and the observance of the "American Sabbath." The official record says:---

After some more discussion it was put to a vote. If the Sabbath we now are Jews and Seventh-day Baptists. If it be true that we ought not to claim the Sabbath, every if we do not call it the Christian Sabbath, it must and somebody else's Sabbath.

The question was then put on the motion and carried, and any further changes that may be made in any resolution or resolutions relative to the Sunday closing of the World's Work, was first. Miss Gordon moved that in the preamble the words, "Lord's day" be changed to the "Sabbath." Again we quote from the official minutes---

Mr. Nabcock moved to amend the resolution by striking from the report the word "American" before the word "Sabbath." . . .

She said that it was not the privilege, of the keepers of Friday or of Sabbath who observe their views with the same freedom. If they can consistently, why cannot we of Jews that they are right, and that all ought to observe Friday, or that Sabbathkeepers are right and Christendom wrong for the Jews or the Christian the right of changing the day as Advanced by Jews.

To see the Bible in the rules for all, or of individual, be and yet to see man is only right in so far as his conclusions agree with it (if it could be done), or to serve God consistently, in obedience to his commandments, is the province of human government to legislate to compel man to be religious. To remember as man is not to answer to the government, but to yet God alone for his religious belief and practice.
