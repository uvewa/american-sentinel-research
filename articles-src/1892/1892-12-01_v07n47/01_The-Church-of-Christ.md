# The Church of Christ.

IN the Scriptures the Christians relationship to Christ is described under the symbol of the marriage tie: "Ye are members [that is] of the body of Christ. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the Church." Eph. 5:22-32.

In accordance with this idea, the Church of Christ is represented in the Scriptures as the purest and fairest of women, leaning upon the arm of her beloved, drawn to him with the drawings of his love; her only thought being of her companion, to be the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely, whose banner over her is love, and who would present her to himself "a glorious church not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish." Such is the Church to Christ; such is Christ to his Church; and such is the relationship between Christ and his Church.

To such a church as this Christ committed his gospel to be by her made known to every creature. It is only such a church as this that can make known the gospel of Christ. That "grace" is the "power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." Rom. 1:16. No one can make known that power who does not know that power for himself and in himself. And the Church could make known the power of God only by knowing the power in and for herself. And that power being known only by faith, in the nature of things it is only by abiding faithful to her Lord that the Church could fulfil the work of the gospel.

AGAIN: The gospel is Christ in men the hope of glory. Col. 1:27. This is what the Church of Christ is to make known to men. No one can make Christ known to men who for himself does not know Christ in himself. It pleased God "to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him." Gal. 1:16. But Christ is made known in men only by faith: "That Christ may dwell in your hearts *by faith.*" Eph. 3:17. It was, therefore, that the only way in which the Church can make known Christ is man's the hope of glory, is to have to know, and love, Christ revealed in herself; and as this is only known by faith it is evident that it is only by abiding faithful to Christ that she can know Christ in herself or make him known in men.

ONCE MORE: In the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed; and the righteousness of God only. And it is the righteousness of God only which the Church of God is to know, and which she is to make known to all the world. This is the righteousness known only by faith, and revealed only by faith. "Therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith." "Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe." Rom. 1:17, and 3:22. As, therefore, this righteousness is known only by faith, and is revealed only by faith, it is plain that it is only by abiding steadfast in faithfulness to Christ that the Church can know or make known the righteousness of God which is revealed in the gospel. And the sum of all these points, and of many more that might be given, is simply the demonstration over and over that it is only by abiding wholly in Christ, by trusting in him entirely, by depending upon him completely, by perfect faithfulness to him, that the Church can be what she must be in order to do what she is established to do.

SUCH was the Church of Christ in the beginning. Such is always the Church of Christ. But another set of facts has also been the professed Church of Christ. For there has been an apostasy from Christ and from the true Church of Christ. In the apostles' days the warning was given, "Of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples." Acts 20:30. And this apostasy was to come "a falling away first, and that man of sin" was to be "revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that as God he sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. . . . For the mystery of iniquity doth already work." 2 Thess. 2:3-7.

That Lord exalted his Church, and clothed her with the beautiful garments of salvation and righteousness, and the power of godliness, before the eyes of all the nations. He made her exceeding beautiful, and she prospered, and her renown went forth in all the world for her beauty; for it was perfect through His comeliness that he had put upon her.
