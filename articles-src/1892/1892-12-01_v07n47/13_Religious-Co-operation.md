# Religious Co-operation.

NEW YORK, DECEMBER 1, 1892.

ANY one receiving THE AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

---

THE article on another page, "Religious Co-operation," deals with this question. It is to every American citizen the exposure of a wishy-washy sentimentalism that substitutes a sentiment for a principle and then submits to be ruled by it as with a rod of iron.

---

THERE may appear at first sight to be a paradoxical, but it is nevertheless true relation. For instance, the settlement in favor of the so-called church union that was or soon should be, as it is alternated as Romanceand the combination or as the other that it did full just, yet as Mr. Moorey shows, effects are ruled by it.---

These are not the righteousness of their cause. There are many people who do not agree with them, or principles of those who do not agree with them, upon anything, except upon this one important, certain stand. But as do not favor amalgamation of the country, or totally without the sphere of civil jurisdiction.

To say that the majority of intelligent men in these United States do not know this would be an insult to their intelligence. If they do not express themselves when called to express their opinion, it will be because of a truckling to a time serving policy which it would be a compliment to call moral cowardice.

THE *Mail and Express* is alarmed lest Mr. Cleveland should welcome to Washington a Papal Nuncio. Under date of November 17, it said:---

> It is reported in the newspapers that at the request of the reception given to Mr. Cleveland after the election, a Roman Catholic Bishop hailed a special dispatch from Rome saying that the Vatican will open negotiations for the establishment of a regular United States nuncio, and the reception at Washington of a Papal Nuncio.

The *Examiner* believes the union of Church and State, and that the Norwegian Pontiff of the Sweden, under the joint control of the kingdoms throughout the whole world, and those of them can made in the United States are working as rapidly as possible for that result.

The envoy now sitting in the white marble palace in Nashua Avenue is supposed to arrange for the negotiations of a Jesuit Commissioner to the the World's Columbian Exposition; and never before again, for an appointment for the Roman bishops to the Columbian Exposition; and for another Cardinal, for the representation of the Roman Church and the papal authority at the schools of the country, and generally for all of the things which will mean the ascendency of the Roman power in all departments of our Government.

To it seems very improbable that the manifold, religious sentimentalism of the times threatens a union, not only of Protestants, but of Protestantism and Catholicism, quite as destructive both to vital piety and to liberty of conscience to it as was the union which culminated in the Roman Papacy.

SPACE is given in another column to an article from the Chicago *Tribune* in reference to the organized effort now being made to secure the repeal of the Sunday closing provision attached to the World's Fair appropriation bill. It is already evident that this movement will receive large support. It is very important that it should receive support. But it is the highest trappings they make that those who throw their influence in its favor should do so intelligently and from proper motives. A compromise usually confirms the weakness and the timidness of both extremes of which it is the mean. It would be in in this case. No unprincipled compromise, certainly no act should be demanded. Nothing less can consistently be asked. The position should also be consulted in each extreme case to show a full realization that the congressional legislation upon this subject is unconstitutional. There should also be no reserve in stating the fact, that whatever evil precedent may be cited to the contrary, this, as well as all other religious questions, is totally without the sphere of civil jurisdiction.

To say that the majority of intelligent men in these United States do not know this would be an insult to their intelligence. If they do not express themselves when called to express their opinion, it will be because of a truckling to a time serving policy which it would be a compliment to call moral cowardice.

FRANK RUSSELL, D. D., Field Secretary of the Evangelical Alliance, has an article in the *Christian at Work* of November 19, entitled, "The Church and the Community," in which he asks, "What is the Church?" and answers his question in these words:---

> The Church of Christ is all the members of his Church who constitute the Church in its relation to the Church and all for which the Church stands as a redemptive force.

View this in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court that this is a Christian Nation, together with the declarations and "organic utterances" upon which it was made, is based, and who can say that we have already in this country a union of Church and State in every particular.

The Supreme Court of Nebraska has declared that baseball and other games, including races and other amusements of a class falling under the general name of sports, can not be indulged in on Sunday.

---

As sensible people jealous of their liberty and desiring to preserve the same, the State has no more right to say that its inhabitants shall be Christians, or that they must cherish in particular the Christian religion and the binding force of the Bible, than it has to say that they must all be Methodists, or Presbyterians or the like.---*Justice Maxwell on the 11th inst.*

> It is remarkable, says the *Signs of the Times*, "that in a Nation which is not a 'nation of Christ's Church, State, and nation,' are not to be accounted as guilty of sin of intolerance, should adopt exactly the same position in the form of Sunday laws, which have been the chief instruments of violation of State rights that should prevail."

And the question under consideration concerns the Sunday laws. But what happens then to that appeal by Mr. Cleveland? Congress must see that the State is protected from such officious interference, and, that its own answers shall not be allowed to break down those barriers.

---

So in order to carry out their propositions to close the Fair on Sunday, it must be insisted, that Congress shall nullify a portion of the most the most invulnerable of Sabbath rights. The Constitution of Illinois, which provides more explicitly protect the State of Illinois in all the rights of religious worship and conscience overridden, and its police regulations of the State destroyed, by Act of Congress. But the Constitution which protects Illinois, Congress must ruling, with the police regulations of the State, also protects.
