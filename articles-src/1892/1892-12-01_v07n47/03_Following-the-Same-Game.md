# Following the Same Game.

To apply or the decisions of the United States courts, government, and in the face of the present condition of things the churches are drifting into the course of the original apostate church. It may be that the churches have drifted into the course of the original apostate church in this respect. The progress in this way has been most rapid. We might here give representative facts showing the progress of this most alarming tendency. It has developed slowly along the way; but what is the use of it when every phase of this religio-political movement is year before the eyes of all the nation? Not to review briefly, we need only to say the principal Protestant churches of the United States have boasted of the greatest achievement that---supposedly and essentially---by pulpit, platform, and press---they have succeeded in securing the enforcement of the observance of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath upon the Government of the United States. But what have they done to recover this lost ground? They have not made even the first attempt to dissociate from her original sin, but, instead of this, one consistent phase of the churches' effort has been to bind themselves still more firmly to the State, and get from the State further and further recognition of religion.
