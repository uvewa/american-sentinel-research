# The Only Proper Sunday Law.

LAST week we published an article from the *Christian Statesman* in which it was claimed that---

Sunday laws are not at all religious. They have nothing to do with religion. They merely fix one day of rest, and secondly, to prevent persons or work from interfering with the rest of others.

It seems strange that men will deny the religious character of Sunday laws, in the face of the facts of judicial opinion and of history to the contrary. Two weeks ago we published an article giving some of these decisions, and since they might have been given. In his excellent little work, "The Sabbath Question," Mr. Slingsby, of the Law Department of the University of Pennsylvania, after quoting decisions maintaining five propositions, says:---

1. Sunday is a holy day.

2. That Sunday is to be recognized as a religious institution.

3. That Christianity being recognized in this law, no man dare to openly attack it.

4. That the Sunday laws command this rest as a religious and not a mere civil institution.

These propositions are not statements of Mr. Slingsby's convictions of truth, but are a summary of what the courts of this country have decided to be the law on the subject. They are the judicial conclusions of the courts. If these courts have decided and concluded that Sunday is a civil institution only that is true then a certain class of religious institutions established by civil law. Any other religious institution might be made equally a civil institution by the simple process of entrenching it in the civil law. It is vain to deny a thing in the face of the facts.

Another point in the *Statesman* article which demands further notice is the proposition that---

> Those who consistently and really observe any other day as a Sabbath, or day of rest, and worship, and who conduct their secular affairs on that day in such a way and at such a place as not to disturb others, should be exempt from all penalties.

This very thing marks Sunday laws as religious. The proposition is to exempt them from their provisions "conscientious observers of another day." Why not simply observers of another day? Evidently because the purpose of the law is not a religious observance. Were this not the case, in fairness every man be permitted to choose his own rest day; and every employer who consistently gives his employes one rest day out of each week, and compelling employes to give their employes one day of each week, would fully meet the demands of nature for a day of rest. But it is a religious service which the law requires, and to possess it became only a wish to yield this on another day are exempted from observing, at least the outward form, of the prescribed religious observance.

The only proper Sunday law would be such a one as would protect not only the native population of this country but the entire population of the country against enforced observance of any religious institution.
