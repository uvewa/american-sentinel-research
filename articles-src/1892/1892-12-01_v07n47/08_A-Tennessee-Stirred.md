# A Tennessee Stirred.

THE following letter sent us by a friend in Tennessee to whom it was addressed, shows that there is a real live, energetic battle against persecution for conscience' sake. After our effort connected with two or two insurrections at the same time.

MASONS, TENN., Nov. 6, 1892.

*My dear friends:* My ticket to Paris was not used for this reason. Two weeks ago the court had to show men in Paris, Tenn. A Christ man come before it just about 2 miles west of town. He was a nice looking farmer showing the ears of a little coin, a big man was stopping him at the city limits and a big negro trying to crush out a little one through the Sunday law. On last Tuesday King came to town in his buggy and hitched his horse at Foster. For shame.

The constable came to King, but just before he came, King had said to several persons that 'I am ready to be tried for working on Sunday.' The constable drove him to Foster. For shame!

But not a word was said to King; just before he made his speech he had already declared himself not guilty. The constable could have made their speech any time. Their speech had been their own defeat. The orthodox church counts this a disgrace to their cause. Now think of it. I did receive to preach in that town on Sunday. A petition to a priest to Governor Buchanan asking him to interject in these cases, in this petition, and could get about 500 names to it of white people. A very good petition that the Sunday laws be repealed by the Legislature of Tennessee. I could get a lot of petitions to the state Legislature to repeal the Sunday law. These are many people for and against it. The question is would we benefit by asking the Legislature to repeal the Sunday law for Sunday or any other day. To ask in a seasonably limited fashion is a thing, to be in a too eagerly too long, and too soon.

Let us get the Governor with petitions until the Legislature meets and can pass upon it, and from the Legislature with the petition to repeal it; it is simply a question of our constitutional rights and a matter of our liberties.

The writer of this letter is entirely wrong in one respect. He says: "You all know that Mon. North and the others have been indicted again, and will have their sentences some time since; but let it go on. We are being driven to the wall: they are again under indictments, together with also its foremost leaders in this section of the same church. That the whole body of God's church could be so treated as it is now, is not the fault of its instigators. God has led them by the enemy, and God has led him, in is supposing that the result of the Sunday persecution will be from natural causes, though it is very probably that the situation is considerably aggravated by the things which are a result of the doings of its instigators. Had the writer of the foregoing letter said that the King was frustrated in
