# Patron Letters.

IT was a notice of an address by J. J. Wachtburn, delivered in the same public Armory Rooms where the meeting of the Lord's Day Observance Society was held, on the Book of Daniel, in which the point "especially emphasized was this, that religion always takes a back seat in every great crisis in any reform."

THE Board of Control of the Art Students' League, of New York, has brought up the latest demand for Sunday opening, by proposing to throw open its studios and schools for the study of art on Sunday. The resolution of the League to give opportunity for its members to avail themselves of instruction during the week, met with some opposition, but that Sunday should be especially devoted to the male-rooms to have been by the majors. Why artists asked permission should be horrifying on Sunday and questionable on other days. Whether the exhibition on Sunday is a question which only the artistic and educated...

THE *Home Missionary* in its issue for November makes an earnest plea for the extension of the circulation of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and says: "all who have read the stirring articles in recent numbers of this work will be of one mind with respect to this matter, or rest content, until its influence in the land has been increased to many a thousand. Let every one now devote to do what he can for THE SENTINEL. Why should not this work grow until from individual subscriptions and club value, there should be a demand for a regular weekly edition equaling that of the recent special of September 15, a round 150,000?"

THE Don's London letter, of November 12, one paragraph says:

The liberalism of the times has given rise to a strong agitation for opening public museums on Sunday. The object is to secure, through church influence, a certain measure of recreation and culture for the poorer classes, such as already is afforded in many churches on last Sunday.

There was some contention at to the opening of museums and of the World's Fair, and for exactly the same reason. What a strange company these so-called reformers are! How antagonistic to each other! Can a house divided against itself stand? On one hand are those opposing forces will unite for the prosecution of arresting the keepers and let all others go in scot free?

THE "Pearl of Days" gives the latest baseball news as follows:

Playing baseball on Sunday is a violation of the Nebraska law. The Supreme Court of Nebraska has handed down a decision in the case of O'Rourke, a case originating in the arrest of Patrick Hays of Omaha for playing baseball on Sunday. It was the first Sunday violation case that had risen in the Supreme Court in Nebraska. The players were not fined by the County Court. On appeal to the Supreme Court the lower court was sustained. The decision is a clear presentation of the law, so that future controversies regarding the legal results of playing baseball on Sunday will not rise.

Under the provisions of section 84 of the criminal code, any person of fourteen years or upwards, who shall be found on Sunday, sporting, etc., shall be fined in a sum of not exceeding twenty dollars and costs, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding twenty days, or both. Providing, that persons who are members of a religious society by whom any other day than the first day of the week is observed, as the Sabbath, and the day is regularly kept by them as such, the persons so doing shall be liable to the punishment provided for Sunday sports.

There is a considerable number of young men in Lincoln, Nebraska, who know that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord;" and who halt, fully observe it, to whom this decision will be of interest.
