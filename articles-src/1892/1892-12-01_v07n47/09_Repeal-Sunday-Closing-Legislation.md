The World's Fair Sunday Opening Association is actively engaged in securing the expression of the will of the people on the question of repealing the act of Congress closing the Exposition Sunday. Mr. Thompson, Secretary of the organization, who returned from a trip to the Eastern cities this week, says that the sentiment of the people of that section on the question of repealing the act is quite as strong as it is in Chicago. This is true of Boston, New York, Washington, and Philadelphia.

George W. Childs, the philanthropist, expressed himself as strongly in favor of having the Exposition at Chicago open Sunday. Mr. Childs was of the opinion that the Philadelphia Exposition being closed Sunday was a mistake that should not be repeated in Chicago. Other public men of Philadelphia are ardently in favor of repealing the act closing the Fair.

Petitions for an open Fair Sunday will be showered upon Congress to a greater extent than that body has ever before known. These petitions will come from every State and city in the Union. They will come from ministers, bankers, clubs, hotel keepers, and labor organizations. One unique feature of the work being done by the association is an effort to gauge public sentiment on the question. Postal cards have been sent to a certain number of men from "Dun's Reference Book" without discrimination or selection. So many to every city of the United States of the population of not less than 4,000 or more than 10,000 inhabitants. These cards were mailed with a circular asking for immediate response. Nothing whatever was given to prejudice the vote. The result was encouraging. From the first 1,000 sent out the answers indicate that four out of every five persons in the United States desire a repeal of the Sunday closing act. The special committee under whose auspices these cards were sent out—composed of James A. Sexton, Mayor Washburne, the Rev. Dr. Thomas, and James W. Scott—will certify as to the returns.

## LABOR UNIONS WILL ASSIST.

The labor organizations of the city will supplement the work by complete and effective work. Mr. Morgan of the Trade and Labor Assembly, in connection with a number of other labor leaders, will spare no means to secure petitions from every organization in the country. In addition to these, resolutions will be passed and sent to the congressmen and senators.

It is expected that the municipal government will take decisive action upon the question, inasmuch as the Exposition is given under the direct auspices of the city, and further, that hundreds of thousands of visitors from foreign nations and sister cities will be depending upon the hospitality of Chicago. Further, the Exposition being closed Sundays these people will be compelled to drift aimlessly in the streets, or fall victims to the inevitable evils of a large and overcrowded city. Chicago's reputation for hospitality will be at stake in this matter, and consequently this feature is of great importance.

No active campaign will be made by the Exposition to induce Congress to repeal the act, although it is well known that a bill for that purpose will be introduced. They will give their moral support to the association, and aid it in any way consistent with their position in having accepted the appropriation with the condition of Sunday closing. Colonel Thompson gives assurance that there is little fear of the result being favorable to the Sunday opening cause. After December 1st he will make his headquarters in Washington at Willard's.

Persons who sympathize with the objects of this association can obtain from the secretary of the association at No. 160 Adams Street, pamphlets and printed matter in relation to the same. All inquiries upon the subject will be promptly answered, and every assistance rendered in bringing about co-operation in various parts of the country.—Chicago Tribune.
