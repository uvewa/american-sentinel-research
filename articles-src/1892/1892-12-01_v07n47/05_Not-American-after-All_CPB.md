NOTWITHSTANDING all that has been said about the "American Sabbath," the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has repudiated the qualifying word, and if consistent the ladies of that organization will hereafter use only the term, "the Sabbath," to describe the day which they regard as sacred to rest and devotion. This action, which was taken at the Woman's Christian Temperance Union Convention in Denver, October 28 to November 2, was on this wise: A resolution was under discussion which declared "for the protection of the home against the saloon; for the enfranchisement of woman, and for the preservation of our American Sabbath." The official record tells the story thus:—

Mrs. Babcock moved to amend the resolution by substituting the word "the" for "our American" before the word "Sabbath."

A member opposed the striking out of the word "American" on the ground that this is an American Women's Christian Temperance Union, while Mrs. Babcock supported her motion, saying, "The Sabbath is not a national but a divine institution. It was given at the creation of the world, not for one nation, but for all people and for all time. We have in our membership in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union those of all nations and of all religious beliefs."

Mrs. Sickles spoke to the point, that this word "American" affords a contrast to the kind of Sabbath that is kept all through the heathen world, and for that reason she opposed the amendment.

Dr. Anna Shaw said: "I am in favor of the amendment. If the Sabbath was ours and American only, I should see nothing especially sacred in it. It is not ours, neither is it American, and I think we ought not to claim the Sabbath, even if we do try to claim the world as American. We ought not to make a distinction between our Sabbath and somebody else's Sabbath."

The amendment was put to the house and carried, and no further changes offered until the convention reached the resolution relative to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, when Miss Pugh moved that in its preamble the words, "Lord's day" be changed to "Sunday."

Again we quote from the official minutes:—

A member thought that if a change were made at all, it should be to the "Sabbath," because Sunday is a name which comes to us from the heathen world.

Miss Pugh explained that the Sabbath is the seventh day in the week. Every day is the Lord's day. Sunday is the day which has been specially set apart.

It was stated by different members that there is Bible authority for calling it the Lord's day and also the Sabbath.

Mrs. Campbell said: "I sincerely hope that this change will not be made. We have people in Wisconsin who will think it is Saturday if it is changed to the Sabbath."

The motion to change from "Sunday" to "Sabbath" was lost, while that to change the "Lord's day" to "Sabbath" was carried.

Of course there was no consistency in this action. Sunday is not the Sabbath; and while not officially admitted by the body, was, in this discussion, repeatedly brought home to the attention of the convention by the admissions to that effect made by several of the members. It is an unwelcome truth that Sunday is only a counterfeit, and a usurper, but it is being rapidly brought to the attention of the people so that in supporting it and denying the Sabbath of the Lord, they are without excuse. God has not left himself without witnesses.
