# The Church at Rome.

PRE-EMINENT in both phases of this career is the church at Rome. She was pre-eminent in faith, inasmuch that her faith "was spoken of throughout the whole world." Rom. 1:8. She was also pre-eminent in apostasy, inasmuch that in this likeness has been spoken of throughout all the whole world, and of her spiritual training was said:---

Seven individuals gathered in fellowship from the Church of Christ. And the relationship of the individuals is also described under the symbol of the marriage tie: "Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it." So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church: for we are members of his body. "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one. This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the Church." Eph. 5:22-32.

As she had been so highly exalted and honored by the Lord, and therefore had so much to trust to, when she responsibly dishonored she did become, pre-eminent and monstrous was the apostasy in her apostasy. As she had been pre-eminent in beauty, pre-eminent was the corruption. She had been exalted to heaven in her privileges while abiding in the faith, and the depth of apostasy to which she sank was in proportion to the height of exaltation to her apostasy. As she had been pre-eminent in heart-purity in the condition which the Lord had put upon her, so her pre-eminence was in the ugliness of her own unworthy self-conceited pride of her own position, which was only

## POWER SHE MUST HAVE.

As she was now trusting in her own attraction and her own power of attraction to draw disciples to herself, she was left to her own resources in which to clothe herself. She accommodated herself to this—ways of the enwrapping heathen; she perverted the right way of the Lord, and by various perverse things, she decked her own person in all the finery of the heathen. By such means her adherents multiplied; and yet she was never able to accomplish a serious difficulty; she found it impossible to maintain the same power of attraction to her holding. The chiefest trouble is in this: power was in worship according to her will in the matter of the observance of Sunday as a holy day; when she had set up as the sign of her authority to command the obedience of men. To accomplish this she realized that the want of a power beyond herself, a power other than her own. The power of God was not open to her, for the very fact, in fact, in anything else, for it was the very denial of all those things that the Lord required. It is the very denial of the power of God upon the mind of man. True, the power of God was still for her, from his Son, but this was to it; only through sincere repentance, through humbling herself, and confessing of sin, and separating from her heathen customs and from all iniquity. This she would not do. But power she must have and power she would have, even though it were illegitimate. Having forsaken the heavenly power, she must grasp for earthly power. Having forsaken the arm of the Lord, she must lean on the arm of flesh. Having disconnected herself from the kingdom of heaven, she would now connect herself with the kingdoms of earth. Still trusting in her own beauty and her own bedecking and the hold thereby maintained over her subjects, and holding in her hands the profuse patronage of all her preferments, she could coerce her pernicious advances and form as on the nations. Her sinful, wayward course, through Constantine, in gaining imperial favor and forming an adulterous connection with an earthly lord. The now unholy Church formed an unholy connection with the unholy State. And the very first fruit of it was to compel her subjects to keep her will in Sunday observance; and the second fruit of it was to employ her ecclesiastical authority at her disposal with which to compel conformity to punish all who kept the Sabbath.

## FORMED AN ADULTEROUS UNION.

Thus did she who had been appointed a chaste virgin to Christ, she who had been joined in the bonds of pure and holy love to him who is perfect in purity, in love, in purity; who had known the blissful delight of his first love. She also visited her virgin vows, broke her marriage ties and became a harlot. A devotee, and the very symbol of corruption. Accordingly, the next view that is given of her is as a woman seated upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication; and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. Rev. 17:3-6.

## THE LORD WOULD HAVE HEALED BABYLON.

And though in the course of time she had scattered her professions way to all the heathen, and had induced her hearth-keeping to adopt her faith, and put on Christ's name, even yet the Lord would have healed Babylon. In the Reformation of the sixteenth century, the Lord would have healed Babylon. But she would not. There is no healing in those that refused to be healed. God would have healed Babylon, but she forsook her. But lo! those that had formerly been the disciples of the true Church, instead of remaining faithful to him, followed her evil example, took up her harlotries and joined themselves also to the kings of the earth in her stead. This was with every professed Protestant church, except the Baptist. They never had a chance, from the Reformation to the the founding of the Government of the United States. This Government, by utterly prohibiting to itself anything religious, intended to stand off all opportunity for this same satanic, heathen, Babylonish example of joining itself to the Church, and yet, notwithstanding, then and ever since it was sorely against the will of some.
