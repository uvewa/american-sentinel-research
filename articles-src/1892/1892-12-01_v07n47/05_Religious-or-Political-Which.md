# Religious or Political---Which?

THERE is nothing more inconsistent, and few things more wicked, than this religio-political, this coding, religio-political movement, and this tolerating and persecuting sentiment of enforcement that is a matter of indifference what a man exactly, that is, he does not know exactly what it is, and is ready to embrace any plan that will not fully agree with him.

ANOTHER point of interest in Mr. Moorey's plan of "Religious Co-operation."

Co-operation of given communities through their churches of whatever name, and denomination, for the purpose of expressing of national churches through the medium. In all such cases separation between Church and the Roman Church meets the widest favor. But how that any endorsement of civil power raises the spirit of liberalism of another, placing physical results to these makes such enforcement possible.

This is not a negation of his canvass of the followers of Christ; it is simply a denial that human organizations constitute the true Church, and that they can be safely trusted with organic religion to become an accomplished fact.

The early Christian Church had no bond of union but a common faith; and never was there perfect organic union until it was effected by civil power in the time of Constantine. The history of the Dark Ages chronicles the result. Whether or not organic union shall ever again be effected by any means, it is impossible to

spirit. To have the "insight of genius" is misleading to an ordinary mortal. But intoxication does not prepare for service. Even genius is only spiritual.

What is the world tendency of "which we hope and pray and from which so much is to be gained? What can be the tendency of a world in revolt from God? Who is the ruler of this world? Alas! it is under the dominion of Satan. While heavenly forces strive for the mastery and are increasingly victorious in a well peopled manner, it is a false note, any wonder why we ought to say that it is nothing short of blasphemy to pronounce Christendom the kingdom of our Lord to wait.

God indeed moves through things and the evening draweth nigh; but Satan moves also. He is ever being thwarted but he is never overcome so that he gives up. He roars. His power to do real harm lies in the fact that he fights in the dark and his children of God he does his most deadly work. The evil and the darkness as it is participated in by God's people in the current temptation against the ages is the same as it has been.

All this movement is to be avoided also because it is an attack upon the rights of the individual. I do not stop here to note the impossibility of the reason. Men must not for the reason, however. Those are not the point here, however. Those are not the point, however. The discourse on the subject, which Mr. Hodge sagely says, is "the application of the exact principles, whether in singles or in combination in South Africa. A strange combination of those in power at this time. The difference in principle between combinations of force is this: The question is to be the law in a case in so-called Christendom is this work. There are no republic of men but the right to do what the combined judgment of the Christian rulers tell him to do! The Pope asks no right for any man which the State denies; this for there is a possibility of escape, but for what other Christians' judgment and authority leaves us no choice but in civil obedience to human authority actually---but they shall have their own private judgment, liberty of conscience and self-assertion of a free man.
