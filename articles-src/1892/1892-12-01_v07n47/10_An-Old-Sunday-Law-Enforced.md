# An Old Sunday Law Enforced.

THE *Washington Post* of November 17, has this item of news:---

John Curtis, a respectable-looking negro, was arrested on Sunday for mowing a deacon's lawn in the southeast quarter of the city. He was arraigned upon an old and almost concealed weapon, but the policeman who arrested him was told that John was quietly cutting his grass. The fine of $5 was imposed. The fine was then reduced and John was turned out to mow the lawn. John was fined $4 under the old levy court law for every person working on Sunday.

There is also an old Sunday law in the District of Columbia which provides:

That no person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, and that no person having children, servants or slaves, shall command or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's day (works of necessity and charity always excepted), nor shall any children, servants or slaves, to profane the Lord's day by gaming, fishing or fowling, hunting or unlawful pastimes or recreations; and every person transgressing this act, and being convicted thereof before one or more magistrates, shall forfeit two hundred pounds of tobacco for every offense.

Another old statute inherited by the District from Maryland, has this provision:

That if any person shall hereafter within this Province, blaspheme God, that is curse Him, or shall deny our Saviour, Jesus Christ, to be the Son of God, or shall deny the Holy Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or the Godhead of any of the three Persons, or the Unity of the Godhead, or shall utter any profane words concerning the Holy Trinity, or any of the persons thereof, and shall thereof be convict by verdict, shall for the first offense be bored through the tongue, and fined twenty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor. For the second offense the offender shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B, and the offender shall be stigmatized by burning in the forehead with the letter B, and shall moreover be fined forty pounds sterling to the lord proprietor, to be applied and distributed as aforesaid. And for the third offense, the offender shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy.
