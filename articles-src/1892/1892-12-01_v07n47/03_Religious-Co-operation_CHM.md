THERE is a growing sentiment in favor of the federation of local churches in the work of social reform. This is the meaning of all the quasi-Christian and semi-churchly organizations whose existence and work are due to and demand the sacrifice of Christians. The Evangelical Alliance, Peace Congress, Brotherhood of Christian Unity, Christian League, Civic Centre and many other organizations witness to the truth of this statement. The advocates of church union are neither modest nor hesitating. They have no doubts of the righteousness of their cause. There is to them no question as to the sincerity, honesty or principles of those who do not agree with them. Their verdict against them is given with no uncertain sound. Such as do not favor amalgamation are schismatics, sectarians, heretics.

The objects set before Christians to be secured in co-operative effort are:—

1. "The crossing of denominational lines."
2. The evolution of the great sociological problems of our times.
3. "Co-operation with the real tendency of the world." (Carlyle calls this the insight of genius.)
4. To reunite the dismembered fragments of the church of Christ, i. e., secure universal organic church union.
5. The elimination of doctrine as vital to the Christian life. Removal of such creed statements or doctrinal beliefs as are objectionable to any.

It may not be inopportune to point out the weaknesses in this scheme.

I. It is well to remember that all attempts to realise organically the universal church ideas has led to the introduction of the grossest form of error: Co-operation of churches in a given community under a single head. Co-operation of given communities through their single heads in a nation gives a national church. Co-operation of national churches through their heads is Roman Catholicism. And the State Church and the Roman Church mean the wildest forms of error enforced by the strong arm of the civil power unless the spirit of liberalism or of atheistic philosophy creates a public opinion which makes such enforcement impossible. For one thousand years Christianity has been struggling to remove this Nessus shirt from the body, and just when she thinks herself free, it is slipped on again by the foremost leaders in Christian activity. Let it not be so. When once the limiting, cramping idea of a single universal organic church has lost its emasculating power never allow it to again assert itself.

II. We ought to beware of the world spirit. To have the "insight of genius" is intoxicating to an ordinary mortal. But intoxication does not prepare for service even though it be only spiritual. What is the "world tendency" of which we hear so much and from which so much is to be gained? What can be the tendency of a world in revolt from God? Who is the ruler of this world? Alas! it has not yet passed from under the control of Satan. While heavenly forces strive for the mastery and are increasingly victorious he is a wild prophet indeed, a false seer, who would dare to say that the kingdoms of this world have become sufficiently the kingdoms of our Lord to warrant his followers rendering them obedience. God indeed moves through the ages, ruling and over-ruling, but Satan moves also. He is ever being thwarted but he is ever deceiving men to their ruin. His power to do real harm lies along this line. When he leads astray the children of God he does his most deadly work. The world tendency so far as participated in by God's people is the most terrible apostasy the ages have seen.

III. This movement is to be avoided also because it is an attack upon the rights of the individual. I do not stop here to note the impossibility of its success. Men are never improved in the mass. That is not the point here, however. The doctrine of co-operation, as a celebrated evangelist says, is "the application of the trust principle in religious work." The difference in principle between combinations of labor is infinitisimal. So, then, trades unionism is to be the law in all successful Christian work. There are no rights of man but the right to do what the combined judgment of his Christian rulers tell him to do! The Pope asks no more. Superstition can do better than this for there is a possibility of escape, but when the highest Christian judgment and authority leaves us no choice but implicit obedience to human authority acting for God, human rights, the right of private judgment, liberty of conscience which Christ came to give men, has passed away.—C. H. Moscrip, in Central Baptist.
