# Repeat Sunday Closing Legislation.

THE World's Fair Sunday Opening Association, which was organized looking to the expression of the will of the people on the question of repealing the Act of Congress closing the Exposition Sunday. Mr. Thompson, Secretary of the organization, who returned from a trip to the Eastern cities this week, says that the question of repealing the act is quite actively canvassed in the cities of the territory of Boston, New York, Washington, and the Eastern seaboard.

The Knights of Labor Assembly, in connection with many local organizations, is exerting its spare no means to secure petitions from every local organization to them.
