# Editorial Notes.

"LET the Pittsburg Sabbath Reform Convention (March 9) sound United Presbyteria(n) Churches be largely attended."

"Let every community be educated out of the popular fallacism about this Bandist paper, by numerous sermons and public meetings and led by thoroughly distributed, through the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, or by the Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor, of documents for and concerning the Sabbath."

PENNSYLVANIA is indeed to it; it is in danger of repealing the past errors of Judicial and Editorial precedent and establishing them upon its statute books beyond the reach of easy correction.

The ability of National Reformers to make a discrimination without any material difference, is well marked as is expressed by the "H. H. Article of Chicago." "Church and State were divorced in America that Christianity and the Nation might be married." Comment: Marriage between a body, or holy politic, the whole body of politic body,—the re on the organization of a country —"the body of inhabitants of a country." united under one independent government. . . .

According to Mr. Artil's own statement, therefore, the State was divorced from the individual Church in order that it might be to be married to the entire family, under the family name of Christianity, it can add however much. This resembles very much the spiritual adultery against which the Bible incensably, it to terms of such terrible denunciation.

The enforcement of civil Sunday laws seems same judicial and municipal decisions that Sunday, the first day of the week, is not the Sabbath. According to the *Boston Governed* the people of Sharon, Massachusetts, have realized this fact and acted upon it.

At the town meeting in Sharon the much-discussed question of whether Sunday or Saturday is the proper term to use, was decided, and the matter is on. Even Dr. Ralph A. Another felt this morning, hunting and fishing on the Sabbath was made, and the question of its title then became material; it should be substituted for Sabbath. This caused a heated discussion of merely an hour, in which the question was thoroughly threshed out. By a small majority and the word Sabbath was changed to Sunday, and the motion as amended was carried.

It is certain that this question is no longer in doubt; but how many, though knowing the right, will choose the wrong, and endeavor by the same evil Sunday laws "likely so-called," to enforce upon others the acceptance of the error.

"AMERICAN State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation." Mr. William Addison Blakely, of the University of Michigan, has compiled an exceed-ingly interesting and valuable book, bearing upon questions just now well to the front. It is a com-plete epitome of legislative and executive action, and judicial decisions upon the Sunday question in the United States. It sets forth what the author calls "the more prominent incidents in the separation of religion from the State—absolute freedom of all in religious profession—and such." Agitators of the present day will take note of the fact that they are threading over old stires that have been tramped and failed during the century past. Mr. Blakely begins with the beginning of the Republic and traces his history clearly and conclusively to all the prominent discussion. Good people have always differed upon the question of legal enactment for Sunday observance and the union of Church and State. But as in the beginning it was thought wise to make an absolute division between the Church and the civil government, so the result in its outcome tends to each union. The volume is one of great value, and it must careful compilation of facts bearing upon the subject.—*Chicago Inter-Ocean.*
