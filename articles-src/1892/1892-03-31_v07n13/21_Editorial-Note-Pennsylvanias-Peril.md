UNDER the title, "Pennsylvania's Peril," the Christian Statesman says, "Through one of the newsdealers we learn that $50,000 has been raised which will be increased to $100,000, to carry the appeal of the Sunday papers of Pittsburg, first to the Supreme Court and then to the Legislature. There is not the shadow of a chance that Judge Porter's decision that Sunday papers are a 'convenience,' not a 'necessity,' will be reversed by the Supreme Court, which has invariably sustained the Sabbath laws. But the Legislature, which is even now being selected, is not so sure to be right. What can friends of the Sabbath do to prevent the Sabbath law from being nullified by unjust 'special legislation' in the interests of newspaper proprietors and their readers?:

1. Let the right men be selected for the Legislature, and, to avoid any doubt, let them be pledged before election to defend the law.

"2. Let the Pittsburg Sabbath Reform Convention (March 29, Second United Presbyterian Church) be largely attended.

"3. Let every community be educated out of the popular fallacies about the Sunday paper, by numerous sermons and public meetings, and by a thorough distribution, through the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, or by the Young Peoples' Society of Christian Endeavor, of documents for non-church goers."

Pennsylvania is indeed in peril; it is in danger of repeating its past errors of judicial and legislative precedent and establishing them upon its statute books beyond the reach of any appeal.
