Bigotry and intolerance, intrenched in iniquitous laws, may shout, "anarchy," and talk loftily about the sacredness of law, and the duty to obey magistrates, but inalienable right justifies resistance when laws trespass upon the sacred domain of conscience, or exact recognition of those things which in their very nature and design are outside the jurisdiction of human government.
