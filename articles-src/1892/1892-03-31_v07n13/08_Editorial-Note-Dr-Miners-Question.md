According to the Christian Statesman, Rev. Dr. A. A. Miner asks this question concerning the Sunday newspaper:—

Why must we know on Sunday morning that such and such middle-weight whipped another?

The Sentinel gives it up. The Doctor's "we," like the editorial "we," must be plural only in form, at least it does not include all readers of Sunday newspapers. It may be necessary for Dr. Miner to read the sporting news in the Sunday paper, but it is not necessary for everybody to do so. "Rude fellows of the baser sort" can of course find some things adapted to their taste in the average Sunday paper, but others will pass such things by. Only those who wish to will read the sporting column. Indeed, reading the Sunday paper at all is only a matter of choice. Nobody is compelled either to buy or to read it. If the Doctor would only curb his own curiosity until Monday morning his difficulty with the Sunday paper would end at once.

But if Doctor Miner means to ask why anybody wants the Sunday paper, it should be sufficient to say that that is their business. Others have just as much right to demand why he wants certain articles for breakfast, or why he wants his Sunday dinner served in a certain way.

Nor does it follow that a thing to be

proper on Sunday must be necessary. The old Puritans may have demanded to know why it was necessary for a man to kiss his wife on the first day of the week, and as nobody could tell, or prove to a demonstration that the kissing could not be done just as well and effectively on Monday, made a law prohibiting kissing on Sunday. The same principle is involved in laws against Sunday newspapers.
