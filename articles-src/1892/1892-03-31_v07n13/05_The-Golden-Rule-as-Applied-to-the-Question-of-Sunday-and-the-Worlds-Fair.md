# The Golden Rule as Applied to the Question of Sunday and the World's Fair.

*This article is a synopsis of a sermon by Rev. J. M. Foster, preached Feb. 21, in the Second Church, South Chicago, published in the South Chicago Daily Calumet, and endorsed by the Christian Statesman.*

In discussing the question of Sunday closing at the World's Fair, I shall take for text the Golden Rule. "All things that ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." In this statement of Christ's is the embodiment of the principle which should govern all the relations of man to his fellow-men—it must be immediately adds, "For this is the law and the prophets." "Believing this to be the basis of Christian action, I am led to consider the following petition, which being quite generally circulated by those who favor Sunday opening:—

The United States Senate and House of Representatives are asked by the Commissioners and Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition, in its action related the World's Fair on its Sabbath, to abrogate the law of the land, the rights of, the rights of the people of the precedent American history.

We are aware that a variety of sentiments exist among the great citizens of this country on the subject of the Sabbath day, and our Government is not based upon such sentiments, religion, or any creed.

With these principles Congress was asked to take action in a case similar to this. Our Representatives, when asked to discontinue Sunday mails, and the following are quotations from the Senate report on the petition, which was submitted to the Senate and indorsed Jan. 19, 1829.

We are aware that a variety of sentiment exists among the good citizens of this country on the subject of the Sabbath day, and our Government is not based upon such sentiments, religion, or any creed.

> With these Congress was asked and its interference. It has not the legislative right of the Legislature to determine what religious is true and what is false. Our Government is a civil and not a religious institution.

Among all the religious persuasions with which our country abounds, no notice has yet to be had in violation of what government does prescribe in the law of God. To prevent a similar train of evils in this country the Constitution has wisely withheld from our Government the power of defining the law of God.

One year later, 1830, the House of Representatives was petitioned to take action with a view to discontinuing the transportation and the opening of mails on the Sabbath. The following, is the quotation from the committee's report, communicated to the House of Representatives, March 4 and 5, 1830:—

> Congress acts a Committee of delegated and limited power. The committee looks in that instrument for a delegated a power, and on the of the question looking to inquire and determine what part of time, or whether any, has been set apart by the Almighty for religious exercise conveniently.

Speaking of the dangers involved in legislative action, looking to the enforcement of any part of the law of God by human government, the report says:

> The line can not be so strongly drawn between the two. Nor is it possible that any law on the subject shall, in one point, define the law of God, or point out to the citizens our religious duty, it may, with

equal propriety, proceed to define every part of the divine revelation and enforce every divine obligation. In the crumbling of the distinction between civil and ecclesiastical functions, there is that which no statesman, no Christian nation can fail to observe.

The second said, in the minds of the authors of the petition, the secretary and Commissioners for Sunday and the Commissioners to act upon the closing of the Fair on Sunday, in "the rights of men." This is interpreted both by independent and in favor of the petition, to refer particularly to workingmen. Touching this point, I believe that the workingmen themselves are well as well ah to determine what are their rights in this matter as are their self-constituted guardians, and that labor organizations have been almost unanimous in asking that the Fair be open on Sundays. The American Federation of Labor, in annual convention of 1891, and the Knights of Labor, in 1890, passed resolution in favor of Sunday opening. These are organizations which represent eight hundred thousand workingmen.

I pass this point by saying that it looks to me reasonable that if the churches go to their congregations for charges to place their interpretation upon the rights of workingmen, and then ask Congress, State legislatures, and World's Fair Commissioners to force that interpretation upon workingmen by legislative enactments.

The third point in the petition is that which, in the minds of the petitioners, furnishes a sufficient cause of action for Congress and the Commission, to wit "the precedent of American history." "Precedents of Value for us to-day are are those based on correct principle." Our Government, the freest and graced and of the world, was founded on principles, and not on precedent; and it established a precedent which is the entire separation of Church and State. It was at a period and in times characterized by the Church-state and religious abuses almost unmistakably opposed this principle. No reform is ever accomplished except at the cost of some vital interest; and it was felt that all the "precedent of American history," was "collected up to the present time, we would still be hogging and quarrying Quakers. Baptists and hanging Quakers."

> A man enjoys religion when he practices it from the heart, the right to worship God according to the dictates of a spill conscience, and of proclaiming a form of religion must in accordance with every tenet of Christianity.

And this is as much as very man has the right to enjoy and the duty to maintain. The intolerance and power which is apt to use the wheel chariot of the contest is but upon the assumption that holds a different faith.

It may be that in the *Mail and Express* and established by the *Mail and Express,* the enforcement of any religious act not incumbent upon one by the inner conscience but rather one's encouragement from others, but this only consequence must eventually be true of the political religion, and advocated by the *Mail and Express* and the paper's right to race acknowledgement is as yet.

Under this title, "Proceedings Against Adventists," the *Christian Statesman* says, "Through one of our secretaries we learn that $500.00 has been raised of the Sunday papers of Pittsburg, if The the Supreme Court and the Kegly to the Supreme Court and the Legislatures and the courts to these cases.

ACCORDING to the *Christian Statesman,* Rev. Dr. A. A. Miner asks this question and concerning the Sunday newspaper:—

> Why may not a heavy tax and perhaps a Sunday stamp tax be on each and such and each middle weight eight copies?

THE SENTINEL gives it up. The Doctor's "tax," "like the colonel's," is "a good thing; let us press it at hand, at hand to include all readers and travelers." This may be good for the Senators; it may be necessary for Dr. Miner we fancy having news in the Sunday paper, but it is not necessary for him to obtain news at all on a Sunday. "The follow the follow of the secretary of the part on paper," can of course find some things adapted to their taste in the average Sunday paper, but others will pass such things by, no matter whether they find it in the sporting column. Indeed, reading the Sunday paper at all is only a matter of choice. Nobody is compelled, or even urged to read it. If the Doctor would just control his own natural curiosity without blaming his difficulty the Sunday newspaper would not matter at all.

Rev'd Doctor Miner or each and everybody who wants the Sunday paper, it should be sufficient to say that that is their business. Other people have a perfect right to demand why he wants certain articles for breakfast, or why he wants his Sunday dinner served in a certain way.
