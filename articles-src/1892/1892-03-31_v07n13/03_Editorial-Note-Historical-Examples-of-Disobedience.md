DANIEL and his three companions refused obedience to unjust and tyrannical laws; but they were not anarchists. Peter and John disobeyed the magistrates when commanded not to speak any more in the name of Jesus; but they were not anarchists. Time would fail even to mention the prominent martyrs that disobeyed law that they might obey God, and not one of them was an anarchist. John Bunyan resolutely refused to obey the law of England which required him to attend the services of the established Church; but he was not an anarchist. Neither were the Baptists and Quakers of New England anarchists though they persistently disobeyed law and suffered the most shameful indignities rather than surrender even to the civil law their God-given rights.
