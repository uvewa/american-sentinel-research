# The Mail and Express.

THE *Mail and Express* is delighted with the Georgia decision that a man must not be honest, that he need not pay bills contracted for Sunday service, that it says:—

In New York State, unfortunately, no such laws exist, and the immorality of unrestricted Sunday papers may amount to a continuous standing outrage against Sunday. With Sunday advertising a matter the Sunday holiday is legally a lost institution, but Sunday would be made financially impossible.

Very "unfortunately" indeed — for sigpiracy and intolerance! Is the *Mail and Express* troubled by the competition of the Sunday papers of New York?

The Legislature of Massachusetts is urged by the ministers of Boston to pass a law providing that on Sunday the number of trains on any railroad, or cars on any street railway, shall not exceed one-seventh of the daily average run on the week days. This law it is enacted, entirely supersedes all trains and boats. The reason for this request is not far to seek. It proposes actually to remain in the city of Boston and with to enter valley of out of streets, must prohibited the people who will naturally gravitate toward the churches. The same scheme was worked early in the fifth century, when the Emperor Honorius was petitioned, by the Council of Carthage "that the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday, and holidays, to some other day of the week." because the people abandoned the churches for the circus theatre to the church."

"WHAT was a funny composition with no righteousness," remarks the *Republican and Stockbroker,* of Bedford, Massachusetts, which was proposed by a clergyman before a legislative committee at Boston the other day: "It is was that street railway cars that it not run on Sunday except to the church and from the church of any by 1 up on week days. We do not recollect anything in the fourth commandment which says sit is days then shall labor and shall rest six-sevenths of the seventh day. It that commandment is literally binding at the present day, it is binding for the whole of the sixth day.

And the "funniest" thing about it all is that anybody who has given the true second thought should suppose that the fourth commandment has anything to do with Sunday.

In California Mr. Crafts saw a saw-mill in operation, and in San Francisco men were at work on buildings. "At Cheyenne, Sunday work was done shamelessly on the roof of the capitol." In the Mojave he saw Sunday work on a dam; in Allegheny City, just across the river from the home of the *Statesman,* men were at work on railroad tracks—and it does not appear that anybody was shocked; but of Atlanta he remarks, "street-car corporations shocked the citizens by laying track on

the Sabbath, and in New York by similar work on Broadway." Pittsburg, the editor remarks, is the only considerable city which, prohibited the Sunday sale of ice-cream confectionery, and soda water. As Mr. Crafts lives in Pittsburg, he probably feels his Allegheny River water on Saturday for his Sunday drinking—but so, he is not at home on Sunday—he is not at work gathering material for the columns of his paper, and points for his twenty Dollar Sunday evening lectures on "Sabbath reform"—for other States.

The editor of the *Christian Statesman* reports that even in the United Presbyterian city of Monmouth, Illinois, he found open, on Sunday, "an ice-cream saloon, butcher shop, bakery, news-room, grocery, tobacco shop, gent's furnishing store, fruit store, etc." What wicked Monmouth! To be sure! Why did not Mr. Crafts prosecute them under the Illinois Sunday law?

The editor has had Sabbath for three years and a quarter," says the *Christian Statesman;* "the editor has investigated at least ten towns of a study of Sunday work." If the editor of the *Statesman* believes that Sunday is a sacred day, the strict observance of which is enjoined by the fourth commandment, what right has he to spend it in any such manner? Has he a special dispensation from the Author of the fourth commandment that empowers him to go gallivanting about in search of wholesale say and inferences?

But what has the editor of the *Statesman* learned in three years and a quarter—in what way he desires to work evil? And Government? First, in farming districts Sunday "observance has fallen below their former standard, partly because of the *Sunday newspaper,* the elite and some from the farming, partly because of the milk and fruit the train cities ask to have sent in, but chiefly because the farmers themselves, many of them, have been brought up in the continent Sunday." Is the West to "board" of Sunday harvesting. In Centralia, Illinois, the *Sabbath*—no, we beg pardon—the *Sunday—*was yet more deplorably. In the *Statesman's* editor's account is deployed in strawberry time to send *Sunday* picket, attended on Sunday trains to the Chicago market." In Ohio cotton factories are in operation on Sunday.

A *Fair for Sunday advertising* based upon the Walter Taylor Drug Company brought and also by the advertising firm of George P. Rowell and Co., No 10 Spruce Street, New York," says the *Mail and Express of Youth.*

ACCORDING to the *Christian Statesman,* Atlanta, on the ground that advertising on that day was not legal had could not be used to pro- It is further stated that the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, "he had not met with a similar case in any other State, and reported the case as a particularly nice case that might be a precedent in several States where the Sunday law is not enforced.

"DRASTIC," in its worst sense, is a good word to describe Sunday laws in general, and the Georgia Sunday law in particular. This nature and design of the Georgia Sunday law may be judged from the fact that it provides that "all money arising
