THE reckless and extravagant religio-political enthusiasm of the editor of the Christian Statesman, is shown most characteristically in a first-page editorial item in that paper, of the issue of March 19. Every college, every community, every person, all the people, are urged to form themselves into a "Government of the People League," to write personal letters to congressmen, resolve, petition, protest, in reference to a mixed series of measures, all bearing the stamp, "For the protection of the public morale," and many of which can properly have no civil standing whatever.
