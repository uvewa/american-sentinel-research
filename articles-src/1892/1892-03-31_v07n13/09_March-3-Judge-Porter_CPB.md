# March 3, Judge Porter.

MARCH 3, Judge Porter, of Pittsburg, manifested his decision in the apprehended newspaper case annulling the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, and holding that the sale of newspapers upon the first of the week is not a work of worldly necessity.

BUT NOTWITHSTANDING this adverse decision: Henry A. Schafer of the Paper Carriers' Union says,— "Although Judge Porter ruling states that selling or delivering a Sunday newspaper on Sunday is an open violation of the law, we will deliver the papers." — "I am a law abiding citizen . . . a good Christian, the Christian, the Mayor of the city, who is opposed to the law, responds, 'There are my sentiments' " — while the *Leader, Dispatch,* and *Press* exclaim, "We, too." "We disapproved of the law the *Christian Statesman* characterizes as 'anarchy.' "

Anarchy is not, however, opposition to unjust law; but opposition to all law. It is not anarchy when civil forbiddenism throw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor, nor was it anarchy when they refused to use the stamped paper prescribed by foolish and other legal documents. The British Government had no right to tax its Colonies without representation. At the same time, the Colonies, and resistance was in the interest of the common man good.

APART from the anti-Sunday paper crusade, in Pittsburg, it is certain that the cry of "anarchy" always marks a morally suspicious "it is the law" basis is an ill past erased in the minds of the mass of the people the circumstances of most horrid cruelties inflicted in the name of Justice. Thus Christendom of a few centuries ago, men and women, all suffering according to law, papal, all suffering accused to law, and for "violation of law." These were to a man "anarchists," in that they refused obedience to unjust laws.

SUPPOSE the Legislature of Pennsylvania were to pass a law, identical with the Sunday law of 1794, only substituting "the sentiments of Moody, Whitefield," called St. Patrick's day, for "the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday" and suppose the courts and "public" sentiment sustained the law, would the editor of the *Christian Statesman* obey it? And if not, why not? Would a refusal to obey be "anarchy?"

*Unjust laws have been the bulwark of*

*oppression in every age. Witness the "Fugitive Slave law" it—is not own, laid, resisted to the bitter end by a law abiding but outraged people. Was that anarchy? It was "draft" in law for a slave to "steal" himself, that is to assert his God-given right to freedom; by running away; but was it morally wrong? Was it an anarchy?*

SUPPOSE the law of Pennsylvania required all human homes and offices to be open all or a part of Sunday, would it be anarchy to shut? Certainly not for a Sabbath day Certainly for a Sabbath and for the reason that such a law would be an unjust interference with the inalienable rights of individuals. But it is just as much an unjust interference for a law to require a part of this community to be out all and labor and business on one day of the week because of the religious ideas of the other part of the people in regard to it. The law, under which the Roman emperor required Christians one more incense to Jupiter was no more unjust than the law of Pennsylvania, which still makes it pay to buy a law tribute to Sunday by resting upon it. The cry of "anarchy" is nothing but the cry of bigotry of the moral coward.
