"THAT was a funny compromise with righteousness," remarks the Republican Standard, of Bedford, Massachusetts, which was proposed by a clergyman before a legislative committee at Boston the other day. "It was that street railway cars shall not run on Sundays more than one-seventh the number of trips they do on week days. We do not recollect anything in the fourth commandment which says six days thou shalt labor and shall rest six-sevenths of the seventh day. If that commandment is literally binding at the present day, it is binding for the whole of the seventh day."

And the "funniest" thing about it all is that anybody who has given it the second thought should suppose that the fourth commandment has anything to do with Sunday.
