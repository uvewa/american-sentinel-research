ANARCHY is defined to be "political confusion" and an anarchist is "one who seeks to overturn by violence all constituted forms and institutions of society and government, all law and order, and all rights of property, with no purpose of establishing any other system of order in the place of that destroyed." It is evident, therefore, that opposition to unjust laws is not anarchy, nor are those who disobey such laws anarchists in any proper sense of the word.
