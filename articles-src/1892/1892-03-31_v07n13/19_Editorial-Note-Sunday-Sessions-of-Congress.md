A PROPOSAL was lately made in the House of Representatives to hold Sunday sessions of Congress for the purpose of delivering eulogies to the memory of deceased members. A short discussion ensued upon its introduction, in which it was stated that in the Fifty-first Congress the time occupied for this purpose amounted to twenty-four days; and in opposition, the measure was characterized as an "effort to invade the sacredness of Sunday" in which "the people of this country are much interested," as shown by the fact that "we are all constantly receiving petitions that this body should, by its enactments, respect the day." The resolution was lost by a vote of one hundred and sixty to eighty-one.
