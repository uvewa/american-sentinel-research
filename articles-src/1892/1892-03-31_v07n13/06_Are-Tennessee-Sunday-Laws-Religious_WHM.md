In his "Law of Sunday," on page 84, Mr. Ringgold says:—

The historical fact is, of course, just as well known to the pundits of the bench as to other scholars, that the Sunday laws were intended by those who passed them as the assertion of a religious dogma, and designed to force an external compliance with a portion of their ritual upon those who did not believe in the dogma or approve the ceremonial; that the men who concocted such laws were religious enthusiasts, and not physiologists.

The original act of 1741, upon which the present Sunday law of Tennessee is based is, then, the assertion of a religious dogma and designed to enforce a compliance with some requirement of an ecclesiastical ritual upon those who protest against submitting to such requirement. This is well borne out by the language of the statute which says that "all and every person and persons whatsoever, shall on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety."

The evident religious intent of this statute is also upheld by judicial opinion in one of the early recorded Tennessee cases brought under it, where the judge said, "The professed object of this statute was to further the observance of the Sabbath day, pursuant to the spirit of its original institution."

The dogma to be enforced upon all, irrespective of difference of belief, or entire unbelief, is, then, that the day "commonly called Sunday" is the Lord's day, or "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and the portion of the ritual to which compulsory observance is to be had is that of cessation from all labor and amusement upon that day, that it may be remembered "pursuant to the spirit of its original institution," which is, according to the statute, by application to the duties of religion and piety. In conformity with this Judge Green said, in the case of the State vs. Eskridge, in 1852, "The object of the Legislature was to prevent the desecration of a day, which, by our law, is dedicated to the duties of religion." Again, in 1857, Judge McKinney quoted the same expression as authority for a decision made by him. In 1872 Judge Nicholson says, in Williams vs. the State, "The statute under which the indictment was framed, was intended to prevent the desecration of the Sabbath. . . . It is intended to punish those who sell, . . . those who desecrate the Sabbath." In 1878 Judge Deaderick says that "flagrant violations of the Sabbath day do tend to debauch public morals." The same Judge in another decision in 1886 says further, "The statute makes it unlawful for anyone of the enumerated classes to follow his ordinary secular avocation on the Sabbath day, because it is immoral."

All these judicial expressions are unimpeachable witnesses to the truth of Mr. Ringgold's statement that Sunday laws were intended to be an assertion of a religious dogma and were framed for the purpose of enforcing an external compliance with the dogma and ceremonial of Sunday observance upon those who do not believe in it. More than this, they prove that the judicial expressions and decisions of the present time are inspired by the same spirit which dictated the ancient statute. Indeed, it is nowhere denied in any of these decisions that their purpose is to enforce a religious tenet, but rather affirmed. They go upon the assumption that cessation from all labor or amusement, unmitigated idleness in fact, must be enforced on Sunday. Why? Because idleness on Sunday is a tenet of Christianity, and Christianity is a part of the common law, which has been absorbed into our law, and being thus incorporated this part of the common law antedates the constitutional guarantees of religious liberty in these United States, and these guarantees must therefore be construed with reference to the more ancient principles of English law. Therefore, putting this construction upon the relation of the theory that Christianity was part of the law of England, and the constitutional limitations imposed in this country, the legislatures of the different States, and for that matter, the Congress of the United States, are not restrained from making all the laws any religionist desires for the enforcement of any religion which may make apparent to them its right to the title of Christianity, or which may commonly pass by that name.

The case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, with which the readers of THE SENTINEL are familiar, adds to this unanswerable evidence that the Sunday laws of Tennessee are religious laws, and never were intended for anything else than to enforce the observance of a religious dogma and ceremonial upon those who were unwilling to yield this obedience. Five more men of similar character and faith with R. M. King have been indicted in Henry County, Tennessee, upon a like charge. In none of these cases is there a shadow of reason for the course taken against them except that of difference of religious belief as to which day of the week should be observed as holy time. In view of these prosecutions, as well as those which are yet to come, the discussion of the religious laws of Tennessee, which has been running through these columns for some weeks, will be found particularly pertinent.
