# Constantine's Sunday Law.

An interesting question is raised in the *Christian Statesman,* of March 3, in its reference to the nature of Constantine's Sunday law of March 7, A. D. 321, which is as follows:—

Let all judges, inhabitants of the cities, soldiers, and the rest of all the tradesmen rest on the venerable day of the Sun. But let husbandmen may freely and at their pleasure apply that the sewing of grain and the planting of vines can not be so advantageously performed on any other day; lest, by neglecting the opportunity, they should lose the commodities divined by bounty bestow upon men.

It will be observed that the term used to designate the day is "the *Dies venerabilis* of the sun," as **landlords** bill, it is also notice the word used in Constantine's edict to "the plan the Church." It is reported, however, that the law itself furnishes no evidence of this. Indeed, it is very plainly a secular, but it at the said day as law cannot be regarded as sacred in any higher sense than Christmas, Good Friday, and such days are now. Many churches have the this observed Saturday, although it is given some reverence, but making it a Sabbath, to say nothing of the Sabbath, it does not.

It is unscriptive, pure and simple, that Constantine had in his edict any reference whatever to the regard manifested for the day by Christian Baptists. In his "Antiquities of the Christian Church," book 20, chapter 5, Beibtine Josephus says, "Neanor, amongst the festival of the heathen from all political business." In his "History of Christianity," book 3, chapter 2, Milman says:—

The same edict, (that on the religious services of the Sunday, which of the emperor and the State, which) the suspension of all public business and private labor, except that of agriculturists, according to the apparent terms of the decree, for the whole Roman Empire. Ye so has not direct proof that the decree as connected in any way with Christianity for the day, it may be doubted whether the edict was designed to be exercised in the greater of the empire or merely one more put forth to the head of the empire, an pronouncing result it that the will of all his subjects be governed on as this day on a peculiar ground, by which he the general purpose the empire into to repose. As we have before observed, the day of the sun would be most acceptable to be accepted by all his subjects especially that part which had admitted any impress of the superstition of the worship of the sun.

To the same intent Edward V. Neal, in "Feast and Fasts," says, pp. 42, 49. Under August of Augustine the number of days upon which, out of reverence to his gods to whom they were consecrated, no trials might take place at Rome, had become a source upon which the wealthy criminal speculated upon as a means of evading punishment. That being true it is certainly not necessary to suppose that Constantine's edict had any reference whatever to anything except the fact that Sunday was dedicated to his protector, his tutelar deity, the sun. Of Constantine's devotion, the sun god, Gibbon says:—

The devotion of Constantine was more peculiarly

directed to the genius of the sun, the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology, and he was pleased to be represented with the symbols of the god of light and poetry. The edict of Apollo was displayed with the voices of officers of Constantine and the coincident medallions were thought to believe that the empire was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the visible majesty of their patron deity.

The sun was universally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Constantine.

Again, the character of the manners of those days sacred to heathen deities was so very similar to that enjoined by Constantine for Sunday that no one can fail to see that the edict was purely pagan. On this point M. Neal says:—

> The practice of abstaining from various sorts of labor upon days consecrated by religious observance, the lust of suspending at such sessions business proceedings, was familiar to the Romans from the period of the introduction of Christian ideas. Virgil enumerates the rural labors which might be the days be carried on, without extraordinary upon the prohibitions of religious and civil, and he elsewhere shows that many works were counted as shameful. Thus in respect was forbidden to open the channel, to do any yolking when cutting or to guard the flock was from harm. It was not however, otherwise, to guard the crop from injury by birds or to cut briars, or to wash the sheep, or to burn unproductive thorns.

This likeness between these heathen republications and our modern Sunday laws, with their unnerving exceptions, is too striking as to be very suggestively significant.

Constantine was at the time of issuing his Sunday edict a pagan, pure and simple, there is little doubt. He has forbidden certain kinds of labor on the "venerable day of the sun," was issued on the 7th of March on the following day, namely, the 8th of March, was issued an edict directing that in case of any public calamity the Auruspices should be consulted. These were accredited soothsayers on fortune-tellers who professed to read in the entrails of beasts future events. Those like that any Christian emperor were made such a law is absurd.

This arch heathen and hypocrite, Eusebius of Ceasarea, is almost wholly responsible for the false impression which obtains to a considerable extent that Constantine was a Christian man. It is a fact that he made no profession of Christianity until on his death bed, and that throughout his life he was not a pagan, but a layer, of Constantine's character Philip Schaff says:—

> He was far from being so pure and so venerable character as to be the head of the church to desire him to be associated and almost dishonestly exhorts biography; with the evident intention of setting him up as a model for all future Christian rulers. It must with regard be recorded practically progress in the knowledge of Christianity was not a progress in the practice of its virtues. His love of display and pomp of display, his suspicion and cruelty, increased with his power. He was not indeed baptized until a moment away for a missionary for the people and his nation did not truly Christian profession in many ways contrary, that he was Christian and after that he was Christian Statesman, the Mayor of the moral company.

He was far from being so pure and as venerable character as to be the head of the church to desire him to be associated and almost dishonestly exhorts biography, with the evident intention of setting him up as a model for all future Christian rulers. It must with regard be recorded practically.

Again, the year in which his Sunday law was enacted was a critical transition point in his career. It was the very year in which he acquired control over the greater part of the Roman Empire, the consolidation of his conquered rival and brother-in-law. Noted "In the history of ecclesiastical synods and councils" [301], etc.

Nominally with this his secured, son Constantine became in an all political supremacy, the absolute of a young ambitious ruler, a history of barely eleven years. But the same force which had a world then knew only the absolute ruler of a one who had inserted suspicion of political conspiracy, and of indifference and insincerity even greater than his imperial, Fausts, fact is generally believed.

Such was the character of this author of the first Sunday law known to history. In the face of these is the facts fact that who were taught that it was a Christian in behalf of the sacred observances of a Christian institution. It is true that is the faith one was afterwards turned to account by the bishops to restrict the actions of the people upon the first day of the week; but that the law has its origin held its origin in the enactment as a Christian institution is, to say the least, extremely doubtful. Just as the name "Sunday" had, before the so-called change of the Sabbath it is impossible to say. As we have seen, it is probable that the emperor had no thought of effecting any change in any Christian institution by means of his edict, whatever effect it may have had on the change was due not to the intention of the edict, but to it by those who as pagans had honored the solar regarded Sunday as sacred, and who probably saw new law its transferring it to another and more public purpose.
