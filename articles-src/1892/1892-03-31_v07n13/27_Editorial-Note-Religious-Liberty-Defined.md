THE Independent quotes Bishop Henry W. Warren as saying:—

Freedom in religion must not mean freedom from religion.

In like manner Cardinal Gibbons defines religious liberty thus:—

A man enjoys religious liberty when he possesses the free right to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience, and of practicing a form of religion most in accordance with his duties to God.

And this is as much as very many people mean by religious liberty and freedom of conscience; they mean simply liberty for themselves and for those who measurably agree with them; more than this is in their view destructive of social order, and not to be admitted for a moment. Such utterances show that the spirit of intolerance formerly supposed to be dead has lost none of its vitality. Warmed into new life by numerous proposed measures of religious legislation, it is already giving evidence of its old time venom. Human nature has not changed, nor is it likely to change sufficiently to make it safe to trust men with the consciences of their fellow-men.
