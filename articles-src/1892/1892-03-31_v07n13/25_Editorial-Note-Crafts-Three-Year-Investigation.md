THE editor of the Christian Statesman reports that even in the United Presbyterian city of Monmouth, Illinois, he found open, on Sunday, "an ice-cream saloon, butcher shop, bakery, news room, grocery, tobacco shop, gent'ls furnishing store, fruit store, etc." What wicked Presbyterians, to be sure! Why did not Mr. Crafts prosecute them under the Illinois Sunday law?

"NEARLY every Sabbath for three years and a quarter," says the Christian Statesman, "the editor has investigated some town and made a tally of Sunday work." If the editor of the Statesman believes that Sunday is a sacred day, the strict observance of which is enjoined by the fourth commandment, what right has he to spend it in any such manner? Has he a special dispensation from the Author of that law permitting him to disregard it—to do evil that good may come? to act the wholesale spy and informer?

BUT what has the editor of the Statesman learned in three years and a quarter by what in others he would call Sunday desecration? First, in farming districts Sunday "observance has fallen below their former standard, partly because of the Sunday newspaper the cities send out to them, partly because of the milk and fruits the cities ask to have sent in, but chiefly because the farmers themselves, many of them, have been brought up on the continental Sunday." In the West he "heard" of Sunday harvesting. In Centralia, Illinois, the Sunday schools "are depleted in strawberry time to send Sunday picked strawberries on Sunday trains to the Chicago market." In Ohio cheese factories are in operation on Sunday.

IN CALIFORNIA Mr. Crafts saw a saw-mill in operation, and in San Francisco men were at work on buildings. "At Cheyenne, Sunday work was done shamelessly on the roof of the capitol." In Des Moines he saw Sunday work on a dam; in Allegheny City, just across the river from the home of the Statesman, men were at work on rail-road tracks—and it does not appear that anybody was shocked; but of Atlanta he remarks, "street-car corporations shocked the citizens by laying track on the Sabbath, and in New York by similar work on Broadway." Pittsburg, the editor remarks, is the only considerable city which prohibits the Sunday sale of tobacco, confectionary, and soda water. As Mr. Crafts lives in Pittsburg, he probably boils his Allegheny River water on Saturday for his Sunday drinking—but no, he is not at home on Sunday; he is out at work gathering material for the columns of his paper, and points for his twenty-dollar Sunday evening lectures on "Sabbath reform"—for other people.
