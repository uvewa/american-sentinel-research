A PHILADELPHIA lawyer has found a circumscribed district within the State of Pennsylvania, where, as he claims, the old religious laws of 1794 are inoperative. If true, and the position can be maintained, the population of this district, described as being "all north of the Cohocksink Creek to Gunner's Run, and all east of Sixth Street to the Delaware River," is likely to become very dense within a few years, as the ancient statute of 1794 is more and more strictly enforced elsewhere. This remarkable alleged discovery of a sanctuary for the personnel, was brought about through opposition to a general order to close all business on Sunday, issued by the authorities in response to a notification to them by the Retail Grocers' Association, "that nearly all the stores along South Street were kept open on Sunday, and business carried on the same as during the week." The authorities made an exception, however, in favor of cigar stores, because, as the "Director of Public Safety" said,

"cigar stores have always been open and I see no reason why they should be closed." When the attention of this public official, having in charge the safety of Philadelphia, was called to the case which was claimed as an exemption of this especial district he said: "If there is such a law the store keepers may continue their business on Sunday the same as any other day, and we can not close their places." The maze of ludicrous religious and legal situations and inconsistencies is such that to enumerate and comment on them would fill a pamphlet.
