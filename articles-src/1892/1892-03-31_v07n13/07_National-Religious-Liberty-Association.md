# NATIONAL Religious Liberty Association.

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submit to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it to be our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

*E. Rainy, Sec. New York.*

*A. F. Ballenger.*

*R. C. Porter.*

It true, and the position one be the remainder the population of that district, deserve to still "it north of the Cobbleskill Creek and Cammbers mile all mad and of such flown places which Delaware River," is likely to become very dense within a few years, as the national station of 1794 a men and more entirely realized of a themselves. The remarkable alleged discovery of a mortuary for the district if true, this section the legal interpretation for a general order to close all business on Sunday, read by an authorisation the a impressive notifiable, to them by the Bristol Grocers' Association (if that papers all the stores along Shore streets, been kept on Sunday, and business carried on the same as during the week). "The subscribers to the exception, however, in favor of cigar stores because in the "Elberton of Public Safety," such

"cigar stores have always been open and see no reason why they should be closed." When the intention of this public official, having in charge the Safety of Philadelphia, was called to the attention, he was claimed as an exception of this imperial decree of the mail—"If there is such a law then the keepers may continue their business on Sunday the same as any day; and we can in time of their places." "The cause of inherent religious and legal absurdities and inconsistencies is such that no enumeration and comment on them would fill a library."

The most recurrent scheme in France is to refuse to religious questions drives our daily differ and to the Mail and Express and Christian Statesman and great advancement to the cause of religious that religion is coming to the front in French politics; but it is the religious element in the sense that is the most remarkable incident in the recent life of that most unstable of European republics, looking toward the regulation of religion endeavors. Never before was the most observe of popular liberty, in Americanize the constitution so as to paly under a republican, a proper principle. No reform is ever accomplished
