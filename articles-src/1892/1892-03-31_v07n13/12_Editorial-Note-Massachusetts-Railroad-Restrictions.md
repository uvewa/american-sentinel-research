THE Legislature of Massachusetts is asked by the ministers of Boston to pass a law providing that on Sunday the number of trains on any railroad, or cars on any street railway, shall not exceed one-seventh of the daily average run on other days of the week, and prohibiting entirely excursion trains and boats. The reason for this request is not far to seek; compelled to remain in the city on Sunday and with every other variety of entertainment prohibited the people will naturally gravitate toward the churches. The same scheme was worked early in the fifth century, when the Emperor Honorius was petitioned, by the Council of Carthage "that the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday, and from feast days, to some other days of the week," because "the people congregate more to the circus than to the church."
