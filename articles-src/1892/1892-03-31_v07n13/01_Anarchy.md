# Anarchy.

THE cry of "anarchy" raised in Pittsburgh, referred to elsewhere in this paper, is an ominous sign of the times. It indicates that we are entering upon an era in this country when, as never before in our history, the inquiry will not be, is it right? but, what is the law?

Anarchy is defined to be "a political confession" and an anarchist "a one who seeks to overturn by violence all constituted forms and institutions of society and government, all law and order, and all rights of property, with no purpose of establishing any system of order in the place of that destroyed." It is evident, therefore, that, opposition to unjust laws is not anarchy, nor can any one be classed as such who is not violently disorderly such an institution in any respect whatever.

Bakunin and his three companions refused obedience to unjust and tyrannical laws, but they were not anarchists. Peter and John disobeyed the magistrates when commanded not to speak any more in the name of Jesus; but they were not anarchists. Time would fail even to mention the names of those who in the history of human martyrdom that disobeyed laws which they might obey God, and not one of them was an anarchist. John Bunyan resolutely refused to obey the law of England which required him to attend the services of the established Church; but he was not an anarchist. Neither were the Baptists and Quakers of New England anarchists though they persistently disobeyed law and suffered the most shameful indignities rather than surrender even to the civil law their God-given rights.

Bigotry and intolerance, intrenched in iniquitous laws, may shout, "anarchy," and talk loftily about the sacredness of law, and the duty to obey magistrates; but inalienable right justifies resistance when laws trample upon the sacred domains of conscience, or exact recognition of those things which in their very nature and design are outside the jurisdiction of human government.
