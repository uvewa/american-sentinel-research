# Georgia Sunday Laws and Sunday Schools.

The duty of the Church to use the Godgiven means to accomplish these reforms. When these fail, the responsibility rests with the individual. Christians have no right to appeal to civil law to compel men to conform to their ideas of worship.

The following recommendation, found in Crafts's work on Sunday is a matter that points to out in my mind the only legitimate power with which Christianity is clothed in dealing with this Sunday observance question:—

No change has set apart the first day of the week as a time that man is bound to keep holy, and divine authority is not necessary to the worship it is not the more congenial to the principle of Christianity as obligatory upon them, it is not necessary to aid them in making men better in converting souls to God from the sinners, by purifying their hearts' Government will protect them in this effort. When thou shall have the ministers of the public mind and spirit upon them nothing more than this a violation of God's law to give them a day, a one has given, either on Sunday or before Sunday (and I will attend at the World's Fair at all times) as a church citizen is quite capable of working out one of itself, without any coercion of the strong arm of the law.

## Religion and Public Schools.

At the beginning of his reign William De I. dechaired his himself W. 1889, he has issued a set accordingly, and laid hands further out of his ideas as to what means be made use of to achieve his purpose.

That is the advice for to make reformers, set the various people, to work against each other, and so to destroy them, a thought with which I have been long occupied, and upon which I have long meditated . . . We must foster dissent, and accentuate the connection on young minds that the teachings of other Denominations are not only contrary to the law of God and Christian principle, but are un-practical, and dangerous to the aspirations in whose land, both as regards the individual and society.

The year after, in 1890, he spoke again on education, in words which indicate exactly in the spirit of this edict; expressing his belief that teachers find their way into the public schools who are merely Democrats, and gives utterance to his royal expect—the "fear of God" would be rendered more instead upon in the public schools of the nation.

The Minister of Public Worship, therefore, forty only fulfilled the order of the sovereign, in bringing in his bill granting the Church a powerful influence over the school. Hitherto In Prussia schools have been sectarian, and both the Church and the school have been both milled under the control of the State, having come as the same minister in the King's Cabinet. But sectarianism was a principle more or less loosely adhered to, and of per cent. of all Sunday, schools 43,817 in number, were com class, with one teacher for pupils of various religious denominations save in religion —this branch was given over to Catholic priests in Lutheran schools, while In

districts where Catholics abound, Protestant clergymen were privileged to instruct the children of Lutheran parents.

Yet even this loose connection between Church and school, and all the there inter-stitutions upon occasion differences, proved no one to adequate for the task of fixing the minds of young citizens from the old infirmity, prelusion. France, on the contrary, has been the scene of incessant persecution, against Jews and Catholics, and it still, against Jews. Nor has the union between Church and school, even in its strictest form, been conclusively beneficial to the churches of the empire.

Massacred and moreover no better educated they are in countries where no a union exists; faith, is not more ingrained in criminal hearts, nor church-going more their habits. The truth is rather that Germans are comparatively different church-goers: government officials are obliged to attend services, and the reason for the last few has been found more than once in the caution of mixing school instruction discipline during youth, within the same secular walls and with the same associations. Nearly all those who pupils but fail their school lessons if lessons, and find their religious lessons tiresome also, for these are a part of the routine of the school. When freed from this compulsory attendance at the one, they feel freed from further attendance at religious instructions likewise; and religious instruction is the chief thing that evangelical public offer; officially, indeed, is the only thing.

Whatever success has been achieved by restricting the authority of the school with that of the Church, has been a one entirely and purely political. Neither religion nor morality has been conclusively advanced by the plan. Morality is no higher than in countries where Church is independent of the State; and all by Church of that, the Church affairs in every state below that which is found in States with a connection.

But the government is modest, and is satisfied with political purposes. He says in April, and being but on one democratic —the political existences of a party—and the as treated as an accessory. Consider strife, such as the Xanthian Gentiles against the Jews, the Berlinists against the Catholics, the Forest outbreaks against the Lutherans, are of subordinate interest, it only a Denominational contributor could be realized from the against monarchy? Hence, the section of the new law, which make sectarianism in public schools compulsory, which force every child to receive religious instructions, as far as practicable, from a teacher of his own denomination, and which cede the right of deciding which teachers are fit for instruction of children in religion to the clergy. Normal schools, in which teachers are trained, are directed to be established upon a sectarian basis; and Section 110 allows priests and clergymen to have, to inspect such institutions at any

time, as functionaries of their religious orders, without any other restriction than a notice sent and beforehand of their proposed visitation. Both clerical functionaries are granted the privilege of attending the religious lessons in public schools, and of counting upon them to do teachers, when the pupils leave the schoolhouse. Catholic priests can thus visit schools of non-Catholics, or non-Hebrews, if few in number (not more than fifteen), shall be not to favor instruction in one or even other schools of the "recognized sects," or the directors of the superior magistrate.

This is rule to enforce the injunctions of His Majesty, to purify pay school of all suspectable teachers, and to impress upon Church with birth in the Scriptural that fear of God (Gottes furcht, "word), and to "bring into military attachments" pay nothing to the Lord. And it we keep to mind the fact that out in a per cent. of schools in the State with only one teacher, and yet set in it the obligation to make sectarian distinction and to withhold from existing teachers the privilege of giving religious instruction, recreation, arise, at the same time, that a teacher publicly branded as unfit for giving said instruction "also is not fit." then we can see that the ministry has, indeed, offered an efficient instrument for the evil which, the influence and power which is apt to use the wheel chariot of the contest is but upon the assumption that holds a different faith; intended to Denomination. . . . . .

Prussia, without making much about that which will match, but strike united, the Emperor, a pupil of Bismarck, and of them as two surgy carps mode lately by Police Schools law, and such companions routine to house is as single as the monetary against Settlements.—*The Sun and New York, The Independent.*
