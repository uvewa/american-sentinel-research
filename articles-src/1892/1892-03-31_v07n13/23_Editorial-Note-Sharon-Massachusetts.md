THE enforcement of civil Sunday laws necessitates judicial and municipal decisions that Sunday, the first day of the week, is not the Sabbath. According to the Boston Journal the people of Sharon, Massachusetts, have realized this fact and acted upon it:—

At the town meeting in Sharon the much-disnused question whether Sunday or Sabbath was the proper term to use, was decided, and the matter is no longer in doubt. A motion that the constables be authorized to enforce the laws against hunting and fishing on the Sabbath was made, and an amendment was made that the word Sunday should be substituted for Sabbath. This caused a heated discussion of nearly an hour, in which many took part. The amendment was carried by a small majority and the word Sabbath was changed to Sunday, and the motion as amended was carried.

It is certain that this question is no longer in doubt, but how many, though knowing the right, will choose the wrong, and endeavor by the same civil Sunday laws (falsely so-called) to enforce upon others the acceptance of the error.
