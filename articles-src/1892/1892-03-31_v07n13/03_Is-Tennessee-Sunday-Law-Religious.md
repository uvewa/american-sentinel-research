# Is Tennessee Sunday Law Religious?

In his "Law of Sunday," on page 84, Mr. Ringgold says:

> The historical fact is, of course, just as well known in the practice of the bench as in other schools, that the Sunday laws were intended by those who passed them as the assertion of a religious dogma, and designed to force an external compliance with a portion of their creed upon those who did not believe in the dogma or approve the ceremonial; that is the one connected with religious sentiment, and was planned

in the original act of 1741, upon which the present Sunday law of Tennessee is based, is then, the assertion of a religious dogma, and designed to enforce a compliance with some requirement of an ecclesiastical ritual upon those who protest against submitting to such requirement. This is still the law of this requirement, and the statute which says that "all and every persons and persons whatsoever, shall on the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday, apply *equally* themselves *to the duties of religion and piety.*"

The evident religious intent of this statute is also upheld by judicial opinion in one of the early recorded Tennessee cases the Court through Judge Deaderick said, "The professed object of this statute is to further the observance of the Sabbath day, paramount to the *spirit* of the original institution."

The dogma is to be enforced upon all, irrespectively of difference of belief, or unbelief; so, that is, that the "venerability" called Sunday" is the Lord's day, or "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God," and the portion of the ritual to which compulsory observance is to be had is that of cessation from all labor and amusement upon that day, that it may be remembered "pursuant to the spirit of its original institution," which is, according to the statute, by application to the duties of religion and piety. In conformity with that Judge Green said, in the case of the State vs. Kartzin, in 1867, "The object of the Legislature was to prevent the desecration of a day, which, by our religion, is dedicated to the duties of religion." Again, in 1857, Judge McKinney quoted the same expression as authority for a decision. Then, in 1871 and 1889, Judge Nicholson says, in Williams vs. the State, "The statute under which the indictment was framed, was intended to prevent the desecration of the Sabbath. . . . It is intended to punish those who defile, all those who desecrate the Sabbath." In 1878 Judge Deaderick says that "Bagratti vi-

olations of the Sabbath day be tend to debauch public morals." The same Judge rendered another decision in that says further, "The statute makes it unlawful for any of the enumerated to follow the of the enumerated to follow their ordinary secular avocation on the Sabbath day, because it is immoral to do so."

All these judicial expressions are unimpeachable witnesses to the truth of Mr. Ringgold's statements that Sunday laws were intended to be an assertion of a religious dogma and were framed for the purpose of enforcing an external compliance with the dogma and ceremonial of Sunday observance upon those who do not believe in it. More than this, they prove that all the judicial interpretations and decisions of the present time are inspired by the same ideas which dictated the act enacted statute. Indeed, it is nowhere denied in any of these decisions that their object is to enforce a religious trust, but rather affirmed. They do upon the assumption that coercion from all labor or amusement, unimportant idleness in fact, must be enforced on Sundays. Why? Because idleness on Sunday is a tenet of Christianity and Christianity is a part of the common law, which has been absorbed into our law, and being the incorporation into this part of the common law enticles the constitutional guarantees of religious liberty in these United States, and these guarantees must therefore be construed with reference to the more ancient principles of English law. Therefore, putting the construction upon the old church and state view of the theory that Christianity was the law of the land, and ignoring all the constitutional institutions imposed in this country, the legislatures of the States, the courts of the United States, are not content with making all the law any arguments deserve for the enforcement of any religious duty which may appear to them the right to the title of Christianity, or which can be palmed off under a repudiation of the title.

The case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, well which the readers of THE SENTINEL are familiar, adds to this the monstrance that the Sunday laws of Tennessee are religious law, and are used for the enforcing of anything else that is not to observance of a religious dogma and ceremonial upon those who were obligated to yield to that obedience the theory being of intolerance character and faith with M. King laws have been inflicted in Tennessee upon Tennesseans, upon as like charge. In some of these cases there is a shadow of reason for the courts taken against these except that of differences of religious belief as to which day of the week should be observed as holy time. In view of these prosecutions, as well as those which are yet to come, the discussion of the religious laws of Tennessee, which has been running through these columns for some weeks, will be found particularly pertinent.
