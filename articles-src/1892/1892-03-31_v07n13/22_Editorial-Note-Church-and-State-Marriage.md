THE ability of National Reformers to make a discrimination without any material difference, is well marked in an expression by Rev. N. H. Axtell, of Chicago: "Church and State were divorced in America that Christianity and the Nation might marry." The State is defined to be "a political body, or body politic, the whole body of people united under one government; a nation." A nation,—"the body of inhabitants of a country, united under one independent government of their own."

According to Mr. Axtell's own statement, therefore, the State was divorced from the individual Church in order that it might be married to the entire family, under the family name of Christianity, in one adulterous union. This resembles very much the spiritual adultery against which the Bible inveighs in terms of such terrible denunciation.
