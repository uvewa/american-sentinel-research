"A bill for Sunday advertising against the Walter Taylor Drug Company brought by the advertising firm of George P. Rowell & Co., of No. 10 Spruce Street, New York," says the Mail and Express, "has been disallowed by Judge Clark, of Atlanta, on the ground that advertising on that day was not legal and could not be sued for." It is further stated that "the attorney for Rowell & Co., said that he had not met with a similar case in any other State, and regarded the case as a particularly nice one, that might be pertinent in several States where the Sunday laws were drastic."

"Drastic," in its worst sense, is a good word to describe Sunday laws in general, and the Georgia Sunday law in particular. The nature and design of the Georgia Sunday law may be judged from the fact that it provides that "all money arising from

fines imposed for offenses, the gist of which consists in their being committed on the Sabbath day shall be paid to the Ordinary of the county, to be by him distributed for the purpose of establishing and promoting Sabbath schools in the country." Even Mr. Crafts would scarcely have the hardihood to claim that such a law is designed merely for the protection of the "civil Sabbath."

THE Mail and Express is so delighted with the Georgia decision that a man need not be honest, that he need not pay bills contracted for Sunday service, that it says:—

In New York State, unfortunately, no such laws are on the statute books, but the increasing nuisance of the sensational Sunday papers may arouse in time a sufficiently widespread public protest as to make such a law possible. With Sunday advertising made illegal, the issue of newspapers on that day would be made financially impossible.

Very "unfortunately" indeed—for bigotry and intolerance? Is the Mail and Express troubled by the competition of the Sunday papers? It looks like it.
