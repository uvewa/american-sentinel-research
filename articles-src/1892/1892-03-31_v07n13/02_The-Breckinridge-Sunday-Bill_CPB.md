# The Breckinridge Sunday Bill.

As previously noted in these columns, the Breckinridge Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, introduced in the Fifty-first Congress by Representative W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, has been, by the same gentleman, re-introduced in the Fifty-second Congress. The bill is as follows:—

A BILL

TO PREVENT PERSONS FROM BEING FORCED TO LABOR ON SUNDAY.

*Be it enacted the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled,* That it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or to cause the same to be performed by any person in their employment on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to compel pay for labor or service performed on Sundays in violation of this act.

Any person or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation, convicted of a violation of, or who shall violate the provisions of this act, shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars for every such offense; *Provided, however,* That this act shall not be construed as intended to prevent any person or persons who conscientiously observe any other day of the week than Sunday as their day of rest.

It will be observed that the title of this bill is misleading. It is styled, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday in the District of Columbia;" the body of the bill, however, says nothing on that subject, but only proposes to fine any one who labors on Sunday whether he wants to do so or not. It would be as applicable to France as

a "bill to prevent kidnapping" and then provide, not for punishing the kidnappers, but for fining any one who should be kidnapped.

The design of this bill is not to "prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday" but to prevent them from laboring on that day when they want to. At the hearing on this bill before the House Committee on the District of Columbia, Feb. 18, 1890, an effort was made to show that it was demanded by organized labor; but one, Mr. Hobbs, Chief Officer of the Knights of Labor in the District of Columbia, appeared before the committee and said:—

> I want to deny that the Knights of Labor have authorized anybody to speak for them in this matter. Mr. Griebs came before the Congress of Labor and argued this bill, and that body refused to indorse the bill. He came before the District Assembly of the Knights of Labor (which is made up of all the Knights of Labor of the District of Columbia, and that body has refused to submit it.) Those are parties in that body who believe in the bill as it is; others who believe, certain parts of it is the bill which wholly opposed to it); and the Knights of Labor, as a body, have thought best not to have anything to do with it at this time. I am requested to say that the majority of our people believe that they ought to have a day of rest—some of them believe that they ought to have Saturday, and some believe that they ought to be working on Saturday, but as for the other feature of the bill, that they think it best not to appear here in favor of it; and I believe there is quite a portion of the Knights of Labor who believe that if they want rest on Sunday—or any other day—one of the best means by which they can compel their employers to give them rest—their best legal enactment—is that it is best to try to get it through organization. That is about a brief statement of it.

Nobody in the District of Columbia is forced to labor on a day that is regarded as sacred—to be kept holy unto the Lord—any more than he is forced to steal, do or any other wrong act, that act of the transgressor is by himself created.

Men may lose employment by refusing to work on Sunday, but they may also lose

money by not helping themselves to it when they have an opportunity.

But nobody thinks of entitling a bill to punish theft, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to steal." And yet why not?—Simply because it is perfectly proper to forbid and punish stealing, and it is not necessary to cover up the real design of a law for that purpose; but the doubt in the American mind, as to the propriety of bolstering up religious institutions by civil law, makes it necessary to disguise a law the purpose of which is to require of every individual, within its jurisdiction, a measure of religious observance.

Sunday is by many regarded as a holy day; that is why laws are demanded forbidding secular labor and business upon it. This is stated as a truism by Judge J. T. Ringgold of the Baltimore Bar in "Sunday," chapter IV. He says:

> 1. Sunday is a holy day. The holiness of Sunday is to be recognized by resting idle on that day; and not so to remain is to be immoral. . . .
>
> 2. Because this is so, every man should be compelled to observe Sunday as a religion [rest] day.

And as a belief of these propositions is properly attributable every Sunday law ever passed was enacted with the exception of that by Constantine in 321 A. D., which edit seems to have been solely in honor of the sun. The First Amendment ought to be entitled, "A bill to require everybody to manifest some regard for Sunday as a religious institution whether he may regard it or not."

The original Sabbath, is a memorial of the creation. Its intelligent observance is a recognition of God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. It pertains solely to our recognition of God. Like-wise, Sunday, the day set apart generally, is observed as a memorial of the resurrection of Christ. Its significance is therefore, wholly religious. Thus, look at it either from the standpoint of the seventh or the first day, the keeping of a weekly rest, whatever be the day, pertains wholly to religion, to the worship of God, to Christ as the proper object of worship. Therefore no man requires such observance under any protest whatever, is, as Mr. Ringgold confesses, to require the observance of a religious institution. This, Congress has no right to do in the District of Columbia any more than in the States.

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." To make a law whatever requiring any measure of religious observance would abridge the free exercise of religion, for one is not free to do that which is not moral. To be free to do, one must be equally free not to do. That conception of religious liberty which insists on an freedom to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience is a mistaken and dangerous.

The original American doctrine, is that in all matters of religion the individual

should be left absolutely free in the sense of being equally at liberty either to worship or to neglect to worship. This freedom is taken away when men are required to observe, in any measure, a religious institution. The Breckinridge Sunday bill would, therefore, be entirely out of place upon our statute books.
