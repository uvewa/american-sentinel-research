AMERICAN State Papers Bearing on Sunday Legislation." Mr. William Addison Blakely, of the University of Michigan, has compiled an exceedingly interesting and valuable book, bearing upon questions just now well to the front. It is a complete epitome of legislative and executive action, and judicial decisions upon the Sunday question in the United States. It sets forth what the author marks as "The true American idea—absolute separation of religion from the State—absolute freedom for all in religious opinions and worship." Agitators of the present day will take note of the fact that they are threshing over old straw that has been tramped and failed during the century past. Mr. Blakely begins with the beginning of the Republic and traces his history clearly and concisely in all its prominent discussions. Good people have always differed upon the question of legal enactment for Sunday observance and the union of Church and State. But as in the beginning it was thought wise to make an absolute divorce between the two—the great majority will go on thinking the same way. All history shows the danger when Church and State have combined. Christianity for its success needs no such union. The volume is one of great value, and a most careful compilation of facts bearing upon the subject.
