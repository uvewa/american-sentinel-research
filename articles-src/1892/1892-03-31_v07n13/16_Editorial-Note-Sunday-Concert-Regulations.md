UNDER an impartial application of the same regulations by which those who take part in "Sunday concerts" are forbidden to wear costumes or wigs, why would not the priests and pastors and choir boys of the different churches be restricted from wearing their robes, and all the paraphernalia of ceremonial be done away with in the churches? There may be some clergymen who even wear wigs while in their pulpits; let them direct their ushers to seat all suspicious looking strangers in the rear of the church, or some zealous detective may discover the fact and bring them to trial.
