THE Secretary of the International Law and Order League has seen fit to publish a pamphlet defending "the use of detectives." This espionage upon the moral and religious life of the community which the Law and Order League has begun can not be successfully defended, although it will, no doubt, continue to be practiced. Both the purpose and the methods of this League are dangerous in the extreme. It is the civil arm of the Sabbath Union, and the sword arm too, of which the Sabbath Union organ says, in reference to "detectives." "It is a good thing to have a sharp sword at hand, ready for use."
