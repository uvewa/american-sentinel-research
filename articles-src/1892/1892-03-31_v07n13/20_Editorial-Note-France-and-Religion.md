THE recent legislative course in France in reference to religious questions draws out widely different editorial comment from various sources. The Mail and Express and Christian Union seem to see great advancement to the cause of religion in that religion is coming to the front in French politics; while the St. Paul Dispatch says, "Perhaps the most remarkable incident in the recent life of the French republic is the introduction of the measure looking toward the regulation of religious associations. Never before was the utter absence of popular liberty, as Americans understand the term, so plainly manifested under a republican form of government."

It may be that to the Mail and Express and Christian Union the "absence of popular liberty" and the advancement of religion are not incompatible, but rather are necessary concomitants. That certainly is true of the political religion professed and advanced by the Mail and Express, but the time is scarcely ripe to acknowledge it as yet.
