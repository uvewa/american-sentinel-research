MARCH 3, Judge Porter, of Pittsburg, rendered his decision in the appealed newspaper cases sustaining the Pennsylvania Sunday law of 1794, and holding that the sale of newspapers upon the first day of the week is not a work of necessity.

BUT notwithstanding this adverse decision, Henry A. Schafer of the Paper Carriers' Union, says: "Although Judge Porter's ruling states that selling or delivering a Sunday newspaper on Sunday is an open violation of the law, we will deliver papers just the same." According to the Christian Statesman, the Mayor of the city, who is opposed to the law, responds, "Them's my sentiments;" while the Leader, Dispatch, and Press exclaim, "We, too;" this disregard of the law the Statesman characterizes as "anarchy."

Anarchy is not, however, opposition to unjust law; but opposition to all law. It was not anarchy when our forefathers threw the tea overboard in Boston harbor, nor was it anarchy when they refused to use the stamped paper prescribed for deeds and other legal documents. The British Government had no right to tax the Colonies, and resistance was in the interest of wholesome laws and good government.

ASIDE from the merits of this particular case, in Pittsburg, it is certain that the cry of "anarchy" always marks a morally weak cause. "It is the law," has in the past excused in the minds of the mass of the people the commission of most horrid cruelties inflicted in the name of justice. The Christian martyrs, of both pagan and papal times, all suffered according to law, and for violation of law. These were to a man "anarchists," in that they refused obedience to unjust laws.

SUPPOSE the Legislature of Pennsylvania were to pass a law, identical with the Sunday law of 1794, only substituting, "the seventeenth of March, commonly called St. Patrick's day," for "the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday;" and suppose the courts and "public sentiment" sustained the law, would the editor of the Christian Statesman obey it? And if not, why not? Would a refusal to obey be anarchy?

UNJUST laws have been the bulwark of oppression in every age. Witness the "Fugitive Slave law" in our own land, resisted to the bitter end by a law abiding but outraged people. Was that anarchy? It was "theft" in law for a slave to "steal" himself, that is to assert his God-given right to freedom by running away; but was it morally wrong? Was it anarchy?

SUPPOSE the law of Pennsylvania required all business houses and offices to be open all or a part of Sunday, would it be anarchy for the Statesman to close its office on that day? Certainly not; and for the reason that such a law would be an unjust interference with the inalienable rights of individuals. But is it any better for a law to require part of the community to suspend all labor and business on one day of the week because of the religious ideas of the other part of the people? Certainly not. The law, under which the Roman emperors required Christians to offer incense to Jupiter was no more unjust than is the law of Pennsylvania, which requires all men to pay a like tribute to Sunday by resting upon it. The cry of "anarchy" is the refuge of the tyrant and of the moral coward.
