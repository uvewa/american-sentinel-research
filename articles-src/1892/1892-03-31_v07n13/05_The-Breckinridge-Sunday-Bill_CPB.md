As previously noted in these columns, the Breckinridge Sunday Bill for the District of Columbia, introduced in the Fifty-first Congress, by Representative W. C. P. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, has been, by the same gentleman, re-introduced in the Fifty-second Congress. The bill is as follows:

## A BILL

TO PREVENT PERSONS FROM BEING FORCED TO

LABOR ON SUNDAY.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall be unlawful for any person or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, to perform any secular labor or business, or to cause the same to be performed by any person in their employment on Sunday, except works of necessity or mercy; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to receive pay for labor or services performed or rendered in violation of this act.

Any person or corporation, or employe of any person or corporation, in the District of Columbia, who shall violate the provisions of this act, shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars for every such offense: Provided, however, That the provisions of this act shall not be construed to apply to any person or persons who conscientiously believe in and observe any other day of the week than Sunday as a day of rest.

It will be observed that the title of this bill is misleading. It is styled, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday in the District of Columbia," the body of the bill, however, says nothing on that subject, but only proposes to fine any one who labors on Sunday whether he wants to do so or not. It would be equally as appropriate to frame

"a bill to prevent kidnapping" and then provide, not for punishing the kidnappers, but, for fining any one who should be kidnapped.

The design of this bill is not to "prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday" but to prevent them from laboring on that day when they want to. At the hearing on this bill before the House Committee on the District of Columbia Feb. 18, 1890, an effort was made to show that it was demanded by organized labor; but one, Mr. Hobbs, Chief Officer of the Knights of Labor in the District of Columbia, appeared before the committee and said:

I want to deny that the Knights of Labor have authorized anybody to speak for them in this particular matter. Mr. Crafts came before the Federation of Labor and argued this bill, and that body refused to indorse the bill. He came before the District Assembly of the Knights of Labor (which is made up of all the Knights of Labor of the Assemblies of the District of Columbia), and that body has refused to indorse it. There are parties in that body who believe in the bill as it is; others believe in a certain portion of it, and others are wholly opposed to it; and the Knights of Labor, as a whole, have thought best not to have anything to do with it. Every Knight of Labor is in favor of a day of rest—some of them believe that they ought to have two days of rest. . . . They do not believe in working on Sunday, but as for the other feature of the bill, they think it best not to appear here in favor of it; and I believe there is quite a lot of the members of the Order who believe that if they want rest on Sunday—or any other day—they can get it through their labor organizations, and that it is best not to try to get it through Congress by a sort of a church movement.

Nobody in the District of Columbia is forced to labor on a day that he regards as sacred—to be kept holy unto the Lord—any more than he is forced to steal, or do any other wrong act, that at the time might appear to be for his financial benefit. Men may lose employment by refusing to work on Sunday, but they may also lose

"Rev. W. F. Crafts, the author of the "Sabbath for Man," "Addresses on the Civil Sabbath," etc., in the latter work says: "I have searched the world over in vain for an affirmative answer to the question, Did you ever know a man financially ruined by refusing to do Sunday work? I have found scores of instances where courageous conscientiousness in this matter led to promotion, none where it led to poverty." Thus, Mr. Crafts himself being the witness, it appears that no man is compelled even by circumstances to work on Sunday.

money by not helping themselves to it when they have an opportunity.

But nobody thinks of entitling a bill to punish theft, "A bill to prevent persons from being forced to steal." And why not?—Simply because it is perfectly proper to forbid and punish stealing, and it is not necessary to cover up the real design of a law for that purpose; but the doubt in the American mind, as to the propriety of bolstering up religious institutions by civil law, makes it necessary to disguise a law the purpose of which is to require of every individual, within its jurisdiction, a measure of religious observance.

Sunday is by many regarded as a holy day, and that is why laws are demanded forbidding secular labor and business upon it. This is stated as a truism by Hon. J. T. Ringgold of the Baltimore Bar in "Law of Sunday." He says:—

1. Sunday is a holy day. 2. The holiness of Sunday is to be recognized by remaining idle on that day; and not so to remain is to be immoral, 3. Sunday idleness is enforced as a religious [Christian] duty in the individual.

And to a belief of these propositions is properly attributable every Sunday law that ever was enacted with the exception of that by Constantine, in 321 A. D., which edict seems to have been solely in honor of the sun god. Mr. Breckinridge's bill ought to be entitled, "A bill to require everybody to manifest some regard for Sunday as a religious institution whether they so regard it or not."

The original Sabbath is a memorial of the creation. Its intelligent observance is a recognition of God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. It pertains solely to our recognition of God. Likewise, Sunday, the day now generally kept, is observed as a memorial of the resurrection of Christ. Its significance is, therefore, wholly religious. Thus, look at it either from the standpoint of the seventh or the first day, the keeping of a weekly rest, has reference to the recognition of God as the proper object of worship. Therefore to require such observance under any pretext whatever, is, as Mr. Ringgold confesses, to require the observance of a religious institution. This, Congress has no right to do in the District of Columbia or anywhere else.

The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." To make any law whatever requiring any measure of religious observance would abridge the free exercise of religion, for one is not free to do that which he must do. To be free to do, one must be equally free not to do. That conception of religious liberty which defines it as "freedom to worship God according to the dictates of a right conscience" is misleading and dangerous. The original American doctrine is, that in all matters of religion the individual should be left absolutely free in the sense of being equally at liberty either to worship or to neglect to worship. This freedom is taken away when men are required to observe, in any measure, a religious institution. The Breckinridge Sunday bill would, therefore, be entirely out of place upon our statute books.
