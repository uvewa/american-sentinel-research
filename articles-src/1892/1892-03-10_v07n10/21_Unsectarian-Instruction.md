The religious instruction now given in the institutions, which would be opened to the priests by this Freedom-of-Worship Bill, is what is known as "unsectarian religious instruction." However, such religious instruction is "unsectarian" only as to Protestants. From a Roman Catholic standpoint this so-called "unsectarian" instruction is intensely sectarian, for it is anti-papal.
