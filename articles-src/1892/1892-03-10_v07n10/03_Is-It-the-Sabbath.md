# Is It the Sabbath?

*(Concluded.)*

The advocates of Sunday sacredness claim no positive command or example as their warrant for keeping the day, but seek to make it appear from certain texts in the New Testament that Sunday was by the apostles and their immediate converts regarded as the Sabbath. It is proper, therefore, that we examine briefly the several texts in the Bible that speak of Sunday, or rather the first day of the week, for a name is nowhere in the Holy Scriptures given to that day.

The first day of the week is mentioned in the Scriptures only eight times. In not one instance is it called the Sabbath or a Sabbath, as twice it is plainly distinguished from the Sabbath. The first of these texts is Matt. 28:1. "In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre." The two other evangelists make this clear distinction between the Sabbath and the first day of the week.

In Luke 23:56 and 24:1, the record is: "And they returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them."

The distinction made in these texts is very significant, especially in view of the fact that both Matthew and Luke, and, recorded, their own words, both had the words of the Spirit of God; and wrote some thirty-one to thirty-three years after the resurrection of Christ, at which time the change of the Sabbath is said to have been made. It is inconceivable that they should have used each language unless they meant very positively to affirm that the disciples did not call the seventh day the Sabbath. But such ignorance on their part is *prima facie* evidence that no such change had been made, at least not by divine authority.

The first day of the week mentioned by Matthew and Luke, is also mentioned by Mark and John (Mark 16:9; John 21:1; but neither of them gives any addition or any of any change in the Sabbath, or any new name, nor any reason to observe it. Sunday is with them simply, "the first day of the week," while in both their narratives (though not in as close connection as in Matthew and Luke), another day is called "the Sabbath."

The next mention of the first day of the week occurs in Acts 20:7, where we find an account of a night meeting held upon that day. The record runs thus:

> And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. And they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted.

Acts shows that it was Paul's custom to preach in the Jewish synagogues on the Sabbath day. He came there to teach the Jews first; but he also preached to the Gentiles. There was nothing strange in his preaching on this occasion, because, when he was with us at ease, we took him in, and he preached.

It is assumed by many that this meeting was upon Sunday evening; but that was the case is by no means clear. In the first place, in the Scriptures the day begins not at midnight, as with us, but in the evening, at the setting of the sun. In Lev. 23:32, we read, "From even unto even, shall ye celebrate your Sabbath;" and from Mark 1:32 we learn that "even" was at the setting of the sun.

In Luke 23:19 we have this testimony: "And it was good." And it came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be shut before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath; and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should be no burden brought in the Sabbath day. This agrees with the *septuagint,* "And the evening and the morning were the first day," etc., in the first chapter of Genesis. In *re:* obliging Gentiles the *Jews* still reckons the day from sunset to sunset; as do also those Christians who observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. It is evident, therefore, that this meeting was held on what we call Saturday night; that is upon the first or dark part of the first day of the week. Bible time. And it may change, as still required the seventh day as the Sabbath. But such ignorance on their part is *prima facie* evidence that no such change had been made, at least not by divine authority.

not just a week, a some months, but a period of more than eight years, was it apart from a comparison of Matt. 12:1, 2, with Luke 13:9, 28. In the first of these latter we read that "after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light." Luke says "And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering." Now if "after six days" is "about eight," then "after eight days" is just a week, and that is manifestly to insist that "after eight days" is just a week, and that John 20:19 as account of a religion and meeting of the first day of the week which our Lord was present. But to such straits are they driven who would find Bible sanction for Sunday-keeping.

The remaining text supposed to refer to the first day of the week, and frequently appealed to, to prove its sacred character, is Rev. 1:10: "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." Israel Sabbath not a great voice, as of a trumpet." This text does not say that John was in the Spirit on the first day of the week, or upon Sunday, but that he "was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." To assume, therefore, that the Lord's day is Sunday, is to assume the very thing in dispute. The fact remains that the Lord has in the Scriptures a day which he claims as his own, a day for his worship; but it does not tell us it was that first day question.

In a former article was quoted a portion of a fourth commandment (Isa. 58:13, 14), in which occur these words: "The seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." According to the fourth commandment, these instances, which is the Lord's day?--Not the first, but the seventh. But we have also these Scriptures directly upon this point, see Isa. 13:15, we have this testimony:

> "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shall thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Here the Lord expressly claims the Sabbath as his day.

It is said that "Lord's day" means the Lord Christ's Day. Be it so; the truth is the same; for our Saviour declares (Mark 2:28) that he is Lord "of the Sabbath day," so that whether we follow the expression "Lord's day" to the Father or the Son, makes no the slightest difference, for he invariably states that the Sabbath, the seventh day, is the Lord's day.

As THE SENTINEL has so often said, the truth or falsity of the claims of the Sunday-Sabbath can not affect the right of the State to require its observance; the State has no such right in any event; but in view of the fact that it is without a shadow of divine authority, the hope of the hopeless that claims for civil law to compel all men to keep it, stands out all the more boldly, and is shown to be positively without excuse.
