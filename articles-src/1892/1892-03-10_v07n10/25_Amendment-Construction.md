As The Sentinel has previously remarked, concerning this amendment, it might be so construed as to cut off all appropriations for religious purposes. The effect of the amendment, should it be adopted, will all depend upon the turn given to the terms, "sectarian" and "ecclesiastical." As these terms are now used by many, the amendment would cut off all State aid to Catholics but leave the doors wide open for the indirect support of that colorless thing called "unsectarian religious instruction."
