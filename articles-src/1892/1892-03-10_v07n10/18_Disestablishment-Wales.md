As might have been expected, disestablishment of the Church of Wales has been defeated in Parliament. In that country the Established Church is greatly in the minority, but it has the advantage of being entrenched in the law, and so by brute force, holds the whole country under tribute to it. However, with the election of a new Parliament, which can not be long delayed, disestablishment may come.
