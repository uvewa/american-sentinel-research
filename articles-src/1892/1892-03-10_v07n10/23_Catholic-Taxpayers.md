The Sentinel has not the least sympathy with the assumption, that Romanism is the only true religion, and that therefore all other religious instruction is insufficient; but it is the right of that church to so hold, and to so teach; and it is manifestly unjust to require Catholics to contribute to the support of schools, and other institutions, in which the falsity of the papal claim is taught. Protestants ought to deny the Roman assumption; and as far as possible, by proper means fortify the minds of the rising generation against papal superstitions; but they ought to be at the expense themselves, and not ask the Catholics to help foot the bills.
