The papal theory of religion is that all religions, except the Roman Catholic, are either entirely false or else insufficient for the moral uplifting of man, and for the salvation of the soul, and that the church, that is the Papal Church, is alone authorized to teach religion. 'It follows that the teaching of any other religion is itself a denial of the doctrines and claims of Romanism; in short, such religious instruction is essentially Protestant; and in the very nature of the case it can not be otherwise.
