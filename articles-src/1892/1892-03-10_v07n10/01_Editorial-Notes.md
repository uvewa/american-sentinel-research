# Editorial Notes.

Give ye mankind but one clew to overcome—equal and exact justice; that he guarantees shall be always expediency. Devotions our safety—that's—plain only the tiniest of concession—you know not how many branches of evil it produces.—*Wendell Phillips.*

It must be remembered that if we would maintain our free institutions, we must protect the rights of minorities, and learn to throw every privilege and immunity that is accorded the majority, and that every man's rights must be protected whether he stands alone or with the Nation. We must remember, too, the fellowship of mankind to enforce obedience to their religions and their customs.—*W. A.*

The morality of a derived religion which the State will do best to best express, will be conditioned by the condemnation of its agency to, on its part by any attempt to administer things spiritual. The State can no religion have so great as to have nothing to do with it, and itself to have or favor no greatest by its religion alone. The moment the State pays its alliance with one church both are injured.—*Samuel T. Spear, D.D.*

God is the great moral Governor; to him every soul is responsible; to him every free moral agent must give account. To permit civil power to come between the individual and God, would destroy the individual responsibilities toward God. If it were the province of the State to enforce the law of God, the individual would not actually need to observe, and the will of God, but the will of the State. And the effect would be to put the State in the place of God, just as the Papacy puts the Pope in the place of God, "as that as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." But God has no vicegerent upon earth.
