# Sunday at the World's Fair.

Petitioners are going up to Washington from all parts of the country asking Congress to vote no aid to the World's Fair at Chicago unless the management of that institution give the right that it shall close up on Sundays. Temperance women also absolutely refused to contribute a solitary cent to the glorious exhibit of the arts of civilized countries,--if it is to be an exhibit of the army of politicians, Church and State in this country--religion in a republic never being permitted to share by governmental interference. At this late Congress can not afford to legislate upon laws against this, the municipal regulation, of enterprises, the municipal regulation, and Chicago will fall to the ground, after the right of petition has ever been used in this country. The best and brightest part of the international countries of the world will no one exhibition at this Columbian Fair, and we are not fit of a nation to exclude those whose only cause will be on Sunday. Certainly, we all should remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy--but, by legislation, whose Sabbath? New York the city alone, and New York County tells us that in New York City alone, there are two hundred and fifty thousand Jews, whose Sabbath begins on Friday. Those announced real estate values there valued at $30,000,000, and that sixty-five Jewish lawyers admitted to the bar, and that they can have no reason, who should say they have, to irritate in this New York alone, this class of citizens scattered all over the United States. Yet, they are not asking that the exhibit be closed on *their* Sabbath, which they very devoutly believe is the Sabbath of the Bible.--It will not do to name all these as "infidels," or "foreigners," for a large proportion of them were born Americans.

Again, there is another to the religious sect in our country, coming up to the full stature of good citizenship, with all that this phrase implies. They own printing offices and new publishing papers, books, and magazines and advocating their sincere convictions that Saturday is the orthodox Sabbath. Their churches and school-houses are beginning to be seen, and their voices are being heard far and through an educated ministry and distinguished professors. These be native born Americans, citizens, and yet you do not hear of the Seventh-day Adventists petitioning to close the World's Fair against the world on their own Sabbath. Indeed it is a sad stain upon the world, that the Gentile nations are all narrow. Narrow gauge roads were all years ago widened into the standard broad gauge, and now, if a person expects to reach his destination in good shape and on time, he must travel on the broad gauge. It's so in religion, politics, and business. Then, there are in this country regions of quite respectable people, representing the religious convictions, and citizenship, and morality of their various localities, and what they belong to do church and say their doubt the chronology that from the Sabbath of the Bible on Sunday. Are any of their views entitled to less respect or consideration by those worthy petitioners? But, there does not appear, especially in behalf of that rest and meritorious body of Christians to whom Sunday is their only day of rest, devotion and recreation and the world and children. The arts and sciences and--the commercial beauty and glory of all civilized countries--will be to them as nothing if they are assailed on Sunday from this, the grandest and most magnificent exhibit of civilization ever devised by man and carried to perfection by his genius and liberality. It is grand enough for the rich and well-to-do. Close who can make any day of the week a season of rest, and diversion, devote to put those the persons who would restrain their less fortunate companions from this, all human rights. But the workingman, to whom the labor of a day represents from one to five dollars, it means utter starvation for family and self and family. In and around Chicago there are hundreds of thousands of respectable, intelligent, clerks and mechanics in like situation. Many of these would, if they could, take the little ones and wives to visit the vast aggregate of human skill called the World's Fair--the agricultural and mechanical halls, botanical gardens, etc. But the portals of this great national exhibit for employment, and recreation, are sought to be barred on the only day where the workers could make of the opportunities of the occasion. Fairly of sides concerned, questionless reasons will be open. But she who walks in the whole the wonders of the flora and animal world are displayed--the spacious galleries that hold treasures of art has would their equal as a dream of delight in the thoughts of the tired women whose boundaries lie well pleased within the narrow limits of the back yard. Who will presume to deny this privilege to be closed. Public opinion should not have a privileged class to grow up to curtail the most privileges of the intelligent, perspective poor. God bless the tirpan Sabbath of the poor man's--rest, devotion, and recreation. The civil Sabbath of free America has nothing to gain by petition; but it to the extreme of personal oppression.

Front communication as this, published in the "Pearl of Days," show the progress of the popular movement for the recognition of Sunday throughout the world. The French Popular League is wiser in its generation than the American Sabbath Union and avoids committing itself in so many words to the civil enforcement of Sunday regulations; nevertheless they are affiliated organizations with the same general purpose in view.

POPULAR LEAGUE FOR SABBATH REST IN FRANCE.

178 Boulevard St. Germain,

Paris, France, Feb. 1, 1892.

Sir and Dear Brother:--I have the honor of receiving your telegram and of communicating to you the salutation of the French Sabbath-day League. The reading of it was received with overwhelming applause.

International solidarity in this cause of humanity, and it is pleasant and encouraging for the coordinators of your desire to feel themselves is this community of ideas and efforts in behalf of the observance of the Sabbath under the same forms of government.

Accept also, therefore, with all my heart, as secretary of the Popular League, my deep sympathy, and I beg you will accept my very sincere expression.

*Secretary to the Popular League,* the American Sabbath Union.

To COL ELLIOT F. SHEPARD, *President of the American Sabbath Union.*

Under the title "Mass Meeting of the Wicked," a *special* from Chicago, as follows:

> One thousand members of the Trade and Labor Union, an organization which opposes the reading of the Bible in the public schools, and the repeal of all laws on Sabbath observance, the admission of no one else religious exercise as part of general celebrations or religious festivals and feasts, and the exemption of church property from taxation, held a mass meeting in Central Hall to night for the purpose of protesting against the closing of the World's Fair on Sundays. The statement has received the report of all the Socialists and Anarchists organizations in the city.

It is said that, in addition to demanding that the doors of the Exposition be opened on Sundays, motion and ordinary trading be carried on on the same day. It is demanded further that the Fair grounds shall not be used for religious services on the Fair grounds.

It is remarkable that it is but the first of a series of gatherings that will be continued as long as the efforts to compel the exposure of Sunday continue in the observance of the Sabbath by the Fair admission.

It is a remarkable fact, worthy of notice in this item, that, outside of the claim that the unrestrained side of it seems to be asked, the position attributed to this "mass meeting of the wicked," is in the interest of Christianity, pure and simple. The statement that the running of machinery and personal trading be carried on Sunday does not, even that Monday labor and Sunday selling should be compulsory in the Fair. This firm, putting the matter is quite sweeping among these thousands of people, to endeavour to close the Fair. "Whatever I would that others should do, that shall also be compelled to do." The Sabbath Union denies the authority of the Bible, and then acts upon the prayer, "Whatever I would that others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them."
