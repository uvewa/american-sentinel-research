The question of teaching religion in the public schools is one that will not down. The advocates of a national religion are of course logical and consistent in attempting to use State and national means for its promulgation. That California is feeling the premeditations of a coming agitation of this subject is shown by the following editorial item from the Grass Valley Union:—

"A controversy appears to be raging in the State Normal School at San Jose as to whether or not the Bible should be read in the school. Any dispute of this kind is to be greatly regretted. The public schools and the public school system of the State are well managed, and religious questions have nothing to do with them. This is one of the cases in which it is proper to let well enough alone. In this connection there is a rumor throughout the State that during the last few months religious exercises of some nature have been conducted on Sunday in the university buildings at Berkeley by professors of the institution. This is probably untrue, but were it correct it would show bad taste and wrong judgment. The buildings have never been open on Sunday during the twenty years of their existence, and should be used for the purposes for which they are built, and for which every class of people pays taxes."
