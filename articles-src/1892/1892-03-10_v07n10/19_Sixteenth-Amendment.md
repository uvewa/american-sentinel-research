In commenting upon the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Christian at Work says: "This amendment forbids any appropriation of public moneys to sectarian purposes. . . . Its adoption would at once solve the vexed public-school question in every State in the Union. It would also render the introduction or passage of such measures as the Freedom-of-Worship Bill impossible."
