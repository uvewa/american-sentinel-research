# More Judicial Legislation in Tennessee.

The question of the competency of witnesses is a vital matter in the trial of any case or in the discussion of any subject wherein parties differ. If by any means a witness, whose testimony is necessary to establish a certain line of evidence, can be excluded from giving that testimony, as incompetent to be heard in the witness chair, then from lack of proof of essential facts an unjust cause may be won and a good cause may be lost.

Upon the subject of competency of witnesses the code of Tennessee, 1858, says:

> *Every person of sufficient capacity to understand the obligation of an oath, is competent to be a witness in any court in this State.*

The succeeding sections of the Article of course certify exceptions wherein certain persons are or may be held incompetent to testify,--wisely guilty of certain heinous crimes, and when incompetent by reason of special faculty or legal relations to the parties in a case. But it is not enacted that religious belief or unbelief enters into the question of competency in any degree. It would therefore naturally be supposed that it would be entirely unnecessary to go any farther in this investigation, so far as the jurisprudence and judicial decisions of the State of Tennessee are concerned,--particularly as the Constitution of the State expressly lays down this broad principle, that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for holding office in the State, nor as a qualification for jury service. It would, therefore, be supposed that no religious test would be demanded as to the competency of witnesses in a court where neither the judge who sits on the bench, nor the jury upon whose verdict the life, liberty, or property of the party at bar may depend,--"if he can not be required to be of any specified religious creed, or to have any religious belief at all,"--then, certainly, it would not be expected that any such discrimination would hold the witnesses who may appear before such a court. It would seem that the incongruity of such a discrimination would make this impossible, and the evident deduction from such a situation, that the professing Christian or atheist prisoner would, by asserting his privilege to be tried by his peers, have the right to call for a Christian or atheist judge and jury by whom his case might be tried without prejudice,--would cause the ridiculousness of subjecting the witness to a religious test, while the Constitution prohibited applying to judge and jury, to appear so clearly that the possibility of its application to a witness would not be suggested.

But the compilers of the code have fabricated a foot-note to section 4596, in which certain references are given; thus:

> As to incompetency on account of the Article of faith, in this State, see 1 Swan 11, Haywood, page 1; Meigs 51; 1 Head, 131; 2 Head, 310.

Before acquiring the testimony of the cases on this count it might be well to consult these cases. The first is 1 Swan, 10, is that of State vs. Cooper, tried in the Superior Court of law at Knoxville, at Knoxville, in September 1807. This case must speak for itself. After what has been said of the spirit of the Constitution of the State on such a question as this and the broad statement of the code that every person capable of comprehending the obligation of an oath is incompetent to act as witness, no other testimony could be believed, and so added, to say a good deal on the whole of this case. "No person can be a witness who does not believe in a future state of rewards and punishment." The case of three men was presented thus:

> dared as to the credibility of future Paley, and really that he had not indeed Paley say that he so believes that there was either God or devil, that he be admitted as witness.--To this Mr. Campbell agrees but adds, in reference to the "decisions of various courts in the United States. There is entire unanimity in holding that the witness must believe in the existence of a God will punish falshood." Greenleaf deals with the question much more at length, but restates the same thoughts and repeats the same facts.

According to the unquestionable testimony of all the Tennessee cases bearing upon the issue, the English Church and State courts have been impliedly followed in the United States upon the question of the competency of witnesses, solely upon a religious basis, without the slightest thought having ever been given as to whether it was or was not in keeping with constitutional principles.

Thus Judge Campbell, in this case, undoubtedly excludes from the witness stand every one who does not "believe in a future state of existence, rewards, and punishment." And Judge Overton concurs with him, only marking out the course of examination by which a man may so readily be ascertained whether or no the creed of the witness is such as will render him incompetent to testify. And this, although Campbell had shown, and it had not been denied, that there was no authority for such a holding. But this case was tried in 1807, and perhaps it is referred to merely as ancient history. The next citation, possibly, will be in consonance with the language and spirit of the section of the code which we have already quoted. It is the case of *Bennett vs. the State,* 1 Swan 11, heard at the April term of the Supreme Court at Jackson, Tennessee, 1852; a portion of this case reads thus:

> The competency of a witness, one of the prisoners, John Edgar, to testify as a witness. It appears he was sworn on *voir dire*, and on being interrogated by the defendants' counsel, as to his religious belief, stated "that he did not believe in a state of future rewards and punishments, nor in a God, and did not think that punishment inflicted for wrong in this life, was the page of conscience, but he believed in the existence of a God, he also believed the Bible." The court then held him for a competent witness; and it is clear from the examination that the belief in a future state of rewards and punishments is neither essential nor even required to be tested. We cite it, however, he means not to dissent, but on the contrary, delivered an opinion in full of the bench in a future state; but entertains an opinion different from many persons as to the nature of the punishment--an opinion in which he is by no means alone.

It seems that the view of the ancient judge is, notwithstanding the lapse of time, still that of Judge McKinney, in this case. He evidently considers it necessary that to be a competent witness a man must believe in a future state of rewards and punishments. Although he tried to reach this conclusion by a roundabout road, instead of making his position as clear as was done by Judge Campbell in the case just considered.

*Overton J.* considered this question of importance and took a view of the English authorities. *Prima facie*, every person of a country where he is in a future state of rewards and punishments cannot, let his religion be what it may, is competent as a witness. These observations or personal opinions can give in no case the strength of reasons that the common or natural sayings can be given in evidence for the establishment of a settled belief should be produced. The same question may be asked in this case, as the others which relates to reputation,--what is good reputation, on particular opinions, under the code of competency of witnesses?

This Judge Campbell, in this case, undoubtedly excludes from the witness stand every one who does not "believe in a future state of existence, rewards, and punishment." And Judge Overton concurs with him, only marking out the course of examination by which it may so readily to ascertain whether or no the creed of the witness is such as will render incompetent to testify. And this, although Campbell had shown, and it had not been denied, that there was no authority for such a holding. But this case was tried in 1807, and perhaps it is referred to merely as ancient history. The next citation, possibly, will be in consonance with the language and spirit of the section of the code which we have already quoted. It is the case of *Bennett vs. the State,* 1 Swan 11, heard at the April term of the Supreme Court at Jackson, Tennessee, 1852; a portion of this case reads thus:

The Court would not admit this evidence although it held that the defendant produced evidence as to the "separate religious reputation" of Stephens or simply questions the witness himself as to his religious belief. This the defendant's counsel would not do, and the case went to a conviction under *Stephens' Statute* law. In his decision upon appeal Judge McKinney said:

> It is admitted that the semblance imputed to the effect of a religious examination, renders him competent to testify as a witness, and the only question is whether the refusal of the court to admit the evidence is reversible. In this point a difference prevails is possible. Mr. Greenleaf states that the courts of this country hold that the only examination to determine the religious opinions in the competency of a witness is "by the oath of the witness himself on his *voir dire.*" Vol. 1, sec. 370, and note 3. And according to some of the authorities referred to in the note, if the witness answers that he believes in a God, this is sufficient evidence to establish his religious belief. On the other hand Mr. Starkie observes, "that where a party called as a witness takes the oath, he may be asked whether he believes in the existence of God, and the obligation of an oath; and in a future state of rewards and punishments, if it is shown he has refused or admitted to give evidence." We have held before, in an issue specifically, that the party entitled to challenge a witness on this ground, may adopt either mode of examination.

Thus, in establishing the incompetency of a material witness, an impeachment, or a prayer for a receiver of stolen goods or reliance. The authorities referred to here, let it be noticed, are Greenleaf, and Starkie, both text-book authors.

The next case is that of *Anderson vs. Massey,* heard in the Supreme Court by Judge McKinney, in 1871. In the questions involved, in reference to the competency of the witness, the case is about precisely similar to that just given, and the judge quotes, as to the rule of competency, "with special reference" from the decision in the case of *Harvel vs. the State,* 1 Head 235. This "special reference" includes the whole of that case, and renders its own decision.

Upon this authority, which sets out and acts on the basis of precedent, the Circuit Court judge was trying a case. The Circuit Court Judge sent to it the instructions of the directions of Drury Smith, as to the matter of religious belief in a future state of rewards and punishments, and as requiring the examination of the witness himself by the judge or jury as to the nature of the religious belief of the witness, in order to establish the competency of the witness and the instructions for the issue of the jury. For this the case was appealed; and Judge McKinney reversed for another trial.

Again, a witness is considered incompetent who is "untaught" to "materialism." In this case is decided under the same absence of reason and precedent that characterized the first case; there was added to this bill of rights, in reference to juries, "and no person shall be disqualified from serving as a juror, on account of his religious opinions or for want of any religious belief." It was shown as a qualification for jurors, "Thus his constitutional theory and the judicial prescription draw farther apart; the one contracting as the other advances."

One of the authorities upon which Judge McKinney bases his opinion is the "Law of Evidence," by Stephens; referring to the *Twelve Temples,* one of Her Majesty's judges, "What the law is in England, and what Her Majesty's Council may say."

Before a witness takes the oath, he may be asked on his *voir dire* whether he believes in the obligation of an oath, in the existence of God, and a state of rewards and punishment, and the opinion of the court of the existence of God, the question of whether he ought to be admitted is left to the judge. We, of course, know what the law of England is on this subject. We know what was the law of the world, although it does not believe in a future state of rewards and punishments, and "is not bound to speak the truth, merely having a good opportunity for the same."
