# Editorial Paragraphs.

NOTE.--Any one receiving the AMERICAN SENTINEL without having ordered it may know that it is sent to him by some friend. Therefore, those who have not ordered the SENTINEL need have no fears that they will be asked to pay for it.

---

The bill to authorize an appropriation to maintain the Metropolitan Museum of Art and keep it open on Sundays, has passed the New York Senate. "It ought soon to become law," says the *World*, "and throw its double that it is all."

---

NEVER before were the advocates of religious legislation so active or so aggressive now. Both Congress and the several State Legislatures are being fairly deluged with petitions asking for legislation of a religious character. The friends of this measure are concerning Sunday.

---

As might have been expected, disestablishment of the Church of Wales has been defeated in Parliament. It is that country the Established Church is greatly in the minority, but it has the advantage of being entrenched in the law, and so by brute force, holds the whole country under its control. But Britain cannot long defer the action of a new Parliament, and disestablishment may not be long delayed; disestablishment may not be long delayed.

---

In commenting upon the proposed fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the *Christian at Work* says: "This amendment forbids any State to appropriate public money to sectarian purposes. . . . Its adoption would not cancel any vote observed by the United States in every State in the Union. It would also render this resolution or passage of such measures as the Presidential Congress."

---

The *Freedom of Worship* Bill is a measure now before the Legislature of New York which provides that no institution in this State shall compel any State aid unless it is free and open for any denomination to hold religious services for the benefit of such inmates as desire the services of that particular sect. Of course the object of the bill is to secure the admission of Romish priests to certain institutions supported by the State, but under Protestant control so far as the religious instruction given is concerned.

---

The religious instruction now given in the institutions, which would be opened to the priests by this Freedom of Worship Bill, is what is known as "unsectarian religious instruction." However, such religious instruction is "unsectarian" only as to Protestants. From a Roman Catholic standpoint this so-called "unsectarian" instruction is intensely sectarian, for it is anti-papal.

---

The papal theory of religion is that all religions, except the Roman Catholic, are either entirely false or else insufficient for the moral uplifting of man, and for the salvation of the soul, and that the church, that is the Papal Church, is alone authorized to teach religion. It follows that the teaching of any other religion is itself an act of doctrine and a violation of the Romanism; in short, such religious instruction is essentially Protestant; and in the very nature of the case it can not be otherwise.

---

THE SENTINEL has not the most sympathy with the assumption, that Protestantism is the only true religion, and that therefore all other religions instruction is unprotestant; but it is the right of that church so to hold, and to teach, and it is manifestly unjust to require Catholics to contribute to the support of schools, and other institutions, in which the beliefs of the papal claim is taught. Protestant ought to pay for Roman sovereignty, and as far as possible, by proper means fortify the minds of the rising generation against papal superstition; but they ought to be at the expense themselves, and not ask Catholics to help foot the bills.

---

THE AMERICAN State is, or at least professes to be, purely secular. This is the American theory of civil government, and it is the correct theory. The proposed sixteenth Amendment is not, however, designed to convent what shame as this; it provides, it is true, that no State shall "use its property for, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control," but the well-known views of the promoters of this measure forbid the hope that they intend anything more than to cut off State appropriations to Roman Catholic institutions.

---

As THE SENTINEL has previously remarked, concerning this amendment, it might be so contrived as to cut off all appropriation for religious purposes. The effect of the amendment, should it be adopted, will be determined entirely by the terms, "sectarian" and "ecclesiastical." As these terms are now used by many, the amendment would cut off all State aid to Catholics but leave the doors wide open for the indirect support of that colorless thing called "unsectarian religious instruction."

---

A good deal is being said by both press and pulpit on the subject of marriage and divorce, and the religious press especially is deploring the great increase in the number of divorces granted. The remedy proposed is the law, in the direction of a rational divorce law, or at least in the amendment of the divorce laws of the several States. But this arrangement has the real difficulty. The fault is not in the laws but in the morals of the people. A change in the laws might make fewer divorces, but would not give to it the morality which gives to divorces. It is well to have good marriage and divorce laws; it is better to have a good moral community. Legislators can make the laws: individuals can not make the moral.

---

A MASTER asks to be advised as to the propriety of signing the following pledge, which is being circulated very extensively in an initiative of the *Voice,* of this city.

We, the undersigned, being profoundly impressed with the imperative need of removing the overthrow of evil political influence, and the overwhelming civic political influence, and in behalf of our homes, families, and country, we ought to take more direct action for moral and political reform; and that to this end we should own a united as a thrust at the liquor sale purposes, and select and vote for moral candidates for the candidates of the Prohibition party ticket first, and for the candidacy and advocacy of the Prohibition party platform.

---

THE SENTINEL can not better answer than in the words of holy writ: "He that wavereth is a matter before unto the." Prov. 18:13. As yet, nobody knows what the platform of the Prohibition Party will be, or who will be its candidates, the platform will only make such a pledge or guilty he must be on his own manhood, for he abdicates his right to exercise his private judgment.

---

PAGANISM is the body, of which all but "Christ is the soul." What folly then to balk of enforcing morality by civil law.

---

It is a contradiction to let a man be free, and force him to be religious.
