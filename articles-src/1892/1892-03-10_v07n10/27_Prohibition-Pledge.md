A reader asks to be advised as to the propriety of signing the following pledge, which is being circulated very extensively at the instance of the Voice, of this city:—

We, the undersigned, being profoundly impressed with the aggressive power of the liquor traffic, and the overwhelming evils, political, industrial, and moral, growing out of it, believe that a strong influence would be exerted upon public sentiment and a long step taken toward the eradication of those evils if the enemies of the liquor traffic would present as united a front as the liquor dealers present when their business is attacked. We therefore agree to vote, at the Presidential election in 1892, for the candidates of the Prohibition Party for President and Vice-President, provided that the signatures of one million voters be secured to this agreement.

The Sentinel can not better answer this than in the words of holy writ: "He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him." Prov. 18:13. As yet, nobody knows what the platform of the Prohibition Party will be, nor who will be its candidates. The man who signs such a pledge is guilty of treason to his own manhood, for he abdicates the right to exercise his private judgment.
