# Republic and Sunday Laws.

*The Christian Statesman,* of February 10, 1892, has the following argument on Republic and Sunday laws:--

> A republic can not exist without morality, nor morality without religion, nor religion without the Sabbath nor the Sabbath without law.

Surely these propositions must be the least essential in religion, it is not, however, all that is essential to true religion.

Prayer is essential. Let us try the same logic with reference to this: A republic can not exist without morality, nor morality without religion, nor religion without prayer, nor prayer without law; therefore the Government must make a law requiring all to pray. This is as logical for the other, for those who fail and do not pray to God are as truly irreligious and those who do not keep his Sabbath. And this is the logic of National Reformers, who know of no other way to advance religion than by law. With them the law is the last resort at all times.

Such reasoning makes human law (for that is the sort of law that is meant), the ultimate source of religion. Religion cannot exist without the Sabbath, nor the Sabbath exist without law; therefore, to have religion, the Government must legislate,--must pass a Sabbath law! For it is to say that religion can not exist without the aid and support of the Government--that is, in other words, without Church and State being united. But who does not know better? Who does not know that it has existed not only without the aid of but has in spite of it? Witness the rise and progress of Christianity during the first two centuries.

If the *Statesman* had said, a republic can not exist without morality, nor morality without religion, nor religion without conviction and a change of heart, which can be affected by no human law, but by the preaching of the gospel and the influence of the Spirit of God only, it would have come nearer the truth. A putrid heart in the only place where genuine religion can dwell. But the heart can be purified only by God, and that by faith. Acts 15. Republics must get good convention, but it is the goodness of God, not civil law, that leads to repentance. Rom. 2:4. As well might a man seek to purify a greater stream, divert it from thither, as to expect the fruits of religion from those who are unregenerate. It is only the good man out of the good treasure of his heart that brings forth good fruit. That religion which expects Sabbath-keeping, religion, and morality, but will be accepted is to God, to come from unregenerated hearts, is not the religion of Jesus Christ, but the doctrine of antichrist. All the religion that ever came or can ever come from laws enacted by civil governments can at best be only in form. It is the religion of the National Reform party, the American Sabbath Union, and all the other Sunday-law parties and Sunday-day Sabbath-keepers. It is not the religion that is to save or that emanate from the outside but from within. Those holding it are well described by the Apostle Paul in 2 Tim. 3:1-5 as those having "a form of godliness but denying the power thereof." What is it but a greater denial of the power of God to transform the heart, renew the mind, and purify the soul, to say or to assert that religion is dependent for its existence upon the legislative enactments of mere men, and wicked men at that?

It is not true that the true Sabbath has for its foundation and support human law; it is the law of Him who made the Sabbath, and if they would be true, it is so made. This Sabbath is no more dependent for its existence upon human laws than are the continuing stars and those who observe it.

Wherever men are found, who know nothing and worship and keep, and there will be found those who keep, as best of the week, the Sabbath of the fourth commandment of the Sabbath of the Lord, in memory of whose works and is in honor of whom it was made. But this is in no way to roads: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, etc." Here is the all-sufficient Sabbath law. He who has this law for the foundation of his Sabbath observance has none to other. But the last man who really and truly keeps the one the Statesman and its allies are observing, is declaring to the world that he is not seeking character for God. For he is in earnest the Sabbath of their Lord and Master. The Sabbath of the Lord needs no law, support, and those who observe it ask for nothing but to be let alone, to be allowed to obey God, and in spite of law.

"The love of love being the foundation of the government of God, the happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their accord with its great principles of righteousness. God desires from all his creatures the service of love,--service that springs from an appreciation of his character. He takes no pleasure in a forced obedience; and to all he grants freedom of will, that they may render
