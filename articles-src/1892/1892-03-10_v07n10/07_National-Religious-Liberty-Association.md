# National Religious Liberty Association.

## Declaration of Principles.

We believe in the religion taught by Jesus Christ.

We believe in temperance, and regard the liquor traffic as a curse to society.

We believe in supporting the civil government, and submitting to its authority.

We deny the right of any civil government to legislate on religious questions.

We believe it is the right, and should be the privilege, of every man to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience.

We also believe it our duty to use every lawful and honorable means to prevent religious legislation by the civil government; that we and our fellow-citizens may enjoy the inestimable blessings of both religious and civil liberty.

**OFFICERS.**

Pres., A. F. BALLENGER, *Sec., W. A. COLCORD,*

*Dist. Sec. for New York,* 43 Bond Street, New York.

It is reported that petitions are being industriously circulated and sent to the President and to the Government order to exhibit at the World's Fair on Sunday.

The *Pearl of Days'* argument that "the legislatures of Ohio by a decided vote--fifty-five to thirty-five affirmative and twenty in the negative--has accepted the Commissioners of the Columbian Exposition, in Chicago, to keep the gates closed on that day."

The question of teaching religion in the public schools is attracting much attention. The existence of a national religion can of course logical and constitutional, and where accepted this action on its part seems to be presumptuous. That California is finding the presentation of a strong argument which subjects its silence by the following from the *Orion Signal,* of February 20:

> It was rumored some time since, that the State Normal School at San Jose as to whether or not they should use the Bible, or any religious topic of which is to be generally regarded. The public schools of this State, as is elsewhere the case, are well managed; and religious questions have in certain quarters; there is a strong deliberation by which it is proper to be yet enough alone. We understand there is strong deliberation that the State during the last few months religious sessions and still more various have been made friendly in the university buildings at Berkeley by Stanford, but were in certain, would observe and harbor this, and wrong. Righteous the buildings they are now occupying, were never intended for religion in their existence, and should be used for the purpose of educating all the people of people pays for.

This extract from the proceedings of the Ohio House of Representatives, reported in the *Ohio State Journal,* Feby. 19, shows how little the legislators in the General Assembly of Ohio think of those laws involving religious questions and morals:

> The gay farther on the subject of legislation convention, yesterday afternoon in the house. Mr. McCready, by request of the Juniormen Bar Association, had introduced a bill purporting to do nothing on Sunday.

There was some opposition to it coming from the result coalition but it passed by a good majority. Mr. McCready, the author of the bill, championed its measure and claimed it was intended to advance civilization and was in the interest of humanity.

> Mr. Busard opposed the bill on the ground that it would inconvenience the travelling community. He claimed also the proposed law was such that all saloons be closed on Sunday. Thorugh demanded strict religious observance, it also received the views of the laboring class, many of whom had no other day in which to avail themselves of a barber's views against the bill, which provides that any person engaged in the practice of barbering upon Sunday shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than twenty-five or more than fifty dollars, or imprisoned not less than ten days in the county jail, or both, bent not more than thirty days.

On Wednesday, March 3, the Committee on Columbian Exposition reported the following questions in reference to the World's Fair and the observance of Sunday at the World's Fair. The closing of the World's Fair on Sunday. There were present stated some fifty prominent representatives and members of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the National Reform, the Woman's Legislature in stating. The purpose of the delegation having, and it was resolution be presented that they would endorse the Government and Congress that the World's Fair be kept closed on Sundays. After much deliberation the delegation gave a detailed history of the fight for Sunday closing, and declared that so far Congress, and the legislatures of fourteen other counties, and upon the precedents quoted they must close on Sunday. He took the ground that the Government had no righteous authority to control of the Exposition at Chicago. Mr. Hoot acknowledged that the delegation was well stated; Mr. Ford, and Mr. Taylor, of this town, stated and in the delegation replied to the questions as regards the subject, made a religious plea that the Legislature petition Congress that the World's Fair be closed on Sundays. The matter was referred to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in regard to their action last year.

Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia, and the California and Tennessee counties, and the Assembly of Indiana upon this to legislate on this subject, for an obscure decree, of passing resolutions recommending that Sunday be maintained as a rest day at the World's Fair.

A DIFFERENCE of opinion seems to have arisen in the ranks of the Sunday law reformers. The Herald and the Sabbath Union and the Law and Order League agree that the barber shops should be closed on Sunday--but as to how these laws should best be enforced--on this there has been short. The committee to whom the matter was referred, at its meeting, could not agree.

> Your standing Committee on Ordinances, to whom was referred an ordinance to close barber shops on Sundays, respectfully report that they have made the matter careful consideration and find that conditions vary. Some work one day and rest six, and others work six and rest one; some work five and rest one. Some work one day and rest six, and others work five and rest one. Your committee think that these do merit the greatest consideration from the State and there; we think the facts so interlocking that we cannot come to a recommendation.

"Your committee further finds that 'one man esteems one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regards the day regards it unto the Lord; and he that regards not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it.'--*Romans* 14:5, 6."

> Your committee respectfully recommends that this ordinance be not passed.

Not long since Sabbath representatives made their appeal to a speech after the same fashion. It seemed to occur that the gentlemen who had Sunday legislation were a little out of their initiative; they were trying to impress on the level of the community the kind of Sunday they wanted.

"This council has always been honored by people representing the two extremes in the liquor traffic--the Puritans and the Publicans. The Bar-
