Such communications as this, published in the "Pearl of Days," show the progress of the popular movement for the recognition of Sunday throughout the world. The French Popular League is wiser in its generation than the American Sabbath Union and avoids committing itself in so many words to the civil enforcement of Sunday regulations, nevertheless they are affiliated organizations with the same general purpose in view:—

POPULAR LEAGUE FOR SABBATH REST IN FRANCE.
174 Boulevard St. Germain,
Paris, France, Feb. 10, 1893.

Sir and Dear Colleague: I have had the pleasure of receiving your telegram and of communicating it last evening, to the general assembly of our Popular League. The reading of it was received with overwhelming applause.

The cause of Sabbath rest interests the whole of humanity, and it is pleasant and encouraging for the combatants of every nation to feel themselves side by side with those of another nation. The sentiment of this community of ideas and efforts is doubled in value, when it concerns nations living under the same form of government.

I thank you, therefore, with all my heart, sir and dear colleague, for your manifestation of sympathy, and I beg you will accept my very sincere acknowledgment.

The President of the Popular League,
LION SAY.
To Col. Elliott F. Shepard, President of the American Sabbath Union.
