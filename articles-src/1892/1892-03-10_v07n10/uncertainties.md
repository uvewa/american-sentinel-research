# Uncertainties Log - v07n10 (1892-03-10)

## General Notes

This OCR transcription was generally clear and readable. No significant obstructions or uncertainties were encountered.

## Minor OCR Corrections Made

1. **Page 3, "Is It the Sabbath?" article**
   - Original OCR: "unlesvened bread"
   - Corrected to: "unleavened bread"
   - Confidence: HIGH
   - Reason: Common biblical term, obvious OCR error

2. **Page 7, Book advertisement**
   - Original OCR: "MANYELOUS SCREUCHINGS"
   - Likely should be: "MARVELOUS SURROUNDINGS" (contextual guess for Yosemite Valley description)
   - Note: Left as transcribed from OCR due to uncertainty about original printed text
   - This appears in an advertisement, not article content

3. **Page 7, Book advertisement**
   - Original OCR: "priors all words"
   - Context suggests: "prints all words" (in description of pocket speller)
   - Note: Left as transcribed from OCR due to uncertainty

4. **Page 7, Advertisement footer**
   - Original OCR: "SHOES OF THE TIMES"
   - Should be: "SIGNS OF THE TIMES"
   - Confidence: HIGH
   - Reason: Known publication name, obvious OCR error
   - Note: This is in subscription information, not article content

## Attribution Notes

1. **Article by W. S. C.** - Signed only with initials "W. S. C., Deckertown, N. J." at end of Elmira Telegram reprint. This is not a known regular contributor, so full name unknown.

2. **Author initials removed from article bodies** - Following instructions, initials "W. H. M.", "C. P. B.", and "W. A. COLCORD" were removed from the ends of their respective articles and placed in YAML frontmatter only.

## Editorial Notes vs. Articles

Many short items were published as standalone editorial notes. Each was given its own file per instructions, even when very brief (single paragraph or single sentence).
