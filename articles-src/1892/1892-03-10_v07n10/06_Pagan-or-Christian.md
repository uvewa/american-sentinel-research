# Pagan or Christian.

The *New York Tribune* has opened its columns to a discussion as to whether the civilization of the present time is Pagan or Christian, as to the comparative values of what might be called Pagan, or Christian distinctively considered. Among the many articles published the one here quoted, shows an intelligent discrimination between civilization and Christianity, between civilization, Christianity and civilization. The article is reprinted in full.

> I. With many others, no doubt, have read with interest, and may I say astonishment, the discussion of "civilization," under the above leading, and have waited patiently hoping that some contributor would rise and inquire and inspire what the thing was over which the argument was being held, or that they say cannot hold have some chance of judging the merits of the various assertions being made. The original question, as I understand it, seems to be, "Is our civilization Pagan or Christian?" As I can not conceive how a "civilization" or any other thing can be either one or the other, I venture to call your attention to a few facts that may ease the controversy of results that is inanimate and irrational. Both Paganism and Christian are religion--the one "worship of many" or religious "one true worship of God," the "the other" the "religion of Jesus Christ," or Christianity, "a believer in Jesus Christ." A "civilization" being without life, without mind, and without spirit, can neither worship, testify, nor repent. Civilization, it is, is a condition of things as regards morals, hence a civilization can be no religion, therefore can not be Pagan, Christian, or infidel.

> We hear to-day, on every hand, our "civilization" spoken of, until the average man avoids making a similar mistake with your correspondents. A nation, as a thing, no appelation, and theorizing a synonym for confederacy or nation, and even if every individual in its ranks was a Christian, the nation would be simply a community of Christians, a Christian community, not a Christian nation. A nation is the result of a civil compact between individuals, without reference to religion, and though all may be of one religion, because the religion of the individual is of no more no part of their civilization though it may mold it, than it is statesmanship as no character, quality or degree of civilization is the natural birthright of any race.

> The question, what is the character of our civilization, and what we owe to Christianity? is really what, it seems, our correspondents would like answered, or what, said, wants me to see the meaning of this: "To which do we owe most included the development of our civilization: Paganism or Christianity?"
>
> To properly consider this question let me, on the start, to understand individual terms in their proper meaning. Standard lexicographers define the word as "the act of civilizing or state of being civilized, advancement in social life." To "civilize," means, "to reclaim from savage life." A savage is "a barbarian or rude" person, while a civilized person is "refined, reclaimed from barbarism." "Civil" is defined as "pertaining to society," and "Society" as "a union of many in one interest," while a "civilian" "pertains to the community." So much for words and phrases.

> If this definition be substantially correct, and the two religions be admitted to be in all, the palm of victory must, of necessity, be given to Christianity. If we trace the record of civilizations from the earliest that had relations to the gathering into a monarchy in Assyria, and so on down through the succeeding kingdoms until we reach Rome, we notice a constant development in culture and refinement, under Paganism, but a lamentable disregard by its devotees for the rights and liberties of individuals.
>
> With the coming of Christ, a new era dawned upon the world. Up to that time civilization to the individual had been a doubtful failure. He had become, it is true, both cultivated and refined, and, so far, civilized, but the status for individual civilization had not resulted from the civilization, for while the history of Rome, for instance, shows that the State protected its subjects to the bed of its ability from common foe from without, it absorbed the individual's liberty and made him a mere part of itself, while as a government maintaining its, power. Such a thing as personal liberty was unknown, the individual existed simply for the State.
>
> Jesus Christ taught the value of a soul and thrilled the world with the doctrine of true liberty,--"Render, therefore, unto Cesar [justly] unto the things that are Cesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." The civilization influenced by its birth has come to fruition in our own country, wherein our government, under a country, wherein our government "of the people, by the people and for the people," and wherein all men, have its liberty right "to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience" "where they are protected in their life and pursuit of happiness in her proper sphere as the equal of man, and her proper sphere as the equal of man, and where she values all. To Christianity, then, belongs the palm of victory, as having developed the highest and truest values of civilization, and to our country the distinction of selecting as the God for its development.--*W. S. C., Decker.*

"The ministers of religion should learn that usefulness consists but little upon how visibly he every walk of life, but when he acts upon the hearts of people by the power of the Divine wreath, or from to influence men to a genuine moral life, by impressing them with his own or the church's displeasures, he abuses his sacred office and arrays himself on the side of religious and to persecution. It matters not even, if in a given case, the individual's views are correct as to the better political course to pursue, the principle remains unchanged; and should be limited unto him by free people everywhere that estimation, as much, and
