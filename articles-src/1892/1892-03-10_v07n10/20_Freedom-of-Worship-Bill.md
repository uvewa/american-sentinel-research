The Freedom-of-Worship Bill is a measure now before the Legislature of New York which provides that no institution in this State shall receive any State aid unless it is free and open for any denomination to hold religious services for the benefit of such inmates as desire the services of that particular sect. Of course the object of the bill is to secure the admission of Romish priests to certain institutions supported by the State, but under Protestant control so far as the religious instruction given is concerned.
