The minister of religion should inculcate correct principles, should insist upon honesty in every walk of life, but when he attempts to coerce voters by threats of the Divine wrath, or even to influence them in a certain direction by threatening them with his own or the church's displeasure, he abuses his sacred office and arrays himself on the side of religious despotism. It matters not even if, in a given case, the minister's views are correct as to the better political course to pursue, the principle remains unchanged; and it should be insisted upon by free people everywhere that ecclesiastics, as such, shall keep out of politics.
