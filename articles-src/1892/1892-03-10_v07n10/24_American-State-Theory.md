The American State is, or at least professes to be, purely secular. This is the American theory of civil government, and it is the correct theory. The proposed Sixteenth Amendment is not, however, designed to correct such abuses as this; it provides, it is true, that no State shall "use its property or credit, or any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or aiding, by appropriation, payment for services, expenses or otherwise, any church, religious denomination or religious society, or any institution, society or undertaking which is wholly, or in part, under sectarian or ecclesiastical control;" but the well-known views of the promoters of this measure forbid the hope that they intend anything more than to cut off State appropriations to Roman Catholic institutions.
