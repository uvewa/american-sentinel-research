Under the title "Mass Meeting of the Wicked," the Mail and Express, of February 27, publishes a "special" from Chicago, as follows:—

Under the auspices of the American Secular Union, an organization which opposes the reading of the Bible in the public schools, favors the repeal of all laws on Sabbath observance, the abolition of the oath in courts of justice, and the substitution of a simple affirmation, the discontinuance of the observance of religious festivals and feasts, and the abolition of paid preachers in prisons, hospitals and other similar institutions, a mass meeting is to be held in Central Music Hall to-night for the purpose of demanding that the World's Fair be kept open on Sundays. The movement has received the support of all the Socialistic and American organizations of the city, as well as of the foreign-speaking atheistic element.

It is said that, in addition to demanding that the gates shall be opened, the machinery kept in motion and ordinary trading be carried on on the Lord's day, the resolutions will also declare in favor of the unrestricted sale of liquors of all kinds on the Fair grounds.

It is given out that this is but the first of a series of gatherings that will be continued so long as the religious element of the country continues to petition and hold meetings in favor of the proper observance of the Sabbath by the Fair authorities.

It is a remarkable fact, worthy of notice in this item, that, outside of the claim that the unrestricted sale of liquors is to be asked, the position attributed to this "mass meeting of the wicked," is in the interest of Christianity, pure and undefiled. The statement that the running of machinery and general trading be carried on Sunday does not mean that Sunday labor and Sunday selling should be compulsory at the Fair. This form of putting the matter is quite common among those who favor compulsory Sunday closing. The golden rule of the orthodox in reference to the World's Fair is, "Whatsoever I would that others should do, that shall they be compelled to do." The Secular Union denies the authority of the Bible, and then acts upon its precept, "Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them."
