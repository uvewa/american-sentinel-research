A good deal is being said by both press and pulpit on the subject of marriage and divorce, and the religious press especially is deploring the great increase in the number of divorces granted. The remedy is supposed to be in the direction of a national divorce law, or at least in the amendment of the divorce laws of the several States. But this never can correct the real difficulty. The fault is not in the laws but in the morals of the people. A change in the laws might make fewer divorces but it would not remove the immorality which gives rise to divorces. It is well to have good marriage and divorce laws; it is better to have good morals. Legislatures can make the laws: individuals alone can cultivate the morals.
