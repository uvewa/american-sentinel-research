This extract from the proceedings of the Ohio Legislature published in the State Journal, Columbus, February 25, shows how little the legislative mind comprehends the true principle at issue in these bills involving religious questions:—

"The gay barber was the subject of legislative consideration yesterday afternoon in the house. Mr. McConnell, by request of the Journeyman Barber's Association, had introduced a bill prohibiting barbering on Sunday.

"There was some opposition to it coming from the rural districts but it passed by a good majority. Mr. McConnell, the author of the bill, championed his measure and claimed it was demanded by 'advancing civilization and was in the interest of humanity.'"

"Mr. Beaird opposed the bill on the ground that it would inconvenience the traveling public. Before this reform was instituted he would suggest that saloons be closed on Sunday. Though demanded by the union of barbers it was not made in the interest of the laboring class, many of whom had no opportunity to be shaved on Saturday. There were ten votes against the bill, which provides that any person found engaged in the business of barbering on Sunday shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than twenty-five or more than fifty dollars, or imprisoned in the county jail for a period of not less than fifteen nor more than thirty days."
