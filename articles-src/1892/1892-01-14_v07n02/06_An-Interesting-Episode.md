When the American Sabbath Union originated in the Methodist Church, all Methodist ministers are not enlisted in its favoring its work. This was apparent at a mass meeting recently held in the Marshall Field Methodist Church of Chicago in the interests of enforced Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The meeting was called and directed by Mr. McLean, Chicago agent of the American Sabbath Union, Dr. A. H. Henry, pastor by Kale St. Methodist Episcopal Church, was requested by the Secretary to deliver the leading address, which he premised to do, after stating that he was not in full sympathy with the movement and being naturally known for a liberal in his entire views.

Dr. Henry created a sensation and foreshadowed his position by declaring that he had seen a circular letter issued by the Beer Brewer's Association instructing its members to work for Sunday closing at the Fair that the opportunity for the sale of

beer might be increased. The speaker then gave the reasons for the present interest of Sunday observance, among which were the attitudes of Christians themselves who lead in the prosecution of those who ignore the particular Sabbath rigor by failure to close the street cars in order to attend down town churches. "Again, our liberal Sunday" said the speaker, "is closed for commercial reasons just as some of our churches are operated for commercial reasons." To confirm the last statement he related how a brother pastor, after a revival meeting at which our hundred and fifty persons professed conversion, was held to one of the reasons to reply to an encouraging reference to the number of conversions, "Oh this whole batch is not worth a "hundred dollars."

"When the churches," said the speaker, at me close to the poor man, when they give him as warm a welcome, as the saloon proprietor, it will go far to settle this Sunday closing question."

"I have three dogs of some of our foaming, cooing hysterical," continued Dr. Henry, "is demanding that the Fair be closed. It seems to exhibit the American Sabbath. Let us make a candid examination of our American Sabbath and see if we desire to make an honest exhibit of it." Then he listed a graphic American description of the so called American Sabbath, which was not in the least complimentary to this much exalted institution, was none the less truthful to fact. At present end it was conceded that a faithful exhibit of the American Sabbath was not desirable; even Mr. McLean in replying to this part had knowledge that he was ashamed of the American Sabbath and that he did believe the Sabbath of this, but that, but of the conclusion, they proposed to put on exhibition. We shall now expect to hear the term "American Country Sabbath" used in the future, instead of the "American Sabbath" by the American Sabbath Union and its kindred organizations.

Dr. Henry declared that this Sunday reform was an attempt to restore the Puritan Sabbath, which manifested itself periodically and that it was to be hoped that some one would forever exorcise the Puritan ghost. We want no Puritan Sabbath," said the speaker, "with its three hour sermons, accompanied by a tithing-man with a long pole, with an attachment to chastise bad boys and tickle the ears of the sleeping victims of the pious discourse." He then counseled the American Sabbath Union to devote itself to nobler work than crying "rest on" to proprietors to open the Fair. He declared that the work of the Church was to meet the people where the right people were.

Mr. McLean winced under the sturdy blows of truth delivered by his brother minister, but when Dr. Henry concluded, he called to the defense of his movement, first by a mercantile consult, which pro-

duced a smile on Dr. Henry's face, that "all the large department stores were for the Fair on Sunday," and that the opposition was held by "advocates, infidels and the devil." He said while both to its favor of the restoration of the Puritan Sabbath, he "would a thousand times rather have the Puritan Sabbath, with all its rigor, than no Sabbath at all, than what we have." When we remember that the Puritan Sabbath meant compulsory attendance at church under the penalty of fines, imprisonment and flogging for disobedience, and that "what Sabbath we now have" is one in which a person may attend church, or go to the theatre, concert, art gallery, or the park, as he chooses, we ask the attention from a representative of the American Sabbath Union is very significant. As usual, an expression of the preference was taken; one lone vote for closing for an open Fair, with no machinery running on a — Far? Henry's position, third, for rigid Sunday closing; the remainder for a modified closing. Dr. Henry's position was not prompted by a disregard for national Sunday observance, but by a conviction that mere compulsory compliance now being used is secure it, are contrary to the genius of American liberty and the spirit of the gospel of Christ.
