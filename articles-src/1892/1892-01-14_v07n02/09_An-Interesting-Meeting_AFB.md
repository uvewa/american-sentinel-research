WHILE the American Sabbath Union originated in the Methodist Church, all Methodist ministers are not united in indorsing its work. This was apparent at a mass-meeting recently held in the Marshfield Methodist Church of Chicago in the interests of enforced Sunday closing of the World's Fair. The meeting was called and directed by Mr. McLean, Chicago Secretary of the American Sabbath Union. Dr. A. H. Henry, pastor De Kalb St. Methodist Episcopal Church, was requested by the Secretary to deliver the leading address, which he promised to do, after stating that he was not in full sympathy with the movement and being assured that he was at liberty to state his views.

Dr. Henry created a sensation and foreshadowed his position by declaring that he had seen a circular letter issued by the Beer Brewers' Association instructing its agents to work for Sunday closing at the Fair that the opportunity for the sale of beer might be increased. The speaker next gave the reasons for the present status of Sunday observance, among which were the attitude of Christians themselves who lead in the procession of those who ignore the puritanic Sabbath rigor by patronizing street cars in order to attend down town churches. "Again, our liberal Sunday," said the speaker, "is such for commercial reasons just as some of our churches are operated for commercial reasons." To confirm the last statement he related how a brother pastor, after a revival meeting at which one hundred and fifty persons professed conversion, was told by one of the trustees in reply to an encouraging reference to the number of conversions, that "the whole bunch" was not worth "a hundred dollars." "When the churches," said the speaker, "get as close to the poor man, when they give him as warm a welcome, as the saloon proprietor," it will go far to settle this Sunday closing question.

"Is there not some danger of our becoming hysterical," continued Dr. Henry, "in demanding that the Fair be closed in order to exhibit the American Sabbath? Let us make a candid examination of our American Sabbath and see if we desire to make an honest exhibit of it." Then followed a graphic description of the so-called American Sabbath, which, while not in the least complimentary to this much extolled institution, was none the less faithful to fact. All seemed convinced that a faithful exhibit of the American Sabbath was not desirable; even Mr. McLean in replying to this point acknowledged that he was ashamed of the American Sabbath, but that it was not the Sabbath of the cities, but of the country, that they proposed to put on exhibition. We shall now expect to hear the term "American Country Sabbath" used in the future, instead of the "American Sabbath" by the American Sabbath Union and kindred organizations.

Dr. Henry declared that this Sunday movement was an attempt to restore the Puritan Sabbath, which manifested itself periodically and that it was to be hoped "that some one would forever down this Puritan ghost. We want no Puritan Sabbath," said the speaker, "with its three hour sermons, accompanied by a deacon with a long pole, with fox-tail attachment to chastise bad boys and tickle the ears of the sleeping victims of the prosy discourse." He then counseled the American Sabbath Union to devote itself to nobler work than crying "no! no!" to propositions to open the Fair. He declared that the work of the Church was to meet the people there with the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Mr. McLean winced under the sturdy blows of truth delivered by his brother minister, but when Dr. Henry concluded, he sallied to the defense of his movement, first by a sarcastic remark, which produced a smile on Dr. Henry's face, that "all the best people were in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday," and that the opposition was held by "saloonists, infidels and the devil." He said that while not in favor of the restoration of the Puritan Sabbath, he "would a thousand times rather have the Puritan Sabbath, with all its rigor, than the Sabbath that we now have," When we remember that the Puritan Sabbath meant compulsory attendance at church under the penalty of fines, imprisonment and flogging for disobedience, and that "the Sabbath we now have" is one in which a person may attend church, go to the concert, museum, art gallery, or the park as he chooses, this statement from a representative of the American Sabbath Union is very significant. As usual, an expression of the congregation was taken; one fourth voting for an open Fair, with no machinery running,—Dr. Henry's position; one-third, for rigid Sunday closing; the remainder keeping their seats. Dr. Henry's position was not prompted by a disregard for rational Sunday observance, but by a conviction that these compulsory methods now being used to secure it, are contrary to the genius of American liberty and the spirit of the gospel of Christ.
