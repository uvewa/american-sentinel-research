ROBERT BAIRD, of Edinburgh, writing on "Religion in America" in the year 1843, having narrated the story of the discovery and early settlement of North America says:—

He who "hath made of one blood, all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation," had resolved in this manner to prepare a place to which, in ages then drawing near, those who should be persecuted for Christ's sake might flee and find protection, and thus found a Protestant empire.

This is a candid statement of the hope and expectation held by a certain body of religionists, in reference to this country, nearly fifty years ago; that there might be founded here "a Protestant empire." The expression is without reserve, because at that time, and writing in Scotland, there was no need to vail such a thought behind any wordy sophistry, as now.

The idea that the new world should be a refuge for the persecuted of all nations meant, with them, always, persecuted Protestants; and it never so much as entered their minds that the Lord had opened a refuge for the down-trodden of any sect or denomination, or all; and also equally, for those who know not God or any church.

It is certain that man's ways are not God's ways. He did not direct that those who first took sanctuary in his city of refuge should monopolize its privileges and deny them to others.
