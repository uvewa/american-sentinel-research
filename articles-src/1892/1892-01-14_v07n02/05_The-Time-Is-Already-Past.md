As long ago as 1845 Rev. George B. Cheever, of New York, in a lecture on Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," said:—

Almost every sect in turn, when tempted by size of power, has exercised the practice of religious persecution.

Bunyan was the first to be put into the Charte of Bedford jail to punish for conscience and humanity, . . . no politician, . . . or any publicist who an English-history for attaching or john Bunyan in prison, would furnish a focused testimony for burning Latimer and Ridley at the stake. Showed that the lesson of religious intolerance ought be known and experienced, needs still above all to learn. It not long time, instruction, and displace men, nor for instruction had lost its heart, and they never would have learned it had not the bitter Church been so long from the State, and deprived of all possibility of grafting the secular arm to her service. Even the Romanists are learned it is when he would have called down fire from heaven to destroy the hamartanous, and he, nor his followers, when they forsake a faithful and same upon John the Baptize of those, from pain, from and death, because he followed and then. And they never would have learned it had the mind of Jesus been ever been attained to by his followers. Who does not see that toleration itself, . . . much less equal religious liberty for all men, is a thing that ought not to exist, that is it itself tyranny? But we must have perfect religious equality power, say to me so condescendingly, I permit you to exercise at your religious conviction. And what authority have you to permit me; or may man I to permit you? God permits us all.

It needs no proof to show that the National Reform Association, the American Sabbath Union, and the Sunday Best Society, the Bureau of the W. C. T. U., are simply different branches of the one grand scheme of the churches to gain control of the civil power to enforce upon all their arbitrary decrees.

Nor do we need to present any further testimony to demonstrate that the "civil" Sabbath plan is a deception and a snare, or that the professed interest of these preachers and organizations in the "poor enslaved workingmen" and "the toiling masses" is a fraud.

The editorial, of the leading labor journal in the United States, nailed truly: "We have discovered the hypocrisy in the claim that Sunday laws are only designed to enforce two hours quiet." Not a bit as it seems strange how anybody with half an eye could fail to discover it.

The truth of the matter is that the workingmen, of the United States, have intelligence enough to know for themselves whether they are oppressed or enslaved, and are abundantly able to supply their own remedies for relief. The workingmen of the United States are not so ignorant, not so enifiable, that the church managers are able to assume the office of self-appointed guardians to decide for them when they are oppressed and when they are not; and when they are tired and when they are not; and whether they can safely be intrusted with their own liberties.

Away with such presumptuous arrogance! Let the workingmen arise in their manliness and in the genuine dignity of labor, and denounce, as it deserves, and as the wicked thing that it is, this hypocrit-

ical "mothering" and fraudulent "interest" of the church managers in their devised schemes to invade the rights and liberties, not only of the workingmen, but of all the people.

A. T. J.

Nor is the American Sabbath Union alone in this. The National Reform Association is the original organization in the United States, pledged to the enforcement of religious observances by law. This organization even demands the adoption of an amendment to the National Constitution, declaring this to be a Christian Nation," embodying Christian laws, institutions, and usages on an undeniable legal basis" and "enforcing upon all the laws of Christian life." And this same organization, in its national convention in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1887, declared that "a secular, anti-church, and anti-Christian State, are all trying to catch the workingmen, but National Reform must secure the workingmen, and they can best be secured through the agitation of the Sabbath, for workingmen given do not want to work on the Sabbath."

The would be head of the Sunday Rest League of the United States, W. F. Crafts, lately published *Christian Statesman,* Dec., 11, 1891, the statement that "We fear that a majority of the workingmen can not yet wisely use eight hours leisure time for the best advantage."
