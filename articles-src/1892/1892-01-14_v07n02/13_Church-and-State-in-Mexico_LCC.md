A stay of three weeks in the Republic of Mexico, gave me an opportunity of learning some things concerning the situation of the religious influences of the Church over the State. Mexico is a republic, the same as the United States of America. It has about one-sixth the population of the United States. It has several States; the people elect their President and representatives in Congress, and in many ways their government is similar to ours.

In name, Church and State are separate, as the National Reformers, in the United States would have them there, even with their pet schemes in full working order; but as a matter of fact in Mexico, the Catholic Church is the power behind the throne in all political and governmental affairs, as truly as when the government recognized it as the national religion. The power of the priests over the people is but little less than then, and they dictate in everything.

There are a few men in official positions who are fearless in their denunciations of the work of the priests. I had the privilege of listening, in their national Congress, to a masterly speech, made by the best orator of the nation, Senor Don Juan Mateo, on a bill which he had introduced to provide for a divorce law, which, as yet, the Mexican government does not have, and the manner in which he denounced some of the work of the priests was severe and unsparing. Evidently, he had many sympathizers in the membership of the house, and in the large audience of spectators, as he was cheered vociferously by a certain portion of those present whenever any allusions of this kind were made. May the day come when the true principles of religious liberty may be better understood in Mexico; while we, who live in what is comparatively religious freedom, should use every effort in our power to hinder the attempts to unite Church and State in our land.
