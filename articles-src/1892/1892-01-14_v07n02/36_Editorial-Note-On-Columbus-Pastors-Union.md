THE legitimate result of the secularization of religion by means of State paid chaplaincies, is shown in this special despatch to the World, from Columbus, Ohio:—

In the meeting of the Pastors' Union of this city to-day there was developed a feeling on the part of the preachers in favor of striking for pay for praying at the opening of the sessions of the Legislature. It has always been customary to invite different clergymen in the city to officiate in this way, and neither branch has ever elected a chaplain or paid for such services. The Chair to-day in the Pastor's meeting appointed Rev. W. C. Holliday to look after this work, but he declined with very sharp remarks upon the policy of the Legislature in getting its praying done for nothing. Other clergymen joined him . . . finally the work was assigned to another with no definite action taken by the Union on free prayers in the General Assembly.

If the Legislature should refuse the services of the members of this Pastors' Union, it is not likely that it would lose divine favor by it, for truly the prayer of the cent. per cent. righteous availeth not much. Even the Pharisee prayed for glory, standing on the corners of the streets to be seen of men, but the Pastors' Union of Columbus, Ohio, prays for lucre only.
