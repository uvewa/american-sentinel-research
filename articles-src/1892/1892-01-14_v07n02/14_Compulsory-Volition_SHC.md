In the Methodist Quarterly Review, in an article entitled "The Freedom of Choice," is the following:—

Any scheme of volitional necessitation, whether of theology, philosophy, or materialistic evolution, must utterly deny the necessary and manifest laws and facts of our national and moral agency.

Now the National Reform Association and its allies are striving for laws to try and "necessitate a volition" to observe Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Sabbath. But, even, if they succeeded in compelling some to refrain from work and to attend church services; it would be forced, therefore unwilling, attendance and unacceptable before the Lord. You might drive a man into church but you can not make him worship. In fact a church that seeks the aid of the secular power to fill its church buildings, is not the church of Christ—nor is its worship, so called, other than vain worship, for it is not true worship.

Under such circumstances the people, in order to act as free moral agents, and follow the dictates of their own consciences, are compelled to transgress either the law of God or the law of the State; and all because the State legislates upon things that should not come under its jurisdiction.
