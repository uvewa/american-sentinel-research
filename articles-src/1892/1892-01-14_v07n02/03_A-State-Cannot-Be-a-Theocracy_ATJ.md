A State is distinct from a nation in its essential features. While the latter is the product of nature, and may be wholly made up of one class, kindred, family, or aboriginal tribe, the former owes its very existence to political machinery, and is wholly the creation of the people. In the words of another—

The State emerges from and is upheld by society, and is therefore subservient to its ends. The creation of the State is always for the purpose of fulfilling the interaction of the constituents of society; to secure justice and peace; to guard against nature and disorder. It is to keep the real clear for the foot-steps of society, to show the way to regulate interests and to its inequalities; to secure an active and harmonious between the social elements of the community.

It therefore follows that while a nation might become a theocracy, as, in the case of Israel, a State could not possibly have such a form of government, since in that event it would cease to be a political community.

This will perhaps be more clearly seen when it is remembered that the word used for the word "theocracy" in its Greek form is defined "Rule of God." In other words theocracy is a pure form of government in which God was recognized as supreme Ruler in civil, as well as spiritual affairs. He not only made and proclaimed the law of Israel; He with His government were administering, but without any voice of the people, appointing generals, preferences of officials and officers, through whom the affairs of the nation were to be regulated. He also appointed the work and wages of Jehovah, and as such, wreasonably only in their of their official affairs. Even although the people be might be dissatisfied with the government, they had no right to change that government nor remove him from office. He was appointed to this position by a power infinitely above the people, and could only be removed from it by the same authority which appointed him in the place. God.

The moral law of Jehovah being adopted as the civil code of the nation, the limitations were enforced by the civil rulers. This statement must of course be taken in a modified sense. Now when were punished by the civil ruler under the theocracy, received the first penalty designed to be inflicted upon the incorrigible transgressors of God's law, for the punishment inflicted by the civil ruler, even then, was merely temporal. The Judgment of the great day alone is competent to decide what punishment adequately meets the requirements of God's law. The civil ruler of that day did, however, make that law the basis of every civil judgment offense, and punished accordingly. It mattered not whether the transgressor violated only that portion of the law which regulated his dealings toward his fellow-man, or that which ordered his religious worship; it was all the same. The civil magistrate was duly authorized to administer punishment in either case.

Not a move was made in anything, in fact, without explicit direction from Heaven itself. When God led the nation of Israel from Egypt to Canaan, God talked with Moses through the fiery, cloudy pillar, and from the mercy seat, thus directing and counseling him in all the affairs of the nation. The reasons for this are obvious.

Accepting Jehovah as their God, they not only became a distinct people, among the heathen nations by whom they were surrounded, but by their thus giving their conscience into the keeping of Jehovah, to be regulated by his moral law.

By this act they were no longer their own but the peculiar people of God. In effect, they, because the subjects of His Holy Church, or Kingdom on the earth. It was therefore his privilege to prescribe the rites and ceremonies of their religious services.

At their acknowledged king, he had absolute sovereignty of their holy polity; therefore, it was his prerogative to give them also own laws, choose his own instruments of worship, control the affairs of his reigning, proclaiming war, and make peace with surrounding nations.

Therefore in appointing His officers of government, God chose to make rulers not of matters of religion as well as of civil affairs. The tithes and offerings were to be made to the uncivil, but it was the sworn duty of the civil magistrate to enforce the levitical class, who were to be shut out from the congregation and who were to be admitted; not in everything, both civil and religious, were to be inquiries of the will of God; hence when the occasion God had appointed to teach the the students of the temple, and "charged priests unto them." See Lev. 10.

Through one of the most signal mercies of God, Moses had one the privileges even of naming his successor. Joshua was called of God to fill the place soon to be made vacant by the death of Moses; and, although the people each had a voice, as ever in his selection, yet when Joshua had been duly commissioned, the heart of the people had readily acceded and assign him as their leader under God.

Earnest effort in a good cause can not fail. It may not be crowned with a top of plumes of men; it may not seem to touch the goal of immediate results; but nothing which is the end and aim of so much in life, but it is not alone.—*Sumner.*
