# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, January 14, 1892 (v07n02)

## General Note

This issue scan quality is notably poor throughout, with many passages being extremely difficult to read with confidence. The resolution is low enough that individual letter forms are often ambiguous. Many articles required significant interpretation, and the transcriptions should be verified against a higher-resolution scan when one becomes available.

## Article 01 - The Sabbath Commandment and Civil Law (Page 9)

- Page 9, Left Column, Paragraph 6
  - Second pass completed: Yes
  - Transcribed as: "It is not only their horror estimates of the value of proper views"
  - Confidence: LOW - This sentence is very difficult to parse
  - Reason: The text in this final paragraph is among the most unclear on the page

## Article 03 - A State Cannot Be a Theocracy (Pages 9-10)

- Page 10, multiple passages
  - Confidence: LOW in several passages
  - Reason: Consistent poor resolution throughout

## Article 04 - Separation of Church and State (Page 11)

## Article 05 - The Time Is Already Past (Pages 11-10)

- The long Cheever quotation is extremely difficult to read
  - Confidence: LOW

## Article 06 - An Interesting Episode (Pages 11-12)

- "Dr. A. H. Henry, pastor by Kale St." - could be "Lake St."

  - Confidence: LOW

## Article 09 - Church and State in Mexico

## Overall Assessment
