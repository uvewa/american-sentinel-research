THE French Senate has, by a vote of four to one, "denounced the Romanists for jeopardizing social peace and the rights of the State;" and the Mail and Express comments that, "what is bad for the French Republic is doubly bad for the American." There is more truth in this comment than the Mail and Express would acknowledge, because, in America, it is the action of the Protestant Church and its different allied organizations, which is jeopardizing the rights of the State and the citizen.

In the countries to the south of us the questions of the relations of the Church to the State are more pronounced, in the light in which they appeal to the understanding, than in this country. But the reason is that there the strife is an open one between the Roman Catholic Church and the State, while here it is between the State and the survival of Roman Catholic principles hidden in the Protestant Church. In Mexico an open conflict is reported to have broken out between the government and a Romish propaganda of monastic principles among the students of the several educational institutions; while despatches from Rome say that the Pope "will excommunicate President Peixotto, his Cabinet, and the members of the Brazilian Congress, unless measures are taken to renew the former relations between Church and State in Brazil." Italy, France, Russia, and China, are also stirred deeply by questions which are mainly religious in their inception, and will prove purely religious in their progressive development. All these are but various phases of the same religious agitation.
