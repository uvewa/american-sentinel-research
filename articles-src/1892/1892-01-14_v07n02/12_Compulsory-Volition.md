In the *Methodist Quarterly Review*, in an article on "The National Reform Bureau," the writer says:—

If we can secure, by philosophy, education, or legislation, such a Sabbath observance as shall conduce to the highest physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual well-being, we shall promote one of the highest forces of our national and moral power.

Now the National Reform Bureau, and all its allies who are striving for Laws to try and "necessitate a volition" to observe Sunday, the first day of the week, as the Sabbath. But, even, if they succeeded in compelling man to refrain from his secular and employment, they could not compel him to attend church services; it would be forced, therefore unwilling, therefore a mere set after prospectors before the Lord, that might drive a man into church but you can not make him worship. To in fact a law that seeks the aid of the secular power to lift its church as the church of the church of Christ—nor is it worship, or is cold, other than vain worship, for it is forced.

Under such circumstances the people, in order to act as free moral agents, shall follow the dictates of their own conscience, are compelled to transgress either the law of God or the law of the State, a thing that should not come under his jurisdiction.
