SINCE the earliest move of the American Sabbath Union, in its effort to draw all organized bodies of every character into alliance with itself for the purpose of enforcing Sunday observance by law, the most strenuous assertions have been made that the Knights of Labor, and the workingmen in general, were arrayed with it; and the chief weight of argument for legal Sunday closing has been that Sunday rest might be secured for the laboring man. Most especially has this been urged in reference to the World's Fair. An article by T. V. Powderly, Grand Master Workman, in the Knights of Labor Journal, is a complete refutation of all the claims heretofore made in behalf of the workingmen, as asking for Sunday closing by law through their organizations. Mr. Powderly says:—

The World's Columbian Exposition should be kept open on Sunday. Those who attend to its operation can have one day in the week for rest, pleasure, recreation, or devotion, just as they please. If suggestions are in order, mine would be to keep the Exposition open seven days in each week; that the employes work but eight hours each day; that it open each day at 7 A. M., and close at 11 P. M. Those who begin work at seven in the morning will have completed the eight hours at three in the afternoon, and on Sunday will have time to attend church in the evening. Let those who begin work at seven one week take the night turn the following week.

The reply to this will probably be that neither Mr. Powderly nor his constituents know what is best or right for them, and so they must be compelled to rest whether they consider it advisable and desirable or not.
