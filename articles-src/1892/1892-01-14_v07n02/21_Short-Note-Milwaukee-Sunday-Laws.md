MILWAUKEE does not attempt to enforce its Sunday laws, and a comparison of the proportion of arrests to its population, as compared with sixteen other cities of the United States of over 150,000 inhabitants, shows the proportionate percentage of arrests in Milwaukee to be about one-third that of the average of other cities. Does this mean that two-thirds of the arrests in the large cities of the country are for infraction of Sunday ordinances? Or what is the significance of so peculiar a fact?
