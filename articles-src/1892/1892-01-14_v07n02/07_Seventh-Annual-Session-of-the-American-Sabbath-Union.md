The American Sabbath Union held its third annual session at Des Moines, Iowa, December 14 and 17. Delegates were present from several of the States, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, President of the Union, Dr. Herrick Johnson, Rev. J. P. Mills, B. B. Knowes, and President Blanchard, being among the number. Rev. Mr. Crafts, who established the merit of having started the organization in the Methodist Church, is said not to be in good standing with it and is not present. The attendance was much better than at any previous meeting and a great deal of enthusiasm was manifest throughout, as their favorite themes were manifest. It was very apparent that the main object for which they are working at the present time, is to secure the closing of the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. Three-fourths of all the addresses bore directly or indirectly upon this subject. The matter was presented ominously from a civil standpoint, yet the moral infirmness of Sunday closing came in for due consideration.

Dr. Johnson gave the opening address, being based upon "Sunday Opening of the Columbian Exposition." He argued the following points: First, It is contrary to all World's Fair precedents. Second, It would be against the best morals and traditions of our national life. Third, It is against the conscience of 10,000,000 church members. Fourth, It would be a national humiliation for us to put our American Sabbath in the back yard and bring the front that mongrel, bastard day, called the European Sunday. Fifth, It would be a fearful menace to social order. Sixth, It would be taking the

command of God, commandeous, and do you dare to say that you know not? Who is that stands in the gap between us and God, either to say you or nay? Your interests in purely a prayer; for you have no right to meddle with the matter. But whatever Church and State are united, there lives will be nothing with the matter: and even in this country, if one particular sect were to get the power of the State, there would be an end to our perfect freedom. But sir, if you make yourself merely a citizen, you are therefore a preacher; whether your name be Jones or England.

The Church of America is almost moving the world in its present attempt to affix in the fundamental law of the land, the acknowledged legal desire that that which it declares in a civil crisis, in the master of remission of taxes, and approval of church attendance through sectarian schools the Church has obtained the patronage of the State; and in many instances the Church has not absolutely the civil law to enforce a penalty upon whatever according to its interpretation—alien. The time is already far passed toward the this and it is about time that of thinking the finger of warning.
