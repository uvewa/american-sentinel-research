At the recent session of the North Georgia Conference of Southern Methodists, they passed resolutions calling on the managers of the World's Fair to close that exhibition on Sundays, and also pleading that Sunday rest be granted to the railroad men.

Let the Church work for the conversion of men, and leave the Fair to look after itself. And also let it tell the railroad men, and everybody else, that they now have the privilege not to run on Sunday if they wish to, and no one can hinder them. But the North Georgia Conference doubts the means by vote that it wants the railroad men to be allowed to rest without any danger of losing his job. However a church that wants a man to be allowed to observe a religious institution without making any sacrifice, has certainly overshooting the mark, and not the teachings of Christ. If a man has convictions in the matter he should follow them regardless of business position or anything of the kind. If he does not have convictions, he should not be compelled, by law, to follow what some one else may regard with religious awe.

Many and dark have been the crimes committed in the name of liberty, but they are but a drop in the bucket to what there than are the abominations practised in the name of the religion of Him in whom was found no guilt, and in whose life there was no sin.
