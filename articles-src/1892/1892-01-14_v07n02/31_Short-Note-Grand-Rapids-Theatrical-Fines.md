THE fining of theatrical managers for giving entertainments on Sunday, still continues in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In many cases, no doubt, these exhibitions might well be dispensed with entirely, but, even if that be the case, Sunday closing only will not perceptibly improve civil order, any more than Monday or Saturday closing. The only way to effect the result desired is that which is said to have been used in Minneapolis; simply not to patronize them.
