THE Law and Order League of Pittsburg secured a conviction in a case against the owners of a river steamer for carrying excursion parties on Sunday. The case was appealed and the conviction by the justice court affirmed on the ground that the steamer was "doing a strictly secular business contrary to law." Suppose the steamer should do "a strictly religious business" on some other day of the week, what would be the penalty?
