A stay of three weeks in the Republic of Mexico, gave opportunities of learning some things concerning the situation of the religious influence of the Church over the State. Mexico is a republic, the same as the United States of America. It has about one-ninth the population of the United States. It has several States; the people elect their President and their representatives in Congress, and in many ways their government is similar to ours.

In name, Church and State are separate, as the National Reformers, in the United States would have them there, even with their pet schemes in full working order; but as a matter of fact in Mexico, the Catholic Church is the power behind all in all political and governmental affairs, as truly as when the government recognized it as the national religion. The power of the priests over the people is but little less than then, and they dictate in everything.

There are a few men in official position who are fearless in their denunciation of the work of the priests. I had the privilege of listening, in their national congress, to a masterly speech, made by the best orator of the nation, benor Don Jose Manor, on a bill which he had introduced to provide for a divorce law, which, as yet, the Mexican government does not

of our individual conscience was one of the treasures about half in the foundation of our Republic; but Colonel Shepard would sweep this all away, said is asking the good people in the various churches to organize with him to assist in this nefarious work.

During the Convention, it was loudly proclaimed by more than one that this Union proposed to maintain a total separation between Church and State. But what do such sanctimonious amount to, no matter how emphatically or earnestly stated, when, in their avowed principles, they say that if a man, through choosing to go in the ministry, and deserving to observe another day for the Sabbath, and believing that he in his conscience holds to keep it, must nevertheless surrender the right God gives right and obey whatever ecclesiastical laws they may choose to enact? Say what they will, in regard to Sunday as a civil institution, it is religious, and when laws favoring it are enforced, the whole is nothing more nor nothing less than a union, to that extent, of Church and State. When laws that will bind the conscience of an individual and refuse him the privilege of believing in and worshipping God according to his own mind and belief are enacted, it is the worst form of despotic establishment, and is laying the foundation for doing all the wicked work that was ever performed by any himself that ever cursed the earth.
