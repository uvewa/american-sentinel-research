It is he who never attempts to enforce upon others those things which God hath joined, nor to join those things which God hath put asunder; and he who has this wisdom has also the happiest lot on earth.

It is not man's physical, but his spiritual need that asks that he so held in view the Sabbath commandment. The Sabbath is intended to be a day in which to worship God—a day of holy remembrance of his Creator and of his obligations to him. That day is to be kept holy. If it is not kept holy, it is not kept at all. When the State undertakes to demand the observance of the Sabbath, or Lord's day, it demands of men that which does not belong to it, but which belongs only to God. When the State undertakes to enforce the observance of the Sabbath, it undertakes that which, to it, is an impossible task, because holiness is not an attribute of civil government, nor has it even the power or the authority to prescribe it to individuals.

The importance to the American citizen at this time, of definite and correct knowledge of the distinct and separate spheres of civil and ecclesiastical, political and moral, can not be over estimated. And yet, never in the political history, or the constitutional history of this country has there been a time when such powerful agencies have been so actively engaged in propagating deceptive and erroneous theories upon this question as at the present hour. The weight of the entire body of human precedent is used, and relied upon, to support not only the propriety but the duty of enforcing religious moralities by legal enaction. This reliance upon precedent has become established until it is no less an idolatry, in fact, than the ancestor worship of China.

The truth is, that those who are now advocating legal interference, national, State, and municipal, in religious and moral questions, is established upon a purely human basis of blind adherence to the dictum of human authority, without, in any way, subjecting it to test in the light of truth.

Unalloyed civil freedom in religious affairs is an achievement of religious purity and unselfishness, which the unregenerate heart is unable to comprehend. Correct conception upon these questions, in their entirety can only come with a regenerate heart. It is not only their horror estimates of the value of proper views upon a problem in the very nature of things a fundamental test of the truth of God; while the acceptance of error, in its solution, develops the mystery of iniquity.
