The most sad and tearful history of barbarous wars had its origin in the Church domination within polities, civil affairs and governments. It was not that religion drove the blood of her children in the funeral contests of the past and spared not even the babe in the its mother's arms. That stifled by inquisition the toddeler, better informed than the priesthood in affairs and blazed the way for the enthronement of liberty for all.

From Mount Sinai of to-day and learn the abolition of burning strange fire before the Lord, the meddling of Church with the affairs of State and its consequential cruelty, barbarism, and misery of citizens. What a sorrowful chapter for the nineteenth century, and under one or another eyes, is this fearful persecution of the early races in Russia, and of themselves from the established Church! The holy synod, as a politicien, was more concerned, with power on earth than in life to come, and to further rivet the chain of slavery. And what matters it? In the hearts of men, of man, every thought, aspiration and hope, is not the inherently regulating down to the regulation within, though, from the regulations population, through fate—, if—the father, and misery, and death sense to make—like father and son. And it is the demand of men that which does not belong to it, but which belongs only to God. The holy synod would not be the slave, but indeed, but humanity should be the slave.

Let not true Americans lose the dark lessons of by-gone times and cherish the free founders of this Republic. It is now fenced and installed flatly to the right—one principles that separated Church and State, and served to free the free men of America that religious liberty, without which we shall go back centuries.—*Elijah Biggs, in Minneapolis Evening Journal.*
