The American Sabbath Union held its third annual session at Des Moines, Iowa, December 16 and 17. Delegates were present from several of the States, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, President of the Union, Dr. Herrick Johnson, Rev. J. P. Mills, J. H. Knowles, and President Blanchard, being among the number. Rev. Mr. Crafts, who claims the credit of having originated the organization in the Methodist Church, seems to have been entirely divorced from it and was not present. The attendance was much better than at any previous meeting and a great deal of enthusiasm was manifest throughout, as their favorite themes were discussed. It was very apparent that the main object for which they are working, at the present time, is to secure the closing of the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday. Three-fourths of all the addresses bore directly or indirectly upon this subject. The matter was presented ostensibly from a civil standpoint, yet the moral influence of Sunday closing came in for due consideration.

Dr. Johnson gave the opening address, his subject being "Sunday Opening of the Columbian Exposition." He argued the following points: First, It is contrary to all World's Fair precedents. Second, It would be against the best morals and traditions of our national life. Third, It is against the consciences of 10,000,000 church members. Fourth, It would be a national humiliation for us to put our American Sabbath in the back yard and bring to the front that mongrel, bastard thing, called the European Sunday. Fifth, It would be a fearful menace to social order. Sixth, It would be taking the down grade for labor when Europe is starting on the up grade. Seventh, It would be the enforcing of labor upon a whole army of Sabbath workers. Eighth, It will prove another strong link in the chain that will turn over the workingman, bound hand and foot, to those who would work them three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Ninth, It would be selling the Lord's Day for a few pieces of silver, not less the Lord himself.

The readers of THE SENTINEL have been shown the fallacy of such positions many times.

Dr. Thompson, of California, followed in an address bearing upon the same subject, but presented no arguments that would be new to the readers of this journal.

"Observations Abroad as Relating to Conditions at Home," was the subject of a paper read by the Hon. J. F. Lamb, of Wisconsin, from which he gave his observations of fifteen continental Sundays while on a visit to the Old World.

Hon. L. S. Coffin, Ex-Railroad Commissioner of Iowa, spoke on the Sabbath and laboring men. Quite a good deal of attention was given to the consideration of laboring men in regard to the Sunday question, and much fervor was manifested in talking about the Sunday slavery of the toiler for his daily bread. Yet, while these advocates for Sunday laws are thus canting in regard to the oppressing of labor on Sunday, the laboring man himself is not raising a single cry along this line; and when he does speak it is generally to say that he wants to have his freedom to work or play or do as he pleases on Sunday, without the interference of any straight-jacket Sunday laws. Some of the standard resolutions were passed, reaffirming the strength of the American Sabbath Union, urging the people to labor for their promulgation, asking the co-operation of all labor organizations, commending the President of the United States for his order that the inspection of the army hereafter be held on secular days, urging that the presidential inauguration be held on the first Wednesday in March instead of the fourth day of March, which sometimes comes on Sunday, demanding that the Exposition at Chicago in '93 be closed on Sunday, etc.

Dr. Knowles spent quite a little time, during one meeting, in telling the Convention how devoted the committee and leading men of the American Sabbath Union were in their supplications to God for divine guidance in all their labors. He said that they never had a committee meeting, even amid the busy scenes of Park Row, New York, where their head office is located, without opening and closing each meeting with prayer, and when they were on their way to Chicago last summer to petition the Commissioners of the World's Fair to close its gates on Sunday, he said they even prayed earnestly while on the train, that the Lord would give them success.

A reporter had the following interview with Colonel Shepard and one or two others of the leaders of this movement:—

Q. What do you hope to secure by this agitation?
A. We hope, by this agitation, to so mold public sentiment that there will be a popular uprising of the people in favor of a more strict observance of Sunday.

Q. But suppose the people do not come up to the desired standard, what then?
A. If they do not yield to the plain conclusive arguments in its favor, then we must resort to law.

Here, another added, "Yes, and I believe we might as well start out in that way at first, as I doubt if moral suasion will ever reach them."

Q. Have you made preparations for an effort in this direction?
A. Yes, sir, we have in contemplation a committee whose chief business it is to look after Sabbath legislation, at the national capital and at all the State legislatures.

Q. Do you still intend to prosecute the introduction of a bill in Congress similar to the Blair bill?
A. Indeed, we do, and we intend to work at it until our desires are met.

Q. But do you not think that the movement you are interested in, if carried to its legitimate result, would end in religious persecution?
A. No, sir; a man who says we are favoring a movement which will persecute any one is one hundred years behind the times.

Q. But already there has been such persecution, at least something that borders on it, in the case of R. M. King, of Tennessee, who was an observer of Saturday but who was imprisoned for Sunday labor.
A. Yes; I remember such a case, and the judge ruled against him on the ground that he had no right to set himself up against the sentiment of any community, and by prosecuting his course, outrage the feelings of a religious people. When a man enters society, there are certain principles and rights that have to be surrendered, and this is one of them.

So it seems from these questions and answers that the American Sabbath Union proposes to prosecute its work with vigor and earnestness; and the fact that the organization is supported by men of wealth and influence is one of the many reasons why every lover of liberty, and especially the precious boon of liberty of conscience, should arouse to action and assist in exposing the sophistry in the arguments which it advances. History can be of no value to us if it does not show that this movement is taking the steps that were taken by the bishops and leaders of the Church in the fourth century, that laid the foundation for the great system of religious despotism, which enslaved the consciences of men and racked them with the most cruel tortures during the long scenes of the Middle Ages.

The statement made in the last answer above, given by Mr. Shepard, should open the eyes of the people to the real animus of this movement. It is clearly seen here that he would take away the rights of an individual to rest on Saturday, if his conscience required it, and would compel him to surrender his conscience to the majority, and obey whatever laws might be imposed on him by religious bigots, no matter how absurd or contrary to every principle of his religious belief. The right to worship God according to the dictates of our individual consciences was one of the corner-stones laid in the foundation of our Republic; but Colonel Shepard would sweep this all away, and is asking the good people in the various churches to organize with him to assist in this nefarious work.

During the Convention, it was loudly proclaimed, again and again, that the Union proposed to maintain a total separation between Church and State. But what do such asseverations amount to, no matter how emphatically or earnestly stated, when, in their own avowed principles, they say that if a man, though choosing to be in the minority, and desiring to observe another day for the Sabbath, and believing that he is in conscience bound to keep it, must nevertheless surrender this God-given right and obey whatever ecclesistical laws they may choose to enact? Say what they will, in regard to Sunday being a civil institution, it is religious, and when laws favoring it are enforced, they can be regarded as nothing more nor less than a union, to that extent, of Church and State. When laws that will bind the conscience of an individual and refuse him the privilege of believing in and worshiping God according to his own mind and belief are enacted, it is the worst form of despotic ecclesiasticism, and is laying the foundation for doing all the wicked work that was ever performed by any hierarch that ever cursed the earth.
