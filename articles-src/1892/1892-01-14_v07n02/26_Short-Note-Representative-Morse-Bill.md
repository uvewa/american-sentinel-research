REPRESENTATIVE MORSE, of Massachusetts has introduced in the House a bill "to prohibit the opening on Sunday of any exposition for which the United States makes appropriations." Such a bill would not only make it impossible for Congress to appropriate anything further to the Chicago Exposition except under the explicit understanding that it shall be closed on Sunday, but would also render it impossible for the United States to make an official exhibit in any exposition of a foreign country, without a previous guarantee from that government that it shall not be opened on Sunday. The United States then becomes the world wide apostle of Sunday.
