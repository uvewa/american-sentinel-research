Now that the Swine Breeders' Association and the American Short-horn Breeders' Association have put themselves on record as asking for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, the Bee-Keepers' Association follows suit by voting, two to one, at its convention in Chicago in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday.

If the little busy bee can, by resolution, be restrained from improving the shining hours of Sunday at the World's Fair, the only thing required further is a World's Fair baking powder that will not rise on Sunday.
