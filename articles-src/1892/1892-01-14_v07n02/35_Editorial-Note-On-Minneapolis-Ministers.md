THE ministers of Minneapolis, Minnesota, have presented to the common council of that city a draft of an ordinance in reference to Sunday amusements, containing six sections, in the drawing of which they have employed able legal counsel, and which they place before the city fathers with the evident assurance that in consideration of the source from which it originates, and the moral purpose it is to subserve, they must necessarily adopt it and enforce its regulations. Such systematic effort on the part of organized ministerial and religious bodies, with the intent to control or direct municipal government in the interest of their own views of moral and religious "reform," is no longer unique in this country. In fact, cities where such movements have not been inaugurated are now rather the exception than the rule. Over the entire country, from east to west, and from north to south, the delusion has passed that the State and the citizen must be evangelized, undergo moral reformation, by force of law, and that the clergy and the Church bear the responsibility, not only of asserting this as a fact, but of providing the necessary legal remedies, and securing the enforcement of them, with the application of their penalties. This is a remarkable condition of affairs to exist thus early in a country, the Government of which, national, State and municipal, was supposed to have been established on the principle of absolute separation of Church and State.
