The French Senate has, by a vote of four to one, "re-sentenced the Romanism for jeopardizing social peace and the rights of the State;" and the *Mail and Express* comments that, "what is bad for the French Republic is doubly bad for the American." There is more truth in this comment than the *Mail and Express* would acknowledge, because, in America, it is the action of the Protestant Church, that is endangering the rights of the State, which is jeopardizing the rights of the State and the citizens.

In the countries to the south of the United States as the State more pronounced, in the light in which they appeal to the understanding, than in this country. But the reason is that there the strife is an open one between the Roman Catholic Church and the State, while here it is between the Church and the servants of the Church, on principles hidden in the Protestant Church.

In Mexico it is an open and avowed fight that has broken out between the government and a Romish propagation of monastic principles among the students of the several educational institutions; while, despatches from Rome say that the Pope "will excommunicate President Palencio, Lacklored, and the members of his Mexican Congress, unless measures are taken to resend the former relations between Church and State in Brazil." Italy, France, Hanover, etc., are also stirred deeply by these questions which are mainly religious in their inception, and will prove particularly in their proper development.

All these are but various phases of the same religious agitation.

Robert Baird, of Edinburgh, writing on "Religion in America" in the year 1843, laying narrated the story of the discovery and settlement of North America says:

He was "made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth, and had determined the time before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation," had resolved in his providence that Europe was not to remain the only depository of the Gospel message; that even drawing near, those who should be prosecuted for righteousness; sake, should be able to find refuge, and thus found a Protestant empire.

This is a manifest statement of the hope and expectations held by a certain body of

religionists, in reference to this country, nearly fifty years ago; that there might be founded here "a Protestant empire." This expression is without reserve, and, at that time, and writing in Scotland, there was no need to vail much a thought behind say words signifying, any more.

The idea that the new world should be a refuge for the persecuted of all nations must, with them, always, presupposed Protestantism and it never so much as entered their minds that the Lord of a nation a refuge for the downtrodden, of any sect or denomination, or all; and also equally, for those who know not God of any kind.

It is verily, that man's ways are not God's ways. He did not direct that those who first took sanctuary in his care should endeavor to monopolize its privileges and deny them to others.

The prime ministers of Minnesota, Michigan, have presented to the common council of that city a draft of an ordinance in reference to Sunday amusements, containing six sections, in the drawing of which they have employed able legal counsel, and which they place before the city fathers with the evident assurance that in consideration of the source from which it originates, and the moral purpose it to conserve, they require most probably adopt it and enforce its regulations. This system also effort on the part of organized ministerial and religious bodies, with the intent to control or direct municipal government in the interest of their own views and in furtherance of their purposes, is no longer unique in this country. In fact, cities where such movements have not yet inaugurated are now rather the exception than the rule. Over the entire country, from east to west, and from north to south, the delusion has passed that the State and the citizen must be evangelized, undergo moral reformation, by force of law, and that the clergy and the Church best the respectively, not only of providing the honesty legal results, and securing the enforcement of them, with the application of their penalties. This is a remarkable condition of affairs existing in this early in a country, the Government of which, national, State and municipal, was supposed to have been established on the principle of absolute separation of Church and State.

This legitimate result of the secularization of religion by means of State participation, is shown in this special dispatch to the *World*, from Columbus, Ohio:—

In the meeting of the Pastors' Union of this city to-day there was a resolution asking to set apart the preaches in favor of striking for pay for prayer and Bible-reading in the public schools. This has always been customary to invite different clergy-men in the city to officate in this way and court

branches has ever about six minutes or paid for such services. The Chair to-day in the Pastors' meeting appointed Rev. W. C. Holliday to look after this work, but he decided, with very sharp remarks among the body of the Legislature in getting a law passed permitting the practice. Other clergymen joined in the discussion and it is likely that a committee of the new who have audition action taken by the Union state will be asked to look into the matter.

If the Legislators should reform the services of the members of this Pastors' Union, it is not likely that it would do them divine favor by it, for truly the prayer of the man of the earth rights established is the voice. Even the Pharisee have prayed so in words, and in sentiments that streaks to seem of men, yet the prayer did not reach beyond the ceiling of Columbus, Ohio, pays for the Lord's answers to his prayers.

Since the earliest moves of the American Union, this is it affect to draw all in the industrial bodies of every character into alliance with itself in an effort of political coercive. With that for the purpose of the most strenuous assertions have been made that the Knights of Labor, and the workmen, including in general, were in full sympathy, and the chief weight of argument for legal Sunday closing has been that Saturday rest might be secured to the laboring man. Methodism itself has been no stranger in reference to the World's Fair's Sunday strictly to T. T. Powderly, Grand Master Workman, in the Knights of Labor themselves, is a complete refutation of all the statements of the friends of Sunday closing of workingmen, as asking for Sunday closed "by law through their organization. Mr. Fowley says:

Close the Exposition gates every day and there will be room for all who wish to visit the Fair during the remaining six days. If the Fair were kept open on Sunday. Those who attend in the interests of labor will not be obliged to attend for pleasure, recreation or instruction, just as much as of it as they would for the other six days. It is said keep the Exposition open seven days in the week, those who wish to observe the Sabbath or Sunday can do so, those who wish to visit the Fair, and not open it on day 8. . . . and closed at the same time every night. If we had three long evenings that every morning meet in the night, every meeting will have comprised the eight hours as passed it ought to be extended eight hours as to attend church in the evening. Let the people have a week out of the work and the time that is good and fair.

To this reply is this will probably not satisfy neither Mr. Fowderly nor his constituents know what is best or right for them, and so they must be compelled by tradition and laws." We consider it advisable and desirable for
