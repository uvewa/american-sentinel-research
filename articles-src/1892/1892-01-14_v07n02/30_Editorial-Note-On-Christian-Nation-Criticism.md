In the Religious Liberty column of THE SENTINEL for Dec. 17, some criticisms of the Statesman and its new management which appeared in the Christian Nation, were quoted. The Nation feels aggrieved at the reappearance of its own words and puts this estimate upon their force: "The issues, just at hand, of two little papers—the Advocate and Ensign, of Philadelphia, and THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, of New York—in their references to this journal remind us of the old song about the mosquito attacking the elephant. The mosquito got his battering ram smashed, but the elephant wasn't hurt; and from some things which these little papers have said it would seem as though they too, poor misguided things, have suffered by collision with the larger body, and that their buzzing is now of the nature of loquacity without capacity."
