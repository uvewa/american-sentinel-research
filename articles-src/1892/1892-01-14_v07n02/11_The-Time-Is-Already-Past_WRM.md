As long ago as 1843 Rev. George B. Cheever, of New York, in a lecture on Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," said:—

Almost every sect in turn, when tempted by the power, has resorted to the practice of religious persecution; . . . Bunyan was the first person in the reign of Charles II. *punished* for the crime of nonconformity . . . any palliation which could be resorted to, for the purpose of justifying an English hierarchy for shutting up John Bunyan in prison, would justify a Romish hierarchy for burning Latimer and Ridley at the stake. Strange that the lesson of religious toleration should be one of the last and hardest, even for liberal minds, to learn. It cost long time, instruction, and discipline, even for the disciples of Christ to learn it; and they never would have learned it had not the infant Church been cut loose from the State, and deprived of all possibility of girding the secular arm with thunder in its behalf. John had not learned it when he would have called down fire from heaven to destroy the Samaritans; nor John, nor his followers, when they forbade a faithful saint (some John Bunyan of those days), from casting out devils, because he followed not them. And they never would have learned it had the union of Church and State been sanctioned by the Saviour. . . . Who does not see that toleration itself, applied to religion, implies the assumption of a power that ought not to exist, that is in itself tyranny. It implies that you, an earthly authority, an earthly power, say to me so condescendingly, I permit you the exercise of your religion. You permit me? And what authority have you to permit me, any more than I to permit you? God permits me, God commands me, and do you dare to say that you tolerate me? Who is he that shall come in between me and God, either to say yea or nay? Your toleration itself is tyranny, for you have no right to meddle with the matter. But whenever Church and State are united, then there will be meddling with the matter; and even in this country, if one particular sect were to get the patronage of the State, there would be an end to our perfect religious freedom. . . . If you make nonconformity a crime, you are therefore a persecuting Church, whether your name be Rome, or England, or America.

The Church of America is almost moving the world in its present attempt to fix in the fundamental law of the land, the acknowledged legal decree that that which it declares sin is a civil crime. In the matter of remission of taxes, and appropriations for denominational Indian schools, the Church has obtained the patronage of the State; and in many instances the Church has subsidized the civil law to enforce a penalty upon—what is according to its interpretation—sin. The time is already far passed toward which this clear minded thinker pointed the finger of warning.
