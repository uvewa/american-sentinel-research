Under this head the San Francisco Examiner publishes a letter and comment worthy of note:—

"The following letter was written by George Washington, when President of the United States, in answer to a letter from a Seventh-Day Baptist Society, some of the members of which had been fined and imprisoned for laboring on Sunday. They wished to know if he, as President of the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States, understood that instrument to warrant any such interference with their religious freedom and rights of conscience. The letter is dated August 4, 1789, and reads as follows:—

"If I had had the least idea of any difficulty resulting from the Constitution adopted by the convention of which I had the honor to be president, when it was formed, so as to endanger the rights of any religious denomination, then I never should have attached my name to that instrument. If I had any idea that the general Government was so administered that liberty of conscience was endangered, I pray you be assured that no man would be more willing than myself to revise and alter that part of it, so as to avoid religious persecution. You can, without doubt, remember that I have often expressed my opinion that every man who conducts himself as a good citizen is accountable alone to God for his religious faith, and should be protected in worshiping God according to the dictates of his own conscience.

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

"This letter is copied from 'An Appeal to the Friends of Equal Rights and Religious Freedom in the United States,' by the Seventh-day Baptist General Conference, published in 1846, and shows conclusively that 'the Father of his Country' had no sympathy with nor approval of Sunday laws like those on our statue book, which would punish a Jew or a Seventh-Day Baptist or Adventist for not observing as a day of rest a day which, according to his religious belief, is one of those upon which he is commanded to labor and do all his work. It is these oppressive and persecuting Sunday laws which the Democratic party proposes to repeal and which the Republican party pledges itself to retain on the statute book. Let all friends of civil and religious liberty bear this in mind to-day."
