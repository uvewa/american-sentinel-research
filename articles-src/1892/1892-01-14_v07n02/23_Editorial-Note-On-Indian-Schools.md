THE Mail and Express says, "A grave error has been made in the past in permitting religious denominations to control some of the Indian schools. There should be an absolute separation of Church and State, and Indian schools supported by the Government should be nonsectarian in all respects. The public sentiment of American citizens utterly opposes all denominational interference with the public school system, and the Indian schools resemble in their intent and purpose the free institutions in which white children are educated and prepared for lives of usefulness."

This is true; the Government has fallen into a very grave error in this instance, but its error is no less serious in this than in any other case, where it has permitted the State to assume legislative patronage of religion. Denominational prejudice, jealousy of Roman Catholic influence, has opened the eyes of the Mail and Express to the truth in this particular case. The acknowledgement of the application of this principle of non-interference with the public schools of the Church, here made, arises from sectarian selfishness and not from any vision, transitory even, of the principles which should govern the relations of Church and State.
