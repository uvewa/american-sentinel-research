THE CHICAGO DAILY TIMES has this interesting editorial note:

"The act of a Kansas Court in granting an injunction to restrain the issuance of certain school bonds voted on Saturday, the plea of the petitioners being that two-thirds of the qualified voters of the district are Seventh-day Baptists and were virtually disfranchised by the election being held on their holy day, is a notable contribution to judicial precedent. It appears that the school-district trustees intend to accept the decision without appeal, which is unfortunate, as the question is one which should be definitely determined by the decision of a court of last resort. It involves, evidently, not the question at issue alone, but equally, the right of law-making bodies to force the observance of Sunday upon those whose religious faith impels them to refrain from mundane activity on Saturday—the true Sabbath. With the evident tendency of modern life to open wide the gates of pleasure on Sunday, and the increasing activity of the Sabbatarians in opposition to this irresistible tendency, it would be well to have the legal aspect of the question clearly and authoritatively defined."
