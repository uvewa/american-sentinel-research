THE United Presbyterian is so filled with the idea of the efficacy of the "boycott" as a means of closing the World's Fair on Sunday that it harps upon that thought continually; in a late issue the Presbyterian says: "So great are the issues involved that we believe that we should refuse all part in the World's Fair unless the Sabbath is recognized by the closing of the gates on that day. Every State should order its exhibit to be closed, and they who love the Sabbath should refuse to contribute to an exposition that violates it."
