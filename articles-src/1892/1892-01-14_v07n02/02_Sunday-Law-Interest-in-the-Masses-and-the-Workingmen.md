The American Sabbath Union exists for no other purpose than to secure the enactment and the enforcement of Sunday laws. This too wholly in the interests of worship, religion and the Church. This is the only method which it employs or knows for the advancement of religion, or for the better observance of Sunday and the forms of worship that go with it. It is well set forth in their own words, in an editorial in one of their two official organs. The *Michigan Sabbath Watchman* is "A monthly publication in the interest of the work of the American Sabbath Union, by Rev. Francis W. Wray;" and in this paper for October, as an editorial, runs as follows:—

The churches are preparing the way of the churches and saloons, and make it impossible to run the churches. Let them shut up the cigar stands, ice cream saloons, and soda water fountains, and candy and peanut stands, then put an end to railroad and other Sabbath excursions, and the enemies of the worst can only be turned to the house of God. Break down these encirclements first, before we complain that these indifferent ones have the right "nay" on our measure.

This is pretty strong, but in the same paper this zealous editor goes still further in telling of the contribution of his report to the work of the Union, under the heading "A Good Investment for the Churches," he lays out their designs in the following explicit style:—

If the churches of this State were to contribute $1,000 this year to assist the American Sabbath Union, the results of this work would in itself pay dividends which make for themselves the finest possible investment. Money was so invested in Indiana, and then was this rate of interest. The money now in Indiana's Sabbath enforcement by those who in no way sympathize with the churches, but who are led in large sympathy with the churches, who are led to see the public care and conservation of the Sabbath, where money is spent freely, by the saloonkeepers of Indiana and others, not in the interest of the churches and contribute to their support, and by their influence induce hundreds and thousands to attend places and institutions they now do not. The churches need not join in any combine, but they need to stand on self-defense and they will do it instinctively.

This shows just what the "civil" Sabbath of the American Sabbath Union amounts to; and it also shows just what the "poor enslaved workingmen, the poor enslaved workingmen."

Their interest in the workingmen is simply "fine rates of interest" on the money which they invest in securing and enforcing "our Sunday laws."

Their advocacy of the rights of the workingmen to "rest" is simply the advocacy of the "right of way" of the churches to the masses! "The enemies of the worst can only be more neatly turned to the" houses of God by breaking down the enticirclements of these instead of where these go now! And further, in their tender "interest" for "the workingmen, they have found that it will be "much cheaper" for them to support the churches "than it is not to support them" and their institutions and represent the interest of self-defense and they will do it instinctively.
