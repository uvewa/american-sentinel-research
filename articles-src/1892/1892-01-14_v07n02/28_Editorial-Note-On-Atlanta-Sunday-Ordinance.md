THE agitation of the Sunday question still continues in Atlanta, Georgia, as shown by this extract from the Atlanta Constitution:

"The following resolution, which was introduced by Alderman Woodward at a recent meeting of the council, and adopted, is causing the railroad employees a great deal of trouble:

"Resolved, That all laws, state and municipal in regard to railroad work on the Sabbath day, be rigidly enforced.

"Resolved further. That the chief of police is hereby specially instructed to carry out the provisions of the above resolution, and see that cases are made against the officials that issue orders for work to be done on Sunday contrary to law.

"Saturday night Chief Connolly instructed the captains and officers in charge of the force to strictly enforce the provisions of the resolution. Sunday, several engines were held up, and their crews taken in charge by the police. To say that they were indignant is no exaggeration of the fact.

"During the day, several times, the yard supervisors and others in charge were at the police station exhibiting permits and reciting their instructions from headquarters, but they were valueless, as the recent resolution adopted in the council annulled all permits. The orders from headquarters didn't go with the police department.

"The railroad officials declare that the ordinance is an unjust interference with their business, that it obstructs commerce, and is uncalled for."
