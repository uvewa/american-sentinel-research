The most sad and tearful history of humanity always had its origin in the Church domination within politics, civil affairs and matters. It was this that deluged Europe in the blood of her children in the dismal centuries of the past and spared not even the babe in its mother's arms. That stifled by Inquisition the tenderer, better and nobler impulses of the heart and ever hewed the way for the enthronement of tyranny and the enslavement of man.

Behold Russia of to-day and learn the diabolism of burning strange fire before the Lord, in the meddling of Church in the affairs of State and its concomitant cruelty, barbarity, tyranny, and sinfulness. What a sorrowful chapter for the nineteenth century, and under our own eyes, is this fearful persecution of the Hebrew race in Russia, and of dissenters from the established church! The holy synod, as a politician, was more concerned with power on earth than life in heaven, and to further rivet the chain of slavery, and cripple and retard the free movement of man, every thought, aspiration and hope, at any cost, must be hammered down to the regulation pattern, though torture, misery, and death ensue to family,—the father, mother, and little ones. The holy synod would not be the slave, no, indeed, but humanity should be the slave.

Let all true Americans heed the dark lessons of by-gone times and cherish the noble founders of this Republic, in renewed and steadfast fealty to the righteous principles that separated Church and State, and secured to the free men of America that religious liberty, without which civil liberty is but an empty dream.

—Elijah Bloom, in Minneapolis Evening Tribune.
