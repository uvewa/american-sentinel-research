THE United Presbyterian thus chronicles the progress of "Sunday Reform" in Newark, N. J.: "Public sentiment is very much aroused, just now, in regard to Sabbath traffic of all kinds. The butchers of six wards have formed organizations to secure Sabbath closing. On the 5th, the officers of these organizations signed the following circular letter, which was sent to every retail butcher (about 550) in the city:

"Dear Sir: The Sabbath closing of the butchers will be brought up and commended by Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts at the meeting to be held in the Young Men's Christian Association Hall, in Clinton St., on Sabbath, the 6th, at 4 o'clock. The subject is 'The Scientific Basis of the Sabbath. . . . Come, that you may fully understand what we are fighting for.' He will also speak at the Catholic Institute on Sabbath evening.

"(Signed) . . .

"The signers are officers of the Butchers' Sabbath Closing Association, and are the committee appointed to wait on the Mayor and Police Commissioners to demand the enforcement of the laws and ordinances forbidding traffic on Sabbath."
