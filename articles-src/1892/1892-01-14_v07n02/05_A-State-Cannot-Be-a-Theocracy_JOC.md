A State is distinct from a nation in its essential features: While the latter is the product of nature, and may be wholly unpolitical, as in the instance of some aboriginal tribes, the former owes its very existence to political machinery, and is wholly the creature of the people. In the words of another:—

The State emerges from and is upheld by society, and is therefore subservient to its ends. The true office of the State is simply to disembarrass the free interaction of the constituents of society; to secure justice and peace; to guard against excess and disorder. It is to keep the road clear for the footsteps of society, not to show the way; to regulate its movements, not to inaugurate them; to secure co-operation and harmony between the social elements, not to generate these elements, or their laws of affinity.

It therefore follows that while a nation might become a theocracy, as in the case of Israel, a State could not possibly have such a form of government, since in that event it would cease to be a political compact.

This will perhaps be more clearly seen by examining the nature of a theocracy. The word "theocracy" in its Greek form is defined "Rule of God." In other words it relates to a past form of government in which God was recognized as supreme Ruler in civil, as well as spiritual affairs. He not only made and proclaimed the law by which his government was administered, but without any voice of the people, expressing their preference, he appointed all officers, through whom the affairs of the nation were to be regulated. Officers thus appointed were but agents of Jehovah, and as such, were amenable only to him for their official acts. Even though the people might be dissatisfied with the course of any official, they had no power to remove him from office. He was appointed to his position by a power infinitely above the people, and could only be removed from it by the same authority which appointed him to the place.

The moral law of Jehovah being adopted as the civil code of the nation, its penalties were enforced by the civil rulers. This statement must of course be taken in a modified sense. None who were punished by the civil ruler under the theocracy, received the full penalty designed to be inflicted upon the incorrigible transgressor of God's law; for the punishment inflicted by the civil ruler, even then, was only temporal. The Judgment of the great day alone is competent to decide what punishment adequately meets the requirement of God's law. The civil ruler of that day did, however, make that law the basis of every outward offense, and punished accordingly. It mattered not whether the transgressor violated only that portion of the law which regulated his dealings toward his fellow-man, or that which ordered his religious worship; it was all the same. The civil magistrate was duly authorized to administer punishment in either case.

Not a move was made in anything, in fact, without explicit direction from Heaven. During all the wearying marches of Israel from Egypt to Canaan, God talked with Moses through the fiery, cloudy pillar, and from above the mercy-seat, directing and counseling him in all the affairs of the nation. The reasons for this are obvious.

1. Accepting Jehovah as their God, they not only became a distinct people, among the idolatrous nations by whom they were surrounded, but they thus gave their consciences into the keeping of Jehovah, to be regulated by his moral law.

2. By this act they were no longer their own but the peculiar people of God. In other words, they became the subjects of God's Church, or kingdom on the earth. It was therefore his privilege to prescribe the rites and ceremonies of their religious worship.

3. As their acknowledged king, he was absolute sovereign of their body politic; and as such, it was his prerogative to make his own laws, choose his own method of governing, proclaim war, and make peace with surrounding nations.

Therefore in appointing his officers of government, God chose to make them ministers of religious as well as of civil affairs. They not only administered punishment to the uncivil, but it was their duty to declare who were clean, and who were unclean, who were to be shut out from the congregation and who were to be admitted. In all these matters the people had no voice; but in everything, both civil and religious, were to inquire of the law at the mouth of those whom God had appointed to teach "all the statutes, which the Lord had spoken unto them." See Lev. 10:11

Though one of the most highly favored of God, Moses had not the privilege even of naming his successor. Joshua was called of God to fill the place soon to be made vacant by the death of Moses; and, although the people had no voice whatever in his selection, yet when Joshua had received his charge in the sight of the people they readily accepted him as their leader under God.
