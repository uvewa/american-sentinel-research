IN reference to the Pittsburg Law and Order suits the evening Leader of that city says:—

Judge Porter this morning rendered a decision affirming the finding of Alderman Roke in the law and Order suits against Sunday newspapers, and thereby laying down the law that the Sunday press is not even a "reasonable necessity," as counsel for the appellants ably sought to demonstrate.

We presume that Judge Porter has acted according to his lights, such as they are, and we have no criticism to offer concerning the type of judicial acumen that can recognize the limited enactment of 1794 as totally obliterating the reasonable privileges of half a million of citizens in 1892.

Suffice it to say that the Sunday newspapers, relying on the justice of their cause, will appeal to the Supreme Court of the State for a decision that will be conclusive. If it should appear from the fiat of that tribunal that the application of the Blue Laws has expanded on the principle of progressive harassment so as to include the needs of later generations in the same category with the things which were not necessities a hundred years ago, it will then remain only to apply to the Legislature and prove by the repeal of the act of 1794 the folly of its oppressive enforcement.

The courts of Pennsylvania have so far held strictly to the spirit of the colonial church and State laws on these questions. It will be a laying aside of precedent, out of respect to principle, scarcely to be expected, if the Supreme Court of the State should declare the law of 1794 unconstitutional, as it is, in that it gives preference by law to certain religious establishments and modes of worship.
