It is claimed that there are over thirteen millions of people of this nationality in this country; and, profoundly in their interest, National Reformers and preachers tell them of a threatened punishment that the World's Exposition at Chicago be closed on Sundays. Such a threat unmasks the selfish persecuting spirit of this "tell you the gospel." Truly it is a real all around the spirit that animates it, though professedly religious, antagonizes the spirit of the gospel of Christ. It does not propose to "persuade men."

These men and gentlemen of Christ "to obey what they believe to be a precept of the law of God, but by the lash of civil penalty it forces the unwilling into a semblance of obedience. Those matches only lack the power of Nebuchadnezzar to resort to the stringent methods of that ruler to his decree. See Dan. 3:19, 20.

When a Sunday at the Exposition be closed on Sunday it is the result of associations and interpretations that well its guarded and interpreted. What will be gained by the closing? To the entrance of Christianity? Manifestly nothing, but rather, an insult to its claims of brotherhood, for, rather, there is no grounds for the reflection of all nationalities gathered there will not be long in bartering upon the gates are closed against them, and by it will be seen as a contradiction, attempt them to the churches to hear the gospel? Will it not rather create in them a hatred towards the churches and a determined purpose to avoid them? Such is human nature.

Turned away from the Exposition, and into the chartered of the great city, the saloon and beer garden will be filled to overflowing in spite of an array of police, and the city will as it was to be glad to open the Exposition to all who comes or trains and boats on Sunday to absorb the surging populace, and drain off its pent up social uneasiness. On the other hand, were the churches to adopt God's plan of winning by the moral, suasion and the power of example, how different the result might be.

In imagination I see a Hindu, a Chinaman, a Persian, and a Turk, walking through the Exposition buildings on Sunday, in company with an interpreter, when the following dialogue takes place.

Hindu.—"Why is it that we see less people to-day than on the other days, and many of the stalls closed?"

Interpreter.—"It is because there are millions of people in this country, and thousands of them in this city, who keep Sunday, thinking it to be the Sabbath, or holy time, and therefore not one of them is here to-day."

Turk.—"Allah is great! But what kind of people is this?"

Interpreter.—"They are a very good people. They keep up their farms, and not they pay their meal bills, their grocery bills, their milk bills, their rent bills, and all other calls, and, if one of their number is too poor to do it, he hire more fortunate brethren help him."

The trouble is not that the people of Germany are educated, but they are wrongly educated. They are taught the religion in which they are instructed in Bible and made State taught. The result is a generation of practical Atheists. The American Exponent should make men of his mind to be worthy by throwing upon their own resources, instead of having the State to do for them the to make for everything, including religion, this made, and ready put on like a cast or a pair of gloves.

Chinaman.—"How much like the great men of our country."

Interpreter.—"Yes, I can tell you more. They do not smoke nor chew tobacce nor opium, nor take snuff. They do not drink whiskey, nor use intoxicating wine even at the communion table. Their women dress plainly, do not 'bang' their hair, nor wear earrings or finger rings. I can tell you they are a marvel of everything, their temples, or Joe houses, which they call churches, you will observe the 'o it calls and the it poor meet together."

Persian.—"And where do they learn all these excellent things? They must have a sacred book, even better than the Koran!"

Interpreter.—"Yes, they have, it is called the Bible."

All.—"Impossible! We have the Bible offered to the people in our country, but in our own languages, but we spurned it."

Interpreter.—"We remember to have seen it offered to the people in our country but in our own languages, but we spurned it. Now, however, we are well received soon as we reach home to procure a copy of two wonderful book and to see whether and then Christian people the same that send missionaries into our countries."

Interpreter.—"Yes, the very same."

All.—"These conduct led us at once to one of their temples where we can learn more of that wonderful people."

That would have been a pen picture of an ideal Christianity in its popular characters. Ministers and people committed to the schemes of National Reform, accustom, do act, in a general manner, contain the power, a godly example, the fruit of a holy life, as their professions and confessions show, of sufficient potency to win the respect of intelligent observers; yet to attend that powerful Christianity exists not in the Redeemer. Truly, the Exposition is only to some to such an end. The animus of the scheme is too poorly concealed to deceive the observing.
