It is claimed that there are over thirteen million Protestant church members in this country; and, professedly in their interest, National Reformers demand with the emphasis of a threatened boycott that the World's Exposition at Chicago be closed on Sundays. Such a threat unmasks the selfish persecuting spirit of this "civil Sabbath" fraud. It is a fraud because the spirit that animates it is, though professedly religious, antagonistic to the spirit of the gospel of Christ. It does not propose to "persuade men . . . by the meekness and gentleness of Christ" to obey what they believe to be a precept of the laws of God, but, by the lash of civil penalty to force the unwilling into a semblance of obedience. These zealots only lack the power of Nebuchadnezzar to resort to the stringent measures of that heathen ruler. See Dan. 3:19, 20.

Should the gates of the Exposition be closed on Sunday as the result of ecclesiastical interposition what will be gained to the cause of Christianity? Manifestly nothing; but, rather, an irreparable loss to the popular churches at least, for the multitudes of all nationalities gathered there will not be long in learning why the gates are closed against them, and by whom. Will such a consideration attract them to the churches to hear the gospel? Will it not rather create in them a hatred toward the churches and a determined purpose to avoid them? Such is human nature.

Turned away from the Exposition, and into the streets of the great city, the saloons and beer gardens will be filled to overflowing in spite of an army of police, and the city will soon be glad to open the Exposition and welcome excursion trains and boats on Sunday to absorb its surplus population and drain off its pent up social miasm. On the other hand, were the churches to adopt God's plan of winning by moral suasion and the power of example, how different the result might be.

In imagination I see a Hindu, a Chinaman, a Persian, and a Turk, walking through the Exposition buildings on Sunday, in company with an interpreter, when the following dialogue takes place:

Hindu.—"Why is it that we see less people here to-day than on other days, and many of the stalls closed?"

Interpreter.—"It is because there are millions of people in this country, and thousands of them in this city, who keep Sunday, thinking it to be the Sabbath, or holy time, and therefore not one of them is here to-day."

Turk.—"Allah is great! But what kind of people are they?"

Interpreter.—"They are a very good people. They are every one of them honest; they pay their meat bills, their grocery bills, their milk bills, their rent bills, and all other debts; and if one of their number is too poor to do it, his more fortunate brethren help him."

Chinaman.—"How much like the great Confucius. Tell some more."

Interpreter.—"Yes, I can tell you more. They do not smoke nor chew tobacco nor opium, nor take snuff. They do not drink whiskey, nor use intoxicating wine even at the communion table. Their women dress plainly, do not 'hang' their hair, nor wear earrings or finger rings. I can tell you they are a marvel of sweetness, of grace, and of beauty. When you go into their mosques, or Joss houses, which they call churches, you will observe that 'the rich and the poor meet together,' and no caste is observable."

Persian.—"And where do they learn all these excellent things? They must have a sacred book, more excellent than the zend."

Interpreter.—"Yes, they have; it is called the Bible."

All.—"We remember to have seen it offered to the people in our own country and in our own languages, but we spurned it. Now, however, we are resolved as soon as we reach home to procure a copy of the wonderful book and read it. But are these Christian people the same that send missionaries into our countries?"

Interpreter.—"Yes, the very same."

All.—"Please conduct us at once to one of their temples where we can learn more of this wonderful people."

But I have drawn a pen picture of an ideal Christianity in the popular churches. Ministers and people committed to the scheme of National Reform, so-called, do not, in a general sense, possess the power of a godly example, the fruit of a holy life, as their practices and confessions show, of sufficient potency to win the respect of intelligent observers, or to attract the masses to the sanctuary; and they must needs arm themselves with civil power to supply the deficiency, and to silence the reprover.

The closing of the Exposition is only a means to such an end. The animus of the scheme is too poorly concealed to deceive the observing.
