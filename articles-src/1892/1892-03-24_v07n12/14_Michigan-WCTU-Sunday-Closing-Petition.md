MARY T. LATHELP, President, and Emma A. Wheeler, Secretary, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Michigan, have addressed Mrs. Palmer, Superintendent of the Woman's Department at the World's Fair, "in behalf of twelve thousand white-ribbon women of Michigan," urging that the Exposition should be closed on Sunday. The petition was referred to the Director General of the Exposition with Mrs. Palmer's "official indorsement;" which means, of course, that the head of the Woman's department expresses her official approval of Sunday closing by authority.
