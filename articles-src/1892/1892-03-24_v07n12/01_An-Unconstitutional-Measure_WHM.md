In the House of Representatives on January 5, of this year, Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill entitled "A Bill to Prohibit the Opening of any Exhibition or Exposition where Appropriations of the United States are Expended," and reading as follows:—

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That no exhibition or exposition for which appropriation is made by Congress shall be opened on Sunday.

SECTION 2. That any violation of this act shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for every violation of the foregoing act.

This bill, expressed in precisely the same language, was introduced in the previous Congress by the same Representative, on December 19, 1890. It has been reintroduced and referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

The resolution thus insistently brought before Congress and to the attention of this committee, is but one of a series, which, from different points of view, are intended to serve the same purpose,—that of committing Congress to unconstitutional legislation upon religious subjects. The passage of this resolution would commit Congress to the establishment of a religious test by which its advocates would hope forever after to govern the Congress of the United States in making similar appropriations, and would establish a precedent, which, in order to maintain consistency and remain in conformity with itself, would make it necessary for Congress to require Sunday closing and Sunday keeping as a prerequisite in many other cases not specified in the bill.

This measure is stated in concise terms; there is no unnecessary verbiage. It is as arbitrary in its business-like brevity as it is in purpose. What is its purpose? The statement is clear,—"That no exhibition or exposition, for which appropriation is made by Congress, shall be opened on Sunday." But this very conciseness of expression, where no particulars are specified, necessarily becomes, in interpretation, of the very broadest application, and of the very widest significance. What is the breadth of application of this bill, and what the width of its significance? That no exhibition shall be opened on Sunday for which Congress has appropriated money will cover every individual exhibit of the United States Government both in this and in foreign countries. It will also pertain to every exhibit in this country or elsewhere, to which the United States shall contribute in any measure, making it necessary in all such cases, where the United States may be a partner, either active or silent, for Congress to require all others interested to enter into a contract, and give bonds at least to the amount of the appropriation made, that the exhibit shall not be opened on Sunday, or accept simply one hundred to one thousand dollars fine in lieu of the broken contract. And this assumption of authority by Congress as to the matter of Sunday closing is irrespective of whether it holds the majority of the stock in the enterprise or but a minor share. Whatever its interest or however small its appropriation or insignificant its exhibit, still, by virtue of its governmental authority it arbitrarily requires, in defiance it may be of the vote of its fellow-stockholders or associate contributors, that such exhibition shall be closed on Sunday.

That no exposition, for which Congress appropriates money, shall be opened on Sunday, would mean that no exposition such as the Centennial Exposition, at Philadelphia, or the Columbian Exposition, at Chicago, toward defraying the expenses of which Congress makes appropriation, or which it assists in any degree with the money of the United States, can be opened on Sunday. No reason is given. No cause for such action assigned. The fact is simply stated that all such enterprises and all the people connected with them and in attendance upon them, shall yield to the Government of the United States this portion of time. When Jehovah required of men that they should render to him the seventh day he gave a sufficient reason; but this bill would have the citizens of the United States, and incidentally the whole world, as it may be related to these expositions, render to it the first day of the week, a tribute of one-seventh of their time, without deigning to state any reason other than its own arbitrary will. In these cases this measure would be an indirect assumption of the right of exclusive legislation over one day in the week, in territory within the limits of a State and under the control of a municipality for which the Constitution gives no warrant. The powers of Congress are specified and that of direct legislative or municipal control restricted to the District of Columbia and "places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be." In order then to exercise this right of local control it would be necessary for Congress to purchase the site of all expositions in which it took part, subject to the permission of State Legislatures, therefore this indirect method of attaining the same end is undertaken, and by it Congress is enabled to exercise exclusive authority for one day of the week in territory outside of that over which the Constitution gives it control. The application of this bill is certainly broad.

But what is the purpose of this measure? A bill so forcibly arbitrary and with such a breadth of application must have been inspired by an intent to use the power that might be obtained by it for a purpose. Its purpose is the same as that of all other bills relating to Sunday, now, or at any other time, before Congress, and that is, that the Congress of the United States shall give its legislative sanction to the dogma of the sacredness of Sunday, the "American Sabbath." And however many other interpretations this measure might be subject to the religious question would be so inextricably commingled with them as to utterly vitiate its propriety as a matter of adjudication by the Congress of the United States. What would be said of a similar bill which should specify, instead of Sunday, Christmas day, Easter, or any or all the holy days upon the church calendar? No suggestion that Congress, or any civil authority, should so legislate would be listened to for a moment. It would be immediately seen that its purpose was to secure the enforcement of a man-made religious formality. But suppose the other horn of the dilemma is taken and its sanction is based upon the divine authority of the immutable moral law delivered from Sinai. It then becomes confessedly without the pale of constitutionality. More, it becomes a blasphemous assumption of authority to change, interpret, and enforce a divine edict.

There is still another point of, apparently, intentional unconstitutionality involved in this measure. The very reference of this bill to the committee which has it in charge shows the general understanding that it is intended to have effect upon the coming World's Fair in Chicago. Legislation, however, has been had upon that, and appropriations made. Has any one then presumed to present for the consideration of Congress, a measure intended to be an ex post facto law,—one retroactive in character and impairing obligations previously entered into? Vitiating the value of previous contracts, after second and third parties have acted in good faith upon them? It is charitable to consider that this bill was presented without due forethought and without counsel, and yet its reintroduction in a second Congress, couched in precisely identical words would seem to preclude any such charitable construction.

This measure is hopelessly and doubly unconstitutional; its intent is to ask for the unconstitutional application of a law which would be in itself unconstitutional.

To require the observance of Sunday is to require obedience to a religious dogma, which is the distinguishing mark of a certain ecclesiastical hierarchy. It is to assert, by the authority of the Government, that that form of Christianity is part of the law of the land, which is the precept of an established church and religion, and inapplicable under the Constitution of the United States. There can not constitutionally be any United States statute for the purpose of enforcing Sunday keeping, or any other religious observance. This bill would enforce it by a discrimination and a penalty. It has no place upon the United States statute books.

Truly, the application of this bill is not limited, neither is it without significance.
