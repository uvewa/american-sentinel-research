AN incident in Burlington, New Jersey, lately reported to the Union Signal, marks the progress of ecclesiastical influence in municipal affairs. The correspondent says:—

The acting mayor gave permission to hold a Sunday concert in the opera house. The ministers, by telegram ordered the mayor-elect home, and entered their protest. The mayor after looking up the law, found such concerts to be a "willful misdemeanor," and consequently prohibited the sale of tickets. This is a point we should "make note of," that, law can be enforced if there is power behind the law to enforce it.

The calm way in which it is said the ministers by telegram "ordered" the actual mayor home, shows an assumption of authority over municipal officers and municipal affairs as a ministerial prerogative which is quite startling.
