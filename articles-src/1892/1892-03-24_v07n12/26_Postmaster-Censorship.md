THE VOICE complains that copies of that paper, paid for from a fund provided for that purpose, and sent to farmers who are desirous of receiving it, are not delivered but are held by the postmasters who send the publishers the usual notification cards, marked, "fail to receive it," "do not want it," "refuse to take it out of the office," etc, and that consequently the paper remains "dead" in the offices. The VOICE claims to have letters from over one hundred different men whom postmasters have reported as refusing the paper, saying that they never refused it, but on the contrary, wish it continued. These letters are from twenty-five different offices, thus involving twenty-five postmasters in serious difficulty if justice is done. Such a censorship of the mails ought not to be tolerated in this country.
