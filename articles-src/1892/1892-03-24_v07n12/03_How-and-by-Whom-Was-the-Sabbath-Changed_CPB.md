In its issue of the 27th ult., the Christian Statesman has an article, written in the usual contemptuous style of the editor, in which is ridiculed the claim of seventh-day observers that the Sabbath was "changed" by the Roman Catholic Church, and not by the apostolic Church. The question is by no means vital, nor is it even pertinent, to the discussion of the right of the civil power to require cessation of all secular business on Sunday, or any other day; but inasmuch as the Statesman's denial is made in the interests of a State-bolstered religious institution, it may not be amiss to examine briefly the question, "How, and by Whom, Was the Sabbath Changed?"

That the Sabbath was ever really changed, in the proper sense of that word, will be asserted only by those who believe that Sunday is now the true Sabbath; for God made the Sabbath, by resting upon, and by blessing and sanctifying the seventh day, and he alone could really change it. But that a change has been attempted, and that so far as the practice of a vast majority of the Christian world is concerned, it has been successful, is patent to all. That the Bible gives no hint of this change, and consequently no sanction to it, has been shown in a previous number of this paper. Therefore, the only remaining question is, "How, and by Whom, Was the Sabbath Changed?"

That neither Christ nor his apostles changed the Sabbath is admitted by many who regard the day as sacred. Thus the Christian at Work, of February 18, 1886, said:—

We hear less than we used to about the apostolic origin of the present Sunday observance, and for the reason that while the Sabbath and Sabbath rest is woven into the warp and woof of Scripture, it is now seen, as it is admitted, that we must go to later than apostolic times for the establishment of Sunday observance.

Just how Sunday observance was introduced is thus explained by the same paper, January 8, 1885:—

The selection of Sunday, thus changing the particular day designated in the fourth commandment, was brought about by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church; and on this basis, and on none other, does the Christian Sabbath, the first day of the week rest.

Neander, who "McClintock and Strong's Cyclopedia" says, is "universally conceded to be by far the greatest of ecclesiastical historians," gives this pointed and candid testimony in the first edition of his history:—

The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance, and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect; far from them and from the apostolic Church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had begun to take place; for men appear by that time to have considered working on Sunday a sin.—Rose's Neander, page 126.

Representative Sunday keepers would not make such statements if the facts of history did not compel them to do so. The truth is, that self-respecting men, unless blinded by bigotry, do not care to hazard their reputation on utterances which can be so easily discredited as can the statement that the apostolic Church regarded Sunday as the Sabbath; and so all, except those polemic divines who care more for their particular creeds than for the truth, refuse to longer peddle the pious frauds by which Sunday sanctity has so long been sustained.

But who did "transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday"? The Christian at Work says that it was done "by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church," in "later than apostolic times." But what right had the "early Christian Church" to concur in setting aside the divinely appointed Sabbath and substituting another in its stead? Evidently none whatever. And if such concurrence could give sanctity to an institution and make it binding upon anybody, how comes it that the same concurrence did not give equal sanctity to other institutions of the "early Christian Church"? The truth is that the Church never had at any period any such authority; and the assumption was nothing short of blasphemy. By whatever name it may be called, whether the "early Christian Church," or the "Roman Catholic Church," the Sabbath could have been "changed" only by a church that had departed not a little from the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

It may be technically inaccurate to assert, as some do, that "the Roman Catholic Church changed the Sabbath," or that "the Pope changed it;" but it is absolutely true, "as it is admitted," that the change was made by the Church after, as all Church history shows, numerous corruptions and abuses had crept into the Church. And it is also true that these corruptions and abuses continued to increase in number and influence until the apostasy which had begun even in Paul's day, developed into the full-grown man of sin. As well might we deny the identity of the boy and the man, or of the thirteen Colonies and the thirteen original States of the Union, as to deny that the apostasy of which the Roman Catholic Church is the embodiment is simply the perfect development of that to which the apostle referred in his second letter to the Thessalonians.

Like the apostasy which finally developed into the full-grown "man of sin," the change of the Sabbath was a growth. It is impossible for either friend or foe of Sunday keeping to say definitely just when it was introduced. As well might we attempt to locate definitely the origin of saint worship, prayers for the dead, etc., as to say just when Sunday began to be regarded as sacred; but like the other inheritances from paganism now found in the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church, it should be enough for Protestants to know that it is without a shadow of divine authority; and that the very best that can be said truthfully for it, is that the observance of Sunday was "brought about by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church," in "later than apostolic times."

In his "History of Romanism," book 2, chap. 1, sec. 3, Dowling has well said:—

Protestantism, as opposed to Popery, has been defined by Isaac Taylor, in his Ancient Christianity, as "A REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE INNOVATIONS BEARING AN ASCERTAINED DATE," and to this definition we have no particular objection, inasmuch as the date of most, if not all of the Popish innovations, both doctrinal and ritual, can be ascertained with considerable accuracy. Still we must be allowed to add, that should innovations be discovered, either in that or any other communion the date of the admission of which is entirely unknown, if they are contrary to the doctrine and spirit of the Bible, if they are not found in God's word—that is to say, if they are innovations at all—then true Protestantism requires their unqualified rejection, just as much as if their date were as clearly ascertained as is the date of the Papal supremacy, or the absurd dogma of transubstantiation. "THE BIBLE I SAY, THE BIBLE ONLY, IS THE RELIGION OF PROTESTANTST!" Nor is it of any account in the estimation of the genuine Protestant, how early a doctrine originated, if it is not found in the Bible. He learns from the New Testament itself, that there were errors in the time of the apostles, and that their pens were frequently employed in combating those errors. Hence, if a doctrine be propounded for his acceptance, he asks, Is it to be found in the inspired word? was it taught by the Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles?

Concerning the introduction of some of the Romish practices, Dowling says:—

There is scarcely anything which strikes the mind of the careful student of ancient ecclesiastical history with greater surprise, than the comparatively early period at which many of the corruptions of Christianity, which are embodied in the Romish system, took their rise; yet it is not to be supposed that when the first originators of many of these unscriptural notions and practices, planted those germs of corruption, they anticipated or even imagined that they would grow into such a vast and hideous system of superstition and error, as is that of Popery. Thus remarks a learned and sagacious writer: "Each of the great corruptions of later ages took its rise in a manner which it would be harsh to say was deserving of strong reprehension. . . . The worship of images, the invocation of saints, and the superstition of relics, were but the expansions of the natural feelings of veneration and affection cherished toward the memory of those who had suffered and died for the truth. . . . The very abuses which make the twelfth century abhorrent on the page of history, were, in the fourth, fragrant with the practice and suffrage of a blessed company of primitive confessors. The remembered saints who had given their bodies to the flames had also lent their voice and example to those unwise excesses which at length drove true religion from the earth. Ustaught by experience the ancient Church surmised not of the occult tendencies of the course it pursued, nor should it be loaded with consequences which human sagacity could not well have foreseen."—Id., book 2, chap. 1, sec. 1.

The same might be said of the observance of Sunday, that it was but natural that those who had before regarded it as a day sacred to the sun, should, upon becoming Christians, retain some of that reverence; nor is it strange that they should seek to connect the observance of the first day, with their new religion, especially as the fact of the resurrection of Christ on that day afforded them an excellent pretext for so doing. And that is just what they did; and it is significant that the practice of keeping Sunday as a Christian festival originated among Gentile Christians—those who had as pagans worshiped the sun upon that day. Recognizing this fact, the *North British Review*, Vol. 13, p. 409, thus defends the change:—

That very day was the Sunday of their heathen neighbors and respective countrymen; and patriotism gladly united with expediency in making it their Lord's day and their Sabbath. . . . The primitive Church, in fact, was shut up to the adoption of Sunday, until it became established and supreme, when it was too late to make another alteration; and it was no irreverent or undelightful thing to adopt it, inasmuch as the first day of the week was their own high day at any rate.

It can not be claimed that this paragraph was written by an enemy to the first day, for it is a defense of the Sunday institution; and it is evident that had the writer known any better argument for the practice of Sunday-keeping than "expediency," or any higher authority for it than the practice and decree of a corrupt and time-serving church, he would never have made such humiliating and damaging admissions. And this lack of scriptural authority for Sunday-keeping, together with the plea of "expediency" marks it as a child of the Papacy; not that it was *begotten* by the man of sin, for, as we have seen, it was a heathen festival long before there was such a thing as the Papacy; but that it was early adopted by the mystery of iniquity, and given a place in the Christian Church which rightfully belonged to another day, namely, the seventh, the one specified in the fourth commandment.

But what especially marks the Sunday Sabbath as the child of the Roman Church, is the fact that it was a Roman Catholic Council that first decreed that it should be kept instead of the ancient Sabbath. Upon this point Rev. Mr. James, in addressing the University at Oxford, said:—

When the practice of keeping Saturday Sabbaths, which had become so general at the close of this [the third] century, was evidently gaining ground in the Eastern church, a decree was passed in the council held at Laodicea [A. D. 364] "that members of the church should not rest from work on the Sabbath, like Jews, but should labor on that day, and preferring in honor the Lord's day, then if it be in their power should rest from work as Christians."

William Prynne, famous in the history of English Puritanism, also says:—

It is certain that Christ himself, his apostles, and the primitive Christians, for some good space of time, did constantly observe the seventh-day Sabbath, . . . the evangelists and St. Luke in the Acts ever styling it the Sabbath day, . . . and making mention of its . . . solemnization by the apostles and other Christians, . . . it being still solemnized by many Christians after the apostles' times, even till the Council of Laodicea [A. D. 364], as ecclesiastical writers and the twentyninth canon of that council testify, which runs thus: "Because Christians ought not to Judaize, and to rest in the Sabbath, but to work in that day [which many did refuse at that time to do]. But preferring in honor the Lord's day 'there being then a great controversy among Christians which of these two days . . . should have precedency]; if they desired to rest they should do this as Christians. Wherefore if they shall be found to Judaize, let them be accursed from Christ." The seventh-day Sabbath was . . . solemnized by Christ, the apostles, and primitive Christians, till the Laodicean Council did in a manner quite abolish the observation of it. . . . The Council of Laodicea . . . first settled the observation of the Lord's day, and prohibited . . . the keeping of the Jewish Sabbath under an anathema.

Of the effects of the decree of this council, John Ley, another old English writer, speaks thus:—

From the apostles' time to the Council of Laodicea, which was about the year 364, the holy observation of the Jews' Sabbath continued, as may be proved out of many authors; yea, notwithstanding the decree of that council against it.

About the year 468 or 469 A. D., Pope Leo issued the following decree:—

WE ORDAIN, according to the true meaning of the Holy Ghost, and of the apostles as thereby directed, that on the sacred day [Sunday] wherein our own integrity was restored, all do rest and cease from labor.

It was thus that the voluntary custom of a *portion* of the Church was made universal and enforced upon the whole Church; and thus it was that what Neander calls a "transfer of the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday" was made, and a "divine command" for its observance established. So far, then, as giving it the authority of the Church, and by it displacing the seventh day, the man of sin, the Papacy, the Roman Catholic Church, while yet in its nonage, or minority, did change the Sabbath; and to assert this is no greater inaccuracy of language, even, than to say that the "Father of his country," while yet a child ruined his father's cherry tree. At the time of that occurrence he was not the "Father of his country," but his identity never changed; the incident was true of the individual and no change of name or title could separate the fact from him.
