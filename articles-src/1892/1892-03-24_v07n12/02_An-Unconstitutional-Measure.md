In the House of Representatives on January 5, of this year, Mr. Morse, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill entitled "A Bill to Prohibit the Opening of any Exhibition or Exposition where Appropriations of the United States are Expended," and reading as follows:—

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,* That no exhibition or exposition where appropriations made by Congress are expended, shall be opened on Sunday.

SEC. 2. That any violation of this act shall be punishable by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for every violation of the foregoing act.

This bill, expressed in precisely the same language, was introduced in the previous Congress by the same Representative, on December 19, 1890. It has been reintroduced and referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

The resolution thus insistently brought before Congress and to the attention of this committee, is but one of a series which, from different points of view, are intended to serve the same purpose,—that of causing Congress to enter upon religious legislation upon religious subjects. The passage of this resolution would commit Congress to the establishment of a religious test by which its advocates would long forever after to govern the Congress of the United States in making similar appropriations, and would establish a precedent, which, in order to maintain consistency and to remain in conformity with itself, would make it necessary for Congress to require Sunday closing and Sunday keeping as a precedence in many other cases not specified in the bill.

There is no unnecessary verbiage. It is as arbitrary in its business-like brevity as it is in its purpose. What is its type? Its exact statement is clear,—"That no exhibition or exposition, for which appropriated in any by Congress, shall be opened on Sunday." But this very conciseness of expression, when no particulars are specified, necessarily becomes, in interpretation, of the very broadest application, and of the very widest significance. What is the breadth of application of this bill, and what the width of its significance? That no exhibition shall be opened on Sunday for which Congress has appropriated money will cover every individual exhibit of the United States Government both in this and in foreign countries. It will also cover every exhibition or exposition elsewhere, to which the United States shall contribute in any manner, making it necessary in all such cases, that the United States have in it a partner, either active or silent, for Congress to require all others interested to enter into a contract, and give bonds and bind to the amount of the appropriation made, that the exhibition shall not be open on Sunday, or else accept simply one hundred to one thousand dollars in fines in lieu of the broken contract.

And this assumption of authority by Congress as to the number of Sunday closing the majority of the stock in the enterprise or but a minor share. Whatever its interest or however small its appropriation, if its legislature is to avail itself, by virtue of its governmental authority it arbitrarily requires, in defiance it may be to the voice of its fellow-stockholders or associate contributors, that such exhibition shall be closed on Sunday.

That no exposition, for which Congress appropriates money, shall be opened on Sunday, would mean that this exposition in its entirety, the Centennial, the Philadelphia, or the Columbian Exposition, at Chicago, toward defraying the expenses of which Congress makes appropriation, or which in lieu of the broken contract.

No cause for such action suggested. Not even the most devout churchgoer of that faith and confidence of religion which can be given. No reason is given. Nor even is it said that all such enterprises and all the people connected with them and in attendance upon them, shall yield to the Government, the United States system of force. When, who have advocated organized of men that they should render to their ecclesiasts duty by pure a religious reason; but this bill would have the citizens of the United States, and incidentally the whole world, as it may be related to these expositions, render to it the first day of the week, a tribute of one-seventh of their time, without deigning to state any other reason than their own arbitrary will. In these cases this measure would be an indirect assumption of the right of exclusive legislation over one day in the week, in territory within the limits of a State and under the control of a municipality for which the Constitution gives no warrant. The powers of Congress are specified and that of direct legislative and independent control over territory that is not of Columbia and "places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be." In other than to exercise the right of local control it would be necessary for Congress to purchase the site of all expositions in which it took part, subject to the permission of State Legislatures, before this indirect method of advancing the cause of its undertakers, and by it Congress is enabled to exercise exclusive authority for one day of the week in territory outside of that over which the Constitution gives it control. The application of this bill is not totally based.

What the purpose of this measure? A bill so forcibly arbitrary and with such breadth of application must have been inspired by an intent to use this power that might be obtained by it for a purpose. Its purpose is the same as that of all other bills relating to Sunday, now, or at any other time, before Congress, and that is, that the Congress of the United States shall give its legislative endorsement to the dogma of the sacredness of Sunday, the "American Sabbath." And however many other interpretations the measure might be subject to the religious question would be so insistently communicated with them as to utterly vitiate its propriety as a matter of adjudication by the Congress of the United States. What would be said of a similar bill which should specify, instead of Sunday, Christmas day, Easter, or any or all the holy days upon the church calendar? If the principle be admitted that any civil authority, should so legislate would be listened to for a moment. It would be immediately seen that the proposition was to secure the enforcement of a man-made religious formality. But suppose the other form of the dilemma: what if the act of the bill itself and takes its sanction is based upon the divine authority of the immutable moral law delivered from Sinai. It then becomes confessedly without the pale of constitutionality. Moreover, it becomes a blasphemous assumption of authority to change, interpret, and enforce a divine edict.

There is still another point of apparently legitimate unconstitutionality involved in this measure. The very references of this bill to the committee which has it in charge shows the general understanding that it is intended to have effect upon the coming World's Fair in Chicago. Legislation, however, has been had upon that, and appropriations made, that are a condition prepared to present for the constitutional question of Congress's immediate relation to the case.

As an *ex post facto* law,—one retroactive in character and imposing obligations previously entered into! Visiting the value of previous contracts, after one sided and third parties have acted in good faith upon them! It is charitable to have contended as this bill was maintained without due forethought and without counsel, and yet congress has this second Congress, conduced to precisely identical words would seem to preclude any such charitable construction.

This measure is expressly and directly unconstitutional, its intent is to ask for the unconstitutional application of a law which would be in itself unconstitutional.

To require the observance of Sunday is to require obedience to a religious dogma, which is the distinguishing mark of a certain ecclesiastical hierarchy. It is to enact, by the authority of the Government, that that form of Christianity is part of the law of the land, which is the principle of an established church and religion, and one which is repugnant to the law of the United States. There can not constitutionally be any United States statute for the purpose of enforcing Sunday keeping, or any other religious observance. This bill must endorse it by a discrimination and a penalty. It has no place upon the United States statute books.

Truly, the application of this bill is not needed, neither is it without its significance.
