"The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly do enact as follows:"

"Section 1. Enacted by Senate and Assembly of New York, enacted as a misdemeanor for any person to carry on the business of a barber on the first day of the week known as Sunday.

"SEC. 2. That any one found guilty of violating this act shall be fined not less than ten nor more than or dollars or imprisonment in the county jail not less than fifteen days or more than thirty days, or both, in discretion of court."

The title would indicate that Mr. Littman means to have it made a crime for any person to carry on the business of a barber in this State on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. This critical reader will observe, however, that there is not a word about Sunday in the body of the act itself. The first section, it is provokes anything or all, which is extremely doubtful, infringes an attempt to prohibit the "barbering" business in New York on Saturday—the seventh day of the week day as well.

This would do for the city of Syracuse, but it will hardly answer for New York. We would respectfully suggest an amendment. Let it be made a misdemeanor for such a man as Adam C. Littman to attempt to engage in the business of legislation for the State of New York.

Ten rigs of the anonymous complaint and the tested censorship of the decretists has begun in New York. The following brief item from the free mails this adaptation. From *Collamer et al.*

Complaints were sent to Police Headquarters last Sunday from various parts of the city, asserting that at the city theaters were very little different from the average weekday performances that it was stated theatrical managers were trying to evade the law by giving "sacred concerts" instead of theatrical performances. It was intimated from headquarters that the law should be enforced, with specific directions as to the nature of the programmes to be given:—

"Any interlude, tragedy, comedy, opera, ballet, play, farce, negro minstrelsy, negro or other dancing, tumbling, or other gymnastic performance, or other entertainment of the stage, or any part thereof."

Attention was also called to the fact that it was a violation of the law for theatrical managers to sell tickets or in any other way dispose of admission to their matinee performances on Sunday.

The result of the order from headquarters was that Detectives Kemp, Dowd, and McConnell, went on the search; some hall is the Broadway, the Tremont, and Hall's, and the Broadway Theater. Out Tab Imperial's Brother, at the Broadway, were giving "biblical tableaux," was the object of special attention. At Koster and Bial's and the Standard the actors were performing in citizen's clothing, and coats and no costumes was in use and public criticism was passed upon them. Yeats "Van's" people's night is an interlude from the theatrical interlude from the theatrical, they use and wigs and theatrical wardrobe was prohibited. The entertainment was a concert interspersed with living pictures from history and the Bible and a striking group. Captain Reilly said:

"I should not interfere, not like this plain clothes detective business, with what I consider however the law intended."

A previous order in regard to certain acts to be performed. Last week Miss Lydia Yeamans was tried for one of the vaudeville features it was called, and was acquitted. She appears at the Yeamans Tremont. Detective Hayes had said she would be arrested if she repeated the performance. The Tremont's manager said the audience would not stand the order was provoked by this, and by the warning by the detective a barber's habit or a character to effect his or hers and wigs, while one was after the good clothes order provoked by this, and by the warning by which a detective habit's character to detect is effected, while one was is worn after the good clothes order very bad grace by the editors of the police commissioners.

It is but one step farther to a police censorship of the Sunday wigs and costumes of the general public.

Test much of the threat of Dr. Parkhurst, to turn the city upside down and off and the uncovering municipal authorities, has appeared in the streets of fear of the functionaries for selling liquor on Sunday. The mountain has been in tremendous eruption for several Saturday posts, and the small church mouse has been brought before Justice McMahon to be disposed.
