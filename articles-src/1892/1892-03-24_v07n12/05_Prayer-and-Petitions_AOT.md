Mrs. J. C. BATEHAM, National Superintendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, sends out the following:—

The week of prayer for Sabbath observance from April 4 to 11, should receive special attention, as it comes about the time the Exposition question is to be settled, and the World's Sabbath Prayer Union of all lands will join with us in putting this as the foremost topic. Make it as much a point to secure the church prayer meetings as the sermons. Get both in every church, if possible, and also introduce our leaflets in the Sabbath schools. Public meetings, prayer meetings in the Unions, private prayers, and a large use of literature should also emphasize the week.

In line with the same work the President of the Indiana Woman's Christian Temperance Union advises the local unions in that State thus:—

The circulation of petitions will be a very important part of our work, and I hope that every Union in the State will see to the circulation of the petitions in regard to the Sunday closing of the Columbian Exposition. Be sure to get the indorsement of every public assembly, if possible; and the names of all persons in your locality. As the question whether the Exposition is to be closed will be decided next April, we have no time to lose.

As these good women pray and petition, it may be that God will open the eyes of some of them to see the great error of trying to secure the legal enforcement of Sunday, or any other religious observance.
