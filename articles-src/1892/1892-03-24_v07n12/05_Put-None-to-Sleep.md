One of the most prominently announced tenets of the Society of Christian Endeavor of Oakland, California, is thus quoted by the *Times* of that city:—

The largest liberty that we can have is a product of personal purity, combined with living always as an organic community, whose mission is wrought not under the moral Governor of the universe. It is a republic that is far too near an autocratic and absolute. God established the Sabbath day.

We would commend to the Sabbath Endeavor society of Oakland the wisdom to agree that day. License is not liberty. True liberty is the God-given right of every man living at moral motion. The Sabbath day is far nearest to the conditions that are necessary to the highest citizenship. To do away with the Sabbath day does away with a sense of moral responsibility. To do away with moral responsibility is to do away with any recognition of duties to others. And when our fellow men no longer consider their duty to us we have license,—not liberty.

Remember France and her Revolis and Reign of Terror.

Upon this our contemporaries should be patiently and, with a willingly prayed-in considering of all points of the Christian patriotism that spirit allowed the "largest liberty" that should be known. Quietly and calmly, to the compelling "personal institute" by means of the religious obligation, pillars and the nation's pledges. The sign, who, when they fared, at Plymouth Rock, "fell full upon their knees and then upon the face of the aborigines," and who gave themselves to an organic community, whose mission is wrought under the moral Governor of the universe." Acting upon this idea they proceeded to punish "by the civil power" all who did not acknowledge their "responsibility" to God as these their Sabbath "responsibilities" which came and look everybody "for the full Sabbath." Then, these refugees from the old world persecutions soon built a meetinghouse with a fortress around that "God established the Sabbath day" and that its sanctity should be maintained by the civil power.

"Which God—which Sabbath," was readily enough decided in the own minds of the two that the others want to be told—"not asked."

The same plan is today in the hearts of those who would fain enforce the "largest liberty" to inflict injury upon those who oppose the "true Sabbath, Sunday," to compel all to adopt their form of working out a moral mission "and which under the moral Governor of the universe" had no consideration for the rights of others.

Intolerance and persecution are but the logical and legitimate result of the assumption that political parties and civil governments have any business in "the enterprise of enforcing any part of the divine law." They have in fact not the slightest shining right.
