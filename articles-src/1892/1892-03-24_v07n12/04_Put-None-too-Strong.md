The fourth section of the pronunciamento of the Society of Christian Endeavor of Oakland, California, is thus quoted by the *Times* of that city:—

The largest liberty that we can have is a product of personal restraint along certain lines. The State is an organic community, whose mission is wrought out under the moral Governor of the universe. It is responsible to him in the same sense as is the individual. God established the Sabbath day. The Nation as such, being responsible to him, must recognize that day. License is not liberty. True liberty gives us protection and the privilege of working out a moral mission. The Sabbath day is fundamental to the conditions which are essential to the highest citizenship. To do away with the Sabbath day does away with a sense of moral responsibility. To do away with moral responsibility does away with any consideration of the rights of others. And when our fellow-men no longer consider our rights we are surrounded by barbarism and anarchy. Remember France and her Revolution.

Upon this our contemporary comments thus pertinently, and withal pungently:—

Herein is contained an excellent exposition of the Puritanical spirit that allowed the "largest liberty" to the witches, Quakers, and Baptists of Salem by compelling "personal restraint" by means of the gibbet, the pillory, and the ducking-stool. The bigots, who, when they landed at Plymouth Rock "first fell upon their knees and then upon the aborigines," also believed that "the State (as organized by themselves) is an organic community, whose mission is wrought under the moral Governor of the universe." Acting upon this idea they proceeded to the building of a jail in which to imprison all who did not acknowledge their "responsibility" to the particular God worshiped by the jail builders. Then these refugees from the persecutions of another sort of bigotry, built a church in which they preached that "God established the Sabbath day." Whereupon those who, searching for the truth, made inquiry, "Which God—which Sabbath!" were promptly landed in the jail, exposed in the pillory, ducked in the horse pond, or hanged by the neck. The same spirit prevails in the effort to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, but the power to inflict injury upon those who oppose the "true liberty" which "gives us protection and the privilege of working out a moral mission" and which has never, when opportunity afforded, had "any consideration for the rights of others," is lacking. Their "fellow-men no longer consider their right" to jail, pillory, duck, and hang. They are surrounded by the "barbarism" of common sense and the "anarchy" which emanates from the principle that every man shall be allowed to worship his own god, in the way that best pleases him, on the day he sees fit to set apart for this purpose.

Intolerance and persecution are the necessary and legitimate fruit of the assumption that political parties and civil governments are charged with the responsibility of enforcing any part of the divine law. The *Times* has put it in none too strong a light.
