A RECENTLY contributed article in the Boston Traveller, referred to in these columns last week, contains these two startling propositions:—

When the Bible was put into the hands of the people, they became the earthly sovereigns and executives of all it contains. Therefore, whether we consider morals and religion as within the jurisdiction of the Church or the State, the people are supreme in that jurisdiction.

The people, the State, are the final interpreters of all laws, religious or non-religious, in or out of the Bible.

The assumption that the people are the executors of all that the Bible contains is a most dangerous one, and fully justifies all the persecution for conscience' sake that the world has ever seen. Mr. Eaton probably made the statement having in mind only a republic; but the proposition is not true even then. However, its fallacy is more apparent when we apply it to a government in which the power is in the hands of a few, or of a single man.

It can not be disputed that whatever powers the people, in their aggregate capacity, have of right, may, by them, be delegated to those whom they select as their rulers. It follows that if the people are the executors of all that the Bible contains, a single man might properly exercise that power, for it might be delegated to him by the people. Indeed, it is unquestionably the case that generally in the past a vast majority of the people have chosen to be ruled by a single man. It is evident that when such a choice is made by a majority of the people, the one whom they choose to reign over them has properly all the power that belongs of right to those who gave it to him.

The people can not, in the very nature of the case be, in their aggregate capacity, the final interpreters of the divine law as Mr. Eaton asserts. Only as individuals are the people interpreters of the divine law; and even then the interpretation given by the individual is binding only on himself; he has no right to force it upon anybody else. Were this not true there could be no such thing as individual conscience or individual responsibility to God. The people, or rather a majority of the people, or those able to command the most votes, would decide what was right and what wrong, and all would be bound to abide the decision. And not only so, but if such were the divine plan, a thing would be right or wrong according to the number of votes in its favor!

Some questions do belong absolutely to the people; in many cases their will is, and of right ought to be, final. For instance, it is the right of the people to decide, in their aggregate capacity, what shall be their form of government; what their system of money; their laws of trade; whether they will build macadamized turnpikes or only dirt roads; whether they will grant to private corporations charters to build railways and canals, or whether they will build and own these public highways themselves. But when it comes to the matter of individual moral duty, the whole people have no more right to decide for one than one has to decide for the whole people. In morals the individual is responsible to God and he must be left free to discharge that responsibility according to his own conscience. Any attempt, whether by one or by many, to do otherwise is a usurpation of divine prerogatives.
