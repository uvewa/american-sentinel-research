A recently contributed article in the *Boston Traveller,* referred to in these columns last week, contains the following startling propositions:—

The people are the State. And if the people, they are the State, they become the earthly sovereigns and are responsible for law-making. The people can consider morals and religion as within the jurisdiction of human law and can legislate on them.

The people, the State, are the final interpreters of all law, religious or non-religious, in or out of the Bible.

The assumption that the people are the executors of all that the Bible teaches is a most dangerous one, and fully justifies all the persecution for conscience's sake that the world has ever seen. Mr. Eakes probably made the statement having in mind only a republic; but the proposition is not fair even then. However, its fallacy is more apparent when we apply it to a government where the power is in the hands of a few, or of a single one.

It can not be disputed that governments, equally with individuals, may have rights, or rather, sovereignty, laws of right, may, by them, be disregarded; be them whom they may, despise their rulers. It follows that if the people are the executors of all that the Bible teaches, a single man might rightfully do that same, for in might he be delegated by the people. Indeed, it is unquestionable the case that generally in the past a man's majesty or the people who came forward to be tried by a single man. It was claimed that when such a choice was made by a majority of the people, the choice was they chose to reign over them has properly all the power that is rightfully given to those who gave it to him.

If people can not, in the very nature of the case, transfer to another all of their rights, they can not be interpreters of the divine law or Mr. Eaton assumes. Certainly as individuals we would have no more jurisdiction over the divine law; and even then the divine law requires giving to "his individual his believing on only himself, he has no right to impose it upon others." And if this be true, it cannot then be that the people can, being not true there could be no such thing as individual responsibility to God,—personal responsibility to God. The people, or rather a majority of the people, or those able to command the most votes, would determine what was right and what wrong, and all the people must accept such determination. And not only so, but if such were the truth of the matter, the Bible itself would be wrong according to the number of votes or the ruling of force.

That governments may be strong by the people; the people in many other respects as theirs will, of right ought to, be final. For a nation, it is the right of the people to be citizens, in their aggregate capacity, what shall be the form of government, what taxes shall be laid, how the revenue shall be expended; how the defense of money; their laws of territorial expansion over turnpike turpentine and only dirt roads; whether they will grant to private individuals or charters to build railway and canals, or like; whether they will build and own these public highways. On all such questions when it comes to the matter of individual moral right, both moral and political, there is no right to decide for one than one has to decide for another. This is because in morals the individual is responsible to God and must be left free to discharge that responsibility according to his own conscience. Any attempt, whether by one or by many, to do otherwise is a usurpation of divine prerogatives.
