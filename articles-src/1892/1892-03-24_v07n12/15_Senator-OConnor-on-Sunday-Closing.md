IN the New York Legislature Senator O'Connor, who is a Roman Catholic, and the only one on the Republican side of the Senate, took part in the discussion of the resolution for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and expressed just and unprejudiced views in showing that it was inconsistent to demand that the Fair should be kept closed on Sunday, while no respect was shown to Saturday which was to some the sacred day of the week. He thought the Hebrews of this country were as much entitled to be considered in this question as the Christians. To pass the resolution would be to inject religion into legislation and to this he strongly objected. The day seems to have come when the Protestants are more pronounced Papists than the Roman Catholics themselves.
