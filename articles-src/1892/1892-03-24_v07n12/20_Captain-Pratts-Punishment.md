AGAIN upon the following day the discussion of the statements made by Captain Pratt was resumed. Telegrams were read from Captain Pratt, disclaiming any personal attack upon Congressmen, but reiterating the charges as to political manipulation by the lobby of the Catholic Church. Mr. Belizhoover, of Pennsylvania, said in reference to the reply received by himself to telegraphic questions put to the Captain,—

It expressly disclaims all intention of impeaching the integrity of any member of Congress or attributing to him any improper motives for his conduct. It states as a fact that the Catholics receive a disproportionate share of public school appropriations, and that they maintain a powerful lobby at the national capitol, and manipulate politics to accomplish their purposes. . . . I can see very plainly that as a matter of expediency, and also, perhaps, of propriety, Captain Pratt was unwise and unfortunate in indulging in such public and emphatic expressions of these opinions on a question that must of necessity excite bitter feeling and discussion. This country guarantees freedom of speech, but it is unprofitable for a public servant to indulge in the luxury.

I have known Captain Pratt for many years as an earnest, enthusiastic, and scholarly gentleman, who has given a large portion of his life to the education and civilization of the Indians. He is an ardent, honest, and untiring official, and has been largely instrumental in building up the school at Carlisle.

Mr. Dickerson.—But does not the gentleman think that he ought to be turned out for his aspersions on the church without regard to what he may have said as to any individual?

The appropriation of one thousand dollars for the Superintendent of the Indian school at Carlisle was stricken from the bill; and that is what it cost Captain Pratt to say what might have been verified by every member of the House by referring to the records, and consulting any unprejudiced person conversant with the congressional lobbies. Certainly the exercise of his right of freedom of speech was unprofitable to this public servant. Why?
