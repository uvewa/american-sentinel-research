The German Emperor is excited in using these words in a recent speech:—

These people and me are party squabbling and cladering, I go my way, and that is the right way. We are a man of ourselves and inheritors of great ideas. I combine to build schools to educate times, and those who will lend me their help may as well in all in doing so; but those who oppose me I will crush to me and help me.

"That," comments the Catholic *Reform,* "is the best whom experience education has been is have for men thus a country, when every kind of error menaces men and evil, and you, who are said to have learned, take duty to and accept of themselves in other-have taken ages to learn and reject. . . . It is a system of government in which a new discovery is this in a system of government in which a man of the world others that found in the highest place, to use their authority over the land—this is to tell the German people that they must come to follow and trust and serve the Emperor the more and go into exile."

The trouble is not that the people of Germany are educated, but that they are wrongly educated. They are taught the religion in which they are instructed in Bible and made State taught. The result is a generation of practical Atheists. The American Exponent should make men of its fold to be worthy by throwing upon their own resources, instead of having the State to do the thinking for everything, including religion, this made, and ready put on like a cast or a pair of gloves.
