The German Emperor is credited with using these words in a recent speech:—

The people need not care for party squabbling and chattering; I go my way, and that is the right way. We are in a state of transition and destined for great things. I'll conduct you into splendid times; and those who will not help me may as well shake German dust from their feet. I ask you to confide in me and help me.

"That," comments the Catholic Review, is the land where compulsory education has been in force for more than a century, where every man and woman can read and write, and where very many thousands—more thousands than there are hundreds in other lands—have taken degrees at the universities. And yet the sum and substance of all this is a system of government in which a comparatively young man without much political experience of the world other than that gained in the officers' quarters of a German military post, is able to tell the German people that they must confide in him, and follow him, or else quit their fatherland and go into exile.

The trouble is not that the people of Germany are educated, but that they are educated upon wrong principles. The religion in which they are instructed is State made and State taught. The result is a generation of practical infidels. The German Emperor should make men of his subjects by throwing them upon their own resources, instead of teaching them to look to the State for everything, including their religion, State made, and ready to be put on like a coat or a pair of gloves.
