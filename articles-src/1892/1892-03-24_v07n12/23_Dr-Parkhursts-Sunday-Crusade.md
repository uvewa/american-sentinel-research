THE result of the threat of Dr. Parkhurst, to turn the city upside down and sift out its unworthy municipal authorities, has appeared in the arrest of four or five bartenders for selling liquor on Sunday. The mountain has been in tremendous eruption for several Sundays past, and the usual church mouse has been brought before Justice McMahon to be christened.
