"THE time has come," says the Christian Nation, "when the people of this land can bear to have loyalty to Christ preached to them, even to the point of being urged to protest against, and dissent from, a Constitution that does not own Christ's authority and law. That is a sign that it is now time for us to preach the principle with its practical application."

How the National Reformers, who have always refused to own allegiance to this Government, can make their "protest against, and their dissent from," the Constitution any more practical than it has been in the past is hard to imagine, unless they appeal to the bullets which they long ago threatened; or possibly, they propose voluntary exile. They have in the past suggested that course to all atheists—including Seventh-day Baptists. But it seems improbable that the National Reformers have come to the point of being willing to take their own medicine. They want more room; but their instincts lead them to seek it not by getting out, but by crowding out. Therefore, in all probability, God will suffer National Reformers to dwell in the land until sin and sinners are together blotted out by his almighty power, to make way for the everlasting kingdom of Christ, which the Lord, and not men, will establish.
