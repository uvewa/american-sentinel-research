The venerable Dr. Cuyler has this to say for the Puritans:—

"In these degenerate days, when many a church member commences God's day by wading through twenty pages of politics and sporting news and scandals from the 'Satanic press,' and goes to church to grumble if a sermon is over twenty-five minutes, and if the quartette music is not up to opera pitch, and then comes home to his big dinner and his sofa; in these days of self-indulgence and luxury, we are tempted to cry out, Oh, for a revival of the grand old spirit of the Puritans! With all its rigors, life to them was full of honest enjoyment. Their simple tastes were easily qualified. Their stern virtues were sweetened by domestic love. Their grace grew by hard toil and close companionship with God, and on the rugged, storm-swept hills of New England was produced the most significant manhood our country has ever seen."

Certainly there was much to be admired in Puritan character, and it would be well if there were in the world to-day more of the sturdy Puritan spirit so far as a recognition of personal obligation to God is concerned; but spare us the Puritan disposition to coerce others in matters of religious faith and practice. The more religion a man has for himself the better; but the less he attempts to compel others to have, the greater will the influence of his own be. Let us emulate the virtues but avoid the errors of the Puritans.

Anarchy is opposition to all law; not resistance to an unjust law.
