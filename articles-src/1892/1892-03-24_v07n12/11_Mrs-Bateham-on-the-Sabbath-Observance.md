Mrs. C. P. Bateham, intendent of the Sabbath Observance Department of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union, sends out the following:—

The work of prayer for Sabbath observance continues to extend; and the "greatest struggle" comes about the time the Exposition question is to be decided. The National W. C. T. U. urges that all hands will join with us in putting this in as the most important question of the day before the Christian people.

The circulation of petitions will be a very important part of our work, and all Sabbath friends in the State will see to the circulation of the petitions before and in any connection with the Columbian Exposition. Be sure it as got the indorsement of every public assembly, if possible, to the question whether the Exposition is to be closed will be determined.

As these good women pray and petition,

it may be that God will open the eyes of some of them to see the great error of trying to secure the legal enforcement of Sunday, or any other religious observance.

A. T.
