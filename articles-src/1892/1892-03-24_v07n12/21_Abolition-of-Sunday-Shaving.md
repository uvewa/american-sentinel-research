UNDER the head "Abolition of Sunday Shaving," the Sun, of March 16, has the following editorial item:—

"There is a man in the Legislature of this State named Listman—Adam C. Listman, of Syracuse—a Republican Assemblyman of the Third Assembly district of Onondaga County. This gentleman has introduced a bill which has been sent to us from Albany in its printed form, and we copy it exactly as it is printed:—

"An act making it a misdemeanor for any person to carry on the business of barbering on Sunday in the State of New York,

"The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows:

"SECTION I. Enacted by Senate and Assembly of New York, making it a misdemeanor for any person to carry on the business of harboring in New York State.

"SEC. 2. That any one found guilty of violating this act shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars or imprisonment in the county jail not less than fifteen days or more than thirty days, or both, in discretion of court.

"SEC. 3. This act to take effect on June one, eighteen hundred and ninety-two.

"The title would indicate that Mr. Listman means to have it made a crime for any person to carry on the business of a barber in this State on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday. The critical reader will observe, however, that there is not a word about Sunday in the body of the act itself. The first section, if it provides anything at all, which is extremely doubtful, indicates an attempt to prohibit the "harbering" business in New York altogether, not only on Sunday but on week days as well.

"This may do for the city of Syracuse, but it will hardly answer for New York. We would respectfully suggest an amendment. Let it be made a misdemeanor for such a man as Adam C. Listman to attempt to engage in the business of legislation for the State of New York."
