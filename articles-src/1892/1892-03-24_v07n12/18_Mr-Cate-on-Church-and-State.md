WHILE the appropriation bill for the District of Columbia was being discussed in the House on March 3, and the item of five hundred dollars towards the support of St. Joseph's Asylum was under consideration, Mr. Cate, of Arkansas, expressed these convictions:—

In my political and religious education I have been taught to believe that the Church and the State should be kept entirely apart. I do not know that this particular institution belongs to any church, nor do I care, but I am told that in this bill there are numerous institutions provided for, which are under the care of different religious denominations and are here asking aid of the Government under the guise of charity. Now, Mr. Chairman, my idea is that we ought to have charitable institutions. No gentleman goes beyond me in a disposition to provide for the poor and needy and the suffering, but if the Government must do that work, let it do it through the instrumentality of government officers, and not through the agency of the churches. For that reason, sir, I oppose not only this item, but every provision in this bill which recognizes any church or seeks to aid any institution that is not under the control of the Government. Charity does not and should not percolate through the walls of the public treasury. Then let the churches and the private charitable institutions of the country go on in their noble work, blessing those that give and those that receive, while the Government, aiding none, protecting all, should return to its primitive and proper mission of extending "equal and exact justice to all and special privileges to none."

Such views as these are wholesome, they are satisfactory evidence that the political salt of this country has not yet entirely lost its savor. The continued introduction of religious questions into congressional debates, shows, however, a greater need for its saving qualities than ever before.
