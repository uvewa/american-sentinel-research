The Russian Government seems to be going to do absolute extremism in its warfare on the Protestants of the Baltic countries. In the matter of reducing the theological school at Dorpat to a mere academy, or of transferring it to some smaller town, its ministry seems to have advised only.

"This time has come," says the Christian Nation, "when the heels of the people lead this man to have been kept to everybody preached to them, even to the point of putting it into practice, to a political stand from a Constitution that does not assent God's Christ's authority and law. That it is a sign that it is now time for us in press the principle while in practical application."

How the National Reformers, who have always refused to own allegiance to this standard, and their dissent from the Constitution, are more practical than it has been in the past is hard to imagine, unless they appeal to the ballot with the lofty hope that through the the ballot they long now Athenistick or possibly, they propose voluntary exile. They have in the past supposed that comes to all alliance-in-refusing to obey seventh-day Baptists. But it seems impossible that they all were right, and not only so, but if such were the truth of that matter, the National Reformers have come to the point of being willing to take their own medicine. They want room about, but their instances lead them to seek it not just by getting out, but by crawling out. Theocrats, in a job probably, God will suffer National Reformers to be tried in like mould until the sinful measures are together blotted out by his almighty power, to make way for the everlasting kingdom of Christ, which the Lord, and not men, will establish.

The plea that Sunday laws are not religious, and that they are designated only to preserve the "Civil Sabbath," that is to guarantee to all men the right to rest one day in seven, is disproved not only by the decision of courts, as shown, in these columns last week, but by their practical workings as well.

---

The case of the five men recently indicted in Henry County, Tennessee, whose names we published last week, corroborates the evidence of the Supreme Court of several of the States that Sunday laws are religious and that such is their purpose.

The writer is personally acquainted with all of these men, and knows them to be not only honest, industrious citizens but pious men, members of a Christian Church, whose aims are above reproach where they are known, except as concerns the law of God, which they reverently obey and enforce from the majority of their neighbors.

The men referred to are members by Adventist Church. Three of them hold official positions in the church, two being elder and two deacon; and each of the five is a man whose "word is as good as his bond." The writer has it directly from a member of the Presbyterian Church, a business man who knows all these men, that any of them would be trusted by any merchant who knows them to any amount that they might ask; for they are known to be especially honest.

An extreme circumstance which bearing upon the merits of this case is that these men are all farmers, all living where they could not possibly disturb anybody by their Sunday work, except mentally; and all but one living where only such work would be likely to be observed, unless men should go out of their way to seek to and be annoyed by it.

The indictment against these men is simply for maintaining a nuisance by their Sunday work. The facts stated above show that this could not be true in any proper or reasonable sense of that term. If the work complained of had been done in a village and had been of a noisy character, such as to really disturb people who did not care to be disturbed, there might have been a nuisance; but in this case there is none. The only possible annoyance is a disturbed state of mind such as might be occasioned in a Protestant by seeing his Catholic neighbors going to mass or confession; or by a podocratic by hearing a sound sharp the whistle of a passing train. These indictments are clearly inspired only by religious intolerance. So far as known the men indicted are without personal enemies; they are hated only because of their religion; and their prosecution is simply persecution for conscience' sake.

APROPOS of the article on another page on the change of the Sabbath, is the following letter from Cardinal Gibbons, kindly furnished to us by a friend.

Cardinal's Residence,

JNO. R. ASKEY, ESQ.,—*Dear Sir:* In answer to your first question, directed by the Cardinal to reply to your letter, I beg to say: "Who changed the Sabbath?"

*Answer.*—"The Holy Catholic Church."

No. 2.—"Are Protestants following the Bible or the Holy Catholic Church, in keeping Sunday?"

*Answer.*—"The Protestants are following the custom introduced by the Holy Catholic Church in honoring the Protestants by commanding them to keep the Sunday and at the same time professing to be guided by the Bible only." *Jno. Trad.*

Faithfully yours,

C. F. THOMAS, Chancellor.

This letter from the Cardinal, which, however, contains nothing new, adds an additional plea of "guilty" to the prophetic charge made against that Church.

And to shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.

Prophecy foretold that the Papacy would do these things; history testifies that it has done them; and does that power plainly confess that part of the change that now takes in thinking to change the law of God; in willing and daring to enter this conviction in any candid mind?

The *Voice* complains that copies of that paper, paid for from a fund provided for that purpose, and sent to temperance delegates, and others who were thought to be desirous of receiving it, are not delivered but are held by the postmasters who place the publishers the usual notification cards, "dead, etc. in excess to No." "to let waste of it," "refuses to take in," "refused to take in out of the box," etc., and that occasionally the pages of "dead" mail "is in the Office." Our *Voice* claims to have letters from over one hundred and fifty different towns where postmasters have reported as refusing the paper, saying that they have never ordered. In fact, the *Voice* from twenty-five different towns, then in twenty-five different States, or perhaps one hundred fifty postmasters to return on officials it unlikely it does to some. But a censorship of that insult might not be a dose it tolerates in this country.

The Archbishop of Canterbury has instructed a committee to inquire into the admission of the Church to claims for themselves and their livings clergymen who are convicted of drunkenness, felony, or other immoral offences. What a commentary it such is made on a Church and State institution.

Under the head "Abolition of Sunday Games," the *Dio,* of March 5, has the following news of an action in the Legislature of New York. Mr. Colan, of Syracuse, is a "German Catholic" who is said to be a member of the Justice of the Peace of the district of Onondaga County. This gentleman has introduced a bill in the Legislature "now pending at Albany in its printed form, and we copy it exactly as it follows:—

---

An act making it a misdemeanor for any person to play, for themselves, any game or sport on Sunday in the State of New York, whether it be called on any of the parks, gardens, race tracks, ball fields, or in any public place of any kind."
