APPROPOS of the article on another page on the change of the Sabbath, is the following letter from Cardinal Gibbons, kindly furnished to us by a friend:—

Cardinal's Residence.

Baltimore.

Feb. 25, 1892.

JNO. R. ASHLEY, Esq.—Dear Sir: In answer to your first question, directed by the Cardinal to reply to your letter, I will say—"Who Changed the Sabbath?" Answer—The Holy Catholic Church. 2nd. "Are Protestants following the Bible or the Holy Catholic Church, in keeping Sunday?" Answer—The Protestants are following the custom introduced by the Holy Catholic Church. 3rd. The Protestants do contradict themselves by keeping the Sunday and at the same time professing to be guided by the Bible only. I am,

Faithfully yours,

C. P. THOMAS, Chancellor.

This letter from the Cardinal, which, however, contains nothing new, is simply a plea of "guilty" to the prophetic charge made in Dan. 7:25:—

And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.

Prophecy foretold that the Papacy would do these things; history testifies that it has done them; and now that power pleads guilty to that part of the charge that relates to thinking to change the law of God. What is yet lacking to secure a conviction in any candid mind?
