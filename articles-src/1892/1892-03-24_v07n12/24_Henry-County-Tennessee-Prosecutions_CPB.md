THE plea that Sunday laws are not religious, and that they are designed only to preserve the "Civil Sabbath," that is to guarantee to all men the right to rest one day in seven, is disproved not only by the decision of courts, as shown in these columns last week, but by their practical workings as well.

THE cases of the five men recently indicted in Henry County, Tennessee, whose names we published last week, corroborates the evidence of the Supreme Courts of several of the States that Sunday laws are religious and that such is their purpose.

THE writer is personally acquainted with all of these men and knows them to be not only honest, industrious citizens but pious men, members of a Christian Church; whose lives are above reproach where they are known, except as concerning the law of God, which they understand differently from the majority of their neighbors.

THE men referred to are members of the Springville Seventh-day Adventist Church. Three of them hold official positions in the church, two being elders and one a deacon; and each of the five is a man whose "word is as good as his bond." The writer has it directly from a member of the Presbyterian Church, a business man who knows all these men, that any of them would be trusted by any merchant who knows them to any amount that they might ask; for they are known to be scrupulously honest.

ANOTHER circumstance which has a bearing upon the merits of this case is that these men are all farmers, all living where they could not possibly disturb anybody by their Sunday work, except mentally; and all but one living where such work would not be likely to be observed, unless people went out of their way to note it and be annoyed by it.

THE indictment against these men is for maintaining a nuisance by their Sunday work. The facts stated show that this could not be true in any proper or reasonable sense of that term. If the work complained of had been done in a village and had been of a noisy character, such as to really disturb people who desired quiet, there might be some excuse for calling it a nuisance; but in this case there is none. The only possible annoyance is a disturbed state of mind such as might be occasioned in a Protestant by seeing his Catholic neighbor going to mass or confession; or to a pedo-baptist by hearing a Baptist deny the validity of sprinkling. These indictments are clearly inspired only by religious intolerance. So far as known the men indicted are without personal enemies; they are hated only because of their religion; and their prosecution is simply persecution for conscience' sake.
