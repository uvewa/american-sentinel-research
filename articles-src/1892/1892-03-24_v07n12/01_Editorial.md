The original Sabbath is a memorial of creation. It was instituted for that purpose, and its intelligent observance is a recognition of God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. It does not pertain to any failure on our fellow-men, but to our recognition of God; and a failure to observe it is upon no human being but the one who fails.

Sunday is the memorial of the resurrection of Christ. Its significance is, therefore, wholly religious. Thus, look at it either as the standard of the seventh or of the first day, the recognition of God is its one proper object of worship. To enforce or require such worship; to require or compel its observance under any pretext whatever, is to require the observance by or of a religious day.

The only religion on which restriction on Sunday observance can be defended must be held by that are religiously wrong; a matter of legislation which are not herein materially protected against. It remains to be proved that society or any of its officers holds a commission from Heaven to avenge any supposed affront to the religion whose which is in not also a wrong to our fellow-creatures. The notice that it is one man's duty that another should be religious was the foundation of all the religious persecutions that have ever been perpetrated, and if admitted, would fully justify them. Though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to stop railway travelling on Sunday, and the resistance to the opening of museums on Sunday, is not the cruelty of the old persecutions, the state of mind indicated by it is fundamentally the same insanity. It is a determination not to tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their religion, because it is not permitted by the persecutor's religion.—*John Stuart Mill.*
