DURING the discussion upon the item in the Indian Appropriation bill of an allowance to Captain R. H. Pratt, for services as Superintendent of the Carlisle Indian school, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Mansur, of Missouri, said:—

I think, sir, the Catholic Church can not do anything better, in the way of exercising its great political power in this Nation, than to demand the absolute removal of Captain Pratt. The insult is greater to that church than it is to myself.

This refers to a published interview in the Washington Post, in which Captain Pratt was made to say of the attacks in the House upon the Indian appropriations that,—

They were made through the Catholic Church, in paying congressmen to attack the national schools, because they are detrimental to their parochial schools, which are given three times the amount by the Government that other denominations receive.

Mr. Mansur's estimate of the comparative worth of congressional and Catholic honor is too modest. To say that a congressman has received bribes from the Catholic Church is not a less insult to him than to that church in which Jesuitical methods have always been practiced. But the item of interest in this is the unqualified statement by a representative in Congress that the Catholic Church has "great political power in this Nation," and his advice to that church to use it "to demand the absolute removal" of a Government officer of acknowledged ability from a responsible position. The reading between the lines of this discussion is that ecclesiasticism is already the power behind the congressman's chair in the halls of Government, and that to maintain its place there it does not need to use a money bribe.
