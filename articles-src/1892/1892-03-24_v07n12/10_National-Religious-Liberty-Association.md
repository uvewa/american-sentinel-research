WHAT is the meaning of a bill in the Legislature, at Albany, to make "Good Friday" a legal holiday?

Law and Order Agent McAllon, of Pittsburg, is still busy filing information against news dealers and news agents for the Sunday selling of news papers in Pittsburg. His list for Sunday, March 13, contained twelve names.

The New York State Legislature has passed a concurrent resolution asking the World's Fair Commissioners not to open the Fair on Sundays. The blindfolds of Pharisaism seemed to be the only New York legacy to legislators at this time in the way of any such legislative action.

MARY T. LATHRAP, President, and FANNA A. SHAVER, Secretary, of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union of Michigan, have addressed Mrs. Palmer, Superintendent of the Woman's Department at the World's Fair, "in behalf of justice and right at the World's Fair," to join them in urging that the Exposition should be closed on Sunday. The petition was referred to the Directors of the one-tenth of the Exposition with Mrs. Palmer's "official endorsement," which means, if it shall be translated in the right way at the right place, the official approval of Sunday closing by authority.

In the New York Legislature Senator O'Connor, who is a Roman Catholic, and one of the brightest legislative side of the Senate, took part in the discussion of the matter of Sunday at the World's Fair, and expressed just and properly just and impartial sentiments for an American Senator. He demanded that the Fair should be kept closed on Sunday in the interests of "the workingman," which was to some the sacred day of the working man's day of the week. His expressions are very much entitled to be considered in this question in their proper light, as if intended to advance and inject religion into legislation and to this he strongly objected. The day seems to have come when the Protestants are more pronounced Papists than the Roman Catholic hierarchy.

An incident in Burlington, New Jersey, lately reported in the *Union Signal,* marks the progress of ecclesiastical influence in municipal affairs. The correspondent says:—

The city or county gave permission to hold a fair day concert in his opera house. The minister, by their protests, compelled its cancellation for the third period. The mayor after looking up the law, declared that the concerts would proceed in spite of them. This is a point: we should "make note of," that, religious influence defeated secular municipal law.

The calm way in which it is said in the ministers by "religion" "coerced" the actual mayor shows an assumption of authority over municipal police and municipal affairs as a ministerial prerogative which is quite startling.

In reference to the Pittsburg Law and Order suits one exchange leader at that city says:—

Judge Potts this morning rendered a decision that sustaining the applicability of the Law and Order suits against Sunday newspapers, and thereby held that the sale of Sunday newspapers is not even a "reasonable necessity," as contended by the defense. The judge said that the provisions of the act of 1794 were in effect self-executing; that every person is to have due regard to his lights, such as they are, and we have to consider that the Legislature, by the adoption of 1794 as formally obliterating the reasonable privilege of such transactions to maintain such an institution on the basis of their cause, will appeal to the moral support of the community, and that it will be conclusive. If it should appear from the evidence that the defendants were merely acting so as not to obstruct the needs of later generations of it would be a binding one, and they were not intimates a binding one at that, as it does not appear from the definition.

The courts of Pennsylvania have so far held strictly to the spirit of the colonial church and state laws in these cases. It will be no help to make of procedure, out of respect to principle, should, to be expected, if the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that Sunday laws are national, as it is, that it gives preference by law to a particular form of religious worship.

When the appropriation bill for the District of Columbia was being debated in Congress, on March 2, and the item of five hundred dollars for the Carlisle Indian school at Carlisle, Penn., was under consideration, Mr. Cain, of Arkansas, attempted to have it stricken out, because he had been taught to believe that the Church and the State should be kept entirely separate. It seems that this particular institution belongs to it. I agree with the gentleman but I have found that we are giving appropriation to institutions that are under the care of different religious denominations, but, rather, there is an insult to its claims of brotherhood, for the Government seems to be going to the extreme in this matter, and the idea is that we ought to have charitable institutions, and not through the agency of religious authorities, but through the Government authorities; and not through the agency of religious authorities, in my opinion at least, Government should not through its Government officers, and not through the agency of religious authorities.

The Government should not recognize any church or sects to aid any charitable object whatever of a religious character. The Government takes all the money it expends through the vaults of the public treasury, from the people at large; and as long as the institutions of the country go on in their noble work of civilizing and Christianizing, training all, should return to its primitive and proper place, and from it, if the Government goes its way, etc. And then come the individual.

Such views as these are wholesome, they are just, and being just, we commend them to this country but not yet entirely his at heart. The combination of civil and strictly religious and congressional debates, shows, however, a greater need for its being put into relation, closer with the faith.

During the discussion upon the item in the Indian Appropriation bill of an allowance to Captain R. H. Pratt, for service as Superintendent of the Carlisle Indian school, in the House of Representatives, Mr. Mansur, of Missouri, entered a vigorous protest. He contended that it was in its purpose the appropriation of the Indian school at Carlisle to every member of the House by referring to the interests with the congressional bidden. Certainly with all respect to Captain Pratt it is not susceptible to this public servant. Why?
