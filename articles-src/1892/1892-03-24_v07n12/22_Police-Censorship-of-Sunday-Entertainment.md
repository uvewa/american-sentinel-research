THE reign of the anonymous complaint and the moral censorship of the detective has begun in New York. The following local item from the Sun reads like an adaptation from Colonial days:—

Complaints were sent to Police Headquarters last week by citizens, who didn't append their names to their letters, that Sunday concerns recently given at the city theaters were very little different from those given upon the stage every day, and that the theatrical managers were trying to evade the law prohibiting theatrical performances on Sunday.

Superintendent Murray sent out orders that the law should be enforced, with specific directions that the police should stop any attempt to introduce these specific theatrical and dramatic performances:

"Any interlude, tragedy, comedy, opera, ballet, play, farce, negro minstrelsy, negro or other dancing, equestrian, circus or dramatic performance, jugglers, acrobats, or rope dancing."

Attention was also called to the fact that it was a misdemeanor for any manager to let his theater on Sunday for entertainments having any of these features.

The result of the order from headquarters was that Detectives Kemp, Brett, and McConnell, were made censors last night of the performances at Worth's Museum, the Standard Theater, Koster and Bial's, and the Broadway Theater. Col. Bob Ingersoll's lecture at the Broadway was passed without question. He talked on "Myths and Miracles." At Koster and Bial's and the Standard the actors were introduced to the detectives when about to go on, and police criticism was passed upon them. Yank How's jugglery act was eliminated from the entertainment at the Standard, and the use of all wigs and theatrical wardrobe was prohibited. The actors and actresses who sang or talked or played on the piano had to do it in evening dress or walking dress. Captain Reilly said:

"If theatrical managers do not like this police censorship they must go to the Legislature and have the law amended."

He had refused requests to permit certain acts to be performed. Last week Miss Lydia Yeamans was upset by the refusal of the authorities to permit her to appear in sailor costume at the Broadway Theatre. Detective Mays had said she would be arrested if she wore the sailor suit. She thought it was unfair interference. Superintendent Murray's order was provoked by this, and by the wearing by an actor at the Standard Theater of a red wig which a detective hadn't chanced to detect as a wig and which was worn after the police prohibitory order. Some of the actors submitted with very bad grace to the orders of the police censors.

It is but one step farther to a police censorship of the Sunday wigs and costumes of the general public.
