it may be that God will open the eyes of some of them to see the great error of trying to secure the legal enforcement of Sunday, or any other religious observance.

A. T.

Water is the duty of the State in this matter? Comity, to do whatever conserves the welfare of the majority of the people. The minority have the right to keep away from the Exposition on Sunday, but they have no right to close others out in the way of a majority by blistering it; indicting the statutes of or securing legislative enactments to prevent them from enjoying that day in whatever way they may see fit, provided they do not infringe on the rights of the minority.—*Eldredge Cludy Stern,* in *North American Review.*
