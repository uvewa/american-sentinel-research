In its issue of the 4th, the *Christian Statesman* has an article, written in the usual coryphaeous style of the editor, in which he attributed the claim of seventh-day observers that the Sabbath was "changed" by the Roman Catholic Church, and not by the apostolic Church. The question is by no means vital, nor is it directly pertinent to the discussion of the right of the civil power to require compliance of all secular business on Sunday, or other any day; but inasmuch as the *Statesman's* denial is made in the interest of a State-bolstered religious institution, it may not be amiss to re-examine briefly the question, "How, and by Whom, Was the Sabbath Changed?"

That the Sabbath was ever really changed, in the proper sense of that word, it has seemed only by those who believe that Sunday is now the true Sabbath; for that makes the Sabbath to originally have been upon the seventh day of the week, and by blessing and sanctifying the seventh day, and he alone could really change that. But this change has been attempted, and that so far as the practice of a vast majority of the Christian world is concerned, it has been achieved, is patent to all. That the Bible gives no hint of this change, it has been shown in a previous number of this paper. Therefore, the only remaining question is, "How, and by Whom, was the Sabbath 'Changed'?"

That neither Christ nor his apostles changed the Sabbath is admitted by those who regard the day as sacred. Thus the *Catholic Mirror* and *Work,* of February 11, 1866, says:—

We have but then to seek to ascend the apostolic origin of the present Sunday observance; and for the reason that while the Sabbath and all Sabbath are at straws they are the very word of Scripture, it is in something more or less than the genuine light of the apostolic times for the establishment of the present observance.

Just how Sunday observance was introduced is thus explained by the *Academy,* January 13, 1883:—

The selection of Sunday, thus changing the particular day designated in the fourth commandment, was brought about by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church, and on the basis of, and on same date, from the Christian Sabbath, the first day of the week.

Wunder, "Dr. McCullough and Stronvog considered it to be by far the greatest of occidental historical historians," give emphasis to this statement in his first edition of his *Church History:*—

The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance; nor would the intentions of the apostles be sanction a command in this respect by far from them and from the apostolic Church, to transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday. Perhaps at the end of the second century a false application of this kind had its way taken place; for it now appears from that time to have considered working on Sunday a sin.

That very day was the Sunday of their festive meeting, and has then been taken always and emphatically united with expectancy in making their festive day and their Sabbath. The Christian Church, in fact, was shut up to the adoption of Sunday, and it became established and definite; when it was no late to make another and the Sabbath was a transferred or rehabilitated thing to adopt, it inasmuch as the first day of the week was then high day are its very.

It can not be claimed that this particular paragraph was written by an enemy to the first day, for it is a defense of the Sunday institution; and it is difficult to conceive of a writer known any better argument for the practice of Sunday-keeping than "urgency" of any higher authority for it that the practice and derives of a corrupt age have made such humiliating and damaging admissions. And this lack of scriptural authority for Sunday-keeping, together with the corresponding Roman Catholic marks it as a child of the Papacy; not only so but when it is remembered that, first, it was here seen, it has a human institution long before there was such a thing as the Christian Church itself of any period adopted by the majority of humanity, while yet in its savagery, or minority, and given a place in the Christian Church, which rightfully belonged to another day, namely, the seventh, we do not hesitate thus to say that by "the Father of lies," while yet a child raised his father's character. At the birth of what's fathered he was not the "Father of his country," but his father knew already; still he could cobweb was true of this individual and no changes of name or title could separate the fact from him.

But what specially marks the Sunday Sabbath as the child of the Roman Church, to that it was it that a Roman Catholic Council first put forth decreed that it should be kept instead of the ancient Sabbath. Upon this point Rev. Mr. James T. Armstrong, drumming the University at Oxford, said:—

When the practice of keeping Saturday Sabbaths, which had become so general at the close of this century in the Eastern as well as the Western Church, in the Eastern church, a decree was passed in the Council of Laodicea [about A.D. 364] "that members of the church should not rest from work on the Sabbath day, and performing it honor the Lord's day, then, if it is in their power should rest and pray as Christians."

William Prynne, famous in the history of English Puritanism, also says:—

The seventh-day Sabbath was . . . solemnized by Christ, the apostles, and primitive Christians, for some good space of time as appears in the Scriptures.

The evangelists and St. Luke in the Acts ever styling the Sabbath day and making a notion of its . . . administration by the apostles and other Christians, . . . being still solemnized by many Christians after the apostles' times, till the Council of Laodicea [A.D. 364], as ecclesiastical writers and the twenty-nine canons of that council' testify they . . .

should seek to observe the observance of the first day, with their new, . . . acknowledging as the fact of the resurrection of Christ on that day afforded them as even a just pretext for so doing. And that is just what they did; and it is significant that the practice of keeping Sunday as a Christian festival originated among Gentile Christians—those who had no purpose worshiping the sun upon that day. Recognizing this fact, the *North British Review,* Vol. 18, p. 409, thus declares the change:—

That very day was the Sunday of their festive meeting, and has then been taken always and emphatically united with expectancy in making their festive day and their Sabbath. The Christian Church, in fact, was shut up to the adoption of Sunday, and it became established and definite; when it was no late to make another and the Sabbath was a transferred or rehabilitated thing to adopt, it inasmuch as the first day of the week was then high day are its very.

It can not be claimed that this particular paragraph was written by an enemy to the first day, for it is a defense of the Sunday institution; and it is difficult to conceive of a writer known any better argument for the practice of Sunday-keeping than "urgency" of any higher authority for it.

Representative Sunday keepers would not make such statements if the facts of history did not compel them to do so.

The truth is, the self-respecting one, neither blinded by bigotry, do not care to hazard their reputation on utterances which can be so easily discredited as can the statement that the apostolic Church especially observed the Sabbath, and so shall it, except those polemic divines who care more for their particular creeds than for the truth, refuse to longer peddle the pious frauds by which Sunday sanctity has so long been sustained.

But who did "transfer the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday?" The *Christian at Work* says that it was done "by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church," in "later than apostolic times." But what right had the "early Christian Church" possessed in setting aside the divinely appointed Sabbath and substituting for it in its stead? Evidently none whatever. And if such concurrence could not give validity to such an act, how can it binding upon anybody, how comes it that the same concurrence did not give equal sanctity to other institutions of the "early Christian Church?" The truth is that the Christian Church's word of any period has no such authority; and the assumption, whatever name it may be called, whether the "early Christian Church," or the "Roman Catholic Church," the Sabbath could have been "changed" only by a church that had departed so a little from the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

It may be forcefully instructive to assert, somatic, that "the Roman Catholic the Pope changed it;" but it is also entirely true; "as it is admitted," that the change was made by the Church of God, after all Church history shows, numerous councils, and above all, creeds from into the Church. And it is also true that those corruptions that at once abounded has increased in number and influence until the apostasy matured, as Paul declares it would be developed into the full-grown man of sin.

As well might we deny the identity of the boy and that man, or of the thirteen Colonial States and the thirteen original States of the Union, or deny that the apostasy of which the Roman Catholic Church is the embodiment is simply the perfect development of that to which the apostle alluded in his second letter to the Thessalonians.

Like the apostasy which finally developed into the full-grown "man of sin," the change of the Sabbath, was a growth. It is impossible for either friend or foe of Sunday keeping to say definitely just when it was introduced. As well might we attempt to locate definitely the origin of each evil custom, given by the date, etc., as to say just when Sunday began to be regarded as sacred; but like the other innovations from paganism now found in the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church, it should be enough for Protestants to know that it is without a shadow of divine authority; and that the very best that can be said truthfully for it, is that the observance of Sunday was "brought about by the gradual concurrence of the early Christian Church," in "later than apostolic times."

In his "History of Romanism," book 8, chap. 1, sec. 4, Dowling has well said:—

In no instance has any point of Catholic theology been more clearly or more logically treated than by Rev. Andrew Taylor, in his *American Ceretice's Manual.* He takes up the celebrated question of Sunday's making an accrediting case," and to this defined its Catholic view, "Where in the Bible is it said we are to keep Sunday? That question the Catholic Church has distinctly, to make all of the head of the Papal Inquisition, who has made a book, and it still of the Papal innovations of Christianity. Still, says 'It is not [in the Bible] but we should from the Bible know about instructions, the observance of the institution adopted which is entirely unknown, if they had not the very early tradition which is derived from the apostolic succession, etc.' If this doctrine of any one not found in God's word—that is to say, in the Bible alone—then the Adventists are right; and the Sabbatarians in general are right, in refusing to keep the Sunday. . . . But the Adventists are in their particular position, right also in now requiring their ungathered rejection, just as they have laid down by the plumb line of the Bible; and that the Baptists are wrong as well as the true Protestants. . . .

Of the evidence of the observance of Sabbath, John Ley, another old English writer, speaks thus:—

From the apostles' time to the Council of Laodicea, which was about the year 364, the holy observance of the Jews' Sabbath continued, as may be proved out of many authors; yea, notwithstanding the clause of the same council.

About the year 458 or 470 A.D., Pope Leo stated the following:—

We can, assure according to the true meaning of the Holy Ghost and the apostles, we do most solemnly testify, that on the sacred day [Sunday] wherein we ourselves were regenerated in Christ . . . we are to come from labor.

It was thus that the voluntary custom of a portion of the Church was made universal and enforced upon the whole Church; and this it was that what Neander calls a "transfer of the laws of the Sabbath to Sunday" "was made," and a "divine command" for its observance substituted. So far, then, in giving the authority of the Church, and by it in distinguishing it, the Papacy has done just this with the "early Christian Church," with the Papacy, that the Papacy Catholic Church, while yet in its savagery, or minority, did change the Sabbath; and to assert this is no greater inaccuracy of language, even, than to say that by "the Father of his country," while yet a child raised his father's character. At the birth of what's fathered he was not the "Father of his country," but his father knew already; still he cobweb was true of this individual and no changes of name or title could separate the fact from him.
