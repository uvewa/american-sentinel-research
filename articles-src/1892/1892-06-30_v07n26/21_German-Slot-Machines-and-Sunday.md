It seems in Germany the penny-in-the-slot machine is prohibited from working on Sunday. A late news item from Berlin says: "The ministers of Commerce, Education, and the Interior have issued a circular to the Prussian prefects, instructing them in regard to the operation of the new law regulating Sunday labor, the rules of exemption, etc. One curious paragraph orders the suspension of the sale of sweets, matches, etc., by automatic machines during the prohibited hours."
