A DESPATCH from Hingham, Mass., of June 14, says: "Maurice McGrath, Martin McCormick, Amos Stevens, Louis Eldridge, I. A. Reed, John McCormick, and Henry W. Littleton were before Judge Kelly, in the Second District Court this morning, charged with performing unnecessary labor on the Lord's day. All pleaded guilty to the charge, except Mr. McGrath, and were fined five dollars each. Mr. McGrath conducted his case and was discharged.

"These are the first of the batch of Sunday breakers to be brought before the court, but it is claimed that before the summer is over there will be several, if not hundreds of Sabbath-breakers brought before the court, for it is said that all found working on the Lord's day, such as steamboat men, railroad men, carriage and barge drivers, ice men, watering-cart drivers, horse-car drivers, bartenders, cooks

in fact every one who makes Sunday a business day will have to settle before the court, as it is intended to make a crusade against them."
