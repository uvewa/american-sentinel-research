THE nature of the "disturbance" and "annoyance" caused by the Sunday work of the Adventists in Tennessee, is plainly shown by some of the evidence in the trial of the late R. M. King, in Obion County, that State, in March 1890. Colonel Richardson, counsel for the defendant, asked Mr. Cole, one of the witnesses for the State, questions as follows, and received the subjoined answers:—

Col. R.—Did you see the defendant, Mr. King, working on Sunday?

Mr. Cole.—Yes, sir, I saw him plowing in his field on Sunday, the twenty-third day of June last.

Col. R.—Did it disturb you in any way?

Mr. Cole.—Yes, sir, of course it did; it was very annoying to my feelings.

Col. R.—On what grounds?

Mr. Cole.—On the ground that it was a violation of laws, both sacred and civil.

Col. R.—Then it was an excitement of your religious feelings, and repulsive to your views of Christianity?

Mr. Cole.—Yes, sir.

Col. R.—How long have you known Mr. King?

Mr. Cole.—For about twenty or twenty five years.

Col. R.—What was the general character of the defendant as a peaceable, quiet, law-abiding citizen, up to the time of this indictment?

Mr. Cole.—It was good.

This makes the matter clear: in Tennessee a man of good character as a peaceable, quiet, law-abiding citizen becomes a nuisance if he observes the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and then goes quietly about his work on Sunday.
