IN a recent speech in Congress on closing the World's Fair on Sunday, Mr. Morse is reported to have said:—

Some time since the president of one of our Young Men's Christian Associations addressed an inquiry to the superintendents of a large number of railroads as to the experience of their roads with Sunday trains, asking if they paid, and what was the effect upon the employees. The almost universal answer was that they did not pay, and the effect upon the employees was demoralizing.

It has always been understood that railroad corporations were organized for the purpose of making money. If there has yet been a single instance in which one of these corporations has continued in any given line after it had proved to be unprofitable, there is no record of it at hand. If Mr. Morse is sure that Sunday trains do not pay, all he will have to do will be to convince the managers that such is the case, and they will be abandoned at once. He would then be saved the trouble of making long speeches on the question before Congress.
