THE view set forth by the Advent Review that the fourth commandment establishes a difference between the Sabbath and the six other days of the week and requires men to respect that difference, is certainly both reasonable and consistent. The seventh day of cessation from labor is God's memorial of his cessation from the work of creation, given to man in order that he might the better remember his Creator. Physical rest for man was evidently not the primary object of the Sabbath; for it "was made for man," as our Lord himself declares, before the fall, and consequently before man stood in need of rest from wearing toil. Clearly its object was to keep in lively exercise man's loyalty to God as the Creator, just as our peculiarly national holidays—the Fourth of July and Washington's Birthday—are designed to fan the flame of patriotism in the American breast. Viewed from this standpoint, it is plain that the fourth commandment not only enjoins the keeping of the true Sabbath, but it likewise forbids rivals and counterfeits.
