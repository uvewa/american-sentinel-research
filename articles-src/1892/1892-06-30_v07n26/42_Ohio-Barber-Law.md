A NEWLY enacted statute of Ohio makes it unlawful for any person "engaged in barbering" to prosecute that business Sunday. Nearly all the barbers accept the arrangement gracefully, and announce that they will close their shops on Sunday, but some of them, observing that a similar law with respect to saloon keepers has been violated for years by the use of side doors, and that when any have been brought to trial, the juries obtainable in the police court have invariably acquitted or disagreed, have determined to admit customers by side doors and take the risk of punishment. They say that they must serve their customers, to many of whom a Sunday shave is as much of a necessity as a breakfast.

Such laws are unconstitutional, interfering with the rights and liberty of people.
