# A "Warning" for the Fair.

CONGRESSMEN upon the World's Fair question, to some of them particularly, proposing the Democratic Convention, which as yet we have not proposed and not taken to press.

Last Sunday in Chicago, where according to every daily paper there were more people abroad than on any other previous occasion, and the city's reputation as a clean Sunday city was more than sustained. The churches were fairly well attended, and the attendance was largely composed of delegates and their friends, the parks were open, and the street cars running. During the churches the saloon keepers closed up for the forenoon, but after noon they were doing a thriving business. Now a man who makes Sunday a business day in a great city with an unusual crowd of strangers visiting the city, will be very likely to show to this country every Sunday during the Exposition. If the Republican Convention was in session.

The experience of last Sunday proves what any reasonable person should know. That to close the Fair on Sunday would drive the people from the churches to the saloons and to worse places. Better far the galleries of art, the grandeur of architecture, and the eloquence of the World's words. From a civil standpoint the very best thing to keep the Fair open on Sunday is in the interests of civil order. The religious part of the question would be settled by each individual remaining away from the Fair at such times as compatible might dictate. Of course no open Fair can not be reconciled with proper Sabbath observance, but Sabbath observance is an individual matter. The Columbian Exposition means a great deal more than it has ever regular attendance at the various churches. The people who have not conscientiously attend the Fair on Sunday will of course not do so; but then to those who cannot go on the seventh day, of his management want to keep the Fair open and can find men willing to do their work, why should it not be held open?

## A Lesson Likewise.

IN 1876 the grounds for a fair was legislated by the General Court of Pennsylvania and the Centennial Exhibition was instructed "whom action being had to themselves most civil", "Centennial," and say to State that notwithstanding repeated efforts to force the matter "thereby," "they have not been deterred from their impulse attempt to undermine one form of worship."

In like manner, the indictments against the Adventists for quietly pursuing their Sunday work on their farms "is to the evil example of society, other persons, the people, to the evil example of society, established in public morality and actually to intimations of the citizens of the county and against the peace and dignity of the State." The admission of the unknowness was a witness in the King case in 1891, testifying "that it had been that it was a violation of the law; and one in 1892, there it actually was an excitement of your religious feeling, and republic to your state of Christianity?" inquired the Attorney. Despite the fact of a most remarkable likeness between the persecutions of Quakers in Massachusetts in 1658 and that it actually was there and the real distinction is very close. Two hundred and thirty, years have elapsed and the spirit is here. It is human nature. This is written by a judge, "by a act of fictitious advantage," "and the observance of Sunday have saved the aid of the civil law, and adhere to their advantage, the civil law, and adhere to that advantage for the civil law, and yet deny of this distance for religious freedom.

## The Funnel of Christianity Taught.

THE *Advance* and *Christian Statesman*, by a careful study of the Christian Statesman, has decided the following: Christian temperance Union papers has convinced us that the promoters of the country have got it into their heads that Sunday was made for the clergy.--*Christian Citizen.*
