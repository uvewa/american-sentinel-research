MONTCLAIR, N. J., is a good example of the character of the feeling which inspires the advocates of Sunday laws and their strict enforcement. An enterprise to connect East Orange and Montclair by a street railroad is actively opposed by many residents of Montclair, who are wealthy, able to ride in their own carriages, and have no need of street cars. A published report of the matter says: "There are no Sunday trains to or from Montclair, and the place is isolated from the world on that day of the week. The more wealthy residents say they don't want the town to swarm on the American Sabbath with picnics and sick babies from Orange, while the street railway advocates say they ought to have means of riding for five cents, since they are not rich enough to own carriages."

These citizens of Montclair are determined that the fresh air of the "American Sabbath" shall not be desecrated by sick babies in their town. This is the Christian (?) spirit which inspires Sunday-law advocates the world over.
