COMMENTING upon the wild debauchery which marked Chicago on the Sunday preceding the Democratic Convention, when the city was full of politicians who had not taken the temperance pledge, the World says:—

Last Sunday in Chicago was, according to all accounts, not an ideal Sabbatarian Sunday. Sunday in Chicago does not ordinarily meet the Sabbatarian ideal. The theatres are open and performances are given as on week days; concert gardens flourish, the saloon business is lucrative, and no one who yearns for a "little game" need be disappointed on account of the day.

This is the ordinary Sunday of Chicago when the city has only its regular population and its normal accession of visitors. With the unusual number of strangers brought there by the convention, and in the absence of sufficient opportunities of innocent and reputable amusements, the day was, according to reports, largely occupied by a vast and unsavory orgy.

We call attention to this unpleasant subject be-

cause the well-known scenes of dissipation on Sunday in a great city with an unusual crowd of strangers in it are what Chicago may be expected to show to this country every Sunday during the Exposition, if the Exposition is closed to visitors on that day.

The experience of last Sunday proves what we have repeatedly asserted, that to close the Exposition on Sunday would be to drive the visitors to pleasure resorts, to the saloons and to worse places.

There is undoubtedly much truth in the World's words. From a civil standpoint the very best thing would be to keep the Fair open on Sunday in the interests of civil order. The religious part of the question would be settled by each individual remaining away from the Fair at such times as conscience might dictate. Of course an open Fair can not be reconciled with proper Sabbath observance, but Sabbath observance is an individual matter. The State has nothing to do with it any more than it has with regular attendance upon religious services. Those who can not conscientiously attend the Fair on Sunday will of course not do so, likewise those who cannot go on the seventh day. But if the managers want to keep the Fair open and can find men willing to do the necessary Sunday work it is their concern.
