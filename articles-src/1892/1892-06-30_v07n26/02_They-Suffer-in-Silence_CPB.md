# They Suffer in Silence.

SPRINGVILLE, TENN., of unenviable notoriety because of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists with which the name is associated, is a flag station on the Memphis branch of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, about one hundred and twenty-five miles west of Nashville. The total population of the village is seventy to one souls. A mile and a half east of the village is the Seventh-day Adventist Church building, and in the immediate neighborhood of the church reside the forty or more Adventists and their families that compose the membership of the church and Sabbath-school. The railroad and a single county road run through the neighborhood, but a number of private or neighborhood roads make the several small farms in the vicinity easily accessible.

"The Adventist settlement," as some found anywhere in the thickly populated portions of the United States. The Adventists are industrious, quiet, frugal, and enterprising. Not a few of the older residents of the county acknowledge that these same qualities and industries really are alike unknown among them. But for the trains on the railroad, the loudest noise ever heard in the community would be the sound of the ax or hammer. On two days of the week, Sabbath and Sunday, even these sounds are seldom made by Adventists. On Sunday they keep busy in useful work on Sunday, hoeing gardens, cultivating crops or picking fruits, they could, and all noise of course giving great annoyance to all neighboring neighbors and the ceremonial Sunday observance of some of them.

The Adventists hold regular Sabbath services in their little church, consisting of a Sabbath-school followed by preaching, when a minister is present; otherwise one of the elders gives a short exhortation which is followed by social meeting. On Wednesday evening there is a prayer and social meeting; which all participate. There is also a weekly meeting. Special meetings are held when a minister is in the neighborhood and generally on Sunday. None of these services differ materially from similar meetings held by other denominations except that a deeper feeling of earnestness may characterize them.

The county being but poorly provided with public schools, a subscription school was started some months ago and is still in successful operation, thought likely to be most beneficial and the best interests of the community are among its principal supporters. This school is both a public and a church institution and a part of the plan was to remodel the church building so that the old building might be better fitted for school purposes. What effect this prosecution of the Adventists may have remains to be seen. As the money consumed in some of the preliminary work done, it is possible that the school, the community, will be benefited in the near future, notwithstanding the prosecution of Adventists therefor and the imprisonment of the leading members of the church under our Sunday laws.

The home life of these Adventists is in keeping with their public professions. It supplies them and strengthens natural affection and as a consequence both parents and children are happy in the enjoyment of those ennobling pleasures which God has strewn along through life, and in which he is himself and to each other. There is not a divorce problem here.

But a cloud has settled over this otherwise happy neighborhood. From four of the points of the compass only four houses home, the light of the husbands and father's presence has gone out. The eye of the lonely wife are red with weeping and the plaintive plea of the children, "I want to see my papa," shows that these young hearts have not learned sorrow also. These people have wronged no man and because they love God, and do not persecute their God, yet they suffer under the color and in the name of the law, no informations, no ruling, either against the law or the officers enforcing it, to suffer in silence and mock enthusiasm, quietly biding God's time, confident that their faith and practice will be vindicated, if not before, at the final judgment of the great day. And this is "Christian America." Is the nineteenth century of the Christian era.
