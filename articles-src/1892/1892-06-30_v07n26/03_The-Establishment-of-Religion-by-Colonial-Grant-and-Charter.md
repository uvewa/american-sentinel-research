# The Establishment of Religion by Colonial Grant and Charter.

In the year 1607 the good people of Plymouth Colony began to put in legislative use the legislative strictures which they had built, and which Justice Brewer considers to be one of the foundations of the argument upon which a "Christian nation" decision rests. But the Puritans were not Christians in the broadest sense, and therefore had no part or place in their religious community for people who held other religious ideas than those which belong to an established church, having themselves left behind and seceded from an established church, to found an establishment of religion of their own, where they could have complete freedom of conscience to worship as they pleased, and turn their tables upon those who disagreed with them and give them, too, a full taste of what it felt like instead of being the persecuted, to be the persecutors. And so strongly were they carried away with which they came, it was the logical result of the laws which they had in force on March, 1636, they speak more eloquently, and as loudly, the higher the position. That court decrees!

WHEREAS there hath several persons come into this jurisdiction, . . . and have since some practices manifestly tend to the subversion of the fundamentals of Christian religion, church order and the civil peace of this Government . . . the Court allowed by the Court and the authority thereof that no Quakers or such as are commonly held in that account shall be allowed . . . to come into this Government under the penalties of five pounds to be paid by the master of every vessel that shall bring any such known Quaker . . . or such persons into his oath that he have no such persons on board; or if known otherwise, to be paid, provided he upon his first deserting them in the colony . . . the authorities thereof that if any visitor or Quaker . . . any person hereafter coming in, or who shall hereafter be known or suspected to be such, . . . on passed of presentment, and no odds to contribute . . . If any or any other intelligences her shall have of such person . . . the cognizance who shall retain them or their . . . that they shall be fined 40 shillings an hour for . . . until her or they shall defray the charge both of their accommodation and their trial; and this Government . . . whether strangers or citizens general, in this Government under the penalty of forty and four shillings a time for the count of the land, as are called then such person see coming to them this course for every afternoon.

The clause in parenthisis was incorporated in the original draft of the decree, but set at statute in the early laws of the colony. It is interesting now to note however that it was afterward abrogated. But it is a part of the great colonial legislative whole, together with the rest of the decree, of the history which actuated those, who, according to the opinion of Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court, were an active factor in the establishment of the religion of this Nation by virtue of which this a Christian Nation.

It begins to look as if some one needed to revise their ideas of Christianity. Of course it cannot be Justice Brewer, for he is one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is pretty hard to make a hasty decision, and those of us who have given any attention to this subject are able to hold our views and that it can express its discovery and in what it was founded these old statutes and charters shall teach us.
