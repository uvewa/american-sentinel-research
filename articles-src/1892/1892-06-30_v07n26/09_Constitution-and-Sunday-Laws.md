THE Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitutions of the several States are the supreme law of the land. All Sunday laws, as such, are made in contravention of these Constitutions and are therefore, notwithstanding the decisions of various and sundry courts to the contrary, absolutely null and void in law, and can be shown to be so; although they have been acted upon and men have been most unjustly punished under them.

It is time that sensible men look into this thing, for whatever touches the rights of one citizen touches the rights of all.

What has been the origin and motive of Sunday laws? From their beginning in the early part of the fourth century, they have been enacted in the interest of the religion of the majority in power at the time, and more in the interest of the power than the religion. But Constitutions are intended expressly to protect all, even a minority of one, in those rights of a free man which are declared by them to be inalienable. And the several Constitutions of the States say that every man shall be protected in the "exercise of his religious belief" (premising that such exercise shall interfere with no one else to their injury) and that "no preference shall be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship." Yet these Constitutions are violated daily and by men who call themselves lawgivers and lawmakers.

The apathy and blindness of the average American citizen to the danger so fast crowding upon us of a union between Church and State in this country, is something appalling to a looker-on. They think because we have railroads and telegraphs and all the science of the nineteenth century that we can not go back to the Inquisition or to the persecutions of two centuries ago or more. They have forecasts of the weather and yet can not read the signs that foretell the corruption of religion and the destruction of law in the abrogation of our Constitutions and the assumption of authority by fanaticism and bigotry. Why men have already been persecuted under these Sunday laws—innocent, true-hearted men, humble, pious men, simple, and plain men who believed in the Bible, word for word, who believed that "the seventh day is the Sabbath" of the Lord their God—"in it thou shalt do no work;" and also believed it to be equally a command of God, "six days shall thou labor"—men who harmed no one, whose lives were singularly peaceful and pure—such men have been hounded to death in various of our States by religious persecution. And five citizens of Tennessee, Seventh-day Adventists who believe honestly that it is their duty to work six days of the week and rest on the seventh, are now under indictment for the great crime of plowing their own fields on Sunday. Even Constantine in his Sunday laws excepted agriculturalists. It remains for the nineteenth century civ-

ilization to go even farther than the fourth in this barbarism.

Sunday laws are being everywhere proposed; and very recently Judge Hammond, of the Federal Court, declared, in a decision confirming the decision of the Tennessee Court in the case of R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, who was fined and imprisoned for pursuing his "ordinary avocations" on Sunday, that "if one ostentatiously labors for the purpose of emphasizing his distaste for and his disbelief in the custom, he may be made to suffer for his defiance by persecutions, if you call them so, on the part of the great majority, who will compel him to rest when they rest." Poor Mr. King was simply plowing in his own field, in the performance of what he sincerely believed to be his duty, and was injuring no one. He had, according to his belief, the command of God to justify him, the example of the Saviour to uphold him, and, he might well have thought, the Constitution of his State to protect him; and yet this Judge, this creature, sweeps away in this decision all the protection accorded by the Constitution to a free exercise of religious belief, sets at naught the example of Jesus Christ who also kept the seventh day as his Sabbath, and holds as an act of criminality, and fit for persecutions, that obedience to his God which was to Mr. King his highest duty. Broken in means and in health by fine and imprisonment, he has been called to his final rest by a higher power than his iniquitous judges, who will surely be called to account if there be any retribution in the future—judges who regarded the conscience of the majority as the only conscience to be considered. God save the mark! what is the conscience of the majority?

In the Congress of the United States, laws are being proposed by members from various States all looking to controlling the Christian Sabbath, Sunday, by law. Christians fondly imagine that by these laws they are, as the old preacher said, "fighting the devil." On the contrary they are preparing the way for a legion of devils to spring upon them as soon as any one of their various sects shall predominate over the rest and become most powerful among them.

When the Sunday rest bill, offered by Hon. W. C. P. Breckinridge, was defeated some two years since, one of its advocates stated that it would be brought up again at the next session; "not," he said, "that we care so much for this bill, for there is but little in it, but we want it as a precedent; once admit the principle and Congress can not refuse to make other laws in accordance."

## A PRECEDENT! TO WHAT?

The Constitutions are the only protection to the minority. Jesus Christ suffered martyrdom at the hands of a majority for expressing his religious belief. He believed he was the son of God, and said so. The Jews did not agree with him in his belief; and, religion being a "part of the law of the land," and subject to the law, and the Jews being the majority who made the laws, they crucified him. Under our Constitution he would have had, though a minority of only one, the perfect right to say he was the son of God and to convert as many as he could to his own faith so long as he injured no one in any way, and would have been protected in this right unless he should have fallen into the hands of those who would violate the Constitution by making religious belief subject to law, and law subject to whatever religious party might happen to be in power at the time.

For your freedom's sake, Americans, cling to your Constitutions! They are wise, let them be dearer to you than life itself. Cling to them, for once you throw them aside, you indeed "have your breast to the shaft and your brow to the storm" of whatever odious restrictions a triumphant and tyrannical majority may choose to impose upon you.

But some will say "Sunday laws are not unconstitutional." How can this be so when Congress is expressly forbidden to make any law respecting the establishment of religion, and the States are expressly forbidden to make any law that shall give preference to any religious society or mode of worship. Is not the observance of Sunday, by Christians, as their Sabbath, a part of their mode of worship and are not the Christians a religious society? though subdivided into many sects? and does not the enforcement by law of even one religious observance give preference by law to the mode of worship of which that observance is part? and is not such a law, so far as it goes, a law made to establish that religion to which such observance may belong? How then can it be anything but unconstitutional? how can either Congress or any Legislature make any such law without a direct and positive violation of Constitutions both State and Federal?

But some will say the Sunday laws are not religious in any sense of the word, but only for the benefit of the working classes to insure them rest, whilst others advocate them as a "police regulation."

Now, if the law can decide that a man must rest one day, can it not decide that he must rest two days, or any number of days? Or, that he shall rest only one day in ten, as was decreed in France after the revolution there? But, to be equal, the rest law ought to apply to all men equally and to all sorts of labor. If only works of charity and necessity are to be allowed, and men are forbidden by law to receive pay for Sunday work, then the minister of the gospel could not receive pay for his Sunday preaching—the chambers and the organ-player, the sexton and the boy who blows the bellows would all be debarred from emolument for their Sunday work—and all must do it as a matter of charity. It would be interesting to know how many would continue to preach under this state of the case.

As a police regulation. Under Constitutions that declare "no preference shall be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship," how can an act, solely in deference to the Christian religion, be made a crime that is not a crime per se? an act be made a crime that injures no one? an act that is a virtue on Monday, be made a crime on Sunday? and yet the law, so creating a crime for the sole purpose of punishing it in deference to a certain mode of worship, not be unconstitutional? and in defiance of the Constitutions of the States and of the United States? No such laws can stand the test of constitutional integrity.

It may be said it is in the interest of public order to close saloons on Sundays on the ground that idleness begets mischief, and all the working classes being at leisure Sunday, there may be more danger to the peace than on week days. But if so, the law should be applied not to Sunday alone, or to it as the Sabbath, but every legal Loliday as well, since the working classes are equally as idle on those days as on Sundays.

No, gentlemen, make no Sunday laws, repeal all that are now on the statute books. Repeal all school laws relating to religion. Let religion be taught in the homes and the churches where it belongs, and infidelity and atheism can never "hold the reins" as is feared by some, so long as religion is left free. Let all religion be free as the air of heaven. Have no compulsion about it, and like the air its various currents are life-giving and purifying. But once confine it, deprive it of its native freedom, and like the air so confined, it becomes a very engine of destruction and of death itself.—"Kain-tuckee," in Henderson (Ky.) Reporter.
