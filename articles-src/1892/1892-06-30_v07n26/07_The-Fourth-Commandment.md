# The Fourth Commandment.

EVERY man has a right to work six days in every week, in every week of every year, and to rest on the seventh. This the commandment says. Every man has a right to obey God, to keep the commandments of God, and do all thy work. This was the right exercised by Mr. King. But this was the right which they under upon mankind is God-given right; neither government nor court can annul it. It is a right of which the Constitution becomes an absolute utility.

The right of rest upon whatever day imparts something more than a mere personal right or a community's right in it. It imparts something in the nature of an obligation.

The propriety of the doing so can be disputed by no one. But the obligation to do it, and to demand by law a rest day, one is not devised to man and his fellow-men in the interest of the community. Every man should, the rest on the seventh day which he has blessed and sanctified. This day was set apart before any other day. This is after all other days, and of course the man employed in behalf of other people, or commerce of the country or the State, should regularly refrain from work upon the first day, the third day, the fifth day, and some other day--in the manner proportioned to six days of rest and one of labor; but not upon the seventh day, to show on which day it was that God rested --working to signify that God crowned the heavens and earth by a rest, in the interval rested upon the seventh, "and God rested the seventh day from all his works." This is the rest upon the seventh day. It is not upon the first; it is upon the seventh day. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the day of the rest should not be dissimilar in character from that which God Himself gave to it.

But the impropriety of enforcing rest upon the first day is not that of a morality it does not stop there; for the first day is a man-made institution. No Sunday is God's own holy day; the rights claimed and the acknowledgment of the claimed of this false rest day is a denial of the claims of God's own day. In what other way could one more effectually deny the Sabbath, or deny what he knows to be true, or deny what he knows the claim to be false, or deny what he himself said was to the Creator? In what other way could the Creator himself regard it?

The person who refrains from work upon the first day of the week, thereby acknowledges either the claim of the day,
