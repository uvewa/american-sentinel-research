AND not only do the Seventh-day Adventists regard it as their right to work on Sunday, but they look upon it as a sacred duty to devote Sunday to secular pursuits. Their reasons for taking this view of the question are ably and clearly set forth in an editorial article in the organ of the denomination, the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, of June 14. The article is published, in condensed form, on another page of this paper. We commend it to the careful perusal of every reader of THE SENTINEL.
