SPRINGVILLE, Tenn., of unenviable notoriety because of the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists with which the name is associated, is a flag station on the Memphis branch of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, about one hundred and twenty-five miles west of Nashville. The total population of the village is seventy-five souls. A mile and a half east of the village is the Seventh-day Adventist Church building, and in the immediate neighborhood of the church reside the forty or more Adventists and their families that compose the membership of the church and Sabbath-school. The railroad and a single county road run through the neighborhood, but a number of private or neighborhood roads make the several small farms in the vicinity easily accessible.

"The Adventist settlement," as some term it, is one of the most tranquil to be

found anywhere in the thickly populated portions of the United States. The Adventists are a quiet folk. Neighborhood quarrels and boisterous revelry are alike unknown among them. But for the trains on the railroad, the loudest noises ever heard in the community would be the sound of the ax or hammer. On two days of the week, Sabbath and Sunday, even these sounds are seldom made by Adventists, for while they may be seen quietly at work on Sunday, hoeing gardens, cultivating crops or picking fruit, they avoid all noisy work in deference to their Sunday-keeping neighbors and the occasional Sunday churchgoer.

The Adventists hold regular Sabbath services in their little church, consisting of a Sabbath-school followed by preaching, when a minister is present; otherwise one of the elders gives a short exhortation which is followed by social meeting in which all participate. There is also a regular Wednesday evening prayer and social meeting, which is well attended; and Friday evening a Sabbath-school teachers' meeting. Special meetings are held when a minister is in the neighborhood, and generally on Sunday. None of these services differ materially from similar meetings held by other denominations, except that a deeper feeling of earnestness seems to pervade them.

The county being but poorly provided with public schools, a subscription school was started some months ago and is still in successful operation, though likely to be crippled by the persecution of those who are among its principal supporters. This school was designed to be a permanent institution and a part of the plan was to build a new church, in order that the present building might be better fitted for school purposes. What effect the persecution will have on this enterprise, remains to be seen. As the money necessary, has already been subscribed and some of the preliminary work done, it is probable that the new house of worship will be erected in the near future, notwithstanding the hostile attitude of the authorities and the imprisonment of the leading members of the church under an iniquitous Sunday law.

The home life of these Adventists is in keeping with their public profession. In their domestic relations, Christian love supplements and strengthens natural affection; and as a consequence both parents and children are happy in the enjoyment of those ennobling pleasures which God has given his creatures to bind them closer to himself and to each other. Theirs is not a gloomy religion.

But a cloud has settled over this otherwise happy neighborhood. From four of these homes, the light of the husband's and father's presence has gone out. The eyes of the lonely wife are red with weeping, and the plaintive plea of the children, "I want to see my papa," shows that their young hearts have learned sorrow also. These people have wronged no man and have lived in all good conscience toward God, yet they suffer under the color and forms of civil law. But there is no repining, no bitterness, no railing, either against the law or the officers who enforce it; they suffer in silence and meek submission, quietly biding God's time, confident that their faith and practice will be vindicated, if not before, at the final Judgment of the great day. And this is in "Christian America," in the nineteenth century of the Christian era!
