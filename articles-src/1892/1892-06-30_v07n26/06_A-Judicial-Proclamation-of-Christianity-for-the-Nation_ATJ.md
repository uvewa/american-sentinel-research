# A Judicial Proclamation of Christianity for the Nation.

[Further extract from an address by A. T. Jones.]

JUSTICE BREWER'S decision establishes and justifies the requirement, from all officials, of a belief in the doctrines of the Christian religion. And to prove this, I will only, by a quotation from the Constitution of the United States:--

I. A. B., do profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His eternal Son, the true God, and in the Holy Spirit, one God, blessed forevermore; and I do acknowledge the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be given by divine inspiration.

And the doctrine that he hold all through the ancient articles of the Christian religion speak the same language and are emphasized in the following words:--

From the Constitution of the United States which is supposed to have been built upon the principle of absolute religious freedom, as attested by the judicial expositors of the fundamental law of all the States, or follows: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The ideas that the Executive shall have no days (then or similar, such as are prescribed by special religious instruction) and that the question of Sunday observance as constitutional, necessarily implies that there shall not be made a universal language pervading them all, having in its very terms, as they had, the character and force of law, that of the government, departments, of private persons; they are sitting upon the government and from within.

Having now established a religion for this Nation, this judicial proclamation will, as in all similar cases therein or thereunto; the court cites cases and court decision. They cite the Constitution of Pennsylvania, that "Christianity is, and always has been, a part of the common law;" and then proceeds to establish the doctrine that the blasphemy to speak or act in contempt "of the religion professed by almost the whole community, is an offence, it is done by the title of right, authority of Chief Justice King, of New York, which applied, and so we make a part of this opinion, its meaning of the Constitution.

There remains but one thing more to complete the perfect likeness of the papal system; and that is the direct and positive assertion of binding force. Now it has this one thing lacking. It is fully and completely set. As before stated, it is broadly limned at in the quotation that made above. But this court does not stop with that, in this opinion. It covers Sunday laws as one of the "organic utterances," which proves conclusively that

this is a Christian Nation. The views of the Court are as follows:--

If we pass beyond these matters to a view of American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, note the following: The form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, "In the name of God, Amen;" the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures and other public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe; the Christian charities, to the individual and united, daily given to the relief of the distressed, the maintenance of many hospitals, orphanages and other charitable institutions. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation; and that the purpose of the government of the United States is not to interfere with religion in any of its forms or organizations; (4) to encourage whatever of religion the people may desire and practice; (5) the requirement of the establishment of religion; (6) the requirement of a belief in the doctrine of the Trinity, and (7) the public taxation for the support of church expenses; of this the government to all in all (both Old and New Testaments); (6) the grant to Papists upon every one of the elements of the Papacy; (7) laws for the observance of Sunday, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts and secular institutions. All this is declared by the Supreme Court of the United States to be among the proofs that this is a "Christian Nation."

And what more was ever the Papacy than the very things enumerated and now required by the Papacy? Not a single thing. This is the very image of the Papacy. And of Protestantism. What, then, is this but the establishment of religion, sanctioned by the highest court of the Government, the establishment of the very likeness of the Papacy--the image of the Papacy?

What is this, so then, I wish to make an observation. What is this, I want to say, and what it has wrought, and what is the likeness of the Papacy, in the principle of the national religion? It has not yet wrought its practical workings, for the law has not yet put force into these principles. But the principle of the thing goes, and the establishment of the national religion as approved by the Papacy is still in this opinion.

The nature of the "distinctive" and "unsurpassed" course, by a reading of the story of the history of the Papacy from its earliest manifestation.
