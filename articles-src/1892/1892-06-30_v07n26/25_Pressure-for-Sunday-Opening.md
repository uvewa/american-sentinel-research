THE Boston Congregationalist says:—

In considering the problem that faces the Directors of the Exposition, it must not be assumed by the churches that the Directors will have nothing but pressure for closing brought to bear upon them. Unitarian conferences throughout the West are petitioning for Sunday opening. The Free Religion Association, at its annual meeting in Boston last week, made similar declarations. But more influential than these will be the letters from the Trade's Unions of the country demanding Sunday opening, Samuel Gumpers, President of the Federation of Labor, having just sent a circular letter to all trade's unions in the United States, urging them to use their influence in that way. Still more influential will the secular press be, for with but few exceptions it favors the opening.

It is noticeable that in this entire paragraph, the Congregationalist gives no hint that it realizes that there is any principle at stake, or what that principle is; neither does it attribute to any organization mentioned the motive of defence of any principle.
