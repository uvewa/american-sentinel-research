THE Sioux Falls Daily Press expresses this editorial opinion as to the effort to secure legislation by Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday: "It appears to the Press that, as affairs are now situated, all the talk of governmental interference is useless. The laws of the State of Illinois are yet paramount in the premises, and unless this right is yielded to the Government, the opening or closing of the Fair will depend on enforcement or non-enforcement of the State law."
