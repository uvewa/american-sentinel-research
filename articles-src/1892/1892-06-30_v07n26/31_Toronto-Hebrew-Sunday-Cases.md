Louis Goldsmith, a Hebrew, of Toronto, Ontario, has been fined five dollars and costs by the police magistrate for allowing a number of employees, all Hebrews, to work on Sunday. The magistrate admitted that it was a hardship that Jews who kept their own Sabbath should be compelled to also observe the Christian Sunday, but such was the law. Henry Cohen, a Hebrew tailor, was also fined for cutting cloth in his store on Sunday.

There is an interesting coincidence of thought and expression between the Canadian and the Tennessee judges, and a startling similarity of conclusion which bodes no good to the dissenter for conscience' sake.
