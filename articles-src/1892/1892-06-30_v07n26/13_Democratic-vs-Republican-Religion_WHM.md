THAT exemplar of the perfection of political religion, the Mail and Express, true to its political instincts had no criticism of the members of the Republican Convention, when, in session at Minneapolis, they occupied Sunday in electioneering for the great and good Presbyterian candidate; but now the capacities of the English language are scarcely sufficient to furnish invective to heap upon the Democratic Convention and its delegates at Chicago because Democratic politics were not laid aside on Sunday. THE SENTINEL is not partisan in politics, and so wears no party spectacles to blind it to the apparent fact that, according to the creed of the Mail and Express, Republican politics are religious and Democratic politics are irreligious. This is another evidence that when the Mail and Express has said, as it frequently has, that "religion is politics," that it was always to be understood as intending to say that religion is Republican politics; and so Republican politics being the Christian religion and the American Sunday being the exponent of that religion, which to the Mail and Express is but another name for Republicanism, it naturally paraphrases in its own mind that biblical expression as to the Sabbath being made for man, and, applying it to the political Sunday, reads that Sunday was made for the Republican Party and not the Republican Party for Sunday, and it being, thus, quite clearly Republican in character, the Democratic Party has no right or title in it and to it, and any use of the republican Sunday for democratic purposes would be desecration.

The organ of political religion opens its description of Sunday at Chicago during the Democratic Convention with the scare head, "A Riotous Day! How Democrats desecrated the Sabbath in Chicago;" and continues:—

The Sabbath day was one wild hurrah. . . . The desecration began early. . . . It was a day of utter abandonment and in perfect keeping with Democratic methods. . . . No more disgraceful desecration of the Sabbath was ever witnessed in Chicago. . . . Every delegate drank yesterday, and the bar room doors were wide open. The extra and regular police on duty in the hotel made no secret of taking a drink whenever they wanted it, and once in the afternoon the roundeman marshaled his squad of men in the Auditorium lobby and marched them in a body into the bar, and demanded free drinks for them all—and they got them, too.

One policeman, after drinking one large glass of beer, wanted a second, and because the bartender did not give it to him at once, threatened to make a riot. After getting their beer the policemen took cigars, lighted them and returned to their posts puffing their cigars. And this is Sunday in Chicago.

## DEMOCRATIC SABBATH DESSERATION.

Drunken men lie everywhere, and the mob and drunks are heard everywhere. I saw a number of men, too drunk to move, lying in the gutters along Michigan avenue. At one time it looked as if there would be a big fight near the Wigwam between a crowd of men who were trying to force a dead-drunk Democrat into a cab and another crowd who were trying to get him out. Finally the cab drove off and the "terrible example" fell into the gutter and remained there while the two factions fought out the case with their tongues.

## A RUITOUN NIGHT.

At night the Palmer House was again the center of attraction for the crowd, and added to the thousands of Convention yellers came the Chicago people. Men and women swarmed into the place, and the latter brought their children and even their babies. In that great crowd these babies in arms were pushed and hauled about, crying because their parents were out for a Sunday racket. . . .

## REBEL AIDS FITLY CLOSE A DESECRATED DAY.

Just before midnight the Calumet Club, of Baltimore, came in with their hand, and marching down Congress street, played "Maryland, My Maryland."

On reaching the Auditorium the Baltimore boys serenaded the Tigers with "Dixie," and playing the old rebel tune, marched on to their hotel, thus fully closing for the Democratic party a most disgusting Sabbath of desecration.

If thus early, in the campaign upon which it has entered to show that politics is religion, the Mail and Express finds it necessary to use such descriptive language and broad characterization as this, what is likely to be the style of future canvasses in religious politics, when both the editorial and reportorial corps shall have become fully indoctrinated with the theories they are expected to support, and in sympathy with that form of religion, and en rapport with that style of political feeling and expression? The policy which the Mail and Express is marking out for itself is certainly remarkable.
