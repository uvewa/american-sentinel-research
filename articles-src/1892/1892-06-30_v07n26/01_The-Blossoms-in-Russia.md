# "The Blossoms in Russia."

"The Stundists in Russia," says a late cablegram, "are being persecuted with unabated vigor." So are the Adventists in Tennessee.

THERE is no tyranny like religious tyranny, and once admit that religion can be controlled by law, or that it can control law, and freedom is gone—freedom of religion is gone if law can control it and freedom of the citizen is gone if religion is to control the law.—*Mrs. Stanley Buller Dixon.*

We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men.—*Declaration of Independence.*

THE following from the decision of Judge Hammond in the case of R. M. King, is of interest in connection with the like cases of the Adventists tried in Henry County, Tenn., last month. Judge Hammond thus stated his views as to what is the essence of religious liberty contemplated and guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee:—

> Sectarian religious belief is guaranteed by the Constitution, not in the sense argued here, that the King, as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other as a Jew, or yet another, as a Seventh-day Baptist might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please,

of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance; but only in the sense that he himself should not be disturbed in the practices of his creed; which is quite a different thing from saying that in the course of his daily labor . . . he might disregard laws made in aid, if you choose to say so, of the religion of other sects.

That is to say, a man may belong to a sect; that sect may have a creed; they may practice according to that creed, and may not be disturbed in such practices; but at the same time, they must conform to the laws made in aid of the religion of other sects, who have control of legislation.

ACCORDING to Judge Hammond's interpretation of Tennessee law, if a man is a Baptist he may practice the precepts of the Baptist creed; but if the Methodists should have control of legislation, they could oblige the Baptists by law to conform to the precepts of the Methodist creed. Or one company of people might be Methodists, another Baptists, another Quakers, and so on; but if the Roman Catholics only had control of legislation, they should enact laws enforcing Roman Catholic doctrines and precepts, then the Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, etc., would all be obliged to conform to the Roman Catholic precepts, as by law required. And although protected in the undisturbed practice of their own creeds, none of them dissenting sects would be in any way at liberty to disregard the laws made in aid of the religion of the Roman Catholic sect. And such, according to Judge Hammond's views, is the freedom of religion held guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee!

IN the case of the imprisoned Adventists in Henry County, Tenn., Judge Swiggart said that were it not for the decision of the Supreme Court, in a like case, to the effect that Sunday labor constitutes a nuisance whether anybody is actually disturbed by it or not, he would be inclined to hold that a nuisance had not been proved. In like manner United States

Judge Hammond said in the case of R. M. King, that if it were within his province to decide that question, he would have no difficulty in thinking that King was wrongfully convicted; and that there is not any foundation for the ruling of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that it is a common law nuisance to work in one's field on Sunday. But, although he distinctly said that King was wrongfully convicted, and the State Court wrongfully decided when it confirmed his conviction, yet, as it rested exclusively with the State Court to decide what was common law in the State, and as the State court had decided that work was a common law, it did not belong to the United States Court to overrule the State decision; and therefore he decided that though the thing was wrongfully done, yet it was due process of law. Surely when judges thus declare their inability to right confessed wrongs, "judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and equity can not enter."
