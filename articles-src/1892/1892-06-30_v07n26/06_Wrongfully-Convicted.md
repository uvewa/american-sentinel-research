IN the case of the imprisoned Adventists in Henry County, Tenn., Judge Swiggart said that were it not for the decision of the Supreme Court, in a like case, to the effect that Sunday labor constitutes a nuisance whether anybody is actually disturbed by it or not, he would be inclined to hold that a nuisance had not been proved. In like manner United States

Judge Hammond said in the case of R. M. King, that if it were within his province to decide that question, he would have no difficulty in thinking that King was wrongfully convicted, and that there is not any foundation for the ruling of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that it is a common law nuisance to work in one's field on Sunday. But, although he distinctly said that King was wrongfully convicted, and the State Court wrongfully decided when it confirmed his conviction, yet, as it rested exclusively with the State Court to decide what was common law in the State, and as the State court had decided that such was common law, it did not belong to the United States Court to overrule the State decision; and therefore he decided that though the thing was wrongfully done, yet it was due process of law. Surely when judges thus declare their inability to right confessed wrongs, "judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and equity can not enter."
