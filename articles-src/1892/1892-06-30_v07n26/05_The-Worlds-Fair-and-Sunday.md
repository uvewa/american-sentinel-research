# The World's Fair and Sunday.

THE question propounded in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of June 9, as to whether the Columbian Exhibition been delegated any power by the American people to prescribe the religious observance of the World's Fair visitors, has not yet been answered in the negative. The answer, "no say body of men, no matter how respectable in number and daily walk to speak for the people, and to say to the people's servants that they require the exhibition of the people and the talent, the intent of the people and the interest, the intent of the Exposition have been instructed on the subject."

The people speak through certain definite and prescribed methods, and that legislation in the shape of legislation before Congress, for the people, says, the Exposition is restricted in power and may lawfully hold the people only within those limits at which it has itself been restrained.

Among those powers there are none by which the Congress, by the expenditure of public funds placing restrictions on their expenditures which will deny to any class of citizens equal beneficial results with every other class; and it is contended that there is in this the majority of the people have no right to instruct the Democratic or the Republican conventions about the day of the week, whether the day be Sunday or not; the Sunday in question is one not purposes by Christians, and is not of regulation, on Saturday which at this day observed by the Hebrews and in the Sabbath and worshiped.

To close the gates on Saturday would deny the right to the Jew to visit the Fair on the particular day; a right as entitled to enjoy in common with other citizens who have contributed to the enterprise. Even are a small minority of the people, the Sabbath respected, the gates should be closed on that Day, or any day. The question of numbers can not justify reducing the requirements and that the rights of minorities of religionists in this country observe Sunday and therefore the gates should be closed. No class of citizens should be denied of right because of might.

But the majority of the people of these United States, the majority which is saying the expense of the Fair, considering that it does observe Sunday for religious worship does not observe it to the extent of denial of amusements, in themselves giving no uneaseful and working no injury, law has when the State legislature brings with it intoxication and therefore, direction of mind together with observation too often the citizens of a municipality and is of far more immediate need to be people, and who, if we were the people, would affirm that it is to us as we think, not as their liberty of action shall serve. We, the people, and Omaha demanding the gates of the Exposition be closed on Sunday will. We the people, people of Philadelphia, through the Executive Board, of the Knights of Labor, to the number of 14,000, demand that it be kept open on Sunday. We, the Omaha people, know of none that we shall want legislation of these United States. But let it be agreed to this, that at the very last, We, the Philadelphia people, who toil and who are the backbone of this land, and our fields, and farms, and shops, and mines, and at the desks, and in the cars, represent another one-half of the population.

The people have not instructed the conventions on the question, and how have they delegated that power to any body of men?

The people who pay for the Fair have the right to visit the Fair whenever their conscience or their pleasure invites them.--*World's Reformer.*
