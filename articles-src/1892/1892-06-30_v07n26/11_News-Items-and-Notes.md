# News Items and Notes.

THE *Denver Daily News* is no editorial on Sunday closing at the World's Fair, but this paragraph: "Let us hope that the contest over Sunday as related to the World's Fair will go to the root of the business, and result in a recognition of the undoubted rights of the people. The wisdom of making one day out of seven is conceded by everybody. But all legal regulation on the subject in this country should be, and rightfully can only be, based on civil and secular ground. Mainly relating to departmental affairs rest absolutely with the people themselves. It is not for politicians, or of the clergy, who have not yet become emancipated from the old and formalism spirit of government."

AT a meeting of the Associated Trades of New York, resolutions were adopted in reference to the World's Fair; expressing an interest in its behalf, and expressing themselves as "unalterably opposed to the proposed project looking to the closing on Sundays of the great attraction of the masses of the people of this country."

> Resolved, That in the name of the toilers of the country, we protest against such a sacrifice and denial of their right to examine and study the work and skill of their brother tillers of the earth, on the only day when their time is their own, and their stand is in the most receptive condition to perceive the larger lessons which the dignity, fortune, and amusement of their labor would ever teach.

A TENNESSEE justice has been found who is willing to step in to the rescue of the overworked defendant of that State. He finds that a man cannot with impunity be compelled to labor seven days in a week. Even a horse is entitled to rest at law. Blackstone does seem to point out an inconsistency in the course of the Law and Order League, but that is to be given to the higher courts to explain away. This is the item, from the *Pittsburg Dispatch*: "Harry Sheffner, alias Horn, alias Eisner, the Law and Order detective, was fined twenty-five dollars and costs, in Alderman Steinly, for practicing for following his business on Sunday, upon a complaint made by Harry Fisher, a saloon man, in the local courts. Agent McClure, it is said, decides the decision will hold good, and will appeal the case for his malice."

JAMES GOODERHAM, a Brewer, of Toronto, Ontario, has been found in violation, and the police magistrate for allowing a number of employees, all Hebrews, to work on Sunday. The magistrate admitted that it was a hardship that Jews who kept their own Sabbath, should be compelled to also observe the Christian Sunday, but under the law, Harry Colcra, a Hebrew tailor, was also fined for cutting cloth in his share on Sunday.

An interchange of correspondence and an expression between the Canadians and the Toronto are making a notable contribution to the discussion which bodes no good to the dissenter for noncompliance.

IT is reported that the Toronto Baptist Association has passed a resolution requesting the Canadian Government to prohibit the opening of the Canadian exhibit at the World's Fair on Sundays.

In fact every one who makes Sunday a business day will have to settle before the court, as it is impossible to conduct business without work.

From report from Hingham, Mass., of June 14. The case of the violation of the old Blue Laws—B. F. Newcomb, Grosvenor, and James W. Leland, a test before Judge Kelly, in the Second District Court this morning, that Sunday work was lawful, necessary and ordinary. All pleaded guilty to the charge of illegal labor on Sunday. The case has been continued to be heard.

It seems that the fate of Sunday breakers has to be brought before the court, but it is indicated that we are not to hear the last of it. The arrests are not hundreds of Sabbath breakers brought before the court, for it is one at the time all working on the Lord's day: such as steamboat men, railroad men, omnibus and stage hands, ice cream venders, hackmen, horse-car drivers, bartenders, cooks
