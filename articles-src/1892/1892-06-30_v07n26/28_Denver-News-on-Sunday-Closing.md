The Denver Daily News in an editorial on Sunday closing at the World's Fair, has this paragraph: "Let us hope that the contest over Sunday as related to the World's Fair will go to the root of the business, and result in a recognition of the undoubted rights of the people. The wisdom of resting one day out of seven is conceded by everybody, but all legal regulations on the subject in this country should be, and rightfully can only be, based on civil and secular grounds. Matters relating to supernatural affairs rest absolutely with the individual, distasteful as that theory is to certain of the clergy, who have not yet become emancipated from the old and ferocious spirit of persecution."
