# Editorial Notes.

NOTE.--Any one receiving the American Sentinel without having ordered it, may know that it is sent to them by some friend, unless plainly marked "Sample copy." It is not returned because of unwillingness to pay the subscription price: but we are not out, the intention is to inform them that there is no law that will not be Sentinel for value.

IN order to give the symposium of the effects of a much-needed rest, no paper will suffer to be published this week. No. 27 will bear date of July 7. Our subscribers and friends will see nothing by this arrangement, as a volume of THE SENTINEL contains 51 of fifty numbers. Each subscriber and all therefore receive all his full number of papers during the year.

OUR National Reform exchanges, that want Sunday laws, "but without opposition say we may you conservative the seventh day," are as silent as the grave in relation to the persecution of Seventh-day Adventists in Tennessee. What do the editors of the *Christian Statesman* think about sending honest, God-fearing men to jail upon the strength of the legal fiction that they were "guilty of a public nuisance by working on" the first day of the week, "to the evil example of society, and against the peace and dignity of the State?"

---

THE following from the Constitution of Tennessee in its apprise to his persecution of Adventists in that State under its unjust Sunday laws testifies:

> No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience: and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship. Article 1, Section 3.

---

These Adventists read the Bible for themselves and believe it as they read, as they have the inalienable, and the constitutional right to do. Accordingly, they believe, as the fourth of the ten commandments teaches, that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. Holding this as an obligation which they owe to the Lord, they render it to the Lord. Then, having rendered to God that which is God's, they exercise their God-given right to work the other six days of the week.

And not only do the Seventh-day Adventists regard it as their right to work on Sunday, but they look upon it as a sacred duty to devote Sunday to secular exertion. Their reasons for taking this view of the question are ably and clearly set forth in an editorial article in the organ of the denomination, the *Advent Review and Sabbath Herald*, of June 14. The article is published, in condensed form, on another page of this paper. We commend to the earnest perusal of every reader of THE SENTINEL.

The view set forth by the *Advent Review* that Christians should not keep Sunday but make a difference between the Sabbath and the six other days of the week and we suppose no one to reject that claim, if intentionally made, both reasonable and consistent. The seventh day of cessation from labor is God's memorial of his creation from the work of creation, given to man in order that he might the better remember his Creator. Physical rest might be obtained on any day, and physical rest was certainly not the primary object of the creation rest, for it "was made for man," as our Lord himself declares, before his fall; and consequently before man stood in need of rest from wearing toil. Clearly the object was to keep in lively exercise man's loyalty to God as the Creator, just as our peculiarly national holidays--the Fourth of July and Washington's Birthday--are designed to fan the flames of patriotism in the American breast. Viewed from this standpoint, it is plain that the fourth commandment of the Decalogue is binding upon all men. The cessation from keeping of the true Sabbath, but it likewise forbids rivals and counterfeits.

The nature of the "distinctive" and "unsurpassed" course by a reading of the Adventists in Tennessee, is plainly shown by an extract from the evidence in the trial of this case. In the instance of the case of Bro. R. M. King, in Obion County, that State, in March 1891. Colonel Robert Anderson, counsel for the defendant, asked Mr. Cobb, one of the witnesses for the State, questions as follows, and received the subjoined answers:--

Col. R.--Did you see the defendant, Mr. King, working on the 7th day?

Mr. Cobb.--On the--

Col. R.--No. I saw him plowing in his field on Sunday, the twenty-third day of June 1890.

Col R.--Did I distinctly you in say or to say that you knew this man, and that his plowing in his field on that day was of itself annoying to you feelings?

Mr. Cobb.--Yes.

Col. R.--On the ground that it was a violation of the law?

Mr. Cobb.--Yes.

Col. R.--Then it was an excitement of your religious feelings and repulsive to your views of Christianity?

Mr. Cobb.--Yes.

Col. R.--How long have you known Mr. King?

Col. R.--What was the general character of the defendant as a citizen from first your acquaintance up to the time of this indictment?

Mr. Cobb.--Good.

This makes his matter clear: in Tennessee, quiet, law-abiding citizens becomes a nuisance if he observes the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and then goes quietly about his work on Sunday.

REV. DAVID ANDERSON, a correspondent of the *Oxford Presbyterian*, thus defends the system by which the same individual may be counted as a petitioner in favor of Sunday laws and other religious legislation, as many times as he belongs to different organizations.

Which this appears objectionable on its face, yet so is the system used in elections. A vote may be but representational. A let the right of being represented be thus exercised by members of organizations, then it must be conceded that these who advocate the Sabbath are more in numbers than the masses of the people assembled.

It was by exercising this "right" of multiplied representation that the Sunday forces showed such amazing strength at congress and in 1890, in old Michigan. For the same ratio there are in the United States not two, there are ninety members of the people, every man, woman, and child who, when want the World's Fair closed on Sunday. Simply which was only needed to induce these politicians to think so too.
