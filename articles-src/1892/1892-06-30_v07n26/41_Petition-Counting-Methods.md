REV. DAVID ANDERSON, a correspondent of the United Presbyterian, thus defends the system by which the same individual may be counted as a petitioner in favor of Sunday laws and other religious legislation, as many times as he belongs to different organizations:—

While this appears objectionable on its face, yet when we consider these petitions are not personal, but organizational, it has the right of being represented in proportion to his or her working powers in each of these, as these organizations may be affected by the action petitioned for.

It was by exercising this "right" of being numerously counted, that the Sunday forces showed such amazing numerical strength in Ohio and Michigan. At the same ratio there are in the United States not less than ninety millions of people, every man, woman, and child of whom want the World's Fair closed on Sunday. Surely such methods will presently cause petitions to stink in the nostrils of honest men.
