EVERY person has a right to work six days in every week, for the language of the commandment is, "Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work." These words God spake with his own voice, and the right which they confer upon mankind is a God-given right, confirmed by an authority beside which all opposing human authority becomes an absolute nullity.

But the language of the commandment imparts something more than a mere permission to labor upon six days of the week. It imparts something in the nature of an obligation.

The propriety of its doing so can be readily seen. Six days of the week are left to be devoted to man and his temporal interests, but the seventh day is the Lord's,—the day upon which he rested, and which he blessed and sanctified. This day must therefore be kept distinct and separate from all other days, and of course the means for doing this must not be likewise employed in behalf of other days, or the distinction would be lost. If mankind should regularly refrain from work upon two days of the week—the seventh day and some other day—in the manner prescribed by the commandment for the seventh day, there would be nothing in it to show which day it was that God rested upon, and which he sanctified and blessed,—nothing to signify that God created the heavens and the earth in six days, and rested upon the seventh,—and thus the purpose of the institution would entirely fail. The observance of the commandment by rest upon the seventh day would be nullified by the like rest upon the other day. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that the six working days should be kept distinct in character from that day which God has set apart for himself.

But the impropriety of resting upon both the seventh and first days of the week does not stop here; for the first day is a rival Sabbath. Peculiarly offensive to God, therefore, must any act be which is an acknowledgment of the claims of this false Sabbath to the sanctity and reverence due his own day. In what other way could such observance of the first day, by one who knew its claims to be false, be taken, but as an insult to the Creator? In what other way could the Creator himself regard it?

The person who refrains from labor upon the first day of the week, thereby acknowledges either the claims of the day,

or the authority of the power which seeks to enforce such rest. He may not "keep" the day as the Sabbath day should be kept, according to the spirit of the Sabbath commandment—his observance of it may be one of form only; but this in the eyes of others at least, is an observance of the day, for only each individual can examine the thoughts and intents of his own heart. The eyes of the world around us can not, or at least do not, penetrate beyond the latter of our Sabbath observance,—the outward refraining from labor; this is all, therefore, that can be asked of any one in enforcing Sunday observance. This also is all that the authors of the first-day Sabbath ever asked as that which should constitute its observance. Sunday was never blessed, sanctified, and made holy; as a rival to the true Sabbath, it is sufficient that the religious world should be induced to rest and attend religious worship upon that day instead of on the seventh day. The edicts which gave rise to Sunday observance never commanded anything more; nor is anything more exacted by the apostate church which has ever been the especial guardian of the day. Every intelligent person knows that the Roman Catholic Church does not demand of its members the observance of Sunday in the spirit of Isa. 58:13. That is the observance demanded by God with reference to his day,—an observance which reaches to the world, and the thoughts of the heart.

"God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth;" but the "beast," the Papacy, is not a spirit, and demands no spiritual worship. In those countries where the reign of the Papacy is most supreme, the presence of the devout worshiper at mass on Sunday morning, is deemed by the priest nothing incompatible with his presence at a bull fight in the afternoon; and in our own land it is well enough known that the Catholic communicant, having attended religious services in the morning, is at liberty to spend the remainder of the day just about as he pleases.

The Catholic Church does not demand Sunday observance as an act of worship to God, but as an act of homage to itself, and as such it is an act in the highest degree offensive to God. It lowers his Sabbath before the world to a level with the spurious, rival Sabbath which is of satanic origin. It nullifies entirely the act of resting upon the preceding seventh day. To worship God, and an anti-Christian power also, is to worship the latter power alone. God demands that we should worship and serve him always, and him only. The devil is satisfied to let us serve God part of the time and himself the rest of the time, well knowing that we are thereby serving him all the time, and God not at all. We do not think also that any person can afford to surrender, under such circumstances, his right, before mentioned, to six days of secular employment in every week. He who surrenders a God-given right in obedience to an arbitrary demand by any earthly power, merely as an act of homage to itself, makes himself a slave.

We think therefore that it should be a matter of conscience with all observers of the true Sabbath, not to comply with the demand to rest on the first day of the week. However, "let each be fully persuaded in his own mind." It is certain that they, and all others, have a right not to keep Sunday, and we think it equally evident that to do so would be to make a compromise that would be very displeasing to God.

God will surely vindicate his word; and those who stand upon that word need have no fear but that they will be vindicated with it. Of course, it must not be forgotten that in such a matter every person should act with discretion, taking care not to disturb others, or to make himself needlessly obnoxious to any. Nothing is more unnecessary, nothing would be more unwise, than that any one should make a needless and obnoxious display of his antagonism to Sunday rest. It is enough that a person should quietly and unostentatiously pursue his secular duties upon the first day of the week, and it would certainly be great folly for any one to bring needless trouble in this respect either upon himself or upon the cause of the truth which he professes.—Advent Review and Sabbath Herald.
