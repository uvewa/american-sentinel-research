THE Tribune, in reference to the action of the House of Representatives, on May 26, as to the Sunday closing of the Government exhibit at the World's Fair expresses itself thus: "The House has done an inexcusable thing by ordering that the Government exhibit be closed Sunday, meaning thereby that the Government building shall be shut up. When the Sundry Civil bill which contains that foolish direction is considered in the Senate, it should be stricken out, as not representing the wishes of the vast majority of the people of the United States, and as lessening the value of their Exposition. That matter, too, should be left to the judgment of the directors."
