A Pittsburgh justice has been found who is willing to step in to the rescue of the overworked detectives of this country, and say that they can not with impunity be compelled to labor seven days in the week. To be sure the course of Alderman Bleichner does seem to point out an inconsistency in the course of the Law and Order League, but that is to be given to the higher courts to explain away. This is the item, from the Pittsburgh Dispatch: "Harry Shellhorn, alias Horn, alias Homer, the Law and Order detective, was fined twenty-five dollars and costs, by Alderman Bleichner yesterday for following his business on Sunday. He is the same man who has figured several times in the local courts. Agent McClure, it is said, declares the decision will not hold, and will appeal the case for his satellite."
