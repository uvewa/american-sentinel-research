AT the convention of the National Turner-bund just held in Washington, D. C., the following was adopted:—

WHEREAS, a continued pressure is sought to be exercised for the closing of the Chicago World's Fair on Sundays and holidays: therefore,

Be it resolved by the biennial convention of the North American Turner-bund, in session at Washington, D. C., June, 1892, that the turners, and all liberal-minded citizens of this country for whom they may speak, do most earnestly protest against such Sunday exclusion, and do petition the proper officers of the World's Fair not to yield to this demand of the "Sunday Saints."

A committee of three was appointed to present this, with other resolutions, to Congress.
