# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

THE National Congress of Local Congregations, at Pittsburg, Penn., has adopted a resolution in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, but the report does not state that the Congregationalists favor the movement.

THE Prohibitionists of Paris, Tenn., in the interest of a commission of some kind before the Circuit Court of Henry County, in the middle of a column of a number of offenders on trial for "gaming," "carrying" "disturbing public worship," "selling intoxicating liquors," "keeping saloon open Sunday," publishes the names: "W. E. Lanoy, J. W. Mohs, Daniel, James Stern, working on Sunday."

THE platform of the People's Party, of Folk adopted in the national convention of 1892, held at Cookeville, May 14, 1892, contains this resolution:

"That we favor the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition of the Fourth of July."

The Convention, which adopted the platform, consisted of an estimated one hundred and forty-five hundred votes.

THE Illinois *Falls Daily Press* expresses this editorial opinion on the effort to get legislation from Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday: "It is an unwarranted interference with personal liberty, and, all the talk of governmental interference is a stretch of constitutional authority beyond repair. The laws of the State of Illinois are yet standing. Should any question of morality be added to the Government, the opening or closing of the Fair should be left to the management of this State law."

It seems in Germany the penny in the slot machines have a new form: Berlin says: "The ministers of the evangelical church of Germany have issued a circular to the Prussian president, interstate, in that it is report to the unjustified of the laws regarding Sunday labor, the rules of exemption of this. One other principles, involving the provision of the sale of sweets, traction, etc., in automatic vending machines on Sunday."

THE *Tribune*, in reference to the action of the House of Representatives, in May 28, as to the Sunday closing of the Government exhibit at the World's Fair expresses itself thus: "The House has done an incredible thing by ordering that the Government exhibit shall be closed on Sunday, meaning that the Government building shall be shut on Sunday, and the joint resolution which contains that foolish direction is considered in the Senate, if the added an objection, we are not looking for the wishes of the vast majority of the people of the United States to those by any means who profess Christianity. The matter too, should be left to the managers."

IN a recent speech in Congress on closing the World's Fair on Sunday, Mr. Moore is reported to have said:

> Some time since the president of one of our large Street Railway Companies, in a neighboring city, Montclair, N. J., asked his road employees if of railroads as to the experience of their roads with Sunday closing. Three of the Roads said that they had tried closing their roads on Sundays, and the result had been that they did not pay, and the effect upon the community was disastrous.

It has always been understood that railroad companies were organized for the purpose of making money. If there has yet been a single instance in which one of these corporations has continued in any given line after it had proved to be unprofitable,

there is no record of it as such. If Mr. Moore is sure that Sunday trains do not pay, all he will have to do will be to so inform the stockholders and the rest, and they will be abandoned at once. But from the reports it looks as if the real purpose of his speeches on the question before Congress are very different.

AT the convention of the National Turner-bund just held in Washington, D. C., the following was adopted:

> Be it resolved by the fourteenth National Turner-bund of North America, assembled in convention, that the bund declared its opposition to the Changing of the Chicago World's Fair on Sundays.

Be it resolved by the fourteenth National Turner-bund of the United States that Sunday closing would deprive marked citizens of this country of visiting the World's Fair on the only day when they are able to visit and enjoy it, and that the members of the National Turner-bund the World's Fair set to yield to this demand; and

A committee of three was appointed to present the resolution to the World's Fair Commissioners.

## The Boston Herald.

In considering the problem that faces the Democratic Convention, the *Boston Herald* discovers the chances that the Democrats will have nothing to lose by coming out flat-footed for opening the Fair on Sunday, while it may gain much by petitioning for Sunday opening. The Free Press of that city offers this as the explanation: "The reason is not far to seek. Viewed in a political light, this is sure to make much more effective the initial than there will be the letters from the Trades Assembly of New York City or the Knights of Labor, having just sent a circular letter to all their divisions throughout the country urging upon them the desirability of petitioning Parliament will the secular society and the Sabbath Unions.

It is noticeable that in this entire paragraph, the newspaper does not suggest that there is involved in it any principle at stake, or what that principle is. Right and wrong are not factors in the calculation. Nothing is considered which does not involve the motive of defense of any expediency.

MONTCLAIR, N. J., is a good example of the conditions to be brought about by strict enforcement of Sunday laws and their strict enforcement has been active in all endeavor and its enforcement to the bitter end.

Montclair is a suburb of New York City, and the place is indeed free from its worst elements of its society, they don't want the town to swarm on the Saturday Sabbath as of New York City. Neither do they want Orange, while the street railway advances enough, they ought to have running of every car during the ride from Orange on Sunday.

Those citizens of Montclair are determined that no street car and no railroad shall reach their place, to be determined by sick tickets in their town. This is in the interests of Montclair, to many of whom are to serve their constituents, to many of whom enjoy the blessings of rest in a day of a honestly earned a breakfast.

Sunday laws are unconstitutional, interfering with the rights and liberty of American citizens.--*Syracuse (N. Y.) Press.*
