IN 1658 the preamble to a law promulgated by the General Court of Massachusetts referred to the Quakers as "a pernicious sect." "whose actions tend to undermine civil government," and sets forth that notwithstanding repeated efforts on the part of the authorities "they have not been deterred from their impions attempts to undermine our peace and hazard our ruin."

In like manner, the indictments against Adventists in Tennessee charge that their Sunday work on their farms "is to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of society, prejudicial to public morals and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county and against the peace and dignity of the State." The nature of the annoyance was the same in both instances, namely, as a witness in the King case in 1890, testified, "It was very annoying to my feelings." "On what grounds?" was asked. "On the ground that it was a violation of laws, both sacred and civil." "Then it was an excitement of your religious feelings, and repulsive to your views of Christianity?" inquired the attorney. "Yes, sir," answered the witness. The likeness between the persecution of Quakers in Massachusetts in 1658 and that of Adventists in Tennessee in 1890 and 1892 is very close. Two hundred and thirty-four years has made but little change in human nature. This is evinced by the fact as stated by Judge Hammond, that "by a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom."
