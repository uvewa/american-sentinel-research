# Uncertainties - American Sentinel, June 30, 1892 (v7n26)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is significantly below average. Many passages, particularly in articles 04 (Constitution and Sunday Laws), 06 (A Judicial Proclamation of Christianity for the Nation), and portions of the NRLA news items, are extremely difficult to read. The text is blurred in many places, with ink bleed-through from the reverse side and low contrast making individual letters ambiguous. Several extended passages in article 04 could not be reliably transcribed and likely contain errors in the current transcription.
