The question propounded in THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, "Have the Directors of the Columbian Exhibition been delegated any power by the American people to regulate the religious observances of the World's Fair Exhibitors in 1893?" must be answered in the negative. The assumption by any body of men, no matter how respectable in number and daily, is to speak for the people, and to urge by repeated clamor that they represent the wishes of the people on the subject, is the only basis for the belief that the Directors of the Exposition have been instructed on the question.

The people speak through certain designated and prescribed methods, and their agents in the shape of legislative bodies speaking for the people, are, themselves, restricted in power and may lawfully bind the people only within the scope of the powers delegated to them.

Among those powers there are none delegated which authorize the appropriation of public funds placing restrictions on their expenditure which will deny to any class of citizens equal beneficial results with every other class; and it is contained in that that the majority of the people have no right to instruct the Directors of the Exposition to close the gates on any day of the week, whether the day be Sunday, which is the day observed for religious purposes by Christians, and is not scriptural, or Saturday which is the day observed by the Hebrews and is the Sabbath and scriptural.

To close the gates on Saturday would deny the right to the Jew to visit the Exposition on that day; a right be is entitled to enjoy in common with other citizens and because of his citizenship, and the Jews are a small minority of the people. Yet if the Scripture is to be followed and the Sabbath respected, the gates should be closed on that day, if on any day. The question of numbers can not justify injustice; and the insistence that the majority of religionists in this country observe Sunday and therefore the gates should be closed on that day, is simply the claim of right because of might.

But the majority of the people of these United States, the majority which is paying the expenses of the Fair, conceding that it does observe Sunday for religious worship does not observe it to the extent of denial of amusements, innocent in themselves, giving no scandal and working no injury; much less when the amusement brings with it instruction and therefore elevation of mind together with health of body. "We the people" is an expression too often the outcome of a feeling which should be written, "We want to be the people, and who, if we were the people, would compel all men to do as we think, not as their liberty of action permits." We, the people, spoke at Omaha demanding the gates of the Exposition be closed on Sunday; and, We, the people, spoke at Philadelphia through the Executive Board, of the Knights of Labor, demanding the gates of the Exposition be kept open on Sunday. We, the Omaha people, claim to represent one-sixth of the population of these United States. But it will not be denied that, at the very least, We, the Philadelphia people, who toil and labor and work six days in the week in fields, and farms, and shops, and mines, and at the desk, and at the case, represent another one-sixth of the population.

The people have not instructed the Directors to close the Fair on Sunday, nor have they delegated that power to anybody, or bodies of men.

The people who pay for the Fair have the right to visit the Fair when their convenience or their pleasure moves them.—Kentucky Journal.
