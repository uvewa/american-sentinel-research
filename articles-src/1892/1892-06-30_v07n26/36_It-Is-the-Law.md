PERSECUTION for conscience' sake has for the most part been in every age under the color and forms of civil law, and the civil officers have ever taken refuge in the plea, "It is the law." It was so in the case of the Adventists now in jail in Tennessee. Both the Judge and the Attorney-General expressed regret for their part in it, but said, "It is the law." And the Legislature says, "It is the law;" and the people say, "It is the law;" and they all, Attorney-General, Judge, Legislature, and people, settle back into a sort of easy, self-satisfied sort of lethargy, feeling that nobody is to blame except those fellows who can't "get their consciences into harmony with the law."
