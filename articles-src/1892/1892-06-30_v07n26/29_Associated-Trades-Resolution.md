At a meeting of the Associated Trades of New York, resolutions were adopted in reference to the World's Fair, expressing an interest in its behalf, and expressing themselves as "unalterably opposed to the proposed project looking to the closing on Sundays of this great educator of the masses, industrial art and mechanical science.

"Resolved, That in the name of the toilers of the country, we protest against such a sacrifice and denial of their right to examine and study the work and skill of their brother toilers of the earth, on the only day when their time is their own, and their mind is in its most receptive condition to perceive the larger lessons which the dignity, importance, and necessities of the labor world ever teach."
