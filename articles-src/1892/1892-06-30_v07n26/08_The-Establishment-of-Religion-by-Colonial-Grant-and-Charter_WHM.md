In the year 1657 the good people of Plymouth Colony began to put to its legitimate use the legislative structure which they had built, and which Justice Brewer considers to be one of the foundation stones upon which a "Christian nation" has been set, by decreeing that Quakers and heretics had no part or place in their commonwealth. They came, with but few other religious ideas than those which belong to an established church, having dissented and seceded from an established church, to found an establishment of religion of their own, where they could have complete freedom of conscience to worship as they pleased, and turn the tables upon those who disagreed with them by themselves becoming persecutors instead of being the persecuted. This was the natural outcome of the thought with which they came, it was the logical result of the laws which they made, and now, in March, 1658, they speak more decidedly, and at length, to the same point. The court decrees:

WHEREAS there hath several persons come into this Government commonly called Quakers, whose doctrines and practices manifestly tend to the subversion of the fundamentals of Christian religion church order and the civil peace of this Government as appears by the testimonies given in Sunday depositions and otherwise. It is therefore enacted by the Court and the authority thereof that no Quaker or person commonly so called be entertained by any person or persons within this Government under the penalties of five pounds for every such default, or hoe whipt; and in case any one shall entertains any such person ignorantly if he shall testify on his oath that he knew not them to bee such hee shall be freed of the aforesaid penalite, provided he upon his first discerning them to bee such doe discourse them to the constable or his deputis. It is also enacted by this Court and the authorities thereof that if any rantor or Quaker or person commonly soe called shall come into any towns within this Government and by any person or persons bee knowne or suspected to bee such, the person so knowing or suspecting him shall forthwith acquaint the Constable or his deputie of them on pains of presentment, and so liable to censure in court who forthwith on such notice of them or any other intelligence bee shall have of them, shall dilligently endeavour to apprehend him or them, and bring them before some one of the magistrates whose shall cause him or them to be comitted to Guide, there to be kept close prisoners, with such victuals comly as the Court alowith until bee or they shall defray the charge both of their imprisonment and theirs transportation away; together with an Engagement to returne into this Government noe more or else to be continued in close durance till further order from the Court; and as for as much as the meetings of such persons, whether strangers or others proverb disturbing to the peace of this Government: It is therefore enacted by the Court and the Authoritie thereof that henceforth noe such meetings bee assembled or kept by any person in any place within this Government under the penalty of forty shillings a time for every speaker, and ten shillings a time for every bearer that are heads of families, and forty shillings a time for the owner of the place that permits them soe to meele together. (And if they meet together att theirs silent meetings soe called then such person soe meeting together shall pay ten shillings a time and the owner of the place shall pay forty shillings a time.)

The clause in parenthesis was incorporated in the original draft of the decree, but as it stands in the clerk's copy has a pen mark drawn through it, as evidence that it was afterward abrogated. But it stands nevertheless as a silent witness, together with the rest of the decree, of the spirit which actuated those, who, according to the opinion of Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court, were an active factor in the establishment of the religion of this Nation by virtue of which this is a Christian Nation.

It begins to look as if some one needed to revise their ideas of Christianity. Of course it cannot be Justice Brewer, for he is one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is never well to make a hasty decision, and those of us who have given any thought to this subject are able to hold our views and their expression in abeyance until we have studied these old statutes and charters still more.
