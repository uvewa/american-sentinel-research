IN order to give the employes of this office a much-needed rest, no paper will be issued next week. No. 27 of THE SENTINEL will bear date of July 14. Our readers will lose nothing by this arrangement, as a volume of THE SENTINEL consists of fifty numbers. Each subscriber will therefore receive his full number of papers during the year.
