# Constitution and Sunday Laws.

THE Constitution of the United States of America and the constitutions of the several States are the supreme law of the land. All Sunday laws, as such, are in direct contravention of these Constitutions and the doctrines, notwithstanding the declarations of various and sundry courts to the contrary, absolutely will not hold good in law; and this we are free to say, although they have been acted on and still are; but I say this in the conviction that when sensible men look into this subject they will fully wake up and see that the rights of one citizen troubles the rights of another.

What is the origin and motive power of Sunday laws? From their beginning in the early part of the fourth century, Sunday laws have been religious laws. It was the religion of the majority in power at every step from first to last that has been behind the religion. Still it was not Christianity, for Christianity has never invoked the aid of the State. These are the rights of a free man which are declared by the constitutional provisions of the several States that say that every man "has a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience;" and that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious belief;" (providing that such belief will not disturb the peace and injure others) and that "no power" of either State or Nation shall in any case control or interfere with the right. These Constitutions are violated daily and by nearly every Sunday law in the United States.

The apathy and blindness of the average American citizen to the danger so fast growing in a country whose foundations were and are, the rights of the individual, and Church and State in this country, is the most amazing feature of the whole situation, when we recall the terrible lessons of the history of all ages, the tragedy of the Inquisition and all the scenes of the miserable centuries during which there was no such thing as the rights of the individual; the Inquisition or to the persecution of the early colonists of this country. This is no forecast of the weather and yet we have laid up for the country and will so remain the very seeds of that same evil--the mingling of religion and the destruction of law in the interest of any sect--or the destruction of the assumption of authority by Statecraft in things of religion. The spirit is the same.

It is in no degree a civil institution, for innocent, true-hearted men, humble, pious men, who worship God, who read their Bible, the Bible, word for word, who would gladly give their lives for the Master, and their Lord their God--it is on these, and such as these, believers in the Lord God, who actually obey a command of God, "to keep" and observe holy the Sabbath of the Lord their God: on these men the penalty falls--upon the industrious, quiet, God-fearing and pure--such men have been hundreds of times arrested, prosecuted, fined and given persecution. And two citizens of Tennessee, Seventh-day Adventists, who believe honestly that it is their duty to work on six days of the week and rest on the seventh, are now under indictment for the real crime of observing the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Even Constantine the first has exempted agriculturists. Of it remains for the nineteenth century civilization to go even further than the fourth in this barbarism.

The Supreme Court has recently pronounced, and very recently Judge Hammond a decision confirming the decision of the Tennessee court in the case of R. M. King, a Seventh-day Adventist, who was fined and imprisoned for pursuing his "ordinary avocations" on Sunday, that "if one conscience's honor for the purpose of explaining and attaining for himself his discernment in the customs, he may be made to conform to the law, just the same if you call them so, on the part of the great majority of his fellow citizens." That is when they rest. "Poor Mr. King was actually plowing in his own field, in the performance of what he sincerely believed to be his duty; and was injuring no one." He had, according to his belief, the command of God to justify him; the example of the Saviour to uphold him, and he might well have thought the Constitution of the country to protect him. But no. Judge Hammond, the decision goes on to add, his creature, sweeps away all the protection accorded by the Constitution, in a free exercise of religion; not in as taught the example of Jesus Christ who also kept the seventh day as the Sabbath, and holds it an act of criminality, and let his persecutors and condemners be his judge. Yet the persecuted might well be called to account of these heavy restrictions the fortunes of the judges who regarded the conscience of the majority as the only guide of the civil law. For what is the mark? what is the conscience of the majority?

The Catholic Church does not demand Sunday observance as one of worship of God; she never has; the admission is in the SENTINEL time and again, and the Catholic people, to the evil example of society, established in public morality and actually in civil forms. But the statutes are being proposed by members from their churches, the American Christian Sabbath, Sunday, by law. Christian Empire thus inaugurates the new laws they are, as the old preacher said, there is no text. On the contrary they are preparing the way for a legion of people still larger than one alone and any one of their various sects shall prepare away the rest and become sole possessors of God's heritage--the individual.

When the Sunday rest bill, offered by Senator Blair in the Fifty-first Congress, some two years since, one of the advocates declared that it would be brought before the next Congress, "not beautiful," "and you can name your own price for bill, for its flavor, little it is in lot; but we want it as a precedent," into the hands of those who would violate the Constitution by making religious laws, and then it will be the turn of whatever religious party might happen to be in the majority.

For your freedom's sake, Americans, cling to your Constitution! They are dearer to you than life itself. Cling to them, for once away from them safely, you indeed "have your bread to the shutoff and your horse to the aliens at whatever official restriction a termination and tyrannical majority may impose upon you."

But some will say "Sunday laws are not religious laws." We answer: They are so; when Congress is expressly forbidden under any law respecting the establishment of religion, and the States are expressly forbidden to make laws which shall give preference to any religious society or mode of worship. Does not the slightest shadow of Sunday, of Christianity, maintain it a part of the religion, and their Sabbath, a part of their mode of worship--Sunday observance by all classes of society? Does the exemption by law of even one religious observance give preference by law to the mode of worship of which that observance is a part? And if it be not such a law, as far as it goes, a law made to establish that religion to which such observance may belong? It will not avail to say in this connection however that neither Congress nor the Legislature enacted such a law; it is a direct and positive violation of the Constitution.

But some will say the Sunday laws are not religious in any or most of the word, but only for the benefit of the working classes and citizens' welfare, and will designate them as a "police regulation."

Now if the law does forbid a man from following his ordinary avocations, he must rest two days, or any number of days, if we follow the principle carried in this, as was decreed in France after the revolution. But it may, to be equal, the rest law ought to apply to all men equally or not at all; and to all rest of labor. If it only applies to men in need of it, in the interest of charity and necessity, they are to be allowed to choose their own rest day; the man who pays for Sunday work, then the minister of the gospel can catch his own pay for his rest if the law is his resource. It takes the organ player, the sexton and the boy who turns the bellows for some congregations from employment for their Sunday work--and it must at once as a matter of charity; it would be interesting to know how many would continue to preach under that reading of the case.

As a police regulation, under the Constitution, no consideration whatever can be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship. In this instance, the law, in deference to the Christian religion, makes a crime that is not a crime; an act is made a crime that injures no one; he who makes a crime on a Sunday and yet he has law, as concerning time laws and actual mode of worship, cannot be unconstitutional; provided they violate no constitutions of the States and of the United States. A strict analysis has also denied all of constitutional integrity.

It is said it is in the interest of police order to close saloons on Sunday on the ground that certain persons depart therefrom, and all the working classes being at leisure Sunday, there may be more occasions for the peace than on week days. But if so, the law should be applied not to Sunday alone, or to it as the Sabbath, but to every day alike. The laboring and the laboring classes are equally as liable on those days as any other.

No, gentlemen, make no Sunday laws, repeal all that now are on the statute books. Repeal all school laws establishing religion. Let religion be taught in the homes and the churches where it belongs, and religion will stand on its own feet. "Make the calm," as is feared by some; so long as religion is left free, let it be free, let it be voluntary, and there will be no compulsion about it, and like the air and the sunshine, it will perform its own purifying. But none confine it, deprive it of its freedom, and as the air when so confined, it becomes a poisonous element in religion.--"Henderson v. Henderson."
