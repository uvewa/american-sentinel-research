THE following from the Constitution of Tennessee is apropos to the persecution of Adventists in that State under its iniquitous Sunday law:—

No human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and that no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship. Article 1, Section 3.

These Adventists read the Bible for themselves and believe it as they read, as they have the inalienable, and the constitutional right to do. Accordingly, they believe, as the fourth of the ten commandments teaches, that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. Holding this as an obligation which they owe to the Lord, they render it to the Lord. Then, having rendered to God that which is God's, they exercise their God-given right to work the other six days of the week.
