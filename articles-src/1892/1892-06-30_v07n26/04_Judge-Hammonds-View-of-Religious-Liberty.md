THE following from the decision of Judge Hammond in the case of R. M. King, is of interest in connection with the like cases of the Adventists tried in Henry County, Tenn., last month. Judge Hammond thus stated his views as to what is the measure of religious liberty, contemplated and guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee:—

Sectarian religious belief is guaranteed by the Constitution, not in the sense argued here, that King, as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other, as a Jew, or yet another, as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please,

of other sects having control of legislation in the matter of Sunday observance; but only in the sense that he himself should not be disturbed in the practices of his creed; which is quite a different thing from saying that in the course of his daily labor . . . he might disregard laws made in aid, if you choose to say so, of the religion of other sects.

That is to say, a man may belong to a sect; that sect may have a creed; they may practice according to that creed, and may not be disturbed in such practice; but at the same time, they must conform to the laws made in aid of the religion of other sects, who have control of legislation.
