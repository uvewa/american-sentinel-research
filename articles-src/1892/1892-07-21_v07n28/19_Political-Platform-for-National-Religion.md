ANOTHER political expression of national religions which the Statesman wishes inserted into party platforms is this:—

We favor as an important part of the movement of shortening the hours of labor, the enactment of a national law exempting from Sunday work all Government employees, and forbidding all Sunday work on the railroads so far as congressional control of interstate commerce will permit, believing that the law of Sabbath rest is both a law of God and a law of nature, and so should be a law of nations, especially in republics, whose liberty can be preserved only by such culture of mind and heart and conscience as is afforded by the leisure hours of the American Sabbath, protected against both toil and dissipation.

Where is the third or fourth party which will adopt these planks and nominate Shepard and Crafts on its presidential ticket?
