lest if the time speedily come when those schools are controlled by the same element that other kings humble themselves in sackcloth, and endeavor to prevent the possession and reading of the Bible by the common people in their homes, and had stood as long as it dared to do in the way of progressive movements for the past of man, what then? The very moment religious questions of any kind and in this of the slightest degree connected with the Government, they are subjected to the rule of construction, or change of government, of majorities; and the minority must yield to the majority upon the subject of religion.

"There is danger ahead. The battle now in progress is one we have not had before; there are now two well defined parties on one side are those who wish to enter the field of religion into the body politic, and those on the other who stand for the Constitution which forbids such action, should receive the careful attention of every American citizen. No such preparation for the accomplishment of deep ecclesiastical designs of a hierarch could be quietly contemplated, should be made. Beyond the thoughts and fears of noble men, be the dire consequence of a union of Church and State. Look well to what this law does, and pledge some your aid, to survive in the perpetuation of political freedom and religiosity."

But the word of God is still clear. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." Prov. 9:10. And there are thousands of men and women and children depending upon them for bread, and of thousands of them as able to work as any of the laborers in our pulpits, while one of their number is as poor as our very poorest. Surely the care of the poor demands consideration. Consider the question of care for more than a few hundred dollars annually.

Churches of all denominations feel the need of it, should they then be left to meet their financial obligations alone? When the members of the Churches of Rome and other Churches are Bible and its heart of the land and what about it?

When there are comparatively few of our brethren who are in need of help, they are few, indeed; and the folly of those who have, by the Grace of God, risen above the need of such assistance, who are but too ready to spurn it, need not to be told.

But now, and till the number of implementations is far greater than what it is at the present day, let it go, and tell the number from year to year. Our brethren need to learn themselves to their brethren in spirit and in truth, before that time they must find that out themselves, before the care of those who are in want.

The pupils of such schools, is an entirely proper case. It is also a just request to make as regards all private schools. That the pupils should give a reasonable amount of time to educational purposes is all that law can properly ask; the selection of the time to be used belongs with the pupil, his parents, and the school.

The full extent of parental right of the private and parochial schools could not then, touching in this direction, be questioned by the Illinois statute which abridges that right, had been determined by the Supreme Court.

The new compulsory clause of the resolution protesting against the use of public money for private schools after substituting for them as against any construction of Church and State, will have the approval of all; and yet in this the Lutherans have made in a candid a review of principle too large, that not even all of them appreciate fully. For on that principle the resolutions condemn more than can safely be compressed in this in form of the matter.

The second point made that the State should not assume any supervision of parochial schools, or require them to subject themselves to its approval, is just. The authority of the State in this respect extends only to the schools of the State, is the authority of any such authority beyond. That is without force.

The fourth argument that a compulsory education law should not specify what branches or languages should be taught requires a prejudiced opinion in the minds of all fair-minded persons that it should as regards the constitution of a general instruction. The use of the instruction of a foreign language is not worthy of consideration. It is purely a disingenuous plea; a battery having its origin in race prejudice and distrust of that civilization which is the purpose of the State in promoting not only education. Contrary to this, the State has in view the attainment of every mental development and degree of culture among its citizens for the best interests and preservation of the State, just the instruction it can not let in, and should it can not, as it can not let in, ought. it must—a certain educational work to be left neglected by anybody, in such a manner. The establishment of a curriculum in the common schools is a just provision in this direction. It can not require that the degree of mental proficiency and intellectual form desired shall be attained through the use of this language or that.

The fifth and sixth clauses of the resolutions deal with the relations of parent and child. With the general principle of non-interference here, no calm-minded man can have any quarrel. The only earthly sovereign, ruling by divine right, are the father and the mother, and that which devolves the moral responsibility of the education of the child upon the parent, from their shoulders; and assume to itself, a right against the right of the parent to provide for the education of its posterity. To the fatherhood it may be a legal guardian, but a parent never; it can not assume the parental role toward those who have no parent or even its legal guardian. The correlative expression of the God-given right, of the parent to determine what instruction shall be given to their children is to be found in the commandment which says, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Human government must treat lightly and tenderly upon the holy and delicate relation between the family and the conscience. The Illinois compulsory law was a very serious invasion of the rights of the parent. The demand for its modification in this regard should be immediately satisfied. The Supreme Court of Illinois has been clear in this regard, that

it is for the parents of children attending even the public schools to determine the extent and the kind of instruction to be imparted to their children and the attendance of those children in schools shall be under their parental jurisdiction.

The full extent of parental right of the private and parochial schools could not then, touching in this direction, be questioned by the Illinois statute which abridges that right.

The second demand, for the omission of the "supervision" requirement upon the private schools, is one which can not be controverted upon a stated school, certainly in the assumption of its own character, decided, despite authority. As far as parochial or private schools are concerned the right to fix the time and extent of study of the pupil and the parent can not be allowed to extend to the point of practically not requiring attendance upon in schools to be regarded a part of private or parochial in authority.

The third point made that the State should not assume any supervision of parochial schools, or require them to subject themselves to its approval, is just. The authority of the State in this respect extends only to the schools of the State. This is the authority of any such authority beyond. That is without force.

The fourth argument that a compulsory education law should not specify what branches of languages should be taught, required a prejudiced opinion in the minds of all fair-minded persons. The use of the instruction of a foreign language is not worthy of consideration. It is purely disingenuous as a plea; a battery having its origin in race prejudice and distrust of that enlightenment which is the purpose of the State in promoting not only education. Contrary to this, the State has in view the attainment of every mental development and degree of culture among its citizens for the best interests and preservation of the State; just the instruction it can not let in, and should it can not, as it can not let it in, it must—a certain educational work to be left neglected by anybody.

It can not require that the degree of mental proficiency and intellectual form desired shall be attained through the use of this language or that.
