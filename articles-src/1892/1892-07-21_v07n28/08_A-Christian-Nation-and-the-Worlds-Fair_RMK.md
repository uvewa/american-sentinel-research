The inscription, "In God we Trust," on our coins, is an effort to declare this a "Christian Nation," and it is in harmony with the late decision of the United States Supreme Court. Whether the facts in the case will verify the statement is at least questionable. Other nations of the world are invited and will participate in making the Columbian Exposition a World's Fair. It is international. It must appear that the interests of the actors are mutual, and should be considered in all things pertaining to the success of the Fair, and the future interest of the nations concerned. For one nation to adopt and enforce regulations repugnant to the others would be indefensible. For a "Christian nation" to take such a course, certainly would be unjustifiable.

The efforts now being made to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, with respect to the religion of those who are urging it, can only be regarded as an infringement of the rights of the millions who have no religious scruples in regard to that day. They can not see why it is wrong to walk through those spacious halls, and view those works of art and nature on the first day of the week, when it is proper and right to do so on every other day. "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

If Congress passes the appropriation bill for the Fair, with the proposed amendments, it will be very embarrassing for those of other nations who have been formally invited to take part in the Exposition. It will be hard for this "Christian Nation" to explain why the gates of the Fair should be closed on the "American Sabbath," and why those nations which are not Christian nations should be compelled to sacredly observe the day to the Lord of whom they are ignorant, and whom they do not worship at home. As they see upon the lake boats plying in every direction, weighed down with their cargoes of living freight; the piers all crowded with fishermen at work; the arriving and departing trains at the depots, filled to overflowing with excursionists; the parks thronged; the saloons and theatres well patronized; and the streets and street cars burdened with life in every direction, it will be hard to explain the difference between the "American Sabbath" and the "continental Sabbath;" and why it would be more criminal for these multitudes to visit the Fair, or for those who are employed in it to uncover their exhibits, than to spend the day as the teeming thousands outside the grounds will spend it.

If foreign pagan or Mohammedan visitors to the Fair should chance to repair to the churches, and see the comparatively small congregations, it will be more difficult to convince them that this should be called a "Christian Nation," and they will not be able to see why those who are not Christians should be compelled to live after the manner of the Christians, when the Christians are so greatly in the minority. What can be said when they say: Do these Christians, by their laws, expect to make Christians of us, who know not their God, while there are such multitudes in their own land who do not obey them; who refuse to observe their "American Sabbath," and will not worship with them? We are willing to obey your civil laws and rulers, and will not refuse to be brought before your courts if we are found committing acts of incivility or criminality, but we do object to the enforcement of your Christian institutions upon us. We do not believe in them, and for us to obey, and act as though we believed, would be to make ourselves perjured and hypocrites. We do not know the God you worship, and desire to have the privilege of worshiping as we wish. It can do us no good to worship a God in whom we have no faith, and without faith it would not please him if we did. When another World's Fair at some time in the future may be held in our native land, this Nation will then be invited to participate in that, as we are, now, your guests; but we would not expect you to leave your God in America and go there and bow down to our gods, or conform to our religious customs. You would not do it if we should attempt to compel you to do so. Your missionaries, whom you have sent to our land, do not do it now, and neither have we compelled them to do so. Do you desire us, on our return, to force upon them the worship of our gods, and the observances of our religious festivals, fasts and holy days? If what you demand of us here is right and just, it will not be wrong for us to do the same with respect to our laws and ordinances in our land.

When your people are all temperate; when you have closed up your saloons and grog shops, and cease to manufacture these poisonous liquors; when your churches are filled with pious, godly people; when your "American Sabbath" is observed better and more generally than our festivals are, and when you adopt methods by which to convince us, instead of coercing us to render obedience to your Christian laws and ordinances, then will we believe this is a Christian Nation, and we shall then know that your laws and religion is better than ours, that you are connected with a power which can change and affect the human heart, which we know nothing about. Such a God can do us good, but your laws can do no more for us than ours have done.
