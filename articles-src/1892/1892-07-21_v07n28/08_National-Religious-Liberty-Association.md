BAYONNE, N. J., has inserted in a street car franchise a provision that the "Christian Sunday" shall be observed.

*The Star* of Ohio, tells, reports that about fifty liquor dealers in Sugarcreek are charged with keeping open saloon Sunday, and warrants for their arrest have been issued.

A CORRESPONDENT writing from Knoxville, Tennessee, informs us that on June 25, two boys were arrested and fined eight dollars each, for playing ball on Sunday. Rather than pay the fine, or having others pay it, with them paid it; the rest went to jail. The same writer adds: "Several Adventists and a number of others are arrested in the same locality."

THE Managers of the Columbian Exhibition continue to refuse to be guided by the instructions of Congress to close the gates of the great Fair. It is noted as a strong fact that they voted by a large majority to continue opening the Exhibition on Sundays, while they say nothing of the demand for Sunday closing. This may be considered significant of the attitude of local managers.

MASSACHUSETTS people who belong to the Union could think that the World's Fair should not be open on Sunday: but we have seen from the entered a petition which represents the North Missouri Conference and other churches in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. They maintain that the Fair is to be open for the benefit of the laboring people, but want it a "silent" Sunday.

This has been the idea, it may be said, of the Christian people of the country.

WHITELAW REID, the candidate for the vice presidency in the Republican ticket, set his name to a petition to the general Christian Endeavor Society last year, asking Congress to close the Fair. "And with the Endeavorers, wearing the badge of their association, flooding the mails as was therein reported in that capacity, his fellow Endeavorer being the President of the United States, Benjamin Harrison. Notice Mr. Quay, the greatest Republican politician of the time, and that every keystone of party politics in a polite tone. Mr. Harrison published his Sunday edition."

THE Senate has committed itself deliberately to an Act to suppress the free exercise of religion and the State by the passage of a provision conditioning all Government appropriations for the Fair upon its Sunday closing; but it has not done so without being obliged to listen to protests against the act.

Just before the vote was taken, Mr. Turpie, of Indiana, during the last day's debate on the subject, presented the following:

Mr. TURPIE.—I present a petition, and ask that it may be read by the Secretary. It is only a part of my request. I am entitled to five minutes.

The secretary read as follows:

*Washington, July 9, 1892.*

To the Senate:

The undersigned citizens of the United States, having been informed that a bill is now pending before the United States Senate constituting the United States Government a custodian, in part, of the World's Columbian Exposition on behalf of Sunday observance, respectfully petition your honorable body in the premises:

Mr. TURPIE. Mr. President, I presented this petition, and ask for its reference. The petition believing that the right of petition is one that is to be exercised and respected. The petition sets forth there are only five names on this petition; but they
