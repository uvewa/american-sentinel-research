REFERRING to the movement to secure governmental recognition of religion in this country, the Independent Patriot says:

"As American citizens we may be assured that vigilance is still the price of liberty. Our efforts can not be relaxed, our beacon fires can not be extinguished; we can not move one iota from the original foundation of religious liberty and the most complete separation of Church and State, if we would preserve our freedom. Some are superficial and short sighted enough to suppose that if religion could be introduced into our public schools by the reading and teaching of the Bible therein, something would be done for the spread and establishment of truth;

but if the time speedily comes when these schools are controlled by the same element that made kings humble themselves in sackcloth, and endeavored to prevent the possession and reading of the Bible by the common people in their homes, and has stood so long as it dared to do so in the way of all progressive movements on the part of man, what then? The very moment religious questions of any kind are in the slightest degree connected with the Government, they are subjected by such connection to decision and construction by majorities, and the minority must yield to such decision and construction.

"There is danger ahead. The battle now in progress in our own land between those on one side who wish to enter the wedge of religion into the body politic, and those on the other who stand for the Constitution which forbids such entrance, should receive the careful attention of every American citizen. No such preparation for the accomplishment of deep ecclesiastical designs as is herein unwittingly contemplated, should be made. Beware of the thoughtless step. Look ahead to the dire consequences of a union of Church and State. Look back to what it has done, and pledge anew your life and services to the perpetuation of political freedom and religious liberty."
