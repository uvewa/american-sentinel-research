AN amendment to the Sunday Civil bill, offered by Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, with the additional five million appropriation for the World's Fair upon closing, has passed the Senate.

THE Senate has passed, by a vote of 25 to 29, an amendment prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors within the Exposition grounds, but the action of the following day nullified this; and the Sunday bill will be sent back to the House with the amendment attached conditioning the appropriation upon the Sunday closing of the entire Exposition. It is, consequently, an exhibit of the unconstitutional character of political religion that governmental appropriations may be made in aid of Sunday selling, or days in the week, providing Sunday is religiously observed. The Sunday closing rule was made on political lines, only one Republican senator voting against the measure.

THE congressional situation as it now stands, the House having previously passed the provision closing the Government exhibit on Sunday and the Senate having concurred—shows both Houses of Congress to have acted on the same subject—but reversely, in the affirmative, upon the question of religious legislation. And not only does Congress thus feel itself to the establishment of the greatest legislative error in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, and in complete subversion of the principles of American institutions as regards legislation respecting religion, but it has done it in such a manner that although a failure to agree upon the House, or a refusal to accept the appropriation, coupled with these conditions, by the World's Fair management, may defeat the purpose of the attempted legislation; and the Fair will be open; yet, the fatal step has been taken, and the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court, have taken, and legislative and judicial sanction to the assumption of a prerogative over religion by the Nation in its legislative and judicial capacities.

WHITELAW REID's paper, the *Tribune*, opposes the closing of even the Government exhibit at the Columbian Exposition on the ground that such action would not represent "the wishes of the vast majority of the people." Upon this the *Christian Statesman* remarks that "'the only reliable tally of the 'wishes' is the petition'" which have been presented. It has, however, been shown repeatedly that the petitions for the closing of the Fair are thoroughly unreliable, being stuffed and fraudulent in the extreme.

Some three years ago the Union Signal, by a typographical error, spoke of the Civil Sunday bill as the "Civil Sunday bill." THE SENTINEL noted the error and took occasion to remark that the time would doubtless come when the appropriation bill known as the "Civil Sunday bill" would indeed be what our contemporary had inadvertently called it, the "Civil Sunday bill." That time has come; for that bill now carries with it an appropriation of five millions of dollars, conditioned on the observance of Sunday at the World's Columbian Exposition.

WHEN Senator Potter sharply reminded a few days since, that the talk in Congress about closing the World's Fair on Sunday was only hypocrisy, he expressed a truth, though an uncomfortable one. The Senator reminded his colleagues, that they were very solicitous about Sunday, that they not only received their mail letters upon that day, but were in the habit of going to get on packing expeditions on Sunday without any criticism whatever to the cowardness which were so sensitive about the World's Fair.

The real nerve of the act of support which measures for the legal holiday of Sunday receive at the hands of Congressmen is illustrated by the following:

The key of the whole matter lies right there. Congress is dealing with this question in a spirit of the utmost hypocrisy. There are men there who are the earnest hypocrites. There are not a few of the members of both houses have said in private, that Sabbath observance is valuable. The first of the churches that observe Sunday as a Sabbath. They have no hesitation in doing this because the churches and their supporters, a host profession of ballotmakers view with unmoved concern its condemnation; and there are willing to undermine the Fair and risk it of its best patronage in prostituting the rights of free Americans in the interest of a combination of partisanship with their party.

And men calling themselves Christians, and even ministers of the gospel, love to have it so!

The editor of the *Mail and Express,* used the most space that could be gotten in the text of scripture in one column and tips of the same to another, made a speech on the Fourth of July, in which he said:—

It takes a fountain of journalism which did not exist in the days of monarchy, and which, its existence be it on good morality. The publishers and address make it one of the most useful institutions in the world, and take advertisements and printing of all kinds that have an educational value and moral force. Let us therefore apply this test: The press is the people. It seems as if in choosing Sunday closing, the country were voting against its own better interests. It looks now as if the "American Church" and the "American Sunday" had captured the "American Congress."

The proposing, selling, buying and reading of a Sunday newspaper may be morally wrong as well as legally wrong; this is certainly an open question from church, so that at is the true note is at the present upon it. The man who has a different kind of people has not so done because of the law.

It is but a clipping from this, and will pay for perusing with great words, but the cause of enforced Sunday rest in the bedrooms and saloons and upon the people as something essential to their well being.

The following extract from a private letter from Bowling Green, Mo., dated June 14, 1892, shows that the authorities of Pike County are promising fair persecution of those who work on Sunday:

Deputy Sheriff Hamm came yesterday and took away wages that John Booth owed to me, at auction. It seems that deputy sheriff is a thing no sheriff is; he doing is all he can for those who make him chief is doing all he can for those who make him chief; that is to say, he has lately taken the position of working against us Sunday workers. The bond for my appearance was made for Mr. Booth. Booth made the two bonds of $150.00 each. The justice who tried the case will appear again and they propose to take enough cattle from us to pay those fines.

Evidently this deputy is a worthy instrument of the Tennessee Sunday law as well.
