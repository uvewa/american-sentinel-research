Adventists in Tennessee are being fined because they choose to observe the seventh day of the week instead of Sunday. We think it would strike an unprejudiced observer that a Sunday law which results in such persecution, is as far from a just and proper law as possible. The laws of our land should in their from every religious obligation. The privilege of observing Sunday should be moral, but forced upon none.
