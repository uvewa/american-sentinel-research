A CORRESPONDENT writing from Knoxville, Tenn., informs us that on June 25, ten boys were arrested and fined eight dollars each for playing ball on a previous Sunday. Those who had the eight dollars with them paid it; the rest went to jail. The same correspondent informs us that there are a number of other arrests threatened in the same locality.
