The inscription, "In God we Trust," on our coins, is set as a declaration that this is a "Christian Nation," and it is in harmony with the late decision of the United States Supreme Court. Whether the facts in the case will suit the statement is a very different matter. All people of all the nations are invited; and will participate in what shall be displayed at the World's Fair this year. It is international. It must appear then, that certain questions affecting the future interests of the nation are concerned and should be considered in all things pertaining to the interest of the Fair. If the future interest of the nations concerned, for one of these nations so as to force regulations to the others would be indefensible. For a "Christian nation" to take such a course, certainly would be unjustifiable.

The efforts now being made to close the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday in the respect to the religion of those who are religious, can be required as an act of religion. We maintain that the management of the World's Fair have not the right whatever to refuse religious men to regard a day, or to walk through those spacious grounds and view the grandeurs of all the nations on the first day of the week, if he or she chooses to do so. Nor to ask another one on another day. "To that that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

If Congress passes the appropriation for the Fair, with these religious amendments, it will be very embarrassing for everybody and ourselves; but we have been very kindly invited to take part in the Exposition. It will be hard for the "Christian Nation" to explain why the gates of the World's Fair should be closed on the "American Sabbath," especially when the idea of the Christian nations should be compelled to come as guests of the "Christian Nation" whom they are ignorant, and whom they are not, wedged down with the cargo of what upon the lake boats plying in every direction, with living freight; the piers all crowded with long trains of cars running, with those departing trains at the depots, filled to overflowing; the streets thronged and thoroughfares; the saloons and theaters well patronized; and the streets and street cars burdened with the business of carrying to and from the Fair. For under such circumstances it will be hard to explain the difference between "American Sabbath" and "Continental Sabbath;" and why it should, with all its inconsistencies, be forced upon those who are visiting the Fair, or for those who are employed in it to discover that sabbath, thus to spend the day as the teeming thousands outside the grounds will spend it. If passing pages to Mohammedan visitors to the Fair should chance to repair to the churches, and see the comparatively small congregations, it will be very incomplete. It will be hard to convince them that this should be called a "Christian Nation;" and they will not be able to see why those who are not Christians should be compelled to live after the manner of the Christians, when the Christians are greatly in the minority. What would be said if they say for their Christian citizens, by their laws, expect to make other people religious by law? Why should they, while there are such multitudes in their midst that need converting themselves, seek to force on their "American Sabbath;" and would and will worship with them. All are willing to obey your civil laws and rules, and will not refuse to be brought before your courts if we are found committing acts of incivility or criminality, but we object to the enforcement of your Christian institutions upon us. We ask our own laws in them, and for us to obey, and not as aliens to be singled out especially, as our people have set respective and opposite laws. We ask you to leave the God your worship, and does that bring the blessing and the worship unto us. He, too, says that we are to bear that in life. If we do not so as good to worship without it would not please him. If we do, we do it of our own accord. Perhaps some time in the future may be held to invite friends to participate in, as we do, and are; now, you permit; but we beg of you, do not force it. It will pay you, when you respect us yet to leave your God to America, and put down the fences for our own. Do not force a conformity to our religious customs. You would not do it if we should attempt to compel you to do so. Your missionaries, whom we have not sent, will show you this is true, and neither have we compelled them to do so. Do you please, us, do not return, to force upon them the worship of our gods, and the observances of our religionists, which is a far worse offense than what you demand of us here is right and good; for in all civilized affairs we do, the same with respect to our laws and ordinances."

When your people are all temperance, your homes have all closed up your saloons and grog shops, and cease to manufacture these poisons; [pause.] When your churches are filled with pious, godly people who wear "American Sunday;" it can be observed better and more generally than; and therefore and then, when subject ordinarily by which to convince us, infidels and sinners, we to those so charitable to your own people. In the meantime, we believe this is a Christian Nation, and will not hold it against you when it is known; religion is better than ours, that you are practicing your own. So love and your love affect the human heart, which we know about religion. Such is both is not on us good, but your laws can do no more of us not, either, you have no religion at all."

E. M. KILGORE.
