At the Lutheran Conference which has lately been in session at Freeport, Ill., resolutions were passed relative to legislation upon the school question, in that State, which are eminently just and sensible. The resolutions read as follows:—

We, the German Evangelical Church, for our conscience sake, demand of our [State] government the absolute control of our school and educational system, therefore we demand:

1. The repeal of the present and unjust school law, and
2. The enactment of a new, just, compulsory school law not containing the following points: a, that the compulsory period for parochial schools begin at any certain time; b, that the child attend any certain school; c, that parochial schools be approved or supervised by any State official; d, that instruction be given in certain branches or in a certain language; e, that empowers State officials to take truant anywhere but to their parents as long as the parents fulfill their lawful duties; f, that infringes upon the rights of parents in any manner; g, that allows public money to be used for private purposes; h, that connects Church and State in any manner.
3. We solemnly protest against any class legislation pertaining to parochial schools. We desire for ourselves to keep this question out of politics as long as possible. We instruct our committee, however, to watch the evolution of the whole matter with due care, and keep us posted, so that we can act intelligently.

These resolutions do not question the propriety of compulsory education in a general sense, but protest forcibly and wisely against any legislation upon the subject of education which shall infringe upon the natural rights of the parent or the pupil, in the family relation or religious connection.

The first request as to what the law should not contain, that it should not fix particular dates for the opening of parochial schools, or virtually do that by setting a certain time for the beginning of the compulsory period, as applied to

the pupils of such schools, is an entirely proper one. It is also a just request to make as regards all private schools. That the pupil should give an ascertained amount of time to educational purposes is all that law can properly ask, the selection of the time to be used belongs with the pupil, his parents, or guardian.

The second demand, for the omission of requirements as to the attendance of pupils upon a stated school, certainly strikes at the assumption of an unwarranted, despotic authority. As far as parochial or private schools are concerned the law may not discriminate, the choice of the pupil and the parent can not be interfered with, and certainly the State may not require attendance upon its schools to the exclusion of private or parochial instruction.

The third point made that the State should not assume any supervision of parochial schools, or require them to subject themselves to its approval, is just. The authority of the State to supervise extends only to the schools of the State, the assumption of any such authority beyond that is without right.

The fourth suggestion that a compulsory school law should not specify in what branches or languages instruction should be given, although it will no doubt rouse a prejudiced opposition in the minds of some, is a perfectly proper point to make as regards the constitution of a general law. The fear of the dominance of a foreign language is not worthy of consideration. It is purely chimerical,—a phantasy having its origin in race prejudice unworthy of that enlightenment which is the purpose of the State in promoting education. Compulsory education by the State has in view the attainment of a certain mental development and degree of culture among its citizens for the best interests and preservation of the State; but it may not, as it can not in fact, establish a cast-iron educational mold to which every prospective citizen shall be fitted. The establishment of a curriculum in State schools is as far as it can go in this direction. It can not require that the degree of mental development and intellectual force desired shall be attained through the use of this curriculum, and no other.

The fifth and sixth clauses of the resolution deal with the relations of parent and child. With the general principle of non-interference here, no one, certainly, can have any quarrel. The only earthly sovereigns, ruling by divine right, are parents. Upon them, and not the State, devolves the moral responsibility of parental training, and the State can not lift from their shoulders, and assume to itself, either parental authority or responsibility. To the fatherless it may be a legal guardian, but a parent never, much less assume the parental role toward those who have no need of even its legal guardianship. The correlative expression of the God-given right of the parents over their children is to be found in the commandment itself which says, "Honor thy father and thy mother." Human government must tread lightly and hesitate as it approaches the sacred precincts of the family and the conscience. The Illinois law, as it now stands, is a distinct invasion of the rights of the parent. The demand of the resolutions in this regard should be immediately satisfied. The Supreme Court of Illinois has itself decided in this regard, that

it is for the parents of children attending even the

public schools to determine the extent and the subjects of instruction to be acquired by the child, and that such parental determination is to control school authorities and teachers.

The full extent of parental right in private and parochial schools could not then, according to this decision, be questioned, and the Illinois statute which abridges them ought not to stand an appeal to the Supreme Court.

The two remaining clauses of the resolution protesting against the use of public money for private educational purposes, and against any connection of Church and State, will meet the approval of all; and yet in this the Lutherans have made a candid avowal of principle which no doubt not even all of them appreciate fully. So far as parochial schools are concerned this is the core of the matter. A full acceptance of the principle here stated, in its completeness, and an adherence to it without fear or favor, is the only safeguard of the free exercise of religion pure and undefiled, in the home, the school, and the church.
