MASSACHUSETTS people who belong to the Unitarian faith think that the World's Fair should not be closed on Sunday. In this behalf they have signed a petition which represents the North Massachusetts Conference and other churches in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. They request that the Fair be open Sunday for the benefit of the laboring people, but want it a "silent exhibit," with no machinery running.

This has been the idea, it may be said, of the World's Fair Directors from the beginning.
