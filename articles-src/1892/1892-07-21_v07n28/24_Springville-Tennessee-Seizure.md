THE following extract from a private letter from Springville, Tenn., under date of July 13, shows that the authorities of Henry County are pursuing the persecuted Adventists relentlessly. The writer of the letter says:—

The Deputy Sheriff came yesterday and took the spring wagon that John Dortch used to own, although he had sold it. The deputy (who will be the next sheriff) is doing all he can against the Adventists. He says the sale of the wagon is not legal because it was made after Mr. Dortch was arrested. He says that they can take anything for the State costs that a man has except one hundred pounds of flour, and they propose to take enough to pay all the State costs.

Evidently this deputy is a worthy exponent of the Tennessee Sunday law.
