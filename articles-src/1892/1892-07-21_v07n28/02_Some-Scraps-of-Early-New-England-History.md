THE early history of New England is the history of the Puritans; when one was on the wane. To escape the persecution by Mary, in her attempt to restore Catholicism as the religion of England, many of the Protestants of that country had fled to Germany. The worship of those in exile was conducted by some with a retention of the English ritual, as established under Edward VI, while others preferred the simpler forms used in their worship. This caused a division, and from the distinguishing feature or principal scene of these disturbances was "Frankfort." Those who maintained the English form of worship were called Conformists, and those who advocated Continental forms, were called Non-Conformists. It is an important fact in history that the Conformists drove the Non-Conformists out of the city.

At the accession of Elizabeth, November, 1558, the exiled returned to England to enjoy the established religion under the new regime. But their differences continued. The Non-Conformists acquired the name of "Puritans." The Conformists not only did not separate from the Church of England, but it was not their purpose to separate from either the church or the government of England. It was not their purpose to remain in, and a part of, both. The Puritans did not separate and would not. Each and every one of each, had indeed a Puritan Church of England, and a Puritan government of England.

At Elizabeth we see that Puritan party growing, gaining the triumph by reforming conformity according to the established usages. Elizabeth, acknowledging the failure of the efforts of the Bishop of Canterbury and his subjects, employed the terrors of civil law to compel conformity; and thus began Puritan persecutions. And though the persecution was severe, they bore it with faith, at first, because every effort that was made to crush them only multiplied their numbers and influence a hundredfold, and, second, because they lived in strong hope of better days, when James of Scotland should come to the throne.

James, though a Presbyterian, continued the war which Elizabeth had already waged against the Puritans and Congregationalists. They were denied the possession of churches and ministerial resources, and abused by all classes, as well as by the orders of the king, and, in 1608, they fled to Holland, stopping first at Amsterdam, and afterward going to Leyden in 1609. From there a company of these Pilgrims, sailed and landed at Plymouth, December, 1620.

The success of this venture suggested to others another means of escape. It gave others an opportunity to establish a community according to their own way and manner! And was not the way fully opened, and the opportunity not to be improved? Enough! They would do it. A company was formed; a grant of land was obtained, and John Endicott, with a company of men, was sent over in 1628, and they made a fishing settlement at the place afterward called Salem in Massachusetts Bay.

In 1629 a royal charter was obtained, creating "The Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England," and four hundred and its equals, led by Francis Higginson, went out over, and Endicott became governor of the whole colony.

A Puritan or Calvinistic government was at once established upon the strictest order. A church was immediately organized, according to the Calvinistic Puritan fashion, with Higginson and Samuel Skelton as pastor and teacher, and all others invited to Puritan. Two persons of the former company at Salem, John and Samuel Browne, took the lead in worship according to their own wish, retaining their service after the Episcopol order, making use of the Book of Common Prayer. Their worship was forbidden. The Brownes replied, "We are Separatists, and you are not." "We separate," was the Puritan answer; "We separate, and you separate not from the corruptions and the corruptions. We came away from the corruptions of the Church of England, our mother, where we suffered much for nonconformity in this place of liberty; we can not, we will not, use them. Therefore, we respectfully will try to establish the worship of God." To return the Brownes argued and reasoned; that when their defense was pronounced seditious; their worship was declared to be schismatic; they were sent back to England to "that inns and ever-troublesome" court, Endicott with his Puritans filled their place for such as they.

That was in 1629. And was a specimen of that sort of liberty which the Puritans had. In 1630 there came over another company to the place. John Winthrop and Thomas Dudley, who were the governor and deputy of the Massachusetts Company; and their embarkation in 1630 was the signal of a great Puritan exodus from England. Among these last Puritans. Before Christmas of that year seventeen ships had come to New England, bringing more than one thousand passengers. "Fuller's Voice" and the spirit and heart of liberty of conscience are in expression in the following lines, which we recommend:

Let men of God in courts and churches watch
O'er such as do a toleration hatch,
Lest that ill egg bring forth a cockatrice,
To poison all with heresy and vice.

And Winthrop's estimate of the proposition is seen in his declaration that "I became a faithful minister in my heart, and I could turn it aside from it." "I saw that
