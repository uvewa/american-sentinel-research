To the Honorable the members of the Senate of the United States:

The undersigned, in behalf of a large number of citizens, whose sentiments are, as he believes, in accord with those of a majority of the people of the United States, respectfully and earnestly protests against the passage of the bill [H. R. 3507] entitled, "An act regulating the delivery and sale of ice within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday."

The passage of this bill would mark a new era in the history of our national legislation. It would be, so far as I am aware, the first law of a distinctively religious character. With the title as passed by the House, it undertakes to decide that Sunday is the Sabbath: "On the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday." That Sunday is the Sabbath is denied by multitudes of Christians, and what right has the Congress of the United States to decide the question?

But even should this objection be removed, the religious character of the act remains, providing as it does, what shall or what shall not be done on Sunday.

The incongruous character of the State legislation in regard to Sunday, is best illustrated by its results. Were it not for the seriousness of the subject, it

would be laughable to notice the working of the Sunday laws in the various States.

In Connecticut, at a very early day, it was decided that a note given on Sunday was void. Some years afterward the same man who, in Connecticut had lost the amount due on his note because it was given on Sunday, was sued in Massachusetts on a note given on Sunday, and was obliged to pay it; the Supreme Court of Massachusetts holding the note to be good.

—Wright v. Geer, 1 Root, Rep. 474; Geer v. Putnam, 30 Mass. 312.

In Pennsylvania, it has been decided in various cases, that neither canal boats, nor passenger railroad cars, nor other public conveyances could legally run on Sunday.

In the same State, some thirty years ago, it was necessary to obtain the decision of the highest judicial tribunal of the State to determine whether a servant had the right to drive his employer's family to church on Sunday, in the employer's own private carriage.

—Commonwealth v. Nesbitt, 34 Pa. Rep. 398.

In Maine, the hiring of a horse and carriage on Sunday was held illegal, though they were used for the purpose of carrying a young lady home, who had been attending a religious meeting.

—Tillock v. Webb, 56 Me. 100.

It must be stated, however, to the credit of that State, that it was afterward held, that a young lady, who, on the Lord's day, walks to her aunt's house, and from there proceeds to take a walk with her cousin simply for exercise in the open air, had not violated the law.

—O'Connell v. Lewiston, 65 Me. 34.

In a case in Arkansas, defendant was poor—had no implement with which to cut his wheat, which was wasting from over-ripeness—could borrow none until Saturday evening. He hired a negro and cut his grain on Sunday. But the Court held that he was not justified in breaking the Sabbath.

—State v. Goff, 20 Ark. 289.

In New Hampshire it was decided that swine could not be impounded on Sunday, though they were destroying property.

—Frost and Hull, 4 N. H. 453. In that case the swine had more liberty than the people. The swine were free to destroy, while the people were not at liberty to prevent the destruction.

In Massachusetts it was solemnly decided by the Supreme Court, only twenty-five years ago, that a person walking a short distance in a public highway, simply for exercise and to take the air, on Sunday evening, with no purpose of going to, or stopping at, any place but his own house, was not liable to punishment for so doing.

—Hamilton v. City of Boston, 14 Allen's Rep. 475.

Well would it be for the country if the ludicrous or preposterous character of such enactments were the most that could be said against the Sunday bills now pending. But a graver question is presented. It is, whether Congress shall now enter upon an era of religious legislation. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. And Judge Story says that this was not intended merely to prohibit the establishment of a national religion. The intention was to prohibit all legislation by Congress, on the subject of religion.

—Comm. on the Const. Secs. 1877-9.

This, too, is in accordance with the practice of the legislative department of the Government.

Over sixty years ago, petitions were laid before Congress, asking for the discontinuance of Sunday mails. Hon. Richard M. Johnson, of the committee to whom the matter was referred, presented a masterly report, concluding with a resolution that the committee be discharged from any further consideration of the subject. In presenting the resolution, Mr. Johnson said he believed that legislation upon the subject was improper, and that nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand were opposed to any legislative interference, inasmuch as it would have a tendency to unite religious institutions with the Government. He believed that these petitions and memorials in relation to Sunday mails were but the entering wedge of a scheme to make this Government a religious instead of a social and political institution; they were widely circulated, and people were induced to sign them without reflecting upon the subject or the consequences which would result from the adoption of the measure proposed. There was nothing more improper than the interference of Congress in this matter.

—Abridgement of Debates of Congress, vol. 10, p. 232.

The resolution was adopted, and 3,000 copies of the report ordered printed; and thus the matter was disposed of.

More than half a century passed before any further effort was made to obtain religious legislation at the hands of Congress.

But within the last ten years the desire for such legislation has increased in certain quarters until it has become almost a mania. There is a persistent and determined effort in the direction of religious, and especially of Sunday, legislation. Old State Sunday laws are revived and made the basis of prosecutions, while the most desperate efforts are being made to obtain the passage of new Sunday laws of a more rigid character. Secret organizations are formed and set to work with all the methods of the Inquisition except physical torture, and the spirit manifested in some instances would indicate that the exception is owing merely to the want of power. Congress has hitherto firmly withstood all these efforts, and now first shows signs of wavering.

To the Senate of the United States, the body upon whom, under our admirable system of Government, devolves the duty of checking hasty, inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation, we appeal to stem the tide, and to put a stop at once to this religio-political crusade.

Most of what has been urged against the passage of the Sunday ice bill, will apply with equal force against the condition sought to be attached to the bill making appropriation for the Columbian Exposition;—requiring the Exposition, or at least the Government exhibit, to be closed on Sunday.

Any condition of that kind, whether relating to the whole Exhibition, or only to the Government exhibit, would be subject to all the objections against religious legislation. When the Government exhibit shall be open, and when it shall be closed, may well be left to those having charge of the exhibit. Congress does not prescribe other particulars in regard to management, and to prescribe this would be merely a governmental endorsement of a certain day as the Sabbath, and thus a legislative decision of a religious question.

Considerable has been said, in and out of Congress, as to the alleged fact, that the laws of Illinois would be violated by leaving the Exposition open on Sunday. The State of Illinois is fully capable of vindicating its own laws. There is a great mistake, however, as to the fact. The laws of Illinois simply provide that the acts specified shall not be done to the disturbance of others. But who would be disturbed by the presence of people in Jackson Park on Sunday? Certainly not those who would be engaged in religious exercises several miles away.

This matter of disturbance, and the principal upon which it rests, was well stated by Chief Justice Ruffin, of North Carolina, in State v. Williams, 4 Iredell Rep. 403.

"The truth is," said he, "that it [Sabbath breaking] offends us, not so much because it disturbs us in practicing for ourselves the religious duties, or enjoying the salutary repose or recreation of that day, as that it is in itself a breach of God's law, and a violation of the party's own religious duty."

Thus it appears from the statement of this jurist, a statement the more remarkable because it was made from a religious standpoint, that the disturbance consists not in preventing the party disturbed from being religious himself, or from doing his own duty, but in the fact that somebody else is not doing what the party disturbed thinks that other party ought to do. In other words, one who has every opportunity to do his own duty, is disturbed because somebody else is not doing his duty at the same time. The Congress of the United States is scarcely called upon to aid the State of Illinois in preventing such disturbance as this.

The prevailing sentiment in Illinois may be considered as expressed by Judge Breese, one of the ablest jurists we have ever had.

"The notion," said he, "that Sunday is a day so sacred that no judicial act can be performed, had its origin with ecclesiasticity of an unenlightened age, and rests upon no substantial basis, and if it is the doctrine of the common law, it need not have application here, in this day of thought and increased enlightenment. Men are freer now than then, ard are permitted to regard acts as innocent and harmless, which were then deemed sacrilegious and worthy of anathema."

—Langabier v. R. R. Co. 64 Ill. 247

A union of Church and State does not necessarily mean an establishment of a national religion. Every act of religious legislation is a step in that direction. We ask Congress not to take the first step; and in making that request we believe we voice the desire of millions of patriotic citizens.
