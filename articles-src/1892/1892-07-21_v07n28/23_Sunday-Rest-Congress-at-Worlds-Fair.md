A REPORTER for the Chicago Tribune quotes Dr. W. W. Atterbury, of this city, as saying in an interview:—

At the Paris Exposition one of the most important and notable congresses held was that devoted to "Sunday rest." President Harrison was chosen honorary president of the congress, but sent a letter of regret, and M. Leon Say was made chairman. The question was discussed apart from its religious aspect, and upon hygienic, social, and industrial considerations. The congress was well attended by representatives of railroad and manufacturing companies, chambers of commerce, working men's societies, and by others interested in social and political economy—Roman Catholics, Protestants, Israelites, and Freethinkers. The results of the congress were very appreciable. A French popular league for the promotion of Sunday rest was organized, with M. Jules Simon as honorary president, and M. Leon Say acting president, which has been instrumental in spreading the idea of Sunday rest throughout France.

A congress similar to this will be held at the World's Fair in Chicago, and it is certain to bring together a company of illustrious men from all branches of society in every part of the world. It will certainly be one of the most notable congresses held, and most surely will be productive of great benefit to the cause of Sunday observance everywhere.

The reporter then says of the Doctor himself:—

Dr. Atterbury has been for many years the Secretary of the New York Sabbath Committee, and is familiar with the Sunday-rest movement in Europe. For this reason he has been placed in charge of the arrangements for the International Sunday-rest Congress to be held in 1893. President C. C. Bonney, of the World's Fair Auxiliaries, thinks the congress of so much importance that he is soon to issue an address concerning it, for distribution in foreign lands.

An open Fair will give an excellent opportunity to preach Sunday closing to many thousands who otherwise would not be likely to be their listeners. It is strange this was not thought of earlier, and Congress petitioned to compel all to attend church at the Fair on Sunday.
