The undersigned, in behalf of a large number of citizens, and also representing a number of religious and other organizations, as he believes, in accord with those of a majority of the people of the United States, respectfully and earnestly protests against the passage of the bill, to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, and for all so within the District of Columbia.

The passage of this bill would mark a new era in the history of our national legislation. From the foundation of our Government, the first law of a distinctive and entirely religious legislation. While the bill is proposed as a condition of an appropriation passed by the House, it undertakes to do more than the First Amendment permits. The Sabbath Day, commonly called Sunday, belongs exclusively to religion. It was originated by multitudes of Christians, and what right has the Congress to say that it shall close? and other provisions.

But even should this objection be pushed aside, it is an entirely religious condition, providing as it does, what shall be a "Sabbath."

The incongruity character of the State legislation in regard to Sunday, is best illustrated by its results. Were it not

would be laughable to notice the working of the Sunday laws in the various States.

In Connecticut, at a very early date, it was decided that a ride given on Sunday was void. Some years afterward the same wise men, in Connecticut, had had the amount due on his note because it was given on Sunday, was not good. In Massachusetts a note given on Sunday, and was going to pay it; the Supreme Court held it good. *Wright v. Geer, 1 Root, Rep. 474.* *Geer and Rathburne v. Putnam, 1 Root, Rep. 4.*

In Pennsylvania, it has been decided in a number of cases that contracts for the sale of passenger railroad cars, not other public conveyances, could not run upon that day.

In the same State, some thirty years ago, it was necessary to obtain the action of the highest judicial tribunal of the State to determine whether a servant had the right to drive his employer's family to church on Sunday, in the employer's own private carriage. *Commonwealth v. Nesbit, 4 Pa. Rep. 398.*

In Maine, the driving of a horse and carriage on Sunday was held illegal, though they were used for the purpose of carrying a young boy, who had been so unfortunately injured, to see the doctor. *State v. Barker.*

He stated, however, to the credit of that State, that it was afterward held, that a woman was justified in traveling on horseback on Sunday upon an unbroken horse to her aunt's home; and from there taking to take a walk with her cousin simply for exercise in the open air, had not violated the law. (*Id.* *Townsend v. Griffin, 4 Id.*)

In a case in Arkansas, defendant was so poor—had no implement with which to cut wood, that when wanting fire, on a severe exposure—had borrow some with Saltonstall to warmest. He hired a negro and cut a quarter of cord of wood on Sunday; held that he was not justified in breaking the Sunday law by his necessity, even though they were destroying property.— *Shover and Hull v. The State, 5 Eng. 259. 41 Ark.* In that case the people who had more liberty than the poor. The estates were free to destroy all; the people were not at liberty to preserve their own.

In Massachusetts it was generally decided by the Supreme Court, only twenty-odd years back, that a person walking a short distance in a public highway, simply for the purpose of meeting a friend on Sunday evening, with no purpose of going to, or returning from any place of worship, meeting, was not liable to punishment for so doing. *Hamilton v. Austin, 12 Allen, 482.*

Well would it be for the country if the ludicrous or preposserous character of such enactments were the worst that could be said against the Sunday bills now pending in Congress. But it is far from it. The question whether Congress shall ever enter upon acts of religious legislation. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. And its spirit and purport of it demands that nobody shall seek merely to prohibit the establishment of a national religion. Its purpose was to prohibit all legislation by Congress, on the subject of religion.—*Cooley, on the Const. Cons. 1877, p. 3.*

This, too, is in accordance with the practice of the legislative department of Congress. Over twenty years, petitions were laid before Congress, asking for the observance of Sunday mails. Hon. Richard M. Johnson, of the committee to whom the matter was referred, presented a masterly report, concurring with a resolution that the committee be discharged from any further consideration of the subject. For presenting the resolutions, Mr. Johnson said he believed that legislation upon the subject was improper, and that since time and ninety-one in a thousand were sent to that committee to Congress. It was felt by all that passing an amendment as it would have a tendency to the religious, would weaken the argument. He believed that these petitions and memorials, in relation to Sunday mails bore but on the entering wedge of a scheme to make the Government a religious instead of a social political institution. They were wholly of that religion, and the people were inclined to sign them without reflecting on the subject or the consequences which would result from the adoption of these proposals. There could be nothing more important than the interference of those great agitators. *American State Papers, 1 Journals of Congress, pp. 76, 77, 2d Session, 21st Congress, vol. 2.*

The resolution was adopted, and, for over twenty years, until the time of the war, the matter was disposed of.

Since the termination of the war, however, any further effort was made to obtain religious legislation.

But within the last ten years the desire for such legislation has increased in certain quarters until it has become almost a mania. There is a persistent and determined attempt by a class of Preachers and especially of Sunday, legislation. Old time Sunday laws are also revived, and on the basis of prosecutions, while the most desperate efforts are being made to obtain new legislation of a more sweepingly religious character. Secret organizations are seeking to have incorporated into the codes of the Inquisition except physical torture and these institutions would indicate that the exception is owing to the want of age. Of course Congress has hitherto firmly withstood all these efforts, and our first amendment has stood.

Citizens of the United States, the only body of men upon whom, under our admirable system of Government, devolves the duty of checking of liberty, insoulence, or of constitutional legislation, we appeal to you: let your voice be raised against this religio-political crusade.

Every citizen who opposes the passage of the Sunday law of the Nation, and the passage of the Sunday law of the State, bill, will apply and will write to his Senator and to his Representative in Congress. It ought to be attached to the bill making appropriations for the Columbian Exposition,—requiring the Exposition, or at least the Government exhibit, to be closed on Sunday.

Any condition of that kind, whether relating to the whole Exhibition, or only to the Government exhibit, would be subject to all the objections against religious legislation. When the Government acknowledges Sunday as a day of rest, whether closed, may well be left to those having that in charge. But it would be wrong to prescribe other particulars in regard to management, and to petition that would be merely a governmental indorsement of a certain day as the Sabbath, and thus a legislative decision of a religious question.

Constitutional law says once, and in act of Congress, as to the alleged fact, that the law can not be violated by any Power!
