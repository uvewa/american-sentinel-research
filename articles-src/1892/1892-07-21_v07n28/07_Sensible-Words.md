At the State Convention of the Prohibition Party, held at Barton Opera House, Fresno, June 2, the following resolution relative to the selling of liquor at the Columbian Exposition, and also the closing of the Fair on Sunday, was adopted:

Resolved, That we protest against the sale of liquor on the grounds of the Columbian Exposition and the opening of the Fair on Sunday.

The proceedings of the Prohibition Convention at Fresno, as fully reported in the California Prohibitionist, gives in many instances evidences of sincerity, ability and good judgment; but the above resolution is not one of them. When any set,

party, or number, of men favor dictation, by statutory law, as to how or where any American freeman shall spend any of the days of the year—Sunday included—they are going beyond the limit of personal rights and should be plainly so told. Moreover, we will wager that there is not a saloon-keeper in Chicago who will not indorse the above resolution. It is neither in good judgment or good taste, a thing we regret to see in the members of a party so earnest, so sincere as are the Prohibitionists. Moreover, ours is not a hierarchical government. It is, politically speaking, neither Christian, Jewish nor Mohammedan. It has to do with temporal affairs entirely, and those who seek to involve it in religious disputes and difficulties are not its friends.
