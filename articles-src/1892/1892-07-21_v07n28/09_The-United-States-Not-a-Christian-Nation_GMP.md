It has been said, and truthfully, that "if every man woman and child in the country were a Christian, it would then not be a Christian Nation, but a nation of Christians." Christianity is an individual, not a national, characteristic, consequently the term "Christian nation" can not with propriety be applied to any country even though every individual were perfect in character. And if the term can not appropriately be applied to a nation composed wholly of real Christians, how much less should it be applied to a nation in which comparatively few of the people are true Christians?

Let us for a moment consider a few facts bearing on this subject. The number of murders committed in 1891 was 5,906, suicides from 1882–1887, 8,226. The number in legal confinement for various offenses (to say nothing of those who would be in prison if justice were the rule instead of the exception), June 1, 1890, was as follows: In penitentiaries, 45,233; in county jails, 19,538; in juvenile reformatories, 14,846. The number of illegitimate births equaled 7 per cent. of the whole. The number of divorces granted for 20 years ending 1886, was 328,716. Defalcations and embezzlements for 13 years ending 1890 averaged $5,314,458 per year. The same for 1891 reached the vast sum of $19,720,294. Consider also the immorality and crime so prevalent, especially in the cities—the immense and numberless frauds perpetrated upon the public in every conceivable way, among which might be mentioned the adulteration of foods, quack doctors, and worthless nostrums called remedies, which in many cases are doubtless more harmful than the maladies of which they are said to be a "Sure Cure." Peruse any newspaper and note what a small amount of its space is not used to report crime, expose fraud, or for a description of something tainted more or less with immorality.

Test advertisers and see how many will live up to the letter and spirit of their agreements.

Furthermore, statistics show that this Nation (which some would call Christian) spends $372 for liquor and tobacco as often as it pays one dollar toward the support of Christian missions both home and foreign, and that $125 is spent in the same way for every dollar paid for clergymen's salaries. Does this look like exaggeration? Investigate for yourselves and compare results.

Now it is not to bring reproach upon this Nation that this article is written, nor is it an attempt to prove that it is more immoral than others, for it is not. Neither is it intended to convey the idea that there are no true Christians among us; for there are many in various denominations. The foregoing figures only express facts which no person who is well informed will attempt to gainsay. The sole object of this article is to show in a slight degree the deception in using the name "Christian" as some so blindly do.

It would be no surprise if Satan himself should term a nation of this corrupt world "Christian," hoping thereby to abase the name of Christ; but when professed Christians take a similar course they become a marvel, and it is time to enquire of what spirit they are.

To be Christian is to be like Christ, and surely none but the "Sons of Belial" who know not the Lord (1 Sam. 3:12) are so destitute of spiritual discernment as to fail to see that it would be prostituting the pure and exalted name of "Christian" to use it in this way.

And let it not be forgotten that the class whose excessive piety and good judgment (?) leads them to take the absurd position above referred to, viz.: that ours is a "Christian Nation," is the same that are suffering such intense agony of mind and spirit because they are not in a posi-

tion to force their ideas upon others, and especially the observance of the first day of the week.

The servants of Christ will be found working on a different principle. Their commission reads "Go ye therefore and teach [not force] all nations. . . . Teaching them [not compelling them] to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." Matt. 28:19, 20. "The servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those who oppose themselves." 2 Tim. 2:24, 25.
