THE Managers of the Columbian Exhibition issue each week a circular describing the preparations for the great Fair. It is noted as a strong fact that they publish all that organized bodies say in favor of opening the Exhibition on Sundays, while they say nothing of the demands for Sunday closing. This may be considered significant of the attitude of the Managers upon this subject.
