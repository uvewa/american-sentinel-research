THE editor of the Christian Patriot, Morristown, Tenn., says, "It looks now as if the American Church, and Christians, and the American Sunday had been whipped;" but he said that before the action of the Senate upon the proviso conditioning the five million appropriation on Sunday closing and the prohibition of the sale of liquor within the grounds. It looks now as if the "American Church" and the "American Sunday" had whipped themselves, and obtained only the fruitless acknowledgment by Congress of the authority of the Church, while its behets will not be obeyed at Chicago, and both the proviso and its accompanying appropriation will be scorned.
