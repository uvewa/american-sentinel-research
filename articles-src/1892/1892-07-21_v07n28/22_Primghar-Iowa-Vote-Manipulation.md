On Sunday evening, May 22, after a sermon in Primghar, Iowa, the congregation was asked to vote upon closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and excluding intoxicating liquor from the grounds. With this temperance clause the vote received quite a strong indorsement from the congregation. An editor in the place, not feeling satisfied with the result, canvassed the town the next day to find out how many were in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday,—leaving out the consideration of the temperance clause,—and out of those whom he canvassed he found fourteen in favor of closing on Sunday, and sixty-three against it.

If the managers of the Fair desire to close the great Exposition on that day, it is certainly their right and privilege to do so; but if those in the churches who are laboring to this end would not resort to such strategies to secure votes in its favor, they could have the satisfaction of dealing fairly, even if the Exposition should not be closed.
