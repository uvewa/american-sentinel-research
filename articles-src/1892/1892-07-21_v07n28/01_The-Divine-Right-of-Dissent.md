IT has long been misunderstood by the patrons of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL; it is that while laws have been, and still are, required to yield something to the majority in matters of religion, yet no such requirements ever have been, or ever can be, just. Religious belief is a matter which properly belongs only to each individual. Religion pertains to man's relationship to God, and in that man's personal knowledge of, and faith and obedience, of belief and observance to, his own God. Every man possesses the personal, individual, and inalienable right to believe for himself in religion as he chooses.

And this right of the individual to believe for himself in religious things, carries with it the same personal, individual, and inalienable right to dissent from any and every other phase of religion belief than that as held by anybody or anybody. This right is recognized and declared by Jesus Christ, not only in the words in which he has commanded every man to render to God that which is God's, which, mediatorly to Cæsar that which is Cæsar's, but likewise in the following words: "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him. The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."

The word which Christ spoke was the word of God. The one who is to judge, therefore, is God; and in the last day he will judge every man by the way in which he has acted. To this judgment the Lord Jesus refers every man who refuses to believe and rejects his words. If any man hears Christ's words and believes not, but rejects him and his words, Christ condemns him not, judges him not, but leaves him to the Judge of all, who will render to every man according to his deeds, in the last day.

In these words, the Author of Christianity, the Saviour of the world, has clearly recognized and declared the right of every man to dissent from every religious form known to mankind; and even the religion of Christ itself, being responsible only to God for the exercise of that right.

This makes every man free to believe and be saved; but he will compel none. Christ leaves every man free to receive or reject, to assent or dissent, to believe or disbelieve, just as he chooses; his responsibility is to God alone, and it is the individual who must answer for himself in the last day. "So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 14:12.

Whoever therefore presumes to exercise jurisdiction over the religious belief or observances of any man, or would compel any man to conform to the precepts of any religion, or to comply with the forms of any other certain religion; or would condemn any man for not believing or conforming—whoever would presume to do any such thing, puts himself above Jesus Christ, and usurps the place and prerogative of the "Judge of all."

Such is the doctrine of the free exercise of religion, as announced by Jesus Christ himself. And such is the doctrine upon this point that will ever be held by every true republican government on earth. This is declared and established by the Author of all true religion, the underivable, the divine, right of dissent. And such is the divine right of the freedom of religious belief.

This right, which in this country, the founders of the Government of the United States recognized this divine right as their own, and established the exercise of it as an inalienable civil right, "by refusing to treat faith as a matter of government, or as having a headship in a monarch or a State;" by excluding all religious tests; and by forbidding Congress ever to make "any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." In short, by prohibiting the law making power from making any law whatever upon the subject of religion.

The people of Tennessee adopt this teaching of the Author of the Christian Government, established in that State that divine right, as also an inalienable civil right, by declaring in the Constitution of the State that "no human power can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." But the courts of that State have nullified that provision and declare that by the laws of that State the conscientious observance of the seventh day as a day of rest by laboring on Sunday, and thus outrage the religious feelings of his neighbors.

REFERRING to the movement to secure governmental recognition of religion in the university, the *Independent* says:—

"As American citizens we may be as strict religionists as we will. But religious liberty. Our offenses can not be relaxed, nor fences from evil not be extinguished; we can not move our arm a hair breadth, the real foundation of religious liberty and the most complete separation of Church and State, if we would preserve our freedom. Some people are sufficiently far sighted enough to suppose that if religion could be introduced into our public schools by the teaching and reading of the Bible reading, something that could be done
