THE Pittsburg Dispatch thus pictures the progress of the enforcement of Sunday laws in the oil district of Pennsylvania:—

"There are now few fields in which the drill is kept moving Sunday. A few years ago such a thing as shutting down on the seventh day was not even considered by any contractor in the business. That was when the bulk of the oil was being found in the northern counties, and the wells were located at a distance from the haunts of civilization.

"When operations became active in Allegheny County, and the Blue Law bogie man came into circulation, the drillers were forced to recognize him, and follow that sage bit of advice given to the gentleman about to visit Rome. The owners were even constrained from pumping their wells on Sunday, which entailed a heavy loss to many of them, as the salt water which would accumulate by the well being allowed to stand over Sunday would necessitate pumping a day or two in order to again reach the oil."
