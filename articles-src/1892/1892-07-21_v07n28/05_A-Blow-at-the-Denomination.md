THAT the Adventists of Tennessee regard the arrest and imprisonment of their brethren in Henry County, as religious persecution, and a blow aimed at the doctrines which they hold and teach, and that they propose to meet it as such, is evident from the following article in the Advent Review and Sabbath Herald of July 5:—

"REMEMBER THEM THAT ARE IN BONDS."

This is a living commandment. Some messages have a general application; others a special application. This belongs to a time of persecution, and is addressed to those who have brethren in bonds. We have reached that time, and to us this message is addressed.

How are we to remember our brethren in bonds? — "As bound with them." "Bear ye one another's burdens."

It is but a short time since the persecution of the people of God in the nineteenth century was only a matter of faith seen but by the light of the sure word of prophetic. Now, in this matter, we are walking by sight.

How are we commanded to remember them?— "As bound with them." "Bear ye one another's burdens." What are the burdens of these brethren? Let the following quotations from recent letters from jail answer:—

We are still here in jail. We have washed it out some; and it is not so bad as it was.

Brother Tait sent ten dollars to pay for flour for brethren — and — We sent them down a barrel each to-day. But they need many things. Brother — was in poor circumstances when he came here, and brethren — and — were in the same condition. Brother — a crops need working now, and he has not a cent to have them worked with. His clothes are not very commendable. Brother — is owing for a barrel of flour which the family have just used up, and he is having to keep — out of school to do his farm work, because he hasn't means to hire any one.

This blow is not struck at these brethren as men. It is struck at those gospel truths, the possession of which is making us "a peculiar people." "The leading men in the Advent Church" were called for. Then the leading minister who is teaching that doctrine.

This has indeed a significant ring. My brother, my sister, are you a "leading"—a living, aggressive, member of Christ? Bonner? And if you are not, with a thousand times more emphasis I say, BEWARE! The Master says, "If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned." And again: "He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit."

Are any of our people so unwise as to flatter themselves that this is merely local prejudice, and they will never persecute in our State? That is but a siren song, and warned against by the Lord. The veil is too thin to blind the eyes of one who believes His prophets.

In a letter from a prominent lawyer from a city in one of the States where our people are the most numerous, the author says that persecutions are not confined to the South; that while it is not generally known, it is a fact that applications are being made there for prosecutions.

But the word of God is still plainer. (See Rev. 12: 6, 16, 17.)

All of these men now incarcerated in Paris jail have wives and children depending upon them for support. I am personally acquainted with them all at their own homes. Not one of them is able to suffer this loss of time. Some of these brethren are possessed of a humble home and a few domestic animals, while one of their number is as poor as our Master when he was here on earth. All of the earthly possessions of these brethren could not be sold for more than a few hundred dollars.

But even if they all had homes and the necessaries of life, should they then be left to bear the burdens of separation from their families and imprisonment alone? It seems to me that the only answer, either from the Bible or the heart of the child of God, is, "No, never." "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."

While there are comparatively few of our brethren in bonds, it seems to me that it is both the privilege and the duty of those who have, by the grace of God, their liberty, to furnish the wages of a farm hand for each of the families thus bereft. We can do this now, and till the number of improvements is so increased that this becomes impracticable; at which time the Lord will show us what to do.

Our brethren in bonds have been exhorted to set an example which will be worthy of the imitation of those who are to follow after them. Let us set a worthy example for others to follow when we are "cast into prison."

It will be a stain on our characters if these worthy brethren are required to take their children from school to earn bread for their families, while they are in bonds for righteousness' sake.

A. O. Tait, Battle Creek, Mich., is the proper person to whom to send the tokens of your remembrance. He will see that it is properly disbursed. Now is the time your help is needed.

These children must be educated, that they may follow in the footsteps of their fathers.

If more is sent in than is required for those families now suffering, it can be sacredly preserved for others, perhaps you and me, who are to follow after.

CHAS. L. BOTD.

This article, which is written by the president of the Tennessee River Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, should stir not only Adventists, but true Christians of every name. The principles involved are far-reaching. If liberty of conscience is to be preserved in this country, the people must be aroused to protest against such outrages as are being perpetrated against God-fearing men in Tennessee under the color and forms of civil law.
