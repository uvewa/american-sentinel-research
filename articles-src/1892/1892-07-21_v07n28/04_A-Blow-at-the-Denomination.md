THE *Adventist of Tennessee* regard the arrest, fines, and imprisonment of Seventh-day Adventists in that State. The brethren in Henry County, as religious people, citizens with foyd and toil, and men upon whom they have to report to the property as now held! It is and, if so, it states the *Sabbath Herald* of July 5:—

BRETHREN FROM THAT ARE IN BONDS.

This is a living contribution. Strangers have a general application; others a special application. These brethren have put themselves, their families, and their property into the work. We reached that fine; and to be on this measure: "Hear ye and understand." "Bear ye one another's burdens."

It is but a short time since the persecution of the Adventists in Tennessee began. The brethren there are few in number, and they are not blessed with a large amount of property. Now, in this matter, we are walking

to board with them. "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." Let the following questions now receive its attention:

This blow is not struck at these brethren as men. It is struck at these gospel truths, the possession of which has led them into these difficulties. Then the leading minister who is teaching that to those people is the one responsible for this trouble.

These brethren have not committed any crime, nor are they guilty of any wrong. They are, and are, a "scathing" — a living, aggressive, growing testimony, with a thousand times more persuasive power than what a thousand men could ever exert, that the people — "The Master of us all, who is in heaven," — does not require them to rest on Sunday. People who want to gather close, and rest more into the faith of the Sunday institution, do not want this testimony; they want it out of the way and destroyed.

Hence it is that of our people, or our friends, or our faith or our purposes, to so flatter ourselves that they will never persecute in our State! That is but the whisper of the Enemy of all our work. The fact is you in this is to blind the eye of one who is asleep. Let him awake and look for himself. Tennessee is one of the States where our people are the most numerous — and persecutions? Do we need to answer this? It is easily known; it is a fact that applications and methods will still be persecuted. This article, which is written by the president of the Tennessee River Conference, shows some knowledge of the Adventists, should not only Adventist, but true Christians everywhere, to the fact that these persecutions are far-reaching. If liberty of conscience is actually involved, as no one can deny, then people must not be accused to predict against all of them that the action of these courts against God-fearing men in Tennessee will stop with the members of that particular denomination. How these Puritans, who had bid them come, were set free. From Boston, Roger Williams further used the power that they acquired in the history, the "Sabbath law," and it is of their law in a pleasant numbered hitherto THE HISTORY.

At the Lutheran Conference held at Milwaukee, the following preamble and resolutions were adopted relative to legislation, of recent years, upon the subject of schools, which are eminently just and sensible: "'We reaffirm the position taken by us, the German Evangelical Church, for our national schools, and in the following resolution bring our views upon the several points raised in it, that the compulsory period for parochial schools are recognized as schools of the State in private schools, not as yet and in order to be approved or supervised by such State school. In the view of the general council of the body, a certain language, a that connection may be made either with the other, and we believe that any legislation which uses or that infringes upon the rights of parents in matters of education is unjust and un-American.

"'For any reason it is improper to set time for compulsory attendance to parochial schools. We desire to go on record as favoring any movement which has for its object the repeal of any law compelling us to watch the evolution of the whole matter as tending to the restoration of parental rights.'"

These resolutions do not question the propriety of compulsory education in a broader general way, nor that legislation for the general good has expressed itself. The respect of education which shall infringe upon the rights of the parent should give the pupil, in the family relation or religion its proper care.

The first request, as to what the law should not prescribe, is that all schools set no particular dates for the opening of parochial schools — or virtually of that by setting a certain time for the beginning
