THE Springfield Homestead, Springfield, Mass., thus chronicles the latest revival of provincial religion in that town:—

The most astonished man in this city, Monday, was Frank Rogers, of Green Street, when he was arrested for hoeing in his garden on Sunday. The complainant was a neighbor, Special Officer Albert Newton, with whom he was on pleasant terms, but as it appeared, Mr. Newton had determined to put a stop to Sunday labor in that neighborhood by making an awful example of somebody. The defendant admitted his Sunday work in Wednesday's police court and paid his fine of five dollars without a word, but he had something to say on his side. Mr. Rogers avers that he does not believe in Sunday labor, and has not been in the habit of performing it. For eight weeks in the spring he was without employment, and planted a large garden. After he found a situation with the Springfield Foundry Company, the weeds got the start of him, and his evenings and mornings were not long enough to enable him to conquer them, so he got up early Sunday morning and from 6:30 to 8:30 he hoed with all his might, stopping at an hour when people are up and around, for fear of giving offense to the neighbors. But to get ahead of the righteous Newton, one must get up very early in the morning,

and the sinner was caught. Inasmuch as men have performed a variety of Sunday labor in this city for years without being molested, going as far at times as sawing wood in the front yard while people were going by to church, Mr. Rogers' conscience feels better than his sense of justice.

This smacks finely of old colonial days when every man's hand was religiously against his neighbor who differed from him in precept or practice.
