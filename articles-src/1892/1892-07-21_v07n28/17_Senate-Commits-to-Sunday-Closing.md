THE Senate has committed itself deliberately to an approval of the progress of the union of religion and the State by the passage of a proviso conditioning all governmental appropriation for the World's Fair on Sunday closing; but it has not done so without being obliged to listen to pointed protests. The following is a concise expression from Mr. Turpie, of Indiana, during the last day's debate on the question as it appears in the Congressional Record:

"Mr. Turpie.—I present a petition, and ask that it be read. . . . I ask to have it read as part of my remarks. I am entitled to five minutes of remark.

"The secretary read as follows:—

To the honorable the Senate of the United States in Congress assembled:

We, the undersigned citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully but decidedly protest against the Congress of the United States committing the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation.

Mr. Turpie.—Mr. President, I presented this petition and asked that it be read because I believe that the right of petition is one that is to be observed and regarded. The minority is very few; there are only five names on this petition; but they are entitled to be heard. I do not know that the view in respect to religious matters has been, or can be, at all affected by majorities or minorities. There is one celebrated instance, at least, in which the word of the Lord was not heard in the tempest or the whirlwind, but the 'still small voice.' This may be another instance."
