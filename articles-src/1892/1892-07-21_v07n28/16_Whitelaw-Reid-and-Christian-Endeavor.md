WHITELAW REID, the candidate for the vice-presidency on the Republican ticket, sat on the platform at the great Christian Endeavor gathering in Madison Square Garden, and fraternized with the Endeavors, wearing the badge of their order. As a result of the public attention which he received in that capacity, his fellow Endeavors have formally requested him to discontinue the Sunday Tribune. Since Mr. Quay, the greatest Republican politician of them all, has struck the keynote of party politics to a psalm tune, Mr. Reid will of course find it politically profitable to discontinue his Sunday edition.
