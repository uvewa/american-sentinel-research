WHEN the Sunday ice bill was introduced in the Senate, THE SENTINEL said that before the bill was reached in its due course, the icemen and their employers would demonstrate that the legislation asked for was entirely unnecessary by ceasing to deliver ice on Sunday by mutual agreement. This has been realized. No ice is now delivered in Washington on Sunday. The bill has not yet passed the Senate, and all the reasons urged for its adoption have been shown to be groundless by the very persons who presented the bill and advocated it.
