The members of the American Federation of Labor are petitioning Congress in the following language:—

To the Congress of the United States:

The undersigned members of industrial organizations, citizens of the United States, and intending visitors to the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, respectfully request your honorable body to consider the matter of our petition.

We do not think it right or wise, even if it be allowed under our Constitution, that the United States Congress impose conditions either as to keeping open or closing on Sundays the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893.

The question touches too closely on religious observances and the rights of the individual man, and we respectfully protest against it.

A visit to the Exposition, and a view of the arts and handicrafts of the people of the world, can only tend to ennoble the visitor, enlarge his intelligence, and broaden his sympathetic nature, whether such visit be made on Sunday or any day of the week. Should the Exposition be closed on Sunday, to many of us its advantages would be entirely lost; and we respectfully submit that the deprivation would fall most heavily upon those who most need the great benefits that the Exposition is so well calculated to furnish.

We respectfully and urgently request that our petition may be granted.

And your petitioners will ever pray.

In reference to this, and indorsing it, the *Switchmen's Journal* publishes this letter:—

**AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR.**
Headquarters,
14 Clinton Place, New York.

To the Trade and Labor Unions of the United States of America:

**FELLOW-WORKERS:** A movement has been started by some well intentioned people seeking to influence Congress to order that the World's Fair at Chicago in 1893 shall be closed on Sundays.

As American citizens, as wage-workers, we maintain that Congress would exceed its powers should it undertake to legislate upon questions of this character; that the Government of the United States is non-sectarian.

As a matter of fact the days the wage-workers will have the best opportunity to visit the World's Fair will be on Sundays. A visit to the World's Fair, an examination of the product of the genius of man, can not tend to demoralize or deprave. A visit to the Exposition and a view of the arts and handicrafts of the peoples of all nations can only tend to ennoble the visitor, enlarge the sphere of his intelligence and broaden his sympathetic nature. There is no idea nor thought for the desecration of the Sabbath, but we insist that Congress shall refrain from legislating upon a subject entirely foreign to its sphere.

The tolling masses have not so much leisure time that they can afford to have this wonderful Exposition closed to them upon one of the days in the week which will best give them an opportunity to visit it. Those of our fellow-workers coming from distant cities, or even those in the City of Chicago and the surrounding parts of the country, will of necessity count Sundays as part of the time they desire to devote to visiting the Fair.

For these and many other reasons the executive counsel of the American Federation of Labor have directed the issuance of this circular and accompanying petition. We ask that you endeavor to procure the signatures of the members of your union and such other workmen as are in accord with the spirit of the circular and petition, and who are opposed to Congress closing the Fair on Sundays. The petition after being signed should be forwarded to the congressman of your district at Washington, D. C.

Earnestly hoping that all will act with earnestness and sincerity to maintain the character of our Government, and at the same time to secure the boon of an opportunity to visit the World's Fair in 1893, we are,
Fraternally yours,
**EXECUTIVE COUNCIL,**
American Federation of Labor.
**SAM'L GOMPERS,**
*President.*

It is worthy to be noticed that the tone of this petition, and the letter in its behalf to the different unions, is most considerate in that which is asked, and charitable in its reference to those whom it opposes. Those who are bringing every influence, and all the compulsion they can compass, to bear upon Congress for action to arbitrarily close the World's Fair on Sunday should observe this, and note the fact that here Congress is not asked to declare that the Exposition shall be open, but only that it shall not go outside of the proper sphere of congressional action.

The boast of the American Sabbath Union that the labor organizations are in favor of enforced Sunday closing of the Fair is, by this, proved idle; and the plea of Elliott F. Shepard, before the Committee on the World's Fair, at Washington, is shown to be specious and deceptive when he implies that the American Federation of Labor favors Sunday closing of the Fair, by act of Congress, because at its Convention in Birmingham, Ala., in 1891, it resolved "that one day's rest in seven is a moral, physical, and economical necessity; and wages are lower in those locations and countries where the seven day labor system prevails."

If such a thing can be true that the American Sabbath Union and its members can not see how those two positions can be compatible, they should undertake a little elementary mental and moral training, and develop their perceptive and discriminative faculties to a point where they will not be dominated entirely by preconceived opinion and prejudice.
