# SUNDAY CLOSING WOULD BE A CRIME AGAINST MORALITY.

It would also be a crime against morality. This is a serious charge, but I feel confident that a brief examination will sufficiently confirm it to convince all who will consider any thoughtfully, unbiased minds of its absolute truth.

What happens to those who visit the Fair closed on Sunday? First, so nearly all the hotels and boarding houses would be continually filled pews. Second, because it means that many will spend Sunday in idleness, or worse occupations, and seek the all-too-willing saloon in the neighborhoods to unite Chicago with her crimes on Sunday.

Why do the brewers want the World's Fair closed on Sunday? On its turn. Because their entire coffers of dollars will be spent by people who, having nothing else to do, will drift into the beer gardens and places where beer is sold, or into gambling dens of that city. The fact is that on Sunday the saloon and the beer garden and the World's Fair is closed. And it is also a fact, well known to all residents of the city, that gambling hells are always leagued with saloons and beer gardens. In these places are a trinity of moral death which flourish together. Every observing man knows that Sunday in rum-dominated Chicago would be like every other Sunday—to the saloon and the gambling hall. Now in not look at what the gambler knows. The brewers, with all, prejudice, for the moment, cast off as with confidence, rest in their very nature of things, the instructive and the true—these all declare that the people will learn more than they could otherwise gain from an afternoon in the company of good books. That lesson will never be forgotten. It will be a good Sunday.—The Sunday law is a way preventing those disposed to worship from doing so, no plea of rest and no rational, helpful enjoyment and education are implied; in other words, in other world's the Fair, it is fair to presume, will be well attended from an educational point of view. It will be a most enjoyable way of keeping the first day of the week, and the truth. This is universally conceded to the educational feature of the Exposition; as to visitors who attend on week days; and if hundreds of every-day week, what shall we say of Sunday, which is a day of leisure and is fine and uplifting for the working men?—and thus also for the people those who, after attending church in the morning, wish to improve themselves.
