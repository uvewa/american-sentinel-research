BE sure to read on another page of this paper the article, "The Voice of Organized Labor." It shows that the attempt to make it appear that organized labor demands the closing of the World's Fair in 1893 is in keeping with the stuffed petitions and other "pious frauds" employed in the interest of Sunday sacredness by legislative, judicial and executive action. The whole so-called American Sabbath Union movement is big with dishonesty and intimidation.
