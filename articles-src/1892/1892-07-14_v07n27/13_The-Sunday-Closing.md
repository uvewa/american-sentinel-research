**SENATOR VEST** recently presented a petition, or rather a protest, against keeping the World's Fair open on Sunday, the signers threatening to boycott each and every senator and member of the House who might vote against it. The petition was mainly signed by clergymen, and was referred to the Committee on World's Fair, Senator Vest remarking that he would vote on the question without regard to the petition or its signers. The remark was unnecessary from the senator, but was no doubt the expression of honest indignation at the means proposed to accomplish an end against which a large majority of the people protest.

In the World's Fair bill offered by Judge Lindsay in the Kentucky Senate, the Sunday closing provision was inserted by him, according to the *Capital*, "simply because the preachers of the State sent word that, unless it was done, they would use their utmost endeavors to defeat the bill."

It is written, and in a book with which the clergy should be more familiar than the laity, both as to letter and spirit, that men may not do evil that good may result; and even if it were not so written, natural justice would impel a line of conduct based upon the principle. The good, in fact, which results from wrong action, is not good in its real meaning, but simply a standard of good arbitrarily defined by a few, having power neither over the bodies of men nor over the right of free thought common to all; that species of good which is embraced in the idea that my good is good and your good unparalleled wickedness, and therein contravening every law of morals laid down by Hebrew, pagan and Christian moralists.

The right of petition is denied to no man, fortunately, in these United States, nor in any one of them, whether couched in the form of prayer or of protest; but nowhere is the right of threatening expressed or implied, and the protests to the Federal Senate and the Kentucky Senate are far worse in principle, and altogether more un-American and more dangerous to free thought and free action, within the law, than the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday could possibly be.

Happily neither Federal nor State Government is freer to one more than to another; but if legislation is to be coerced by threats, and especially by the cowardly threat of boycotting a legislator because he proposes to vote as he believes he ought to vote on questions affecting the public at large, and that method is to prevail, as it did in the Legislature, the written guarantees of civil liberty will become absolutely worthless. Legislation coerced by threat is no better than legislation purchased by bribery. The means differ, but the end and object are the same.
