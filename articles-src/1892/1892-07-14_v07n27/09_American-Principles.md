# American Principles.

The principles of American Government start with the Book of Nature, the Author of the Christian religion and the author for the religion we held possessed, the principles that underlie this subject. Here is the principle: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." That is to do, ye by which the religious policy implies, every person would be willing to allow for others to have the freedom bestowed for himself. There would be no such thing as infringing upon the right of another. There would be nothing contrary to good society, but nothing unjust in matters of religion. The rights of all would be equal.

The object of the gospel is to make men better from within, and not by force of those who would legislate in matters of conscience for any other, and this is the very object of the gospel. No person can even expect the civil power to enforce issues of religion upon another, except by persecution.

This is the only Government in all the world that recognizes this principle in the words of Christ; that of perfect separations of Church and State. The civil power has nothing to do with the subject of religion. Not even so much as to legislate a penny. As the thing is in the Bible, and all in all, so in the Government. They say unto him, "Caesar's." Then saith he unto them "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Luke 20:25. Caesar represents civil government.

Civil is defined as the relation of man to man. Religion is in the Bible throughout, the relation of man to his Maker, other things being between man and his Maker in the relation to his Maker, either proper or improper. Now mark: Religion is divine in its nature, from Heaven; and its origin is of Heaven. Therefore we can say with Jefferson, that "the legitimate powers of civil government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does no injury to my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god; it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg." They have nothing whatsoever to do with religious matters. To enforce religion, or "put it down by individual conscience, and only at the last of the time did he work."

Grant, the State, can say, and decide three thousand cases of religion—it does not know religion, it does not know religion,—does not know religion. As a State it knows nothing about it, and can neither decide which is true or which is false. Hence it must be left to the conscience of every man to decide for himself. And every man in his freedom of choice and every man in his freedom of choice as in other things are free. To grant this liberty, the foundation stones of this Government say, was their object for, in the words of Christ, yet let it be forever remembered that the Government of the United States of America, is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. This quotation is from the treaty with Tripoli Under Pres. Washington, adopted 1797. "As the treaty was framed by an American who understood the design of disproof to the Christian religion of the time, it should be taken as a correct expression of the eternal truth, that of perfect equality of all men before the law; and that one religion can not respect however or professes it. On the contrary; it was their respect for, the Constitution and the Christian religion, and forming the Constitution as it now stands."—*Politica, in The Protected American.*
