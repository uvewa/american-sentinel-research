# The Saloon Interest in Chicago.

No license to be granted to a minor.

No one person or firm to be granted more than three licenses.

No license to be granted within a major distance of a church, school house, or hospital.

The methods of the Sunday Unionists had not been any better than the methods operated by the Ku Klux of the South, or the White Caps of Indiana, "their stock in trade is not argument but innuendo."

True, White Caps writ with rolls, but Sunday Unionists, with the fist of wickedness. There is small difference mainly in their principles or methods.
