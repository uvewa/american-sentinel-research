# NATIONAL RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ASSOCIATION.

That drug stores of Manistee, Costa, have been forbidden, by the police department, to sell lager beer and water on Sunday.

The iron members of Seneca Falls, N. Y., have not been entirely willing to take sides or to sustain the closing of the World's Fair.

On July 8, Mr. Palmer, of Illinois, presented to the Sunday rest or handed resolutions presenting reasons against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday.

The authorities of Middleville, Barry County, Mich., have undertaken to enforce the Sunday laws against barbers and others, several arrests having been made.

The International Convention of Christian Association of North America, in a late meeting at Saratoga, N. Y., adopted resolutions in which its great were present, from the United States, Canada and various other lands. The resolution was divided into different sections, passed resolutions asking that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday.

Some time ago a mass meeting in favor of Sunday observance was held at Rock Island, Ill., and a test case, regarding violation of the Sunday law. In response to this the players in the nearby baseball field have given orders to arrest them for trial. The petitioners plume themselves according to the equal advantages of the law, and religion under the influence of their efforts. Their purpose is to set this law Christian or otherwise.

At the Decennial Convention at Fithsburg, Pittsburg, and Wilkinsburg of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of that section, declared himself in favor of keeping the World's Fair open to Sunday. He is stated that it is little less than fanaticism to close the gates of more than one hundred acres of that beautiful worship which is to be devoted to the art of the Exposition, with the result that thousands of laboring men are shut out who can visit each other on no other day.

The North, Minneapolis, Minn., quotes the Prohibition leader for the World's Fair Committee as saying: "My political predecessors are in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, but my own sentiment is not now in favor of keeping it open. The result of keeping it open would be that it would be of the most greatly beneficial to the morals of the crowd. Why, Chicago alone has seven thousand saloons and could well afford to pay $100,000 for every Sunday of the six months."

A TOWNSMEN branch of the American Sabbath Union has been organized at Knoxville, Tenn., from whence through are traveling throughout the State. The first paragraph of one leader reads:—

In view of the bitter and persistent efforts being made from the American Sabbath Union to state that the Christian religion of this Country, from State by State, and county by county; for the purchase of the laws against Sunday rest and the enforcement of the work while we declare our belief in the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship; and for that purpose we most respectfully ask that meetings be called in every possible center, where addresses be made, and to see each other issues of importance brought up.

The intent of this is to fan the flame already burning at Paris, Barry County, and others, while the law comes against other ordinances and defensesmen of the various districts, containing the expressions of the persecution to which Tennessee has already lent itself, would make interesting and profitable reading in connection with these leaflets of the Tennessee Sabbath Union.

Mrs. Alex. Frot, of Brainford, Conn., has recently disannexed, from his pulpit, the enforcement of Sunday observing of its parishioners. The discussion has become so heated that some of the reverend gentleman's opponents have brought him his office. Where opposition in this finds its expression in so marked that this evidence shows that it does not arise from a knowledge of the true purpose upon which it is meant from religious laws and their enforcement.

On June 30, Mr. Durborow, Chairman of the House Committee on the World's Fair, presented the House of Representatives petitions from Edward Atkins; these and others, against the Ukrainian ministers of America; and from the City of Brooklyn, and various other sources against the Western Columbian Conference of Chicago; from ministers of Buffalo, Montclair, N. J.; Karl G. Hinds, L. L. D., and twenty-six other Senators of the Work of all, praying that Congress shall refrain, from any legislation respecting Sunday.

At the semi annual meeting of the National Association of Syracuse, N. Y., held June 11, Secretary Edward Atkins said: "We have the great American Church for the future, the great American Church, the Free Protestant of all the Churches should be the acknowledged head, which Church should take hold of every part of American life. He is working in the report of the meeting to declare that this achievement was criticized in the least. When men can make such statements without being challenged, it is not too late to begin to drift of on-set of unrest toward church domination in this country."

The Christian Churches offer as a place a political platform the following:—

> "We urge in the present communication that the United States Supreme Court, whose authority is to sustain the last word of the Constitution, that: This is a 'Christian Nation,' and we hereby acknowledge our obligation as a political party.

This is one of the most explicit recognitions of the "rights of conscience and constitution sensing religion above revenue, justice above error and righteousness above and enforcement."

This is what the *Christian Statesman* publishes as the platform:—

> "Nearly three hundred barrels recently put in one place in the interest and the enforcement, closing movement. The employes can grant these petitions in a day or an hour. All of whom can purchase a rum at a price of sharing to fifteen cents by using the railroad and express company."

The Philadelphia Press is becoming bolder in its vindication, let the word and nothing out a speech that they train with its Sunday papers. Sabbath break, sabbath keep, sabbath anything—the fact is nothing but adding.—The United Presbyterian pastor of Pekin, Ill., very recently summoned Sabbath was held in that city on the first day at it was heard.—All the short stops at Long Island, N. Y., were closed last Sunday, by the orders from Superintendent Ward Gadsden and J. E. Westwood, of the Methodist body presented a petition. As Dr. Crafts at Washington thinks, do so many others at Washington now as to Sunday legislation as it has to be organized nationally.

The admission to the World's Fair will not be passed. It is interesting from the standpoint so taken as to drive the decision of Sabbath closing into the half million appropriation Sabbath closing and likely to be voted.

On the next there will be a harvest picnic by Baltimore Rock. The P. T. & A. Ry. will give as its picnic this year for the occasion, a train from Paris. The train leaves Paris at 8:45 A. M. arriving at the resort at half past nine.

The train carrying these Sunday picnics are passed within less than a hundred feet of the rod not disturbing the four Seventh-day Adventists imprisoned for quiet farm work done on Sunday. It is not unreasonable
