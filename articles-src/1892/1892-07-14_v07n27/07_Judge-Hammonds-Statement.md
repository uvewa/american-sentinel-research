THE situation in Tennessee, as stated by Judge Hammond in the case of R. M. King, is this:—

Sectarian religious belief is guaranteed by the Constitution, not in the sense argued, that King, as a Seventh-day Adventist, or some other, as a Jew, or yet another, as a Seventh-day Baptist, might set at defiance the prejudices, if you please, of other sects having control of legislation, . . . but only in the sense that he himself should not be disturbed in the practices of his creed; which is quite a different thing from saying that . . . he might disregard laws made in aid, if you choose to say so, of the religion of other sects.
