THE STATEMENT SENT OUT FIRST BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AND EXTENSIVELY COPIED BY PAPERS EVERYWHERE THAT THE STATES OF MICHIGAN AND OHIO HAD SENT IN PETITIONS FOR THE SUNDAY CLOSING OF THE WORLD'S FAIR REPRESENTING NEARLY TWO MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE THAN THEIR LATE CENSUS SHOWS TO BE IN BOTH STATES, IS DENIED UPON THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN COMMISSION. WE CREDITED THE STATEMENT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATIVE PETITIONS MAKES SUCH A RESULT POSSIBLE, AND DOES CONFESSEDLY COUNT THE SAME PERSON AS A PETITIONER AS MANY TIMES AS HE HAS MEMBERSHIP IN ORGANIZATIONS INDORSING THE PETITION.
