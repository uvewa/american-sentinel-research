THE AMERICAN SENTINEL does not insist that the World's Fair at Chicago next summer should be open on Sunday, but it does insist that it is not a proper subject of congressional action. It does insist that it is highly improper for the churches to attempt to compel the closing of the Fair either by civil law or by uncivil boycott. And it does insist that the Directors of the World's Fair Corporation have just the same right to decide this question that the Directors of a railroad have to decide whether they will run Sunday trains or not.
