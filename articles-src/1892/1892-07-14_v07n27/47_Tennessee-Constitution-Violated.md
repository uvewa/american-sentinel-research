THE Constitution of Tennessee declares that "no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship." But notwithstanding this provision of the fundamental law of the State, the courts of the State have sustained a law by which "the people of Tennessee" as Attorney Lewis puts it, "designate and point out a certain day as the Sabbath, and say that that day shall be kept holy, and that no man shall work on that day."
