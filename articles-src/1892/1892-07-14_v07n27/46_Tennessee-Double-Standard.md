IN Henry County, Tenn., work quietly done on Sunday by Seventh-day Adventists, is, according to the Attorney-General and the Grand Jury, "to the great annoyance and disturbance of the people, to the evil example of society, prejudicial to public morals and a public nuisance to the citizens of the county and against the peace and dignity of the State." But picnicking on Sunday is presumably all right, if done by people who do not observe Saturday, as do the Adventists. This conclusion would seem to be justified by the fact that the following notice appeared, on the 24th ult., in the Post-Intelligencer, the official paper of Henry County:—

On Sunday next there will be a basket picnic at Hollow Rock. The P. T. & A. Ry. will give an excursion rate of fifty cents for the round trip from Paris. The train leaves Paris at 9:45 A. M., and returning leaves Hollow Rock at 5 P. M.

The train carrying these Sunday picnickers passed within less than a hundred feet of the cell containing the four Seventh-day Adventists imprisoned for quiet farm work done on Sunday. It is not unreasonable to suppose that upon the train were some of the grand and trial jurors who indicted and convicted them. But then the picnickers were not Adventists; that makes a wide difference, it seems.
