# The Principle Wrong.

The *Democrat Times*, a Georgia Prohibition paper thinks that "there is a large class of people in the community, who have mistaken idea of the Sabbath plank in the Prohibition platform," and to whom it is due that the idea and purpose of that plank be clearly stated. "The party," it continues "firmly believes in keeping the seventh day holy,—from Saturday evening until Sunday evening, according to the custom of the Christian Sabbath; and those whose views are in accordance with this belief, are welcome. These people are largely Prohibitionists. Most of them vote and work with the Democratic Party, but they misunderstand the Sabbath plank, and I feel that it means, in some way, this interference with their rights in regard to Seventh-day keeping, having Sunday, as their Sabbath. We believe a proper explanation of the real purpose of the Sabbath plank, will aid much in satisfying them of its justice, and in removing all fears for them to vote the Prohibition ticket."

The explanation the *Times* gives is this:—

> The truth is, the Sabbath plank does not refer to the seventh day, at all. We, as a people, do not closely observe Saturday as their Sabbath. The idea and purpose of the Sabbath plank is not to enforce its observance. The idea and purpose is to be to protect our civil American Sabbath Sunday as an institution necessary to the moral and civil welfare of our large cities.

We assure our friends, it is against these seemingly harmless looking plausible sounding accommodations, that our Sabbath plank stands; and one purpose and one alone, and that is to secure to them, and it was as well the right of others here and to serve the Nation, and its civil sanctity must be considered in the great issues of the day as have been committed to us by our fathers.

It is scarcely worth while to argue against any with those who stand for Sunday. Whether or not the existing civil Sabbath laws are wrong in principle, and is sensed to them to in truth the right of the State to legislate upon religious questions. The whole matter is well illustrated by the fable of the trees and the ax.

A man made an ax-heft and coming to the trees to provide him a handle for his ax. The trees were not very careful as to what sort of a handle the man got. But when the man got from it a new handle to his ax, then he began to cut them down with it. Then it was too late, for when too late the destruction of his comrades by a mere woodcutting tool.

It is forced its desires upon those who differed by political intrigue and the sharing was the aim of civil war rather than the church work of peace.

The man who is willing that his neighbor should be compelled to keep Sunday and only he be himself free from his own obligations upon that day therefore, is a man not to be trusted. He will seize upon such questions, and therefore surrenders his and liberty and those of his opponents as well by his own influence. The man, whose authority it is to dictate conscience for one will, of course, do the same for others, and of course for himself when it serves his purpose.

Every man, be, for as civil government is concerned, has as much right to observe Sunday; and he has just as much right not to observe it as the man who to observe another day does not alter the case at all. The whole principle of religious legislation is wrong and should never be enforced in any legislation either civil or religious.
