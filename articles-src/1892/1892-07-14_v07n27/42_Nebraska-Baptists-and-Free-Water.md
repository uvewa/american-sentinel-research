THE Albion, Nebr., News reports that a few days since "Dr. Scoggin appeared before the village Board in behalf of the Baptist Church and asked the Board to donate water for lawn purposes to the Baptist Church for the ensuing year. After some deliberation the Board concluded that they had no authority to, and could not with justice to the tax payers of the village, donate water to any person or persons. Whereupon the Doctor informed the Board that inasmuch as God furnishes water free, the Board had no right to put a charge upon the same.

The Board called the attention of the Doctor to the fact that God did not pay for the pumping of the water in this case." These Nebraska Baptists are not much like their Canadian brethren who refused the benefit of the law exempting church property from taxation, and paid their taxes like other people.
