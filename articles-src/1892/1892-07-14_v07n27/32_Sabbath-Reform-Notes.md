This is what the Christian Statesman publishes as "Sabbath Reform":—

"Nearly three hundred barbers recently met in Chicago to inaugurate an 'early closing and Sunday closing movement.' The employers may grant these requests if the men form a union and agree to support a raise in price of shaving to fifteen cents by refusing to work for any one who charges less. The Philadelphia Press is becoming bolder in its violations of law and is sending out a special Sunday train with its Sunday papers. Sabbath breaking is thus spread to many a town, before quiet and law abiding. The United Presbyterian pastor of Findlay, Ohio, recently suppressed Sunday base ball in that city on the first day it was tried. All the liquor shops at Long Branch, N. J., were closed on a recent Sunday through the efforts of Rev. J. Ward Gamble and J. R. Westwood, of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Our Washington correspondent thinks, as do many others at Washington and many at Chicago, that the five million appropriation to the World's Fair will not be passed. It is therefore important to induce the Senate to put the condition of Sabbath closing into the half million appropriation now pending and likely to be voted as soon as the Chicago convention is over. Captain J. H. Wishart and the Newark Law and Order League are at least keeping up a wholesome agitation for the enforcement of the law against Sunday saloons."
