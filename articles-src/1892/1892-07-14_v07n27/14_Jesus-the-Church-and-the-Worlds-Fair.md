### JESUS AND THE CONVENTIONAL RELIGION OF HIS AGE.

One of the most certain and invariable signs of the passage of the soul or vital life from a religion, is the persistent elevation of the external which its votaries exhibit. The exterior, the form, *rite*, dogma,—in a word the shell,—is adored and extolled, as though it indeed were the real essence or being. Thus, when Jesus came with a heart song for the world, he was assailed as being a Sabbath-breaker, as a disturber of conventional religious truth, and as one who spake against the temple, which of course typed the shell of Judaism; while on the other hand, from the kindled indignation of Jesus, usually the very incarnation of gentleness and love, there flamed his most withering denunciation against those who sought to elevate the letter of the law; those who would use coercive force; those who sought to externalize religion, or join it to State or secular power. To the charge that he was a Sabbath-breaker he replied, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath;" a great truth which religious bigotry in all ages has sought to obscure. Upon those who endeavored to hide the poverty of religion in their souls with long prayers, broad phylacteries, and religious ostentation, Jesus pronounced his terrible woes and denunciations. In a word, the one central truth which the great Nazarene, by word, precept, and life, strove to impress upon the hearts of all who should in after ages follow him, was that *religion, as he understood and taught it*, was a lamp for the illumination and salvation of each soul, and not a torch to literally or figuratively kindle fagots around those whose inner consciousness did not respond to the law of love he taught and lived. "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," carries by implication a command of solemn and weighty import. It clearly discourages any attempt at a union of Church and State; and in this, and other teachings which no less solemnly impress these thoughts, the splendid foresight of the great Master is strikingly emphasized. For wherever and whenever the Church has defied the injunction to keep pure and unspotted from the world, and has succeeded in uniting with the secular, religion has been debased, the supreme right of liberty of conscience has been outraged, persecutions have flourished, and not infrequently the State has been, through this alliance, transformed from a just protector of her children to an insane monster, who glutted her religio-political appetite on the richest and purest blood of the ages. That Jesus foresaw this result is probable, and hence he so strenuously discouraged everything which exalted the letter over the spirit of pure and undefiled religion, which must ever be the soul of love, toleration, compassion, mercy, and divine justice; and by divine justice we must not imagine the insane and brutal barbarity which has, during a savage past, masqueraded under the mantle of divine equity.

In the days of Jesus, the orthodox or conventional religion of Judea was a body without a soul. The fire and love of earlier days had gone out; materialism had penetrated its vitals; and with that blind, instinctive consciousness, which would make a wounded lion roar to terrify the approaching hunter, conventional theology elevated the law, and assailed all who in any degree set aside the form or outward observances of the Church. And here is a fact worth remembering: a religion which has become autocratic, always seeks the aid of coercive force, asking the succor of the secular arm. Furthermore, she always seeks to parade her piety, as in the case of Judaism in the days of Jesus, when she whitened the exterior of the sepulchre and cleansed the outside of the cup and platter. It was so in the Grecian world in the days of Socrates. It was so in Asia Minor when Christianity was first being proclaimed. "Great is Diana" became the slogan which preceded a persecution in Ephesus. It was so in Rome when the head of the empire, as has been observed, was at once emperor, priest, and atheist. And it was so after the early Church began to stifle the voicing of the soul in deference to the power, wealth, and viciousness of a soulless, secular spirit. So much for the attitude of Jesus in reference to the externalization of religion, or the union of Church and State. I next wish to notice how, when, and where SUNDAY LAWS originated, as there seems to be so much confusion of thought on this subject. Some devout people seem to imagine that Christians are still under the old Mosaic law,—which never applied to Sunday,—and which made it a capital offence to even gather sticks on the Sabbath. Others seem to think that Jesus or the Primitive Church sanctioned by precept or example the union of Church and State, or the right of the people to dictate to the State, or the right of the Church to dictate to the State how people who do not accept the teachings of the Church shall conduct themselves. Hence a brief glance at the origin and rise of Sunday laws may be helpful before we notice the problem with its special bearing upon the present agitation.

FIRST SUNDAY LAWS.

Says Neander in his "History of the Christian Religion": "One of the first, if not the very first, of the laws secured by the bishops in behalf of the Church, was enacted about A. D. 314, ordering that on Friday and on Sunday 'there should be a suspension of business at the courts and in other civil offices, so that these days might be devoted with less interruption to the purposes of devotion.'"

It is well just here to note the degradation of the Church before she had come to the point where she sought any favor from or alliance with the secular powers. I quote from Eusebius, who, in describing the condition of the churches immediately prior to the Diocletian persecutions, declares that "Prelates were inveighing against prelates, people were rising up against people, and hypocrisy and dissimulation had arisen to the greatest height of malignity." The edict secured from Constantine in 314 or thereabouts, ordering the suspension of business in the courts and civil offices on Friday and Sunday, was what would now be termed the entering wedge for iniquitous religious legislation; legislation which, without question, checked the progress of European civilization centuries by exiling free inquiry, outlawing science, manacling thought, placing a premium on credulity and hypocrisy, and destroying the noblest, purest, and most truly regal natures of the succeeding ages. When theologians or other classes succeed in securing an entering wedge, they are much like the proverbial lion who tastes blood, they become insatiable; hence, we soon find the bishops again importunting the sun-worshiping, Apollo-loving, pseudo-Christian Emperor Constantine for more laws. The royal pagan, while desiring the aid of the now powerful clergy, was not prepared to cast aside the god to whom he had made burnt offerings in 308* and for whom he had ever entertained more affection than for any other deity in the Pantheon; hence, in his famous edict of 321 (which marked in a startling manner the union of Church and State in precisely the manner inferentially forbidden by the founder of Christianity), we find the emperor employing the following significant language: "On the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country, however, persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits, because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for grain sowing or for vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations, the bounty of heaven should be lost."

This was the most signal victory won by the new Christian hierarchy in its efforts to destroy the religion comprehended, emphasized, and taught by Jesus, and for the substitution of a new paganism, moulded after the fashion of the prevailing religions of earlier times; and from that day we find the pure, simple life religion, established by Jesus, which was so well nigh formless and riteless, lost in the pageantry of a mongrel politico-religious system, in which the paganism of Rome and Greece was blended with the ritualistic fancies of ancient Judaism. It will further be observed that this first comprehensive Sunday law did not in any way recognize Christianity; it was Apollo's day, the venerable day of the sun, of which the emperor spoke. On this point Milman observes: "The rescript commanding the celebration of the Christian Sabbath bears no allusion to its peculiar sanctity as a Christian institution. It is the day of the sun which is to be observed by the general veneration. But the believer in the new paganism, of which the solar worship was the characteristic, might acquiesce without scruple in the sanctity of the first day of the week." No references were made to the Judaistic law or the risen Lord. It was a law passed largely to please the worldly minded and ambitious clergy of the new Christian theocracy, but to all intents and purposes it was a recognition of the ancient sun worship; hence, Duray, in his history of Rome, well observes: "A law of the year 321 ordered tribunals, shops, and workshops to be closed on the day of the sun, and he [Constantine] sent to the legions, to be recited upon that day, a form of prayer which could have been employed by a worshiper of Mithra, or Serapis, or of Apollo, quite as well as by a Christian believer. This was the official sanction of the old custom of addressing a prayer to the rising sun. In determining what days should be regarded as holy, and in the composition of a prayer for national use, Constantine exercised one of the rights belonging to him as Pontifex Maximus, and it caused no surprise that he should do this."

I have cited these facts because they throw some light on the first Sunday laws, asked for by an ambitious, worldly, and arrogant priesthood, and granted by the great Pagan-Christian emperor, who courted the Church and praised Apollo. From the fulsome flattery exchanged by the emperor and the bishops during this time, it is evident, however, that each understood the wishes of the other, and each had a well defined object in view, which Draper thus aptly expresses in his "Intellectual Development of Europe": "It was the aim of Constantine to make theology a branch of politics. It was the aim of every bishop in the empire to make politics a branch of theology."

Sunday legislation is directly opposed to the genius of primitive Christianity. It is an insult to Jesus, as it runs counter to the spirit of his positive teaching. It is a pagan after-thought; it is an attempt to raise the letter at the expense of the spirit of true religion. It displays the supremacy of the carnal or worldly minded over the spiritual, and in it he who runs may read the shrivelling of the soul of true religion.

HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF.

Many tactics now being resorted to by organized conservatism are singularly like those employed by the corrupt and ambitious bishops in the days of Constantine, and still more relentlessly pushed by the Church in later times, when, after having sold her birthright of love and purity for civil power, she sought to make all men obey her arbitrary commands. Take, for example, the recent extraordinary action of an organized body of pietists who sought to make the success of the World's Fair conditional upon the Government's acquiescence in their peculiar views of what ought to be, regardless of the wishes of the people. This, while it violates the letter and spirit of the teachings of Christianity, is in perfect keeping with the acts of worldly bishops in the days of Constantine and his successors. The same spirit which fathered all the ferocious persecutions of the Middle Ages is exhibited in the recent efforts of the Church idolaters, as, for example, the attempt to boycott congressmen into obeying their wish. Below I give a recent editorial from the Boston Daily Globe, as it embraces in a few lines a graphic statement of the disgraceful wire pulling of an organized minority.

A flood of small petitions and memorials is rolling in upon Congress demanding that all appropriations of the Government in aid of the Chicago World's Fair shall be made with the proviso that the Fair shall not be opened on Sundays.

So bold and dictatorial are some of these memorials that Senator Vest was constrained to rise in his seat, last week, and protest that they practically amounted to political blackmail. In many cases they are accompanied by the threat that any member of Congress who shall vote any aid or appropriation for the Columbian Exposition, except with the Sabbatarian proviso, will be systematically boycotted at the polls by the denominational constituencies cited in the memorials.

Whatever may be the merits of this question, especially as it relates to the sale of intoxicating beverages, it is after all a question of expediency and the public morals. Congressmen should be allowed to vote according to their judgment and consciences. Attempts at coercion of any kind savor too much of bigotry and vindictiveness.

These memorials are usually addressed to congressmen who stand on doubtful ground in the matter of a re-election. The evident intent is coercion, backed by threats of all sorts of political pains and penalties. This device would seem very natural for political and secular organizations; but as an attempt to over-ride conscience and moral judgments on the part of people ostentatiously claiming to be religious, it is not a little open to criticism.

If the opening of the World's Fair meant the closing of the churches, so that those who desired to attend religious services would be prevented from so doing, the plea of those who assume that they have a monopoly of truth, and who wish to make all who think otherwise bend to their conception, might carry some force. But the opening of the World's Fair does not in any degree interfere with the liberty of those who wish to attend public service; they have all the opportunities they could have otherwise. Hence the question resolves itself into whether or not an intolerant and bigoted monopoly who want to make every one do as they do, shall control matters on this important matter. It is the old spirit of coercion revamped and pressed with the same tenacity which characterized the actions of the Church in the days of the Inquisition.

THE CHURCH AND THE SALOON MARSHALLED UNDER ONE BANNER.

I now wish to notice one or two points relevant to this much mooted problem. The conflict of the present hour is unique in that, for the first time in history, we find the clergy and the runseillers banded together in a common cause. While conference, synod, and council of clergymen are busily engaged in passing resolutions, and while a systematic effort to boycott congressmen is being carried on within the sacred precincts of the church, the brewers, with equal activity, are working for the same end. A short time since, Rev. Dr. A. H. Henry, of the DeKalb Methodist Episcopal Church, vexed and startled a meeting in Chicago, called under the auspices of the American Sabbath Union, by giving publicity to a piece of news not intended for circulation in church circles, as will be seen from the following letter which I republish from THE AMERICAN SENTINEL: "Dr. Henry created a sensation and fore-shadowed his position by declaring that he had seen a circular letter issued by the Beer Brewer's Association, instructing its agents to work for Sunday closing at the Fair, that the opportunity for the sale of beer might be increased."

Strange, indeed, is this spectacle! The temple and the gutter marshalling their forces to prevent thousands of people enjoying the instruction and pure pleasure offered by the great industrial Fair. The Church and the saloon, one loud with threats, the other silent, but no less active; one actuated by a desire to show her external power, the other by greed for gain; one representing organized conservatism, bent on showing the world how all-powerful the ancient edicts of the pagan-Christian Constantine are in the Republic of to-day; the other representing the power of unscrupulous avarice and unlimited wealth. Surely the toiling thousands, whose hope of seeing the World's Exposition hangs upon the Sunday opening, have small chance in this day when the glorious old-time American independence is exchanged for cringing sycophancy which bows before ancient thought, and when gold exerts such a marvelous power in politics. And this leads me to note the insincerity manifested in the past few years by the American Sabbath Union in its favorite role of special friend of the workingman. When endeavoring to prevent the publication of Sunday newspapers, this dangerous and un-American body has appealed to the laborers and labor organizations for support, on the grounds that the laborer should have one day of rest for enjoyment and improvement. But now, when an opportunity is to be offered which rarely comes twice in the lifetime of a toiler, which would fill the tired, aching heart with joy, and enrich the mind with useful knowledge, an opportunity to see the world in miniature, carrying with it great educational value, this same organization is found laboring as zealously as the Chicago saloons to prevent tens of thousands of people from enjoying this splendid treat; for the fact must not be overlooked that Sunday is the only day of the week when tens of thousands of working men and women will have an opportunity to enjoy the Fair. The plea advanced that the employees should have one day of rest would have force if it were not coupled with the insistence that that day be Sunday; but the demand that a special day be observed, and that day the only day in seven on which hundreds of thousands of other working people could possibly attend, reveals most palpably the true inwardness of those persons who would deceive the working masses into the belief that they are their special friends, the shallowness of the pretense is apparent to the dullest observer. If they were sincere in seeking the closing of the Fair one day in the week for the simple purpose of giving the attaches of the Exposition a day of rest, they would be ready to unite with those who are so ably advocating following the example of France and closing the Fair on Monday, as this would give the employees the one day of rest, while it would also allow tens of thousands to enjoy the wonderful sights and be benefited by this unequalled opportunity to see the world in miniature who otherwise would be deprived of this important education and beneficent recreation. Moreover, the receipts would be immensely increased by this arrangement, as Mondays at expositions are always blue days, sparsely attended; while Sunday, for the reason given above, would be one of the heaviest, if not the heaviest, day of the week. Finally, closing on Monday would enable the scrubbers to cleanse the grounds and clean the machinery. It will also be observed that no one need attend who does not wish to do so. The pleas advanced by the members of the Sabbath Union do not carry the ring of an honest solicitude for the laboring people, when they would, by their provision, rule out thousands of laboring men, women, and girls from the privilege of enjoying the Exposition, to where they would secure rest for one attache.

Honesty and sincerity are as pleasing when found among gentlemen of the cloth as among those who have less opportunity to study ethics, and the position of the leaders of the American Sabbath Union does not savor of either honesty or sincerity. The closing of the World's Fair would be a crime against the poor.

SUNDAY CLOSING WOULD BE A CRIME AGAINST MORALITY.

It would also be a crime against morality. This is a serious charge, but I feel confident that a brief examination of the facts will convince any thoughtful and unbiased mind of its absolute truth.

Why do the churches want the World's Fair closed on Sunday? First, to as nearly as possible force people to occupy their scantily filled pews. Second, because it is a step in the well-laid plan on the part of the ultra-religionists to unite Church and State and re-establish a Christian theocracy.

Why do the brewers want the World's Fair closed on Sunday? To turn into their coffers millions of dollars which will be spent by people who, having nothing to do and no place to go, will frequent or hunt out places where liquor is sold, provided the Fair is closed. And it is also a well known fact that the brothels and the gambling hells are always leagued with any effort made by the saloon; for they are a trinity of moral death which flourish together; and the closing of the Fair on Sunday in rum-dominated Chicago would mean a harvest for the saloon, the brothel, and the gambling hell. Now let us look at the problem squarely, honestly, and with all prejudice, for the moment, cast aside. First, the World's Fair will, in the very nature of things, be instructive and therefore valuable. The millions who attend will learn more than they could otherwise gain from years of reading or months of travel, and what they learn will never be forgotten. It will be a place where, without injuring or in any way preventing those disposed to worship God in churches, millions of people can obtain helpful enjoyment and enduring instruction. In other words, the effect of the Fair, it is fair to presume, will be of immense value from an educational point of view. It will be a most enjoyable way of learning great, glorious, and vital truths. This is universally conceded to be the influence expected to be exerted by it on visitors who attend on week days; and if beneficent on week days, what shall we say of Sunday? Will not the influence be as fine and uplifting for those who do not wish to attend church, or those who, after attending church in the morning, wish to improve themselves in the afternoon? Close the World's Fair, and what will be the inevitable result? *The Sabbath Union, the saloon, the brothel, and the gambling hell will have triumphed.* There will be hundreds of thousands of strangers in the great city with nothing to do. If it is fair to judge results by those seen in our great cities to-day, it will be easy to say which of the two great powers will reap the richest harvest. The ministry to-day in all great metropolitan centres have so lost their power on the people that they can no longer fill the pews. I received less than three weeks ago, a letter from a leading orthodox minister of Boston, which contains the following frank, but mournful confession:—

*The churches have all they can do to keep alive. They have no religion to spare. There is scarcely a church where religious truth is the central attraction.* We ministers must conjure by the social principle and by amusing, lecturing to the audience in an engaging manner, or we have empty pews. Look at the topics we advertise. I do not believe twenty thousand persons, different individuals, attend morning or evening services on any Sunday in Boston.

Now the saloon makes no such complaint; the only cause of complaint made by the liquor power is that there are not more licenses granted to saloon keepers; and in our great cities, save at brief intervals when a spasm of virtue thrills the people, the Sunday ordinances which prohibit the opening of saloons on Sunday are dead letters. And this is specially true of cities like Chicago, where the saloon power rules the city with almost autocratic sway. Let us look at the facts as given in some startling statements and vivid pictures by the author of "Chicago's Dark Places," a Christian writer who spent months in carefully collecting facts and data for his work:—

It is an astonishing fact that in Chicago alone there are about five thousand six hundred saloons. Place these side by side, and on each side of the roadway, giving each saloon a width of twenty-five feet, and you would have one vast street of saloons reaching over ten miles in extent. . . . Let us look at a few figures in regard to the saloon interest in this city. Our estimates are carefully made, and we are prepared to verify and defend them if challenged. For the year ending March 1, 1891, the expenditure for beer in this city alone was not less than forty million dollars! The population is about one million two hundred thousand. This gives an average expenditure, for beer alone, of thirty-three dollars and twenty-five cents for every man, woman and child in Chicago, and these results are gained after the most conservative figuring. This would give over fifty-three gallons of beer to be consumed by each man, woman, and child in the city. . . . Now, if Chicago's expenditure for beer only amounts to forty million dollars, we may safely say that for all kinds of intoxicating beverages, including wines and distilled liquors, Chicago spent last year upwards of eighty millions of dollars. Is there any limit to the great good that could come to the city with this amount expended in proper channels? . . . Take the directory and see what a vast difference there is in the number of other businesses in Chicago, compared with this great saloon business, whose chief products are drunken men and women, whoremongers, prostitutes, murderers, thieves, trumps, bums, vagabonds, ward politicians, and general all-around scoundrels. And yet this is the business we allow to exist in our midst because, forsooth, we can't find just the men we want to represent us in politics. Why don't the sensible, intelligent men of this city sink every other interest in the effort to crush out of existence this vile and demoralizing business, and then, whilst we don't believe the millennium would dawn on Chicago, we are sure that so much wretchedness and poverty would disappear as to make it a heaven to many whose existence in it now is a continual hell.

How strong the saloon power is in politics in Chicago may be gained by accusing the following from the same author:—

That the saloon interest in Chicago is opposed to law, order, and the due protection of its citizens, is proven most conclusively by the action of the saloon men, when, under Mr. Onahan's collectively an attempt was made to pass an ordinance in which the following points were sought to be secured:

1. No license to be granted a saloon to locate within two hundred feet of any school, church, or hospital.

2. No one person or firm to be granted more than one saloon license.

3. No licenses should be granted unless a majority of the property owners of the block gave their consent.

4. No minor should be served with liquor, even for home consumption, unless by written request of parent or guardian.

Strong speeches were made on the side of this ordinance [which included other good points], but the saloon element defeated it. The *Tribune* and other papers spoke highly in its favor, but that didn't alter the votes of the seven brewers or saloon keepers in the council, who themselves violated parliamentary law by voting on a resolution that directly affected their business.

A still further glimpse of the power of the saloon in Chicago will be seen by noting one statement further, from the author above mentioned:—

On State Street for instance, from Van Buren to the Twelfth Street viaduct, there are sixty-six saloons. On Van Buren, from State to Fifth Avenue, twenty-two. On Fourth Avenue, in two blocks, there are twenty-five. On Dearborn Street, twenty-five within two blocks. On Madison Street from State Street to Halstead, there are seventy-three. On Clark, from Polk to Van Buren, two blocks, fifty-two. On Cottage Grove Avenue, from 39th to 22d, sixty-two. On Wabsah Avenue, from 23rd to Jackson Street, thirty-five. On Halstead, from Lake to Blue Island Avenue, seventy-six. Now these are merely given as samples. The districts have not been specially chosen. There may be other places equally bad, or worse. If any reader will sit and calmly contemplate what this fearful array of saloons—pestiferous distributers of moral, mental, and physical ruin—really means, he will find such cause for genuine alarm as to lead him, at least, to try and do something to crush the whole saloon system. We have shown that there are five thousand six hundred saloons in this city. Look at the power in politics such figures represent. Each saloon will average three votes—one for the proprietor and two for assistants—three in all. This gives a total voting power of sixteen thousand eight hundred. Sixteen thousand eight hundred votes cast as the vote of one man, for one purpose, and that purpose the protection of the saloon.

It was necessary to cite the above facts to show two things, first, that the power of the saloon in the Prairie City is so great that it controls politics, and secondly, that Sunday closing means millions of dollars to the saloon and an untold and indescribable sea of debauchery, degradation, and crime which otherwise would not disgrace Sundays. The saloon knows that for every dollar spent to secure the closing of the World's Fair, hundreds, if not thousands will flow into the coffers of the liquor traffic; while the other two members of the trinity of night, the brothel and the gambling hell, will be correspondingly benefited. The Church expects to gain a few more auditors for one or two hours in the twenty-four and also the prestige of having a governmental recognition, even in an indirect way, of Constantine's edict. *But what shall we say of the cost to morality which will inevitably follow the triumph of this unhallowed alliance?* Many have been the crimes against humanity and morality committed in Christianity's name for which apologists vainly seek for excuse. Shall we add one more to the list simply at the behests of an organized minority?

I consider the Government of the United States as interdicted from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline or exercises.—*Thomas Jefferson.*
