The branch of the Christian Endeavor which has in charge the question of closing the World's Fair on Sunday met in the Marble Collegiate Church on the afternoon of July 9, and after some discussion and mild opposition by a few, adopted this resolution:—

"Resolved, That the people assembled here today respectfully petition the authorities having the matter in charge to prevent the opening of the Columbian Fair on Sundays, believing that if such action is not taken a vast multitude of the American people, particularly such as hold the Biblical code of morals, would find it in conscience impossible to attend or lend countenance to the Fair, and that this action be transmitted instantly to the congressional session."
