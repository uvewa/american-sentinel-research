# The Voice of Organized Labor.

The members of the American Federation of Labor are petitioning Congress in the following language:—

*To the Congress of the United States:*

> The undersigned members of industrial organizations of the United States most respectfully present to you that, whereas, there is a Bill before Congress to close the World's Fair at Chicago in 1893, respectfully request your honor not to pass any law upon the subject that is not in accordance with the principles embraced under our Constitution, that the United States Government shall not establish any religious creed, or religion, or any sect, or any law giving to any person, or class, or creed, or religion, the control of legislation, and that no religious influences, directly or indirectly, ever be used in the law-making body of the United States; for we believe in the separation of Church and State, the sacredness and the rights of the individual man, for which this great Government was founded; and we also believe that millions of men, women and hundreds of the people of the world, can not be benefited in any way by closing the gates, and besides its sympathetic nature, and to many of us its advantages would be a benefit and a credit to our country, and which we most need the great benefits that the Exposition will give to the laboring class.

We respectfully and urgently request that our prayer be granted.

*In the Trade and Labor Unions of the United States of America. Headquarters, New York.*

The trades unions will use unprejudiced people forces on the question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair at Chicago, Ill., 1893. American citizens, as wage workers, as a class, as having the most vital interests at stake, to undertake to legislate upon questions of this kind will do for the Intervention of the United States.

As a matter of fact the days the wage workers need most for recreation and education is Sunday. An examination of the product of the genius of the world's inventions, in their annual visit to the Exposition and a view of the arts and sciences taught by the Exposition of the world, broadens intelligence and broadens its sympathetic nature of the working class. Their employers shall refrain from legislating upon a subject we believe should remain open.

The unions of New Jersey have asked that the members of Congress who live in New Jersey and the nearby districts will give working men one day in a week which will best give them an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of the Fair. These with the millions of the people of New York, Brooklyn, and the surrounding parts of the country, will afford to say that Sunday would be the best day to devote to visiting the Fair.

We respectfully and urgently request the executives and such worker as such as we in the unions of this city to direct the courses of this great and useful industry and such other workers as are in accord with the spirit of this direction and purpose.
