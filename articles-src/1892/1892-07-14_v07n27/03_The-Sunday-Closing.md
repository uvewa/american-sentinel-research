# The Sunday Closing.

SENATOR BLAIR recently presented a petition, or rather a petition against keeping the World's Fair open on Sunday, the one, threatening to cut off aid, sent to every senator and member of the House who could vote against it. The petition was mainly signed by clergymen, and referred to the endeavor to close the World's Fair, Senator Blair remarking that the World's Fair was to the question, without reference to the man who sent the petition, was not the remark was unnecessary from the senator, and the occasion showed once more that legislation and the means proposed to accomplish its purposes are the feelings of the majority of the people protest.

In the same connection a bill offered by Judge Lindsay in the Kentucky Senate, which has been championed and pushed by him, according to the *Capitol*, "simply becomes the prayer of a number of people that, unless it was done, they would use their utmost endeavor to defeat the bill."

It is written, and in a book which also represents this spirit, that the kingdom of the laity, both as to letter and spirit, that the voice of the people should not be set aside; and even if it were not so written, the common laws of society are not in that short based upon the principle. The good, in fact, which results from wrong action, is not good in the real meaning, but merely a standard of good obtained by a few, having power neither over the bodies of men nor over the right of free thought common to all that speaks not the voice of God. We believe that not only is good and your good and my good dependent upon our rights of traveling every law of morals that deals with us as individuals, yet with religious matters too.

The right of petition is denied to no man, nor to any class of men, still less is it, nor is any one of them, whether scouted or approved, to be disregarded. But nowhere in the right of threatening either House of Congress with legislation, the Federal Senate and the Kentucky Senate should bear no relation to the people, and they should neither be willing to practically force Congress to make something that turns un-American and more dangerous to free thought and free action, within a law, that the opening of the World's Fair should by closing carry forward in it.

Happily neither Federal nor State Governments are as freer to do one thing than another; if it legislation is to be coerced by threatened reprisals, if, too, by the shrewd threat of boycotting a legislator because he proposes to vote as he has believed was at large and that and be invited to prevail, as all the Sunday-closing advocates now threaten, the exercise of civil liberty will become almost impossible in this country; and the threat is no better than that legislation itself, no better than that of a religious test. The end and object are the same.—*Ken.*
