# They Smite with the Fist of Wickedness.

Some time ago the *Los Angeles Churchman* published an article criticising the aims and methods of the American Sabbath Union, and advising its readers to read THE AMERICAN SENTINEL to learn the real object of the Union. A champion of that organization replied as follows:—

Dr. T. W. Haskins, editor of the *Churchman*, *Los Angeles*, in his last issue, makes an uncalled-for attack on the American Sabbath Union. He merely asserts that it is in the wrong, but does not give any reason for his opinion.

He requests his readers to procure for themselves copies of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL in order to find out what are the objects and aims of the American Sabbath Union.

We shall expect the good Doctor on next Sunday, at the close of his sermon, before he takes off his robes, to say to the people of his parish that they must send at once for Ingersoll's "Lectures," and Paine's "Age of Reason," in order to understand the teaching of the Bible, and have a clear conception of the aims and objects of Christianity. It would be exactly the same logic. If the editor of the *Churchman* were honest in his desire to have his readers informed us to the objects of the American Sabbath Union, he would suggest to them to send to one of our offices, get a copy of our constitution, and procure some of our literature.

But he wants them to misunderstand, and therefore requests them to send for copies of a publication that is filled with misinterpretations and downright falsehoods.

When the editor of the *Churchman* comes out in a manly way and makes an argument against the American Sabbath Union and its work, we shall be ready to reply, but can see nothing to answer in his groundless and empty assertions.

Since the above was written we have learned that the *Churchman* was not a success and will be discontinued.

But the energetic Doctor is determined to have a paper and has started a new one in which he proposes to play second fiddle to THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, and in this he will doubtless succeed.

To this Dr. Haskins makes the following dignified reply, which does him credit as a gentleman and a Christian:—

When an applicant for assistance abuses you for not responding to his appeal you may be sure of his unworthiness. When the advocate of a cause does the same for differing with him you have good ground for suspecting the truth and righteousness of his cause.

The spots of the leopard, the fangs of the serpent, the iron hand of the persecutor, are all manifest in the above article.

We have not attacked the American Sabbath Union without good reason. We stated our opinion that we did not believe in its issues, aims, or methods; that its principles were based on error, were unchristian and un-American, and we gave numerous extracts, in the same issue, of the opinions of others, containing the arguments and reasons therefor.

We have seen a good deal of the literature of the American Sabbath Union. Everybody has. It is forced upon you in season and out of season, from the pulpit, the press, the canvasser, the special agents. It would be absurd, if we differed with it, to recommend its literature. If there were another side to the question, the public would like to know where to find it. We told the public where to find it. Is there anything unfair in that? We have seen and read THE AMERICAN SENTINEL for three years, and have yet to find a more dispassionate, logical, truthful, fair-minded, generous advocate for a cause which it believes to be true and vital to the welfare of both country and Church, than that organ. We shall continue to recommend it and to encourage its circulation for the reasons already stated, whether it is called playing second or third fiddle. This we do voluntarily, impelled simply by a conviction of the truth of the cause, without any solicitation on the part of the editors or proprietors of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, with whom we have no personal acquaintance, and have had no correspondence; neither do we agree with the Seventh-day Adventists in their view of the obligation of the Sabbath (the seventh day) in this age of grace.

If misguided opponents see fit to class us with Ingersoll and Paine for presuming to differ with them on Sunday legislation, they must take the consequences of their judgment. We prefer, in this position, to share the ignominy of the Saviour and the apostles, than to partake of the triumph (so called) of the Church a few centuries later when it forced its decrees upon those who differed by political intrigue and the strong arm of civil authority exerted by banishment, torture, and death.

The writer of the above article must have been aware, if he saw our paper, that it has not been discontinued and another one started. To better express the special cause which it advocates, and to free it from the imputation of being an organ of the Episcopal Church, it was thought best to designate the paper by a name which could hardly be misunderstood. Whether it will be a success or not we do not know. If not, we shall not be the first martyr for a cause. But we are certain that it will not seek to secure success by flattering and tickling the vanity of prominent people in Church or State by inserting their faces and puffing their doctrines, and then pinning a placard on their coats, "A friend of our cause."

The methods of the Sunday Unionists are not one whit better than the *modus operandi* of the Ku Klux of the South, or the White Caps of Indiana. Their stock in trade is not argument but innendo. The White Caps smite with rods, the Sunday Unionists, "with the fist of wickedness." There is small difference either in their principles or methods.
