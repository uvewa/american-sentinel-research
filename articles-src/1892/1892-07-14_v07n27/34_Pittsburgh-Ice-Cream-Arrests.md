Law and Order agent McClure is again at work in Pittsburg arresting petty dealers for selling on Sunday; his last achievement is the arrest and fining of nine Italians for dealing in ice cream on Sunday. If Agent McClure and the Pittsburg preachers are so anxious to enforce law and order they now have a good opportunity, without going far from home, or wasting their energies on newsboys and Italian ice cream vendors; they should offer their services to the Carnegie Steel Company and their ex-employees as experts in the enforcement of law and order. What is the value of such men and such an organization if not for just such exigencies as this?
