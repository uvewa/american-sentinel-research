Rev. Mr. Ives, of Stratford, Conn., has earnestly championed, from his pulpit, the enforcement of strict Sunday laws, but not all of his parishioners are of the same mind. The discussion has become so heated that some of the reverend gentleman's opponents have hung him in effigy. Where opposition finds its expression in such methods it is conclusive evidence that it does not arise from a knowledge of the true principle upon which dissent from religious laws and their enforcement should be based.
