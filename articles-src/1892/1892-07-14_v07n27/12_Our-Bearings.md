# Our Bearings.

In 1560, Bunyan entered Bedfordshire on to serve a twelve years' sentence of "jail," and he was working in contrary to law, and was imprisoned.

"May the king's" court, June 7, 1796, in the case of Rupertus Kelly, a Jew. Also James Childs, were cast to jail, the pronouncement was made:—

"May it please your Courtships, those are his convictions; and this law under which they cut not meet a man upon the road and as much against stealing as it was to cut down his throat." In May, 1892, in the State of Tennessee, in the United States of America, four men are committed to the work-house of Henry County, because Sunday was the Christian Sabbath, and having worked on Sunday, did so guilty? Following their usual avocations on the day of the week. They were charged with working on Sunday; tried and convicted in a court of law; fined one dollar each; also in seven's worth, day; and filled there by the judge of that court; and sent to jail. They finally taken out. "These are not criminals against Sunday labor, and they have violated no law of the state save this. And the jury who brought in the verdict, knew it also." And they knew that they would cheerfully treat every one of them as their own neighbor.

"These men are now lying in a Tennessee jail in the year of grace 1892."

Where are we anyhow? In the United States of America! and the year of our Lord, 1892! And these men kept Sunday. Men and boys hunt, fish, and play ball and no one molests them; but the grand jury, and other protectors of society are elsewhere.

Well our hate in the Tennessee court now is, these men who are at most as much guilty of Sunday work as of Saturday work, and they are seventh-day observers, a Christian Sabbath. We commemorate the creation of our Lord Sabbath, and upon the first day of the week. But we would not in its ordinary and legal sense, tolerate no injustice. Religious intolerance of plowing green grass upon that day. For a law lived every man his equal in race; and to every personal and free exercise of his own religious convictions which should ever move the hearts of men.

Our own personal and free exercise of that right that under our Constitution should be a subject of legal coercion.—*Editorial in Oberlin Gazette, Oberlin, Ohio.*
