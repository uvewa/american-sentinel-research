# They Smite with the Fist of Wickedness.

Some time ago the *Los Angeles Churchman* published an article criticising the aims and methods of the American Sabbath Union, and advising its readers to read THE AMERICAN SENTINEL to learn the real object of the Union. A champion of the organization has filed the following:—

T. W. Haskins, editor of the *Churchman*, Los Angeles, in his last issue, makes an editorial in which he has acknowledged and gives reasons and statements without giving any reason for his opinion.

We are not able to secure possession of his own statements, nor to learn what are the objects and aims of our contest.

We shall expect the good Doctor on next Sunday, July 17, to deliver a sermon against Sunday laws and urge his congregation to attend at once and send in for papers for Ingersoll's "Lectures," and "American Sentinel," for they alone can give the correct understanding of the aims and objects of Christianity. It would be interesting to know on what ground the *Churchman* were bound in his desire to have the sabbath day, as they observe it, to be kept open that day. Will he be kind enough to send to one of our offices, get a copy of our Constitution of the United States, and send it to us, or give us his own explanation of the above text? We further requests them to send for copies of a publication that never was heard of before in organized Sabbath fellowship.

When the enemies of the *Churchman* comes in and speaks in the same Christian spirit as the American Sabbath Union and its work, we shall be content and know that we have what our work endeavors.

Since the above was written we have learned through the press that the good Doctor is now in his last sermon somewhat advanced.

We find the energetic Doctor is determined to have a good time of it; and nothing can now persuade us to propose to play second fiddle to THE AMERICAN SENTINEL who has in her own dignified manner refused to be a slave.

To this Dr. Haskins makes the following spirited reply, which does him credit both as a gentleman said a Christian:—

"No! the American Sabbath Union is thoroughly unprincipled. I must confess that on first recognizing it to be supposed you may be sure of that on first sight. But its principles appear in the practice of threats and menaces and they are not a good ground for suspecting the truth and righteousness of its methods.

We have not attacked the American Sabbath Union, as you very well know. We have simply called in question, and do still call in question, the methods, that its principles were based on error, that its methods are those of cowards. I do not say this in the way of anger. We have seen the publications of others, containing the arguments and the records of this Union.

We have seen a good deal of the literature of the Union in the name of all that is sensible I have asked the public, the press, the ratepayer, the special class, whoever they may be to consider, with an effort, and to look at the question from both sides of the question, the public would like to know whether the Sabbath has been really observed. Is there anything unfair in that? We have a right to express and maintain our opinions as to methods and principles. If we are not honest, truthful, fair-minded, generous advocate of the old Sunday institution, they will decline to discuss the question at all with our religious organ. We shall continue to recommend it and to take our stand as to what it claims, and we thus stand, whether it is called playing second or third fiddle to this, that or the other paper. Our position in this matter, as before, is open, and independent of any admiration on the part of the editors or proprietors of other papers. We do very much object, however, to the imputation that we are the enemy of the Christian Sabbath: neither do we agree with the Seventh-day Adventist that Saturday, and not Sunday, is the Sabbath (the seventh day) in this age of grace. But in one thing we do agree with them and that is in opposing unjust and oppressive legislation, and when it comes to them on Sunday legislation, they must take this with the apostles, from the standpoint of the word and the apostles, then to partake of the triumph or partake of the like's crown continues on its way.
