THE attempt to enforce religious externals by civil coercion is no less iniquitous to-day than in that day when the Master, with the majesty and grandeur of a righteous indignation, denounced those who sought, by the requirement of outward observances and adornment, to make the sepulchre of a dead devotion acceptable to God. Those who are really the servants of God know that it is a living devotion only which is their reasonable service, and this only will they render. The attempt to compel religious fealty to the civil law will bear the same fruit now that it always has. The Arena will not be a party to the crime and the impiety about to be committed in Christianity's name. Are there not others to protest?
