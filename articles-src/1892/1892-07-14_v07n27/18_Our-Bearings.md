IN 1660, Bunyan entered Bedford jail to serve a twelve years sentence for "teaching men to worship contrary to law," and for "upholding meetings contrary to the laws of the king." June 4, 1768, in Virginia, John Waller, Louis Craig and James Childs, were sent to jail, the prosecuting attorney having sustained the plea, "May it please your Courtships, these men are great disturbers of the peace; they can not meet a man upon the road but they must ram a passage of scripture down his throat." In May, 1893, in the State of Tennessee, United States of America, four men are committed to jail because they devoutly believed that the seventh day was the Christian Sabbath, and, having worshiped on that day, they quietly "followed their usual avocations" on the first day of the week. They were farmers, who rested and worshiped God on the seventh day, and tilled their land on the other six days. The prosecuting attorney said, "These are not criminals, but sober, honest men; but we have a law against Sunday labor, and they have violated it, and must be punished." One of the jury who brought in the verdict, "Guilty," said, "Those men are honest. I would cheerfully trust every one of them to guard $10,000. Not a cent would be lost." These men are now lying in a Tennessee jail along with criminals of all colors. Where are we anyhow? In the same State and county, saloons, railway trains and mills run unmolested every Sunday. Men and boys hunt, fish, and play ball, without hurting the feelings of the grand jury, and other protectors of the peace.

We doff our hats in the Tennessee court room, and meekly ask: *Are these men so much guilty of Sunday work as of Saturday worship?* We profoundly believe in a Christian Sabbath. We commemorate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the first day of the week. But we would not imprison his disciples for either plucking or plowing grain upon that day. Peter with his sword may capture an ear; but a loving gospel will capture and hold ever more the hearts of men. . . . A day of rest should be provided, but a man's own personal and free exercise of conscientious privilege or duty should not be a subject of legal coercion.—*Editorial in Church Bulletin, Chicago.*
