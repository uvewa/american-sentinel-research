The Wisconsin State Journal has the following:—

"Through a proclamation from the mayor of Stoughton, T. C. Lund, the Sabbath was duly observed at that place Sunday. Business of all kinds was suspended on penalty of arrest, as well as amusements of all kinds; even news agents were not allowed to sell the Sunday papers. People who forgot to get their bread and meat on Saturday night went hungry. The other faction, to retaliate, have circulated a numerously signed petition, which will be presented to the mayor for his action, prohibiting the ringing of church bells and loud and boisterous talking in the pulpit; also the loud peal of the organ, as they claim it disturbs the peace and dignity of the city."
