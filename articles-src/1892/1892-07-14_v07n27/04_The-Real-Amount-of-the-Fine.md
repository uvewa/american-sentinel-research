IN ORDER TO PRESENT THE MATTER IN THE WORST POSSIBLE LIGHT THE MISCALLED CHRISTIAN STATESMAN MENTIONED ONLY THE ONE DOLLAR FINE, EVIDENTLY DESIGNING TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT BY THE PAYMENT OF ONE DOLLAR EACH, THE CONVICTED MEN COULD HAVE KEPT OUT OF PRISON. THE FACT IS THAT WHILE THE NOMINAL FINE WAS ONE DOLLAR EACH, THE FINE IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE IN EACH DOCKETED CASE IS FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THREE STATE FUNDS, MAKING A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO THE NOMINAL FINE. THIS WITH SOME TEN DOLLARS COSTS IN EACH CASE MADE OVER TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS THAT EACH OF THESE ADVENTISTS WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPelled TO PAY AS A PRICE OF HIS LIBERTY.
