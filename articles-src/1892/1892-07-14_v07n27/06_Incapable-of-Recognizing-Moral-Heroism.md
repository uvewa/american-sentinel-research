IN MISREPRESENTING THESE ADVENTISTS AS IT DOES, THE STATESMAN shows that it is utterly incapable of appreciating or of even recognizing moral heroism. The Statesman can, parrot-like, laud the heroes of past ages who surrendered their physical liberty and even laid down their lives rather than surrender their soul-liberty, but it can not recognize the same principle in a small and unpopular minority—"one seventh of one per cent.," as the Statesman sneeringly puts it.
