In the Senate, July 9, Matthew Quay, representing the Sunday politics of the Nation, moved to insert in the sundry civil bill a proviso requiring the closing of the Exposition on Sunday. As a sufficient reason for its adoption he sent to the clerk, to be read to the Senate, the Bible, open at the fourth commandment. Mr. Morgan, of Alabama, commented with biting sarcasm on the manner of the presentation of the proviso and the incongruity of its assumed religious character with that of its advocate; saying, also, that the Government had "acquired no jurisdiction by virtue of the aid it had given to prescribe laws to the people of Chicago on the observance of the Sabbath, or any other similar question."
