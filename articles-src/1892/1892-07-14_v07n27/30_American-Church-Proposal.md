At the semi-monthly meeting of the Ministerial Association of Syracuse, N. Y., held June 13, Rev. Charles Ferguson said "that he believed in one organic Church for the future, the great American Church, of which the President of the United States should be the acknowledged head, which Church should take hold of every phase of American life." There is nothing in the report of the meeting to indicate that this statement was criticised in the least. When men can make such statements without being challenged, is it not an indication of the drift of our times toward church domination in State affairs?
