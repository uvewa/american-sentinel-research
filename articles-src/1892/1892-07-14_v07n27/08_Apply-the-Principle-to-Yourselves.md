NOW LET THE EDITORS OF THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN apply this principle in their own cases. One of them at least is, we believe, a Presbyterian. As such he believes that sprinkling is the proper mode of baptism, and doubtless both the editors so hold. They also believe in baptizing infants. Now suppose they lived in a State were Baptists had control of legislation. And suppose that the Baptists should make a law requiring everybody on arriving at a certain age to submit to immersion. Would the editors of the Statesman meekly bow to such a law? Would they pay fines imposed for disregarding the law, even if it did not forbid them to practice sprinkling? Certainly not, unless they are governed entirely by policy, and regard the State as God.
