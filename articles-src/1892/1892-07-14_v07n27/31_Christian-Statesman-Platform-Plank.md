The Christian Statesman offers as a plank for a political platform the following:—

"We rejoice in the recent unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court, whose authority is only second to that of the Constitution, that 'THIS IS A CHRISTIAN NATION,' and we heartily acknowledge our obligation as a political party, and as parts of a civil Government, while respecting rights of conscience and separating Church and State, to obey the laws of Christ, setting religion above revenue, justice above spoils, in all our political campaigning, and in the enactment and enforcement of law."
