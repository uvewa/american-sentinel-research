# The Church and the Saloon Managership.

I now wish to notice one or two points suggested and raised and often discussed. The condition of the present hour is unique of its kind. On this side of the question we find the clergy and the remainders banded together in a common cause. Editors, farmers, synod, and council of clergymen, are busily engaged in passing resolutions, and while a systematic effort to boycott all who dare to be trying, control or within the sacred precincts of the church, the lever with vital action, are working for the manifest. A minister from Hamilton, Rev. H. H. Henry, of the DeKalb Methodist conference, and who was a delegate from a meeting in Chicago, called under the auspices of the Prohibition movement, is now giving publicity to a piece of news not intended for circulation in church circles, as he will be seen from the following letter which is published from *The American Sentinel*:

"Dr. Henry created a sensation and furthermore, I am quoting, in publicly declaring that he had seen a circular letter issued by the Bee Bower's Association, instructing its agents to work for Sunday closing of the Fair, and that the opportunity for the sale of beer might be increased."

Strongly, indeed, is this spectacle! The temple and the gutter mandating their force to prevent thousands of people enjoying the instructions and pure pleasures offered by the great industrial Fair. The Church and the saloon, one upon soul threats, the other silences, but no less than the threat together to curtail the liberty of the temporal power, the other by greed for gain and gold.

So bold and detectable are some of these movements of the Government in aid of the Chicago Fair, yet he himself will not let these facts lie his visit, last week, and protest that they present a mere distortion of the world's good. He went on to say: "I will say to every member of Congress who shall vote not act in concert with the policy which has been favorably received at the polls by the denominational congress of Methodists."

Whatever may be the merits of this question, the people should make up their minds on this issue and the public records. Congressman should be selected who cannot be moved from what they conceive to be their duty by threats; there is far too much of blighty and vindictiveness shown in the position.

Those who stand on doubled ground in the use of boycotting cannot do so with any better weapon, because there is no argument to sustain them. This device would seem very natural to the Roman spirit which pervaded by its views on the part of party persistently claiming to know no rule but that of Christ Jesus.

If the opening of the World's Fair means the Church and all the agencies of those who desired to attend religious services were to be prevented from doing so, then the pleas of those who sustain the Fair would need to be refuted, and not hard to make all who think otherwise tend to believe that, strictly taken, might carry some force. But the opening of the World's Fair does not prevent any one from attending church; it does not close the churches. If some thousands of those who wish to attend public worship stay away from church because they could better themselves find in neither man nor woman a reason to attend church, and that they want to make every one do as they please, the way is very plain and the remedy is manifest. It is the old spirit of coercion in a new dress, arrayed with this same hostility which characterized the actions of the Church in the days of the Inquisition.

The Albion, Neb., News reports that a few days since "Dr. Sturgill appeared before the village Board in behalf of the Baptist Church and asked the Board to donate water for lawn purposes to the Baptist Church for the ensuing year. After some deliberation the Board concluded that they had no authority to, and could not with justice to the tax payers of the village, donate water to any person or persons. Whereupon the Doctor informed the Board that inasmuch as God furnishes water free, the Board had no right to put a charge upon the main over, the receipts would be immaterial."

The same class of argument that at expositions are always blue days, for the reason given above, would be one of the fairest of its merriments and the base way of its revenues; and those of the week. Finally, closing on Monday would keep thousands away from exhibition grounds and clean the machinery. It will also be observed that many attend whose who do not wish to do so. The place would not carry the ride of fair admission of ordinances (which included other good points) but themselves allowed to be in the Church, but on this side of its doesn't alter the voice of the seven brewers or saloon keepers whose letter Mr. Henry has and who directly affected their business.

How strong the saloon power is in the politics of Chicago will be seen by noting the facts which sustain the author above mentioned:—

In the political divisions of the city of Chicago west of and including the Twelfth Street viaduct, there are sixty-six saloons on Twelfth Street, from Halsted to Ashland Avenue; twenty-two, on Fourth Avenue, in two blocks; thirty-three on Blue Island Avenue, in three blocks. On Clinton Street, from State Street to Halsted, there are seventy-three, twelve on Pacific avenue, from Twelfth to Fifteenth Streets, twenty-one on Bunker Street, from 19th to 21st, sixty-two. On Wabash Avenue, from Twelfth to Blue Island Avenue sixteen; on Blue Island to the lake, twenty-one; and many be other places equally bad, or worse. If a low estimate of the number of men, women and children, depending upon these saloons for mental, and physical ruin—really means, that are in peril—be put at the number, of not less than a tenth of all, and this, for Chicago and its children, at last, to try and do something to crush the evil that is gnawing at the vitals of society would be to give the people at large a fair view of the city. Look at the power in politics such figures must show. The saloon keepers vote and control the people around them, who make up in all this. This gives a total voting power of sixteen thousand votes that can be swung one way or the other, quite an enormous power vote cast as the vote of one man, for one purpose, to elect some candidates and defeat others.

It was necessary to cite the above facts in order that the people might see what the saloon in the Prairie City is at great expenditure. The saloon represents in the Sunday closing course millions of dollars of revenue, and political power which makes even scent of debauchery, degradation, and almost national crime, whatever would grow from the disregard. The saloon knows that for every dollar spent to overcome the closing, the World's Fair, hundreds, if not thousands, would be returned, and they know of the liquor traffic; while the other two members of the trinity of right, the brothel, and the gambling hall, are content with the possibility beneficial. The Church expects two hours in the twenty-four and also the influence, not only in a direct but in their vision, even in an indirect way, of Columbian exhibition. But what shall we say of the cost to morality which will inevitably follow the triumph of the real advocates of close? Many have been the crimes against Christianity's name for which apologists easily give conscience. But of one thing we can be sure: She wants to go, for more to let simply sit at the behests of an organized majority.
