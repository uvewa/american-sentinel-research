The World's Fair Committee of the Senate has decided to report the five million appropriation for the World's Fair as an amendment to the sundry civil appropriation bill, and attach a proviso conditioning the appropriation upon Sunday closing of the Fair. Senator Pettigrew, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the World's Fair, is reported by a correspondent of the Mail and Express as saying that he would not vote a dollar for the World's Fair unless it was closed on Sunday. It is probably mainly through his insistence that this proviso is to be incorporated into the bill.
