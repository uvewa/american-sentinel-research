A Tennessee branch of the American Sabbath Union has been organized at Knoxville, Tenn., from whence they are sending out literature through the State. The first paragraph of one leaflet reads:—

In view of the bitter and persistent efforts being made to break down the American Sunday, or Lord's day, it has seemed best to the various Sabbath associations that they unite in a national society, and proceed to organize the whole country, State by State, and county by county, for the purpose set forth in the third article of the Constitution of this Union, viz: "To preserve the Christian Sabbath as a day of rest and worship; and for that purpose to gather and diffuse information, to publish documents, to use the press, to cause public addresses to be made, and to use such other means as shall be expedient and proper."

The intent of this is to fan the flame already burning at Paris, Henry County, and incite a similar course against other inoffensive and defenseless men. The numbers of THE SENTINEL containing accounts of the persecutions to which Tennessee has already lent itself, would make interesting and profitable reading in connection with these leaflets of the Tennessee Sabbath Union.
