The North, Minneapolis, Minn., quotes the President of the World's Fair Commission as saying: "My religious profilections are in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, but my common sense argues in favor of keeping it open. The result of keeping the Fair open Sundays as well as week days will be greatly beneficial to the morals of the crowd. Why, the saloons and houses of questionable repute could well afford to pay $200,000 for every Sunday that the Fair is closed."
