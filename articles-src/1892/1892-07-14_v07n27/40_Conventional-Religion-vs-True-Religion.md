THE conventional religion of human invention, and the religion of Jesus Christ, pure and undefiled, the truth of God, without alloy, as he taught it, have ever been, and ever will be, at variance; this the Arena cogently and concisely shows to be no less true now when the slogan is, "Great is the venerable day of the sun," than when the rallying cry was, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians." As the one preceded a persecution so will the other.
