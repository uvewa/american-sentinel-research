LET it not be forgotten that the House of Representatives, by a vote of 143 to 35, decided that the Government exhibits at the World's Fair at Chicago should not be opened on Sunday, but by a vote of 74 to 94 refused to provide that liquor should not be sold in the Government buildings. Is not this a confirmation of that which THE SENTINEL has so often said, namely, that the Sunday movement is not in the interest of temperance?
