THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS FROM THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN, OF JUNE 4:—

THE CHRISTIAN NATION ACCUSES THE EDITORS OF THE CHRISTIAN STATESMAN OF BEING VOTERS (ITALICS IN ORIGINAL) AND OF FAVORING "BAILOT REFORM." WE PLEAD QUILTY AND HOPE FOR MERCY. RECENTLY WE DEFENDED THE COVENANTER'S RIGHT NOT TO VOTE, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE COVENANTERS ARE GENERALLY REPRESENTED BY THE NATION EDITOR WHEN HE REFUSES TO RESPECT OUR RIGHT TO VOTE. THE NATION EDITOR BELIEVES IN THE KINGSHIP OF CHRIST, BUT ONLY WITH A COVENANTER PREMIER, AND SO WOULD HAVE COVENANTERS WITHDRAW FROM UNION WORK IN THE NATIONAL REFORM ASSOCIATION. SUCH PERSONS ARE THE WORST ENEMIES OF NATIONAL REFORM AND OF THE COVENANTER CHURCH.

THOUGH NOT INTENDED, THIS PARAGRAPH FROM THE STATESMAN CONTAINS AN IMPORTANT admission, namely, that if Christ is king there must be a premier. It is not pretended that Christ is to reign in person, as a result of the adoption of the National Reform scheme, but only that the government will be administered in his name and in accordance with his law. Of course there must in that event be a premier, or a vicegerent of the Son of God. Why may he not as well be a Covenanter as a Presbyterian, or a Methodist, or even some colorless sort of an individual ready to be any or all of these for power? Or why not be satisfied with the Pope who has for centuries styled himself, *Vicarius filii Dei*, "Vicegerent of the Son of God"? Is there room in the world for two popes?
