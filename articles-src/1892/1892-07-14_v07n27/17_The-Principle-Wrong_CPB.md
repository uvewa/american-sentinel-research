THE Demorest *Times*, a Georgia Prohibition paper thinks that "there is a large class of people in this country, who have a mistaken idea of the Sabbath plank in the Prohibition platform; and to whom it is due that the idea and purpose of that plank should be fully explained." "It is," continues the *Times*, "that class who honestly believe in keeping the seventh, instead of the first day of the week, as the Christian Sabbath; and whose views are entitled to all consideration and respect. These people are largely Prohibitionists, and many of them incline to the Prohibition Party; but they misunderstand the Sabbath plank, and fear that it means, in some way, the interference with their rights in regard to keeping Saturday, instead of Sunday, as their Sabbath. We believe a proper explanation of the purport of our Sabbath plank, will aid much in satisfying those people, and in clearing the way for them to vote the Prohibition ticket."

The explanation which the *Times* given is on this wise:—

The truth is, the Sabbath plank does not refer in any way to them, or any one else, who conscientiously observe Saturday as their Sabbath. The greatest pains has been taken to indicate its purpose to be to protect our civil American Sabbath from the foreign beer garden and saloon debauchery that is fast making it a disgrace and terror in many of our large cities.

We say then, to our friends, it is against those enemies, the saloon and the beer garden with their attending concomitants, that our Sabbath plank is aimed. We respect the people's right to worship God on Saturday, and will guard that right as sacredly as we will the right of others to worship on Sunday. But the American civil Sabbath belongs to the Nation, and its civil sanctity must be preserved if we would keep inviolate, and transmit, unimpaired, to posterity, the sacred trust that has been committed to us by our fathers.

The explanation does not mend matters any with those who stand for right. The trouble is that all so-called civil Sabbath laws are wrong in principle, and to assent to them is to grant the right of the State to legislate upon religious questions. The whole subject is well illustrated by the fable of the trees and the ax:

> A man came into a forest, and made a petition to the trees to provide him a handle for his axe. The trees consented to his request, and gave him a young ash tree. No sooner had the man fitted from it a new handle to his ax, than he began to use it, and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest. An old oak, lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said to a neighboring cedar, "The first step has lost us all. If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained our own privileges, and have stood for ages."

The man who is willing that his neighbor should be compelled to keep Sunday if only he himself is left free to follow his own inclinations upon that day thereby admits the right of the State to legislate upon such questions, and therefore surrenders his soul-liberty; for whatever freedom of conscience he exercises is by sufferance of the State, whose authority in such matters he has acknowledged for others, and of course for himself when it shall see fit to dictate to him.

Every man has, so far as civil government is concerned, an inalienable right to observe Sunday; and he has just as much right not to observe it; and the fact that he observes another day does not alter the case at all. The whole principle of religious legislation is wrong and should be opposed by every lover of liberty either civil or religious.
