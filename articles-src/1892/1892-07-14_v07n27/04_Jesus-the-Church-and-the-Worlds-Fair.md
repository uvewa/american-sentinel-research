# Jesus, the Church, and the World's Fair.

One of the most certain and invariable facts is that the religion which derives its life from a religion, is the persistent assertion of the exercise of the science which its volunteer exhibits.

The exterior, the form, the ritual, the dogma, is a word, the all of that religion, whether it be true or false. It is beyond all real essence or thing. But, then, when Jesus was upon earth, he was recognized and was assailed as being a Sabbath-breaker, and as one who disregarded the Jewish tradition, or as one who spoke against the faith, and as a blasphemer, and as one who perverted the claims of Judaism; while on the other hand, from the Jewish kindliness of heart, Jesus was virtually the very incarnation of gentleness and kindly consideration for the wants of the people. He was the embodiment of discrimination against those who violated the letter of the divine law. He also knew our concerns finer; those who sought to exterminate religion, or "put it down by law," were the Jewish authorities. Now we see a Sabbath-breaker he replied, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath;" a great truth which religious legislators have not yet learned. Religion, upon those who endeavored to folds the power of religion over his teachings by prayers, broad phylacteries, and religious ostentation, Jesus pronounced his bitterest woes and denunciations. In a word, the one Christ with whom the religion of Jesus, by word, precept, and life, strove to be, for the benefit of mankind, and how, in after ages follow him, was that religion, or, for undertaking to enforce a religious observance upon men by power.

The conventional religions of human institutions, and the religion of Jesus Christ, pure and undefiled, the truth of God, although today, as he taught it, have ever been, and not yet, at variance, this the *Arena* cogently and concisely shows to be no less true when the Bible says, "than when the rallying cry was, 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians.'" As to the probability, first, that persecution will be produced as a persecution so will the admission, namely, that if Christ is king then the world must be a province. It is not pretended that Christ is to reign in person, as a result of the adoption of the National Reform scheme, but only that the government will be administered to his name and in accordance with his law. Of course those to that must then be a practice, or a vicegerent of the Son of God. Why may it not be as well be set down with all hyperbolics, or a Methodist, or even some colored sect or an individualist ready to be of any title of the power? "But are they to be intrusted with the 'by power has for establishing and enforcing the law of the vicegerent of the Son of God?'" Is there room in the world for two popes?

The attempt to enforce religious externals by civil coercion is as to be as unchristian to-day in this age as it was in the days of Jesus, when he was the Master, with the majesty and grandeur of a righteous indignation, denounced those who sought, by the requirement of outward observance and adornment, to make the sepulchre of a dead devotion, acceptable to God. Those who are really in the servants of God know that it is a living God, whose only vehicle is their reasonable service, and who only they render. Furthermore, she always seeks the aid of coercive power to enforce in the days of Jesus, when she whitened the outside of the sepulchre and decorated the outside of the cup and platter. It was as it was in Asia Minor when Christianity became almost entirely an outward form. It was so in Asia Minor when Christianity became the religion which preceded to persecute its followers. It was so in Rome when the head of the empire, at his best, assumed to direct the conscience, priest, and control the body of each communicant. It was the Church began to stifle the voicing of the individual conscience with the rack and the viciousness of a smiling, secular force. So much for the attitudes of Jesus to the enterprise to the externalization of religion, for the union of Church and State. I next wish to notice how, when, and where Sinbad was actually done, as there seems to be so much confusion of thought on this subject. Some devout people seem to imagine that Christians are still under the Moses law—which never applied to Gentiles or to the Church of Christ. Primitive Church sanctioned by precept or example, either enforced by the Church, or the right of the people to dictate to the State, or the right of the Church to dictate to the State how people who do not accept the teachings of the Church shall conduct themselves. In Jesus a brief glance at the outset and rise of Sunday laws may be helpful before we notice the problem of the special bearing upon the present agitation.
