The principles of American Government agree with the Book of books. The Author of the Christian religion has given, in language too plain to be misunderstood, the principles that underlie this subject. Hear him: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." This settles the whole question of religious legislation. If all would observe this rule, every person would be willing to allow to another the same freedom he claims for himself. There would be no such thing as infringing upon the rights of another. There would be no such thing as religious legislation, coercion in matters of religion. The rights of conscience would be respected.

The object of the gospel is to make men free, in the highest sense of the word; but those who would legislate in matters of religion, would, by so doing, defeat the very object of the gospel. No person can ever appeal to the civil power to enforce his ideas of religion upon another, except by totally ignoring the Golden Rule.

This is the only Government in all the world that is formed in harmony with the words of Christ: that of perfect separation of Church and State. The Pharisees come seeking to entangle him in his talk. He asks for a penny. As they bring it he says: "Whose image and superscription hath it?" They say unto him "Cæsar's." Now hear his answer: "Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar's, and unto God the things which be God's." Luke 20:25. Cæsar represents civil governments.

Civil is defined as the relation of man to his fellow man or the State. Religion is the relation of man to his Maker, either in obedience or disobedience to the divine law. Now mark: Religion is of divine origin. It has the image and superscription of Heaven. Therefore we can not render religion or religious homage to Cæsar. Cæsar, civil governments, can of right have nothing whatever to do with it. Religion is purely a matter of the individual conscience, and only at the bar of God can a man be made to answer for his faith.

Cæsar, the State, can not decide questions of religion—it does not know religion. As it knows nothing about religion, it can neither decide which is true or false. Hence it must be left to the conscience of every man to decide for himself alone, and all the State can do, is to protect every man in his freedom of choice as to his mode of worship. Thus it is true that the principles of civil and religious liberty, the foundation stones of this Government, are in perfect accord with the words of Christ, yet let it be forever remembered that "the Government of the United States of America, is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion." This quotation is from the treaty with Tripoli, under Geo. Washington, made in 1797. As the treaty was framed by an ex-Congregational minister there was no design of disrespect to the Christian religion. It was but the statement of an eternal truth, that of perfect equality of all and every person before the law, without respect to creed or profession. On the contrary, it was their respect for the Christian religion, that led to this declaration, and forming the Constitution as it is, thus taking religion out of the hands of the State.—*Publius, in The Protestant American.*
