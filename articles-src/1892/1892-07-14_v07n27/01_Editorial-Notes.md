A UNION of religion and the State is only another name for Church and State. It is a distinction without a difference.

As yet the *Christian Statesman* has spoken concerning the imprisonment of Adventists in Tennessee, but only to misrepresent the persecuted and to justify the persecution.

With characteristic shallowness and in utter disregard of the published facts, the *Statesman* says of the imprisoned Adventists that "for the sake of arousing sympathy, they refused to pay their fines and went to jail."

In order to present the matter in the worst possible light the miserable *Christian Statesman* misrepresents, only in a definite form, evidently designed to give the impression, that by the payment of one dollar, the convicted men could have kept out of prison. The fact is that while the nominal fine was one dollar only, the amount imposed by the statute in each case was a fee of one dollar for each of three State funds, making a total of fifteen dollars in addition to the nominal fine. This with ten dollars' costs in each case made over twenty-five dollars that each of these Adventists would have been compelled to pay as a price of his liberty.

But it was not the amount of the fine and costs that caused these men to go to jail; it was the principle involved. Neither was it, as the *Statesman* wickedly asserts, merely sympathy. They could not conscientiously pay fines imposed upon them for obeying a God-given command. This fact had been repeatedly published in THE SENTINEL, so that the *Statesman* is without excuse in making the statement that it does.

In misrepresenting these Adventists as it does, the *Statesman* shows that it is utterly incapable of appreciating or of even recognizing moral heroism. The *Statesman* can, parrot-like, laud the heroes of past ages who surrendered their physical liberty and even laid down their lives rather than surrender their soul-liberty; but it can not recognize the same principle in a small and unpopular minority—"a seventh of one per cent," as the *Statesman* sneeringly puts it.

The situation in Tennessee, as stated by Judge Hammond in the case of B. M. King, is this:—

> Conscientious belief is guaranteed to be free by our Constitution, and in the same argument, King, or yet another, as a Seventh-day Baptist, may be acknowledged as in the exercise of one of those beliefs so guaranteed; and in determining what is or is not a nuisance, the question of intent is of the very essence of the offense, and he himself should not be disturbed in the practices of the creed; which is a different thing entirely from a rule that a magistrate's dangerous laws made is null, if you choose to do it on religious belief alone.

Now let the editors of the *Christian Statesman* apply this principle in their own cases. One of them, at least, is, we believe, a Presbyterian. As such he must believe that sprinkling is the proper mode of baptism, and doubtless holds the editors as bold. They also believe in baptizing infants. Now suppose they lived in a State under Baptist control of legislation. And suppose that the Baptists should make a law requiring everybody on arriving at a certain age to submit to immersion. Would the editors of the *Statesman* meekly bow to such a law? Would they pay fines imposed for disregarding the law, even if it did not forbid them to practice sprinkling?

The following paragraph is from the *Christian Statesman*, of June 23, 1892:—

> The *Christian Nation* accuses some of the members of the National Reform Association of being more zealous about civil laws for the enforcement of Christian morality, to restrain vice, to protect purity and hope for mercy. Recently besides, it says, there are some among those who do not believe Conversions are generally repentable. The question is in the judgment of men about right or rights to vote. The *Nation* salutes believers for the Kingdom. Not just only with a Coercing prayer, and we would have Conversions withdrawn from works in the Illustrated *Sentinel*. Such papers are the worst enemies of National Reform and of the Covenant Church.

Though not intended, this paragraph governed entirely by policy, and regard the State as God.

It was for this very principle that thousands of the early Christian martyrs laid down their lives. They were left free to worship the true God, but were required to show respect to the prevailing religion to the extent of throwing a pinch of incense into the fire in honor of Jupiter, but they went to the stake rather than do it, just as the Tennessee Adventists go to jail, and would doubtless face death itself, rather than prove disloyal to their convictions of duty toward God. "Christianity is not a religion of convenience, but of principles."

The Statement sent out first by the *Advance* of Chicago and extensively copied by papers everywhere that the States of Michigan and Ohio had sent in petitions for the Sunday closing of the World's Fair representing nearly two millions more people than their fair quotas shows to be in both States, is denied upon the authority of the Secretary of the World's Columbian Commission. It is denied, because the system of representative petitions makes such a result possible, and (not conformably) counts the entire population of a county as signing whatever a petitioner may happen to claim for them.
