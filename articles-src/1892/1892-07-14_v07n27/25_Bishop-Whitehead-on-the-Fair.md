At the Diocesan Convention at Pittsburg, Bishop Whitehead, of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of that section, declared himself in favor of keeping the World's Fair open on Sunday. He insisted that it is little less than fanaticism to close the gates of more than one hundred acres of that beautiful territory which is to be devoted to the use of the Exposition, with the result that thousands of laboring men are shut out who can seek admission on no other day.
