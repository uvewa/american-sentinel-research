CONTINUING the discussion of the Sunday opening of the Fair grounds, the Statesman says:—

There can be no doubt that the Directory was emboldened in this act by the fact that the Commission has timidly and evasively laid on the table until October the question of Sunday opening and liquor selling, which in all fairness should have been settled this spring or earlier, before those, whose relations to the Fair turn on the decision of these questions, have erected their buildings for religion or for rum.
