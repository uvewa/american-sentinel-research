THE Post, an independent paper of Washington, D. C., has the following article under the heading, "The Cancer of Paternalism":—

Robert Lees, as temporary chairman of the Democratic State convention of Wisconsin, on Wednesday made what the dispatches call a "remarkable speech" in his opening remarks to the assembled Democracy, and remarkable it was for its vigorous denunciation of the growing spirit of paternalism in the Government, and for the wholesome truths he told concerning a matter that is far too seldom made a topic of public discussion.

Whether Mr. Lees is right in charging our progress toward paternalism wholly to the Republican Party is immaterial; it was but natural that he should do so in addressing a Democratic convention. But wherever the responsibility lies, and both parties are more or less at fault, the evil is the same, and calls for remedy, if the self-respecting people of this country desire to preserve their independence and individuality.

Mr. Lees, who is evidently no believer in the "divine efficacy of law, whether it be in the enactments of Congress or State legislatures," is verging close upon grave and dangerous facts when he says:—

"We no longer trust the people with any power. We treat them as though they were children and incapable of exercising ordinary discretion in conducting their own personal affairs. If a man is involved in a difficulty with his neighbor, he can only obtain redress by engaging the services of an attorney duly admitted to practice in the courts of the State, and holding the certificate of a commission created by law. He can only be poisoned by a druggist duly licensed, or become intoxicated in a duly licensed saloon. His food has to be examined by State authorities. For fear that he may not know what is wrong with his horse when it is sick, the State shall not admit the loss of the nature of the disorder. He is not even allowed to let the ox-eyed dairy grow in his field without incurring the risk of a visit from that latest impersonation of the majesty of the law, a weed commissioner. Are long, at the present rate of progress, one dare not die without procuring the services of a duly licensed physician, or he buried by any one but a duly licensed undertaker."

Paternalism he holds to be the natural outgrowth of a greed for power, which threatens to engulf the liberties of the people unless it be checked. Mr. Lees is not to be understood as decrying any of the safe-guards to social order or calling in the name of anarchy for the overthrow of law. His illustrations are simply designed to show the increasing tendency of the times toward dependence of the people upon the Government, rather than the subordination of the Government to the will of the people. It is thus the citizen, who should be the creator and shaper of his own destinies, is fast being made the mere creature of centralized authority.

There is a demand in certain quarters for the conversion of the railroad and telegraph systems of the country into great governmental machines with a gigantic army of operatives to do their bidding.

There are others who would put the utterances of the newspapers under the censorship of the Government, and paralyze the right arm of civil liberty by suppressing the freedom of the press.

There was a large section of the party in power two years ago, and possibly is now, in favor of establishing unrestricted suffrage in the several States by shackling the States themselves with Federal statutes that it would breed a revolution to enforce.

There are still others who would establish a national bureau of supervision, to regulate, through a legion of paid inspectors, spies, and informers, the character of the food we eat, of the beverages we drink, of the medicines we take, as though the States of the Union were so many institutions for feeble-minded children, incompetent to manage their own affairs.

There is a disposition in all directions to shift upon the Government responsibilities and duties that belong primarily to the citizen, and which he can not evade without the sacrifice of everything that gives strength, vitality, and value to his citizenship; a disposition on the part of the legislators to impose the obligations which they are elected and sworn to perform, upon all sorts of commissions, trusts, and subordinate agencies, that are drains upon the treasury and suppers of the public virtue; to establish, in a word, a system of bureaucracy akin to that of Russia, wherein the will of the people becomes a helpless and inappreciable factor, over-slonged by an autocracy that is fatal to genuine independence and a mockery of popular government.

Such being the situation, and its outlines are in no wise overdrawn, the robust and patriotic philippic of the Wisconsin orator is no less timely than true. It carries with it a weighty admonition. It is a note of warning against the dangers that menace the Republic. It should not fall upon one ear, to lightly pass out of the other. It is a call to arms for the public safety.

The evil of which this article treats is a most serious one. Nor is it confined to one political party. It may be that in certain lines the Republican Party is more inclined to ultra paternalism than is the Democratic Party, but in the main there is little difference, and these two parties are the conservative forces of the Nation. The so-called reform parties are the very embodiment of paternalism.

But neither Mr. Lees nor the Post points out the most serious menace to popular freedom to be found in the paternal tendencies of the times. It is in the various measures of religious legislation that the greatest danger lies.
