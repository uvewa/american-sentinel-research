The advocates of Sunday laws have been guilty of classing the Christian body of believers known as Seventh-day Adventists with saloonists, gamblers, and generally disreputable people, because they, as well as some of these latter classes, have opposed Sunday legislation, though for very different reasons. Their object in doing so has been to cast an unjust reflection upon a people who religiously and conscientiously oppose that which they believe ever has resulted and always will result in evil—religious legislation.

One of these Sunday law advocates, Rev. W. F. Ware, Field Secretary for the American Sabbath Union for Michigan, who has of late been casting considerable of this sort of reflection upon this people, was recently quite roundly reprimanded for his course by an editor of a secular paper (the Allegan, Michigan, Journal), upon which he offered the following apology in his paper, the Michigan Sabbath Watchman, for April:—

In moral character the Seventh-day Adventists deserve and have our respect, and morally they do not deserve to be placed with the foregoing classes. It would be a piece of rank injustice to do so—a downright outrage.

But for all this—for all that morally they do not deserve to be placed with these classes—this representative of the American Sabbath Union persists in doing them this moral injustice. Continuing in his paper he says:—

But we did say, and still affirm, that the Seventh-day Adventists are among the organic foes of the Christian Sabbath, and are among the bitterest foes of this day, and that they are fighting side by side, and hand in hand with saloonists, atheists, agnostics, infidels of various forms and colors, gamblers, prostitutes, etc., to break down all regard for the Christian Sabbath, and to overthrow all laws for its protection as a legal rest day.

If the Seventh-day Adventists or their friends are ashamed of the company they are in, let them remember that we did not put them there. We only pointed them out. They and not we are responsible for the wretched company they keep, and the bad work they are doing.

But it now turns out that these Sunday closing advocates are favored with some of this same kind of "wretched company." As a matter of retaliation for the closing of saloons on Sunday in Sioux City, Iowa, the saloon keepers of that place recently assumed the burden of enforcing the Christian (?) Sunday law of Iowa, and succeeded in so rigorous and general an enforcement of it that the best Sunday-law friends in the place complained. Milk wagons, street cars, local trains and everything were tied up so tight that not a wheel could squeak. A most Puritanic Sunday, Sioux City had, and all to the credit of the saloon keepers and the Iowa Sunday law!

Then again, the brewers and liquor dealers of Chicago have expressed their desire that the World's Fair be closed on Sunday—just what the Sunday-law advocates are putting forth their utmost efforts to secure. Director-General Davis recently stated before the congressional committee that the brewers and distillers would willingly pay a large bonus to have the Fair gates closed on Sunday. Uneasy at having such company as this, the editor of the Christian Statesmen, commenting upon Mr. Davis's statement, says:—

This idea may possibly lead some persons to think that temperance and Sabbath observance are on opposite sides of the Sunday closing question.

This is simply another and a little more polite way of stating that intemperance and Sunday observance by law are on the same side of the Sunday closing of the World's Fair question, which is a fact. It is now in place to observe that the advocates of Sunday closing are "fighting side by side, and hand in hand, with saloonists, atheists, agnostics, infidels of various forms and colors, prostitutes, etc." (for the saloon element includes largely all these other classes); that if they are ashamed of the company they are in, let them remember that the opposers of Church and State union "did not put them there;" that they and not these are responsible for "the wretched company they keep," and the "bad work" they and their saloon associates are doing; and that we have "only pointed them out."

In view of all this the advocates of Sunday closing will now perhaps admit that an individual can not always be honestly characterized by the bad traits of those who for various reasons may perchance fall in with him. A man is known by the company he chooses to keep, and not by the company he may be accidentally thrown into. To take advantage of the accident, and judge or cast reflections in consequence of this, is a course worthy only of those whose cause admits of no defense. Honesty demands and will resort to no such policy. Fair minded men will inquire why each class assumes the attitude it does.

Saloon men favor the Sunday (and every other day) opening of saloons and Sunday closing of everything else that will turn patronage saloonward, for the money there is in it.

Sunday law advocates favor the Sunday opening of churches, and the Sunday closing of everything else they consider in competition with church attendance, for the money, influence and worldly power they are seeking to get through the church.

Seventh-day Adventists oppose, not the closing of saloons on every day, not church attendance on any day, nor the protection of Christians, the same as all others, in the exercise of their inalienable rights; but the union of religion and the State; the enforcement of religious institutions and customs by law, with all the evil results which must inevitably follow such a union and such legislation, and the insult which such a dependence on civil law casts upon the power of the gospel unto salvation.

Reader, which class do you think is on the right side of the question?
