## Overall Assessment

This issue presented moderate OCR difficulty. The 300 DPI scans are generally adequate but some pages, particularly pages 3-4 with their dense multi-column layout, presented challenges. Pages 7-8 contain many short editorial items where the boundaries between items are sometimes ambiguous. A careful human review against the original PDF is recommended, especially for articles marked LOW confidence.
