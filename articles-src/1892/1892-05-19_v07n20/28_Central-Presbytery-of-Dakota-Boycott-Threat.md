THE Central Presbytery of Dakota is reported as having memorialized the Presbyterian General Assembly, which meets at Portland, Oregon, that "in case the gates should be opened on Sunday the Assembly should earnestly request all its ministers and people to absent themselves from the Fair."

The Pittsburg Preachers' anarchistic brew, the organized boycott, is developing its poisonous ferment far and wide.
