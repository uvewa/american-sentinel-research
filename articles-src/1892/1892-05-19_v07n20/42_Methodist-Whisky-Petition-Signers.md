THE Christian Advocate, of this city, has in its issue of March 24, this statement by a correspondent:—

A man in this neighborhood, wishing to sell whisky secured twelve persons to sign his petition. Six belong to the Methodist Episcopal church.

It is but fair to say that the statement is merely made as the basis of a question, and that in replying to the inquiry the Advocate says:—

These persons violated the Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church. They are subjects for the application of the Discipline.

It might, however, be well for the Methodists, and some other churches as well, to get their own dooryards thoroughly cleaned before they again charge those who conscientiously oppose all Sunday laws with being allies of the saloons. An applicant for a liquor license might search the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the lakes to the gulf, but he would not find one Seventh-day Adventist willing to sign his petition, yet, because of their opposition to Sunday laws Adventists are classed with about all that is evil.
