# Editorial Notes.

EXCEPT on condition that religion is to be expected to adopt the attitude that they are not moral on every other day in the week.

"Boycott" is a hated word, because abused, but no other word can indicate that they are not the same. The World's Fair with Sunday opening should not fail for a century, is use of opening fronts of the business of those who oppose the wishes of the Church. World's Fair with Sunday opening should not fail to be boycotted. Sabbath Reform ought to would an invading army whose accused purpose is to destroy the lives and property of those people.

If this does not show the Satanic spirit that animates those who, while calling themselves "Christians" would adopt unchristian methods to coerced others to comply with their demands, then nothing could show it. The boycott is unchristian; and not only unchristian, but it is not the part of a Christian to aid only to remain away from the Fair, but to organize to keep others away from it on every day and in every feature of it that can be visited by the purchase of tickets of admission on Sunday; and while the masses of these on Sunday endure the masquerade, Monday. They forget that the Scripture says, "Avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath"; "Dearly beloved, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." It is rather the spirit of anti-christ. The Lord has no controversy with those who merely set legitimate business on Sunday, such as newspaper selling, and bakeries on their hands. They have robbed God of his glory, they have dishonored and polluted in creation, have, as it were, forced upon him the ordinance of God; that shall be the statute; that God not accept the substitute, your purpose to obtain not only boycotts, but indictive enactments, police regulations, etc.

THE Parkhurst episode is still attracting a good deal of attention in this city. The question is not when the man whose home contained the beauty show, has been graded in the community of the best people of as the world goes, she is discovering of no account whatever.

But the fact of the guilt of this wicked and depraved woman, does not justify a minister of the gospel in invading the best powers to use him as a purpose as enticing women to indecent acts in order that he may become a complainant witness against them. The grand commission to its creation, and if so it does not follow that the minister has no authority to play the detective.

*Crime itself mildly not only with the erring, but with the abandoned.* To the woman taken in adultery he said, "Neither do I condemn thee; go ye, and sin no more." And why did our Lord not condemn her in adultery? Let any honest mind answer: "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved."

CHRIST did not excuse sin; he granted no indulgences to sinners. The sin and the sinner could at one and the same time be both forgiven and destroyed; but the law could not at once be justified. Even when appeared to be settle a civil difference, by declining to act as a civil judge, he answered, "Who made me a divider and a judge over you?" Such work was foreign to Christ's mission, and as he is "no greater than his lord," should not the minister of Christ go and do likewise?

AGAIN, should a Christian ever go where he can not proclaim himself a Christian Society? a minister ever go where he must deny his religion? That is a question for ministers to answer then. But this is just what Dr. Parkhurst's ministers went out to do. They went where their very work led them to do. As related by Mrs. John May, a colored woman of New Jersey, in the *Mail and Express* of Monday, May 3, she asked the Doctor this question, and how Dr. Parkhurst replied that it was to expose recognition in the parlours of New York, as a man of the highest culture and character. Dr. Parkhurst answered that he had been told a thing by a judge or minister, and replied, "I am an officer and acting of justice." There is no ecclesiastic or civil law on the earth which requires a denial of his sacred office, and the last property to be done by a minister of the Lord ought to be that.

BUT as it is in the picture of a Christian minister connecting with lewd women, in order that he may testify against them. Whatever may be said in justification of his course, the fact that there are Christian men associating themselves in doing this thing as the Master himself did, for the reason of his opponents is not enough to prove him delivered and wrong. Rev. Benjamin F. De Costa, a fellow-citizen and associate, John the Evangelist, is of this class. Dr. De Costa is one of the men of New York who advocated his ministerial office that he is right and the "Master's" action in so acting. Dr. De Costa addressed a letter in the *Sun,* saying, "I and money for this poor creature, who is better than those that have been wrongfully charged, he that is Secretary of the White Cross Society of the church, has degraded the country to keep men pure."

Of the women excruciated by Dr. Parkhurst's testimony, Dr. De Costa said:—

> Women like that are sold in this city at a certain age and so at actual or present. They are victims of social conditions for which the public is responsible. They are the product of tenement-house life, and as such, are responsible, in greater or less degree, for this infamy which at last has forced itself upon the attention of this community.

> In any event, such humanitarians show her a great deal more of the true spirit of Christianity and morals fear!

> If I should be set to find fault not for a moral wrong, but for something that could be found in the Constitution of the Society of the United States.

Of the two men personally, we know nothing of either. Dr. De Costa is a rector of a church and not a reformer; and Dr. Parkhurst is a reformer and not yet a churchman. Whatever of these men would seem to have passed or not. But what was Christ's charge to his disciples?

Of the two men personally, with the political views of neither, *Sentinels* ever have their views; but what Christian can doubt that Dr. De Costa stands nearer to the example in harmony with the gospel of Christ than is the society system special objects of the civil law for the promotion of morals?
