WHILE in attendance at a meeting of the International Executive Board of the Knights of Labor, at Pittsburg, Pa., Mr. Powderly said to a reporter:—

I think the World's Fair should be as open on Sunday as on any other day, as Sunday is the only day of leisure to a large majority of the working class.

It is a significant fact that notwithstanding the persistent efforts of the Sunday forces to make it appear that organized labor demands Sunday closing, of all the petitions with which Congress has been flooded for Sunday closing of the Fair, but one has been presented representing a body of laboring men.
