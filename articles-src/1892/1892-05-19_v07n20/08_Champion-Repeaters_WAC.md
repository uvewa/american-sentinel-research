# Champion Repeaters.

THE *Congressional Record* of May 3 lists petitions and memorials presented since the last publication of a list of such, and a record of memorials praying that Congress close the World's Columbian Exposition Fair on Sunday; and that no further appropriations be made for the World's Fair except upon guarantees of Sunday closing, from one school at Mansfield, four churches of Virginia and West Virginia, a Sunday school at Cedar Rapids, and the churches of Nebraska. Twenty-seven churches of Indiana, thirty churches and citizens of Ohio, an Evangelical Alliance, Baptist churches, colleges of Ohio, a Cincinnati, a District Epworth League, Knights Templar of Penn., eight petitions and petitions from the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, containing all individual signatures,\u2014all those last also of Ohio.

This style of mercilesslike Congress, by wholesale, is what the *Christian Statesman* boasts of as "the new method of the old commandment."

This old method of petitioning, by presenting signatures, obtained handy at the door and on the street, is one of the very best means for keeping the Sunday question agitated. Every new petition sent on, after organization and re-organization and then the repetition, gives more names in the name of the organization, just what sort of a creature it is.

It is certainly in a much easier way, to commit a whole denomination to a measure by the presiding officer in a public meeting than to go around with a petition and see each man moral read, and say, "You! line your future. It does not endanger self interest or give objection. The resolution is adopted," and the sign himself to representing a thousand, a thousand, or ten thousand, or more, according to the size of the organization, and his official position in it.

The looks then clear way or may not look at the measure is, it involves a method of getting rid of it, for it involves the most gigantic scheme of misrepresentation that is found. Take, for instance, to exemplify what we mean, the common form of praying Congress (1) vote of the gathering tancted it is a church, the churches at the National churches' meeting will be representative, which churches, all the different denominations of churches, all the different organizations, be represented at all meetings, from all the different Sunday schools, Christian Endeavor Societies, Seventh-day Baptist conventions, Woman's Christian Temperance Unions, Epworth Leagues, Daughters, Public schools, etc., two or three organizations. Once it can be once told, it is tancted once. Take it taken, when it is tancted once. It is read. Look at it. Be counted as it. It is thus practically filed and if a rule is taken, those who were opposed to the resolution, how that is counted again. The repeating has begun. Then the ecclesiastical heads of these organization are called, and each one of the whole organizations are called, and each membership. In the same way, the same way the instinctory of the officers or delegates present at their different councils, grand bodies, etc., up to the legislative representative body of the organization. But the members of Congress do not know this. The members of labor lodges are also committed by resolutions the same way. Senators receive a petition; they read it, a resolution; they vote upon a petition; they are represented again. A multiplicity of votes are cast upon a petition; they are represented again. The country school boards; they vote again. The county school boards; they again are counted. School petitions; they vote again. The Sunday school conventions again they are counted. Their churches convene again they are counted. Their church conferences and presbyteries and local councils, etc., in them all they are counted over and over and over and over. The multiplicity of the repeating is simply enormous. The Evangelical Alliance may vote them again, and whatever else can keep a distinct form and get to be gathered at almost any extra religious congress will do the same for them. Through the organization of the Christian Endeavor Society and the Epworth League, the young people are counted in too. But to the women we are vouched are the most champion repeaters of all. They can be recognized at every polling, where nearly ready for the thing to have been hereabout, except perhaps the labor lodges, where ready for it like the voting has been done, again they are counted and recounted, through the different departmental grades of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the King's Daughters, etc.

This is the apotheosis of repeating.
