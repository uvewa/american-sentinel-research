THE International Federation for the Observance of Sunday, whose office is at Geneva, through their secretary, who was also secretary of the Sunday Rest Congress held during the Paris Exposition, have sent a memorial to the directors of the World's Exposition at Chicago. In this memorial they urge very earnestly that the Exposition be closed on Sunday for the benefit of the large number of employes, who will not only be allowed a time of physical rest, but will be enabled thus to discharge properly their religious duties. They also urge that the decision will have a serious influence upon Europe, where the lovers of Sunday rest are striving by the means of congresses and associations to promote everywhere the wise use of the day.
