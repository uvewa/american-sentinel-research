IN the Senate, on May 5, when presenting "a memorial of citizens of East Hardwick, Va., remonstrating against the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way to commit the Government to a course of religious legislation," Senator Morrill said: "It is clear that this question is a mixed one. If the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday, it would virtually exclude all the workmen in Chicago from any reasonable opportunity to visit it." While the Senator's remark as to the workmen of Chicago may be true, that is not the ground upon which the legislation asked should be refused, but because it is asking Congress to interfere where it has no jurisdiction, and in matters outside the sphere of civil legislation.
