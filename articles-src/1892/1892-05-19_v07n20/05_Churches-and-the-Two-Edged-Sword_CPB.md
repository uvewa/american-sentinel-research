WAXING exceedingly wroth at the imaginary indignity done by the local authorities of the World's Fair, the Statesman continues:—

The churches, whose opposition to the Fair, in case of its becoming an avowed engine of evil, the Commission seeks to postpone until it will be too late to be effective, should remember the new eleventh commandment, "Thou shalt not suffer thyself to be hoodwinked." Manifestly both Directory and Commission have seen the churches so often trodden on, without a murmur from them, by politics and commerce, that they think the proverb, "The trodden worm will turn," has no application to religious and reform organizations. It is to be hoped that the churches will remember that, while Christ was meek and lowly, he also stood, on occasion, with "a two-edged sword in his mouth," the severest antagonist of evil the world ever saw or heard. However meekly we bear wrongs to ourselves, we should show "the manliness of Christ" in resisting this attack on our Christian American institutions.

Just how the churches have so often been "trodden on" in this country is not easy to see. They have always been perfectly free to carry on their propaganda in their own way; have had special protection from the State in the way of laws against disturbing religious meetings, and have, for the most part, been free from taxation. How then have they been "trodden on"?

In only one sense have the churches been "trodden on" in this country, and that is they have, as churches, been allowed no voice in civil affairs. And in this they have been "trodden on"!! Have the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, and other fraternities likewise been "trodden on" because they have been compelled to act politically as individuals and not as societies? Certainly not; and no more have the churches; and the assertion that they have is an assertion that the churches should rule. And that is just what National Reform means; and it is just what the Christian Statesman means.
