Thus the local Directory cavalierly anticipates the settlement of the question that is pending before its superior officers, the national Commission and the national Congress. While this act is a discourtesy to these superiors, and to the eight States that have officially declared against Sunday opening, it is a slap in the face of the churches, which have almost unanimously asked that God's law and American customs, not greed and foreign habits, should govern the Exposition. What cares the Directory for God's law and the convictions of the churches as against hundreds of dollars per week added to the funds of the Fair!
