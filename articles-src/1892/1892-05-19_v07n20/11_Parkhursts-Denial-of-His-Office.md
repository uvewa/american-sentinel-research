AGAIN, should a Christian ever go where he can not proclaim himself a Christian? Should a minister ever go where he must deny his calling? To ask these questions is to answer them. Yet, this is just what Dr. Parkhurst's mistaken conception of the nature of his sacred work led him to do. As related by Miss Frances E. Willard in the Union Signal, of May 5, she asked the Doctor this question: "How could you ever be so disguised as to escape recognition in the puriteus of New York, as a man of the highest culture and character?" Dr. Parkhurst answered that he had been accused of being a judge or minister, and replied, "I am now acting as sheriff." The answer needs no comment. All can see that work which requires a denial of his sacred office can not properly be done by a minister of the Lord Jesus Christ.
