JUST NOW MUCH is being said both for and against the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and among the recent utterances in favor of open doors are those of several prominent women, and their arguments display their large knowledge of the world and human nature, as well as their philanthropic motives. They are all deep thinking, intelligent women, women who have the good of humanity at heart, women who take a broad, far-reaching, view of matters, women who do not believe in dipping out vice by the spoonful while so many men are pouring it in by the bucketful, but rather in stopping the cause thereof.

One of these women is Mrs. May Wright Sewell, of the World's Fair Commissioners of Indiana, who at their last week's meeting discussed the matter of Sunday closing of the great Fair. During the discussion, Mrs. Sewell said she thought that the Exposition should be open, since the back doors of saloons and other impatiens places would be open. She believed that safe and beneficial entertainment should be provided for the thousands who will be drawn to Chicago then, and included among these were the poor who were always there, and who could not afford to lose time through the week to see the Fair, which should be accessible to all.

Another member of the Board of Commissioners, Mary W. Krout, coincided with Mrs. Sewell, and advocated the opening of the art and similar departments, so that the working classes might enjoy them without losing a day's wages, which they could ill afford. She said that the majority of petitions against opening the Fair came from the small towns and country districts who know nothing about the heartless methods of conducting business which prevails in large cities.

Here are the opinions from two other women, who are not members of any Board of Commissioners, but whose opinions, nevertheless, are good and have due weight and influence. Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, of New York: "It is said that those who watch the exhibits and serve the public through the week should have one day of rest. As the labors will be transient, only lasting a few months, and as their surroundings will be varied, beautiful and entertaining, the tax on their time and patience would be light compared with the dreary monotony of ordinary laborers' lives, who spend year after year in dingy workshops and dreary offices, or with multitudes of young men sitting with bent shoulders writing by artificial lights,—a class more to be pitied than those who dig in mines, scarcely ever seeing the light of day. Those who can dispose of their time as they see fit can hardly appreciate what a Sunday at the World's Fair would be for a large class of their fellow-men. Gifted orators might speak to the multitudes on popular reform or religious questions, for their are no meetings more impressive than those held in the open air."

Another is Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, of the Woman's Tribune, who says editorially:—

To the Tribune the arguments for opening the Fair appear to have the weight of reason, justice, and brotherly kindness on their side. So far as its seeming irreligious or unchristian to open the doors on Sunday, it appears to the Tribune to be carrying out in the highest degree the spirit of him who said, "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." The opportunities for holding the great religious and reform meetings on the grounds will be enlarged on, as it will afford the occasion of the century for bringing spiritual instruction to the masses who never go to church, and for whom no church privileges are provided, or are at present possible. With the best sermons, lectures, and sacred concerts, what might not the blessed day do for the elevation and education of the masses? Jackson Park, one of the two great breathing places of Chicago, the only possible chance for the poor to get fresh air and outdoor life, and of which they have always availed themselves in summer, has been appropriated for the World's Fair grounds, and if these are closed to them on Sunday it will be positive robbery to the helpless, and great mortality, especially of children, will result. Every consideration of humanity and good order, seems to demand that there shall be even extra inducements to draw people out of the crowded, heated city, and that the grounds should either be open entirely free or at a much reduced price.

Nebraska can well feel proud of her broad and generous Mrs. Colby, who has surpassed all others in outspoken liberality and justice towards the great mass of laboring people in and about Chicago, inasmuch as she would not only open the grounds on Sunday, but would have admission either free or at a reduced price for their benefit. She well deserves the title, "Charity's Queen," which was bestowed upon her by White Cloud, the chief of the Chippewa Indians.—Kearney (Neb.) Gazette.
