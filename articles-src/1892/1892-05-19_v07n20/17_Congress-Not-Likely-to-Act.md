# Congress Not Likely to Act.

A RECENT dispatch from Washington concerning the outlook over the question of the opening of the World's Fair, says:

> So earnest has become the warfare that an effort was made to have the petitions presented directly to represent the religious bodies of that State in favor of it. A public statement from Washington, was found to have more alleged signatures to it but all of them without exception the petitions against Sunday closing have consisted of memorials from churches and religious organizations; and for a single individual subscribing such a petition pointedly. Mr. Platt, of Connecticut, and others have spoken.
