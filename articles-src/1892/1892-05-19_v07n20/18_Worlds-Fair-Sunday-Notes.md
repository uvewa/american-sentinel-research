# World\'s Fair Sunday Notes.

THE Central Presbytery of Dakota is reported as having memorialized the Presbyterian General Assembly, which meets at Portland, Oregon, that "in case the gates should be opened on Sunday the Assembly should earnestly request all its ministers deep printed thinks can obtain them by writing to protest."

The Pittsburg Printers' anaesthetic bow, the Plumber's holiday is developing its patronage to constant far and wide.

THE *Washington Post,* of May 10, says that "the usual flood of petitions in reference to the World's Fair was poured into the regular channel of the Senate yesterday morning." The *Post* remarks that the petitions were about equally divided in their requests. But Congressmen, and should write to them, that as public individuals not merely and suggestively notes that a "mass meeting of the citizens of Cleveland was the only one in favor of enforced religion at the Exposition, and a company of 'Columbus' at Vernon provided."

THE *Washington Evening Star* says,\u2014"The question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair is one which should be decided in accordance with the popular preference. How the fair issue is any way connected with it. The public preference not should be decided by the popular classes" provided only a "popular demand" be expressed in its favor."

If the World's Fair should be closed on Sunday, it would virtually exclude all the workmen in Chicago from any reasonable opportunity to visit it. "While the proprietors and friends of the workmen of Chicago may be true, that is not the ground upon which the legislation asked for is based." The gentlemen who seek legislation to intervene where it has no jurisdiction, and is matters outside the power of Congress.

THIS Congress has been tampered with petition from the advocates of religious legislation for the passage of the different numbers for the enforcement of Sunday observance before it, but Congress will surely pause and reason before taking action which would result in closing the World's Fair on Sunday. Those who wish to secure the impropriety of any such legislation by Congress have asked, "are there no petitions in opposition to this?" Of late such petitions have begun to be heard, sound, worthy and effective.
