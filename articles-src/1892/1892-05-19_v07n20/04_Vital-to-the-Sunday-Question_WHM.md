# "Vital to the Sunday Question."

IN its issue of April 14, THE SENTINEL published, under the title, "The Supreme Court and a National Religion," a comment upon a portion of Justice Brewer's decision in the case of the Rector of Holy Trinity. The editors closed with the words, "So the Supreme Court of the United States affirms an establishment of religion. What next?" It has been said of this argument that it was too sweeping, and that it was not warranted by the conclusions of others as to the meaning of the decision. We expect to recur to the subject hereafter, and we ask our readers whether this is or not let the *Post* of Washington, D. C., for May 3, answer Judge Brewer's decision, that it is "a Christian Nation."

> This decision is vital to the Sunday question, and to the question of religious liberty generally; for it involves a claim to power on the part of the Government to define and legislate upon the religion of the American people. Notable decisions have been made by the courts heretofore in the same line, but the new form in which it was recently advanced in the interpretation of the existing statute by the Supreme Court, involves a decision upon the fundamental principles of a religious establishment. This, once announced, the movement for a national religion is logical and is bound to maintain. Sunday as a day for rest.

While the *Christian Statesman,* of May 7, says of it calls it an explanation, and advocates the commission of the United States to submit a program of religious studies for the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday or in any other way that may be construed as a form of religious legislation. It would say "so much the worse for the Constitution." The United States Supreme Court on this subject are laid aside: We published the essential portions of the National Reform platform February 13, 1891, the last of which shows that whatever is contrary to Christianity is contrary to law.

It was very largely on the ground of the second and third claims of this platform that Elliott F. Shepard pleaded before the Commission of the World's Fair; that Congress should condition its appropriation for the World's Fair, saying, "It will be in accordance with the Constitution and laws of this country to provide by act of Congress that the Columbian Exhibition of Ohio, the Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday," and, as evidence that it might properly so do, quoting the words of the commission.

Now that this resolution of the Chicago Baptists has opened the eyes of the *Clymester* to the folly of legislation, by city or State, on the ground of religious preference, perhaps it will have less to say than formerly against legislating in favor of Sunday. And perhaps it will not. How different would it more closely adhere to the principle that legislative power, should order all places of business, all factories, all public offices to be closed, by close on Sunday in deference to the public demand? But who constitute the "public" who demand it? Then let some Baptists frame a resolution that the democratic party pass a law that all places of business be closed in the seventh day in deference to the religious preference of seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists and Jews, and on Friday in deference to the conscientious preference of the Mohammedans and Orientals. Can these things be compelled, and observed? When will well-meaning people learn that religious preference is class legislation and is a minute step from class legislation, which by its nature is a direct sword thrust at the foundation principles of our Government?\u2014*Sabbath Recorder.*
