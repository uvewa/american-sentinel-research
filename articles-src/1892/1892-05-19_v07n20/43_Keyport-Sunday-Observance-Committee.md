THE Sunday Observance Committee of Keyport, N. J., held a meeting recently, at which reports from various committees were listened to. The committee to wait upon Mr. Cornell, of the Keyport Steamboat Company to ask him not to run his boat to New York on Sunday, during the summer, reported that Mr. Cornell claimed that the Sabbath committee should see the farmers in reference to the receiving and shipping of produce on Sunday. The committee resolved to enforce the law upon those who had their places of business open the previous Sunday.
