IN a recent meeting in this city in behalf of Sunday observance, Col. Elliott F. Shepard, President of the American Sabbath Union, is reported by the Mail and Express as speaking "of the revelation and blessing contained in the fourth commandment, that man ought to rest one continuous seventh part of time, and would be rewarded with infinite blessing if he did." Had this appeared in any other paper there might be a suspicion that some reporter had played the Colonel false, and put into his mouth words which he never uttered, but as his own paper says it we must believe that Mr. Shepard now advocates keeping "one continuous seventh part of time." If by this he means all time, the thing is quite impossible; no man lives long enough to do that. But if by his unmeaning jumble the Colonel intends one-seventh of the life time of the individual, the difficulty is equally great, for no man knows the measure of his days, hence could not keep one continuous seventh part of his time. Any man who wishes can keep a definite seventh part of his time, or a seventh part in regular succession, but to keep a continuous seventh part of time is out of the question. The Colonel should not require of his disciples impossibilities.
