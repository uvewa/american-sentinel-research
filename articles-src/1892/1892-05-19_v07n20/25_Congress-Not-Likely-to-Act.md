A RECENT despatch from Washington concerning the contest over the question of the opening of the World's Fair, says:

So earnest has become this warfare that an effort has been made to swell the petitions by fraudulent names. A petition came from Michigan claiming to represent the religious bodies of that State in opposition to Sunday opening, which, at investigation, was found to have more alleged signatures than there were residents in the State. Lately, apparently under Colonel Shepard's directions, petitions against Sunday closing have embodied threats to defeat any member of Congress who favored opening the Fair on Sunday. In presenting such a petition yesterday, Mr. Platt, of Connecticut, said that if anything would induce him to vote for Sunday opening it would be these threats to defeat him in case he did so. Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, who is 91 years old, stated in the Senate the other day that these petitions did not frighten him, and that he was in favor of Sunday opening as a matter of justice to workingmen.

The opinion is also expressed that owing to the bitterness already engendered Congress will take no action whatever on Sunday closing. Senate officials estimate that the petitions and memorials so far presented on this subject represent about two million signatures. But as has been shown in the case of the petitions from Michigan and Ohio, many of these so-called signatures are beyond a doubt fraudulent. In the case of the two States named the census returns exposed the pious fraud. But whether exposed or not every petition is fraudulent which assumes to represent whole organizations when only a fraction of the membership have signed the petition or voted in its favor.
