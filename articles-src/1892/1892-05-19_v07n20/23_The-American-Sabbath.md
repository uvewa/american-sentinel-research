A CORRESPONDENT of the Sabbath Recorder, writing from Oroville, Cal., says that there are some very strange ideas advanced concerning Sunday and the World's Fair, and gives for an example this from John V. Farwell, of Chicago:—

As the Fair is national, to which our Government has invited all nations as participants, I think it eminently appropriate that we exhibit an American Sabbath along with our multiform products of labor.

The Recorder's correspondent then comments as follows:—

Now if, as Mr. Farwell says, this is an American institution, it must have been made by Americans. I understand that anything made by Americans as the result of their labor, should by all means have the right of exhibition in this great Fair. He rightly claims that it is purely American; surely the French do not claim it; they never had any hand in its manufacture, and no other nation sets up any claim to having made it. Neither does God set up any claim to it. Then, surely, the thing must be of American manufacture. Then, let the Americans put it on exhibition, place it among the plants as an American mushroom. Why not? I think it would look well there. The idea of an American Sabbath being put on exhibition with "our products of labor"! Surely, if it is one of our products of labor, and is to be exhibited with our other products of labor, then there is no harm in placing it there as a mushroom. There is not, nor can there be, anything sacred or holy about an American made Sabbath. No, let it go on exhibition, and let the Commissioners, by all means, open the gases on Sunday, for an institution thus made would show to better advantage on Sunday than any other day.

It looks to me that this Sunday-closing business is going to seed; it puts one in mind of the boycotting times we had here in California a few years ago, when the Chinese question was to be crammed down our throats at all hazards. I do not know as it would be any great damage if those Christians, or those who are professing to be Christians, should stay away from the Fair as they threaten to do. The thing would probably be a success without them.
