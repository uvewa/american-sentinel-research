# Draft Sunday Law.

THE New York Legislature is a droll body of lawmakers. It has passed a bill making it a law to open the Metropolitan exhibit, yet commanding that the exhibit be closed on Sunday. Immediately after the World's Fair legislation, the State later appropriated $40,000 annually for the maintenance of the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York City upon the condition that the museum should be open on Sunday. Explanations are in order.

Apropos of the foregoing is the fact that the same Legislature which was made for Sunday merchandise in Chicago, in spite of dealing its reasons, by closing on Sunday the Lenox on January Day. It is still very naughty to fish anywhere in New York State on Saturday. In January Bay, facts illustrate the utter absurdity of the Sunday Legislation tangle.
