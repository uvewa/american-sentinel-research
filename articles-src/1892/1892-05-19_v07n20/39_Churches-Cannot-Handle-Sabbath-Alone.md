IN explaining why the American Sabbath Union was called into existence, the same gentleman, in a lecture delivered at Battle Creek, Mich., April 24, stated that the Sunday Sabbath for some cause or other has come to that pass that "the churches can not handle it alone." That is to say that these "evangelical" churches, some of which boast of several million members, are not now capable of performing their religious duties and maintaining their religious institutions alone, but just now when they have become numerically stronger than ever before, they must receive assistance from the State; must have some outside force to help them keep the Sabbath they profess to so greatly love and revere. What, again we ask, is the matter with the churches?

If there were not many in these churches who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, who have not the moral stamina to resist the attractions of the world, who, in short, are unconverted, and whose affections are upon the things of the earth rather than on things above, would there be this demand on the part of the churches for worldly assistance? Is not this the trouble with the churches?
