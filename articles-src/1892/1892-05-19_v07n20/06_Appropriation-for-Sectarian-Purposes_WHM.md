# Appropriation for Sectarian Purposes.

ACCORDING to Judge Brewer's decision it is eminently right to recognize our national Government. The City Council of Omaha, Neb., has, it appears, acted upon the immortal Judge's decision, for as reported in the *Bee* of that city, April 21, last, the City Council passed a resolution appropriating the sum of $275 to defray the expense of a reception to be given the ministers' convention the Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, to assemble in that city in June, of this year. The Mayor opposed the resolution as being illegal, and vetoed the resolution, but it was repassed by the Council over his veto for $15 a Member, and the Council instead of sustaining the veto, the National Reform unanimously passed the resolution by two-thirds of the Mayor, and defeated the Mayor his check for $41. This as our Supreme Judge's conclusions would be, for the religion of the General Government, the City Council of Omaha stands in can better (said a logical step) and recognizes the religion of the State of the religion of the great State of Nebraska, and it controlled by laws, by appropriating out of the last funds for the appropriation of the entire political platform, citizens of Nebraska.
