CHRIST did not excuse sin; he granted no indulgence for sin. But because he could not at one and the same time be both Saviour and judge, he said, "I judge no man." Even when appealed to to settle a civil difficulty, by adjusting property claims, he answered, "Who made me a divider and a judge over you?" Such work was foreign to Christ's mission, and as "the servant is not greater than his lord," should not the minister of Christ do even as Christ did?
