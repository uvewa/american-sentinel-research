# Sunday Closing Advocates and Saloons.

UNDER the tutelage of political religion, religious repeating has achieved a multiplicity of voting to, a fraction of which and not the smallest indulgence of a dollar's worth of render could ever have attained. The *Washington Post* has been pleased to give vent to its disappointment, and states the result in an editorial paragraph, in its issue of May 3:

In its efforts to close the World's Fair on Sunday, the church-going people are not afraid of the people's merits seem to have temporarily forgotten about the saloons, or at least to be willing to be in partnership for purely political reasons it is not that is naturally appalling. The Michigan petition to Congress, for instance, asks that the Fair be not opened on Sunday, and asks for nothing further than the last census discovered in the State. Where Michigan is concerned, at least, insists not only that the critics from the State, but the petition also does not pray for the closing of the saloons in Michigan itself on Sunday, but the reader does not have to account for absence of that petition.

> A similar survey is arrested in Ohio, and perhaps in other States. The *Cincinnati Enquirer* calls attention to the fact that in this State there is the astonishing disclosure of order on the subject of the World's Fair. The paper says it came from churches and temperance workers a great many times which we can not fully catalogue or enumerate. The above shows the reader how these fair people are fair in their prayer. It continues us to inquire, however, whether these good people have been as diligent in petitioning Congress for the abolition of saloons on all days, including the week.

According to the last record the percentage of the standing of Michigan as a "Christian State" on the list of the National Reform Union and its test, "the State that is above Ohio," this second signpost of franchised political representation involves only a line in which respect which the petitions of these organizations might influence them, either from Congress or from the country.
