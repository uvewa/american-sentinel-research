INCONSISTENCY can scarcely go farther than it does when those who advocate the Sunday-closing of the Chicago Exposition, say, in one breath, that Christians in general are increasingly lax and inconsistent in their personal habits concerning Sunday-observance, and in the next, that the opening of the Exhibition on Sunday "will outrage the religious sentiment of millions of people." If Christians will read Sunday newspapers, ride on Sunday trains, and steamboats, patronize Sunday camp-meetings, and share the profits with the railroads which make special provision for Sunday worshipers (?); if Christian men will do all this, how is it that the opening of the Exhibition, five hundred or two thousand miles from their homes, is such a sad shock to their piety?—Sabbath Outlook.
