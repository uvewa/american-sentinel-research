MR. CRAFTS and the American Sabbath Union have persistently repelled, with an air of injured innocence, the charge that their desired Sunday legislation was in any sense religious legislation. The writer heard Mr. Crafts, in a speech at Lakeside, Ohio, last summer, ridicule Seventh-day Adventists and others, for entertaining any such fears regarding his movement. To make the deception more successful, he denounced all compulsion in religion as wrong. After the lecture, Professor Coleman, a prominent National Reformer, was asked why in his opinion, the speaker advocated the secular theory only as a basis for his desired Sunday legislation. He replied that he supposed it was done to "escape the criticism which would result from placing his desired legislation on a religious basis."

Now that Mr. Crafts thinks the United States Supreme Court has declared our Nation to be a Christian Nation, he completely unmarks in the Christian Statesman of April 30, by commenting on the decision as follows:—

It is therefore legitimate to close the Exposition gates, not only because of Sunday toil and traffic and turmoil the opening would cause, but also because "this is a Christian Nation."

No intelligent observer will be surprised at this sudden change; the civil Sabbath mask has always been exceedingly transparent, and at times, extremely chafing to the wearer.
