CHRIST dealt mildly not only with the erring, but with the abandoned. To the woman taken in adultery he said, "Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more." And why did our Lord not condemn this woman? Let Jesus himself answer: "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." John 3:17.
