# Religion on Ice in the District of Columbia.

THERE has been introduced in the United States Senate and House "A bill to prohibit the delivery and sale of ice on Sunday within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day," commanding that the bill would enact:---

SECTION 1. That it shall be unlawful for any person or persons to sell or deliver ice on any Sunday within the limits of the District of Columbia; and any violation on the public streets or thoroughfares of the District of Columbia shall be punished by a fine not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each offense.

SEC. 2. That any person or corporation violating the provisions of this act shall be guilty of a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, to be recovered by action in the police courts of the District of Columbia.

SEC. 3. That a person or corporation convicted of violating the provisions of the act more than once shall, in addition to the fine above provided, pay the same as hereby imposed.

It is not at all strange that the writer of the above favors the bill, but that the success of the Sunday ice bill, for the principle involved in both, is the very same---the enforced observance of Sunday. The question is a religious one, wholly naturally, and that done under its influence, and of its spirit. On the same ground that the Sunday ice law should be an enforcement of religious observance it could be set at rest by an enforcement of religious observance in general. The same principle applies to ice that applies to bread, and to food of all kinds, and not only in its restricted application, but in its broadest application. If the original amendment, the Blair Sunday Rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, the bill for prohibiting Sunday labor at the Exposition, and the Religious Government appropriation of religion at the Exposition, embrace all the rest, and the last, to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, within the District. In all but slight variations of the same thing, they are all parts and developments of this system which connects itself to a line of religious legislation. Those who would be free from it, must follow and obey the bearings of the contest all along the line, watching with the same political vigilance the Sunday ice bill as the political views of the Sunday rest bill.
