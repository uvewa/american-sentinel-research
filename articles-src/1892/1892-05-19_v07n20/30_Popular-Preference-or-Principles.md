THE Washington Evening Star says, "The question of Sunday closing of the World's Fair is one which should be decided in accordance with the popular preference." Does the Star mean to say that whether Congress shall legislate to close it or not should be decided by the popular clamor? Shall Congress give its sanction to any measure, however unconstitutional or vicious it may be, provided only a "popular preference" be expressed in its favor? The Star would do well to consider whether or no principles should not govern in congressional legislation rather than preferences.
