In an article in a preceding issue a number of early statutes were quoted from the legislative proceedings of the Colony of New Plymouth, which showed conclusively that the Pilgrims who landed from the Mayflower, not only intended, as shown by their compact made previous to landing, to establish a religion, but actually did very early in the history of the Colony, establish a religion according to the forms and tenets professed by themselves. The legal enactments, by which these forms and tenets were enforced, were augmented from time to time as the Colony increased in number and lack of unanimity began to appear, and certain frivolities and negligence of religious forms to show themselves. In the records of the proceedings "att the general court holden at New Plymouth, June 6, 1651," this is found:—

It is ordered that whatsoever person, or persons, shall neglect the frequenting the public worship of that is according to God in the places wher they live or doe assemble themselves upon any pretense whatsoever, in any way contrary to God and the allowance of the Government tending to the subversion of religion and churches, or palpable prophanacon of God's holy ordinances being duly convicted; "didilest every one that is a master or a dance of a family, or any other person at their own disposing, to pay ten shillings for every such default.

It is ordered that if any, in any lassy, slothful, or prophease way doth neglect to come to the public's worship of God shall forfeit for every such default ten shillings, or bee publicly whipt.

Thus, in "language more or less emphatic" do these colonists declare the establishment of religion to be their purpose, and still continue so to do. A decree of date June 5, 1652 reads:—

It is enacted by this court that henceforth the Indians within this jurisdiction bee not permitted to do any servill work on the Lord's day, as by fishing, fowling, planting, and carrying of burdens, etc., and if any doe, after notice given them hereof, they shall bee warned to the next general court by the constable of the place where they are transgresses.

Thus do the heathen begin to have the established religion of Plymouth Colony preached to them, and again, in still more unmistakable terms on June 5, 1655, when—

it was enacted that such as deny the Scriptures to bee a rule of life, shall receive corporal punishment according to the discretion of the majestrate, so as it shall not extend to life or limb.

And again in 1656 when it was decreed:—

And likewise, that no Indian shall discharge any gun on the Lord's day att anything to the breach of the Sabbath and desturbance of the English; as they will answer it att their perill.

But previously, in 1655, steps had been taken to establish a church as well as a religion, for it was then decreed that—

WHEREAS, There hath been many complaints of want of due maintenance of the ministers as some have reported; It is therefore enacted that noe pastor or teacher of any congregation shall remove before his complaint hath been tendered to the majestrates, and they have heard both sides; that upon such complaints, if there appears to bee a reali defect in the hearers of the ministers soe complaining, the majestrates shall use all gentle means to persuade them to doe their duty heerth. But if any of them shall not heerly be reclaimed, but shall persist through plaine obstinacy against an ordinance of God, that then it shall bee in the power of the majestrate to use such means as may put them upon their duty.

These are some of the foundation stones. There are more. Mr. Justice Brewer says they are the polished corners of the perfect structure of a Christian Nation, and Mr. Justice Brewer and his associates are the Supreme Court of that Nation.
