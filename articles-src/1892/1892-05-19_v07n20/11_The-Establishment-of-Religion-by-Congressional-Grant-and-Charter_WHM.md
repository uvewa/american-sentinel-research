# The Establishment of Religion by Congressional Grant and Charter.

THE *Christian Statesman,* of May 7, and the charters, from monarchs who assumed to be the head of the Church as well as of the State, which Mr. Justice Brewer cites are a portion of mention of "organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation."

It is very evident that the *Point of Jesus,* the *Christian Statesman,* of M. A. Gault, F. Shepard, to not think the statement far sweeping, that the Supreme Court has established a national religion. Not only has the particular religion but the national religion been specifically designated as the special tenet of that religion which must be enforced is named and its name is Sunday, to, "What next?" be the enforcement by the General Government of that religion?

MR. CRAFTS and the *American Sabbath Union* have been persistently repelled with an act of injured innocency the charges that their desired Sunday legislation. The writer heard Mr. Crafts, in a speech before Seventh-day Adventists and others, for the movement. To make the deception more complete, he demanded all organizations in religion so wrong. After the lecture, Professor Coleman, a prohibition Scholar, Reformer, was asked why in his opinion, only as a basis for his desired Sunday legislation. Director-General Davis in a letter, before the congressional committee that the brewers and distillers would willingly pay a large amount to have the Fair gates closed on Sunday. Unasy and a large brewing company on the soil, and the *Christian Statesman,* commenting upon Mr. Davis's repartee, says:

> The idea may possibly find some persons to think that distillers, saloon-keepers, and wholesale liquor and beer dealers of Chicago have expressed the hope that the Exposition will not open on Sunday\u2014just what the Sunday-law advocate have always said would be the case.

This is simply another and a little more polity of noting that distillery-interests and Sunday observers by law are on the same side. The real motives for promoting World's Fair question, which is a fact. The brewers and distillers and spirit beverage of Sunday closing are "fighting and on my side." Not to speak of farmers, ranchers, athletes, agencies, infidels of various forms and colors, etc., etc., etc., (for the saloon element includes largely all these other classes.) But if it be asked of the company they are in, let them remember what Christian Sabbath Reform and Saloon say: "till put petitions together," they said; they and all these are reminded that they are on "the same side they keep," and the "bad work" they have been doing in making not so much more, but have "only planted their end."

If ever of all the law advocates of Sunday closing will now perhaps admit that this the movement is almost entirely characterized by the bad trails of those whom we for various reasons are most previously persuaded of the fact. The ground must fall in with him. A trust is known by the company he chooses to keep, and the company of the Sunday closers speaks for itself. To take advantage of the accidental, not intentional, agreement, as a consequence of this, is a course worthy only of those who are entirely unworthy of respect. Honesty demands and will resort to no such policy. Fair minded men will inquire why each class assumes the attitude described.

Saloon men favor the Sunday (and every other day) opening of saloons and Sunday closing of everything else that will patronage unfavorable, for them.

Sunday law advocates favor the Sunday closing of everything and the Sunday closing of everything else they counter in competition with church attendance, for the money, influence and worldly power they are willing to get through the churches.

But it now turns out that those Sunday closing advocates are favored with more than a share of "wretched company." As a matter of retaliation for the unjust and cruel reflections upon the State of Iowa, the saloon keepers of that State, as having already massed its influence forcing the Christian (!) Sunday law of Iowa, and continued a stronger and more general an enforcement of it that the force obtained. Milk wagons, street cars, boot and shoe establishments and everything, laid up a tight that not a wheel could squeal. A Portland Saturday Evening City life, of New York, and all to the credit of the saloon keepers and their law friends.

But a large company of ice cream and ice dealers of Chicago have expressed the hope that the Exposition will not open on Sunday\u2014just what the Sunday-law advocates have always said would be the case. Director-General Davis in a letter, before the congressional committee that the brewers and distillers would willingly pay a large amount to have the Fair gates closed on Sunday. Unasy and a large brewing company on the soil, and of the *Christian Statesman,* commenting upon Mr. Davis's repartee, says:

> The idea may possibly find some persons to think that distillers, saloon-keepers, and wholesale liquor and beer dealers of Chicago have expressed but even Sunday\u2014just what that the Sunday-law advocates have always said.

It is not at all strange that the writer of the above favors the bill, for the principle involved in both, is the very same\u2014the enforced observance of Sunday. The question is a religious one wholly naturally, and that done under its influence, and that done under the same ground the Sunday ice law should be, it could be set at rest of the enforcement of religious observance in general. The same principle applies to ice that applies to bread, and to food of all kinds, that not only in its restricted application. If the original amendment, the Blair Sunday Rest bill, the Breckinridge Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, the bill for prohibiting Sunday labor at the Exposition, and the Religious Government appropriation of religion at the Exposition, and the last, to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday, within the District. In all but slight variations of the same thing, they are all parts of a line of religious legislation.

Seventh-day Adventists oppose, not the Christian Sabbath, but any legislation for church attendance on any day, nor the church attendance of those who by all and others, in the exercise of their inalienable rights, but the union of religion with the State; the enforcement of religious institutions and customs by law; the civil penalties that must inevitably follow the establishment of religion by means of a faith which such a dependence on civil law can create, thus the power of religion on one side, with the power of the State on the other.

Reader, which class do you think is on the right side of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL?
