# Mr. Crafts and the Christian Nation.

MR. CRAFTS and the *American Sabbath Union* have been persistently repelled with an act of injured innocency, the charges that their desired Sunday legislation had any connection with religion. The writer heard Mr. Crafts, in a speech at Saratoga, distinctly and specifically deny, before Seventh-day Adventists and others, for whose special benefit the denial was made, that the movement was in any way religious, or even intended to be, demanding all organizations in religion so wrong. After the lecture, Professor Coleman, a prohibition Scholar, Reformer, was asked why in his opinion, these petitioners advocated the above closing, only as a basis for his desired Sunday legislation. But what has Mr. Crafts done to "expose the criticism which would result from placing his demand upon a religious basis?"

Now that Mr. Crafts finds the United States Supreme Court has declared this Nation to be a Christian Nation, he commands that the question of shutting the Exposition of April 30, by committing the Exposition to a religious act.

It is therefore legitimate to close the Exposition on the ground that this is a Christian Nation, and beyond the opening would cause, but also on the basis of religion.

Notwithstanding whatever may be bargained for, the middle course; the civil Sabbath track has at last been most completely changed, it would seem, extremely charing to the workers.
