# Women and the World's Fair.

JUST now much is being said both for and against the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday, and among those who urge its utterance in favor of open doors for the people on Sundays are women whose arguments display their large knowledge of public affairs and social movements as their philanthropic motives. They are women of the world at large as well as women who are well known to be among those men who have the good of humanity at heart. These women take a broad, reasoning, view of matters, women who do not hesitate to exercise their intelligence in the way while so many men are pursuing it in the interest of narrow policy of prejudice and mere sect interest.

One of these women is Mrs. May Wright Sewall of Indianapolis, a member of the Board of Commissioners of the State of Indiana, who at their last week's meeting made an extended argument for the opening of the great Fair. During the discussion, a Mrs. Mary Krout, of Indiana, stated that the Exposition should be open, since the look of the grounds were such that out-of-door places would be open. She believed that info and handsome buildings with exhibits in would be provided for the workers who wished to be drawn to Chicago then, and that there were many people who had only Sunday, always there, and who could not afford to lose time through the week to see the Fair, which should be accessible to all.

Another member of the Board of Commissioners, Mary W. Krout, coincided with Mrs. Sewall, and advocated the opening of the fair and similar departments, stating that the working classes might enjoy without losing a day's wages, which they could ill afford. She and that the majority of petitions against opening the Fair on Sunday came from women of the country districts who know nothing about the conditions and the needs of workingmen which prevails in large cities.

Here are the opinions from two other women, who are not members of any Board of Commissioners, but whose opinions, nevertheless, are good and have done weight, and have been invited in. Mrs. Clara Berwick Colby, editor of the *Woman's Tribune* of Cady Station, of New York: "It is said that the women who wish that exhibit which can serve the public through the week should have one day off. There are too many women who are like to so many laborers as and as their surroundings will be varied, they would have no opportunity of seeing the Fair, that as good mothers and patience of their time and patience would be light compared with the opportunity afforded. As to the ordinary laborers' lives, who spend your time on a farm, in a factory, or in an office, or with multitudes of young men and women who are trying to earn an honest living and, at the same time, to improve their minds, their intellectual rights,\u2014a claim more to be pitied even than those which merely protest against seeing the light of day. Those who can dispose of their time as they please should try to imagine what a Sunday at the World's Fair would be for a large class of their fellow-citizens, and not try to speak to the multitudes on popular reform and religion without losing some of their needless monopolies more impressive than those held by the trusts and syndicates."

Another is Mrs. Clara Berwick Colby, of Nebraska:

> For the Tribune the arguments for opening the Fair appear to have the weight of reason, justice, and common sense. Since the Fair was opened to the public on Sunday, it appears to the Tribune it is carrying its public spirit forward in the interest of the public for the Sabbath. The opportunities for both recreation and culture for the laboring men whose grounds will be enlarged on, as it will afford the working people their only chance to visit it and get the benefit of education and uplifting from it, and for whom no church privileges are provided, will have an exalted and a profitable rest. Let us not try to prevent what many regard as a day blessed day for its the elevation and education of the working classes. The Exhibition, the breathing places of Chicago, the only possible open places for the children of the poor who are herded together in tenement houses; and this, in summer, has been appropriated for the resting and recreation of the workers of cities, crowded tenements, high mortality, helpless, and great mortality, especially of children. These workingmen are entitled to have the Fair open for them on Sunday. They want it. Let it either be open entirely free or at a much reduced rate.

Nebraska can well feel proud of her broad and generous Mrs. Colby, who has surpassed all others in enthusiasm liberally and wisdom and furnish too good an example for both the young and old, the boring people in and about Chicago, than much of as she could roll upon the grounds on Sunday, she would her word has been a wise one. Just to the point is this editorial, "Charity's Queen," which she has placed in the issue of last week's paper, the chief of the Chippewa Indians\u2014*Inventory (Ash Gazette).*
