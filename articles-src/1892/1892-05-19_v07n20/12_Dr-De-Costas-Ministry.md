BUT sad as is the picture of a Christian minister consorting with lewd women, in order that he may testify against them, the incident has brought to the surface the fact that there are Christian ministers in New York who labor something as the Master himself did, for the moral uplifting and eternal salvation of even depraved women. Rev. Benjamin F. De Costa, Pastor of the Church of St. John the Evangelist, is one of this class. When the woman decoyed by the man who abdicated his ministerial office that he might act as "sheriff," was awaiting sentence, Dr. De Costa addressed a letter to the Court, saying: "I ask mercy for this poor creature, who is better than some of her accusers." A reporter sought an interview with the Doctor, and learned that he is Secretary of the White Cross Society, set on foot eight years ago in this country to keep men pure.

Of the woman convicted by Dr. Parkhurst's testimony, Dr. De Costa said:—

Women like Hattie Adams are the sad results of society as it exists at present. They are victims of present social conditions. You and I, as entities of society, as it breathes and moves and has its being to-day, are responsible, in greater or less degree, for the fall of the woman we are talking about.

Who shall throw the first stone? Shall it be you or I? In any event, shall humanitarians stone her? Shall God's priests and chosen ministers stand by and revile her?

I do not think so. If I did I should not be one of the organizers and the present head of the White Cross Society of the United States.

Years and years ago there was a woman taken in adultery. Nobody need be reminded of the verdict passed on her. What was Christ's charge to her?

Of the two men personally, we know nothing. Doubtless they are equally honest, but what Christian can doubt that Dr. De Costa's society is more nearly in harmony with the gospel of Christ than is the society whose agents depend on the civil law for the promotion of morality?
