# The Situation.

SOME twenty more informations for violations of the Sunday law of Pennsylvania have been lodged against newsboys, by the Law and Order League of Pittsburgh.

---

THAT last Sunday in April five thousand people paid twenty-five cents each for admittance to the World's Fair grounds in Chicago. "An admission fee," says the *Christian Statesman,* "is now regularly charged every day in the week, including Sundays. Hence, the concluding exercises, the World's Fair is 'already open on the Sabbath.'"

---

ON the admission of the public to the World's Fair grounds on Sunday for pay, the *Statesman* has this:—

> The action of the local Directory virtually anticipates the settlement of the question that is pending before the superior officers, the national Commission and the national Congress. While this act is not actually contrary to these, since no act of Congress has officially declared against Sunday, it is in stay for the act of the churches, which have petitioned for the closing of the Fair upon American customs, not greed and foreign habits, and in the interests of moral welfare, and the Directory for God's law and the convictions of the churches as against business of traffic should be added to the funds of the Fair.

---

CONTINUING the discussion of the Sunday opening of the Fair grounds, the *Statesman* says:—

> There can be no doubt that the Directory was emboldened to this act by the fact that the Commission has timidly and evasively laid on the table and shelved the question of Sunday opening and liquor selling, which in all fairness should have been settled this spring or earlier, before those having relations to the Fair turn on its decisions of these questions, have erected their buildings for as far as the Fair.

---

WAXING exceedingly wroth at the imaginary indignity done by the local authority (directors) of the World's Fair, the *Statesman* says:—

> The churches, whose opposition to the Fair, in case of its becoming a second capital of evil, the Commission seeks to postpone until it will be too late even for congressional commandment. "Thou shalt not suffer thyself to be hoodwinked." Sabbath reform for rectory and Commission have seen the churches are riding roughshod, without a murmur from them, by politics and commerce; that they think the proverb, "The trodden worm will turn," has no application to religious and reform organizations. It is to be hoped that the churches will remember that, while Christ was meek and lowly in spirit, he also, on occasion, "a scourging of small cords," and that "the armed alliance of all who call upon his name," the several alliances of all who love our world's cause or breast. Heaven surely is not inferior to one "Horseman." By what right the machinery of Christ "in resisting this attack on our Christian civilization."

Just how the churches have so often been "trodden on" in this country is not easy to see. They have always been perfectly free to carry on their propagandist work in their own ways; they have had several acts of protection from the State in the way of laws against disturbing religious meetings, and have, for the most part, been free from taxation. How have they been "trodden on"?

The only way in which the churches have been "trodden on" in this country, is that they have, as churches, been allowed to have been "trodden on." Have the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, and other fraternities likewise been "trodden on," because they have been compelled to act politically as individuals and not as secret organizations? It is the political power of the churches; and the assertion that they have an assertion that the churches should rule. And this is just what National Reform means; and it is just what the *Christian Statesman* advocates.

---

IN view of the great wrong (in which) the churches have suffered by not being allowed to dictate to the State and to give laws to the Nation, the *Statesman* asks, "What can we do?" and in the energy of despair says:—

> Let us turn more earnestly than ever to Congress. We have been unfortunate, but not over-confident, at this critical moment, when action in Congress is doubly expected, the little net of Brooklyn is dismantled, that has set as many thousands in its commissions as the friends of the Lord's day. Our edition is just now sending more petitions to Congress than we, who are having already massed its few rounds of ammunition till it could tell on the public side on the very verge of the battle. The Lord of the Lord's day will win. So send on many of many. WHITE. No predictions are presumptuous in such a contest, for "He" makes no missions; but letters especially to congressmen and senators.

The *Statesman's* reference to a prominent feature of the battle of Bunker Hill is unfortunate for the National Reform side, for the illustration is more nearly true to life than Mr. Crafts thought, for he never would have used it. In this case the Bunker Hill of the defenders of liberty are, as compared with those who would overthrow it, but very few in number; their petitions are likewise few, but they battle for the right, and though like their ancestors at Bunker Hill they meet most temporary defeat, their noble stand will leave the seeds of defeat of tyranny. The *Statesman* should remember "that two can not be out of the earth, one the battle is the strong." God fights on the side, not of the majority, but for the right, and it will finally triumph. Truth will be vindicated, liberty maintained.

But the *Statesman* is not done; it says:—

> In the May meetings, which includes the great Anniversary Conferences of the Methodist and Congregational churches, the national Baptist Society, and many Sabbath school conventions and other gatherings of philanthropic interest, the supervision of the Directory and the duty of the Commission will be discussed, and prominent men will ask also especially more drastic measures. Let each before retire to aid in the erecting of the building or in the preparation of any religious congress until the question of Sunday closing is settled, and let every Christian be advised to accept no position as a member of any advisory board.
