BUT the fact of the guilt of this wicked and depraved woman, does not justify a Christian minister in prostituting his powers to so base a purpose as enticing women to indecent acts in order that he may become a competent witness against them. The gospel commission is to preach, not to prosecute. A minister of Christ has no authority to play the detective.
