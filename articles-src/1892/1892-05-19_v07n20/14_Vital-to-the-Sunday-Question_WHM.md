In its issue of April 14, THE SENTINEL published, under the title, "The Supreme Court and a National Religion," a comment upon a portion of Justice Brewer's decision in the case of the Hector of Holy Trinity. The article closed with the words, "So the Supreme Court of the United States champions an establishment of religion. What next?" It has been said of this expression that it was too sweeping and would not be borne out by the conclusions of others as to the meaning, scope, and effect of the decision. As to whether this is so or not let the Pearl of Days answer when it says, May 7, of Judge Brewer's decision, that it establishes clearly the fact that our Government is Christian. This decision is vital to the Sunday question in all its aspects, and places that question among the most important issues now before the American people. Similar decisions have been given by highest judicial authority, from time to time, but the new form in which it was recently presented gives the conclusion of the court increased emphasis. And this important decision rests upon the fundamental principle that religion is imbedded in the organic structure of the American Government—a religion that recognizes, and is bound to maintain, Sunday as a day for rest and worship.

While the Christian Statesman, of May 7, says of what it calls a sophistical petition "against the commitment of the United States Government to a union of religion and the State by the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation." We would refer any one in or out of Congress who is deceived by this chaff to the two unanimous opinions of the United States Supreme Court on this subject, considered by Mr. Justice Field on March 16, 1885 (113 U. S. 10), the other by Mr. Justice Brewer on February 29, 1892, the last of which shows that the Sabbath laws are a part of our American Christian institutions, etc.

It was very largely on the ground of its accord with this decision of Justice Brewer's that Elliott F. Shepard pleaded before the House Committee on the World's Fair that Congress should condition its appropriation upon the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, saying, "It will be in accordance with the Constitution and laws of this country to provide by act of Congress that the Columbian Exhibition or Columbian Exposition shall not be opened to the public on Sunday," and, as evidence that it might properly so do, quoting the line of commissions, colonial grants, and charters, from monarchs who assumed to be the head of the Church as well as of the State, which Mr. Justice Brewer cites as a portion of his series of "organic utterances that this is a Christian Nation."

It is very evident that the Pearl of Days, the Christian Statesman, and Mr. Elliott F. Shepard, do not think the statement too sweeping, that the Supreme Court has championed an establishment of religion. Not only that but the particular religion established is specified, and already the especial tenet of that religion which must be enforced is named. Will the answer to, "What next?" be the enforcement by the central Government of that religious tenet?
