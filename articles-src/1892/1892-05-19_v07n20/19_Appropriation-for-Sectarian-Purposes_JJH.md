ACCORDING to Judge Brewer's decision Christianity is recognized by our national Government. The City Council of Omaha, Neb., must have been reading the learned Judge's decisions, for as reported by the Omaha daily Bee of April 20, 1892, the City Council passed a resolution appropriating the sum of $275 to defray the expense of a reception to be given the ministers composing the Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, to assemble in that city some time in May. The Mayor opposed the resolution as being illegal, and proposed to raise the amount by private donations, and gave his check for $25, as a starter, but the Council imbibing the spirit and theory of National Reform unanimously passed the resolution over the Mayor's veto, and returned the Mayor his check for $25. Thus as our Supreme Judges recognize Christianity as the religion of the General Government, the City Council of Omaha goes in one better (and a logical step too) and recognizes the Christianity of Methodism as the religion of the great State of Nebraska, and is consistent too, by supporting it out of the public funds by equal taxation. Let every liberty loving citizen of Nebraska protest.
