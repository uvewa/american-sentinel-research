# The American Sabbath.

A COMMENCEMENT of the Sabbath. Rev. writing from Orevillle, Cal., says that there are some very strange ideas advanced concerning Sunday and the World's Fair, and gives for an example this from V. I. Farwell, who says:

> As the Fair is national, to which our contributions national also, it seems only fair to exhibit the American Sabbath along with our multiform products of art and industry.

"The Recorder's" correspondent then comments as follows:

> Now if, as Mr. Farwell says, this is an American Sabbath, we have it not from the Jews on Saturday. I understand that anything made by Americans is American. If a man should put an American roof on his house, would it keep out the rain any better? It has a right, claims that is a purely American, surely it, Mr. Farwell says, is an American Sabbath, it has no way a claim to having made it. Neither does the national any more than any other Nation's art.

> As the Americans put it on exhibition, place it there that the world may critically examine.

> Why not? I think it would look well there. The Sabbath would at least need no building to be properly exhibited. That building is for the display of our products of labor, and is to be exhibited it is to labor no more. May not another institution, that of rest from labor, be exhibited in a way, and is not our one there. Is anything sacred or holy or peculiar in the exhibition, that an institution with an exhibition, and let the Commission, by all means take a sample of our Sunday-closing business at once, which grows more beautifully on Sunday than any other day.

> The last time I saw our Sunday closing business was in the legislature of Kansas, and looking at it as it was in the closing times we had here in California a few years ago; but the Exposition would be a better place to lay down our themes as at banquet. I do not know as I would be able to say anything on it at the Fair, or what is to be done there. But let us by all means keep it away from the Fair as they threaten to do.\u2014*Sabbath Recorder.*
