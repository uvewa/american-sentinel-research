The last Sunday in April five thousand people paid twenty-five cents each for admittance to the World's Fair grounds in Chicago. "An admission fee," says the Christian Statesman, "is now regularly charged every day in the week, including Sundays." Hence, that paper concludes, the World's Fair is "already open on the Sabbath."
