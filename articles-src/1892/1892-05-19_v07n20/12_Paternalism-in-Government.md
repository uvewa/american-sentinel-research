# Paternalism in Government.

THE *Post,* an independent paper of Washington, D. C., publishes the following article under the heading, "The Concord":

Robert Lee, as temporary chairman of the Democratic convention in the State of Virginia, has made what the dispatches call a "remarkable speech." In the course of his remarks he made a demonstration of the growing spirit of paternalism in the National Government in these days, when the Government has a disposition to make a bogy of public discussion.

We treat these as though they were children and are not the men and women and citizens of the country. We have almost lost the capacity for self-government, that self-government which our great forefathers formed upon the basis of personal liberty and liberty for every individual in this country to preserve their independence.

> How far off it is, whether it be in the regulation of our commerce, or in our tariff laws, reaching close upon and dangerous facts of our national life.

We treat these as though they were children and involved in a difficulty with a neighbor, he can not go for a physician, he can not call for an old-fashioned attorney and submittal for permission to attend to his own case; but an entirely incompetent attorney has the right to step between himself and a draught only himself, or become interested in a farm, or a shop, he must get his permission from the Government before he can operate it; he must know what is wrong with his horse when it is sick and he must get permission to call the farrier; if a small dairy grow in his field without interfering with his neighbor, he cannot have it; if, in the majesty of the law, a wool commissioner. He can not treat himself for a cold without an approved physician, or be buried by any one but a licensed undertaker.

The tendency of politics this way is in the hands of a good for power, which threatens to engulf the last vestige of American liberty. A man may not be a man to social order or calling in the name of everything that threatens humanity. These things are amply designed to show the increasing tendency to force upon the people what the Governmental or political powers that be deem for the relation of the Government to the will of the people to be the best for them. There is in progress now the more creation of centralized authority.

Such a centralized authority already exists in the conversion of the railroad and telegraph systems of the country into political machines, operated under State in the passage of any bill or a resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way commanding the Government in a course of religious legislation. "These deep printed thinks can obtain them by writing directly to W. H. McKee, Secretary, International Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich.
