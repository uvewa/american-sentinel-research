ACCORDING to the St. Paul Dispatch, of April 25, the ministers of that city have inaugurated a crusade against "the corruption prevalent in official circles." The meeting was a private one, and "a considerable portion of the morning's meeting was devoted to injunctions to secrecy and admonitions to 'keep this out of the papers,'" but "no adequate precautions had been taken, to keep the papers, or their representatives, out of the meeting." A Dispatch reporter was present. He was, he says, "thoughtfully provided with a chair, and it was not until the meeting began to thoroughly warm up that he discovered that he was not really supposed to be there. He felt a trifle uncomfortable when he first made this discovery, but he stayed on because he was so deeply interested in the meeting, and because he was really gratified to know that it could not be told by his looks that he was the only layman present." The reporter was honorable, however, and did not reveal the secrets, so we are left to surmise what they were. The fact that such meetings are held, is, however, significant in itself. Another significant thing is that the ministers determined not to make the saloon issue prominent, believing that there were worse evils. They are probably gunning for open fairs and Sunday papers. The saloon always sinks into insignificance beside "Sunday desecration."
