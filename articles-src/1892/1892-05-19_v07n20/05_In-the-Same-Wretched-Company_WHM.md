# In the Same "Wretched Company."

THE advocates of Sunday laws have frequently attempted to cast a stigma upon the body of believers known as Seventh-day Adventists, as persons of a morally and generally disreputable people, because they, as keepers of the seventh day classes, have opposed Sunday legislation, through motives of pure self interest. These charges have often been refuted, but the persistence in doing so has been to cast an unjust reflection upon a people who religiously and conscientiously oppose that which they believe ever has enslaved and always will enslave, religious liberty in the State.

One of these Sunday law advocates, the Rev. M. A. Gault, agent for the American Sabbath Union for Michigan, who has of late been making considerable of this sort of reflection upon this people, has been answered, in a letter addressed to his course by an editor of a secular paper in Michigan. The Michigan *Advocate* upon which he offered the following application is on file in this office.

> A recent issue of the Seventh-day Adventist at their State meeting at Lansing, passed a resolution against Sunday opening of the Fair and do not deserve to be placed with the foregoing they favor opening of the Fair on Sunday.

But for all this\u2014for all that morally they do not deserve to be placed with the foregoing\u2014the same unfair and unjust American Sabbath Union pursuits in doing them this moral injustice. Continuing in his paper Mr. Gault says:

> But we did say, and still affirm, that the Seventh-day Adventist people are opposed to the *Christian Sabbath,* and are among the interest of those who oppose its legal protection by civil enactments, against saloon-keepers, anarchists, infidels of various forms and colors.

But the advocates of Sunday laws have every reason on condition that religion is to be expected to adopt the attitude that they are not moral on every other day in the week.

"Boycott" is a hated word, because abused, but no other word can indicate that they are not the same.

If this does not show the Satanic spirit that animates those who, while calling themselves "Christians" would adopt unchristian methods to coerced others to comply with their demands, then nothing could show it. The boycott is unchristian; and not only unchristian, but the boycotts in unchristian to aid only to remain away from the Fair, but to organize to keep others from it on the basis for the same day and in every feature of it that can be visited by the purchase of tickets of admission on Sunday. The Scriptures say, "Avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath"; "Dearly beloved, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." It is also the spirit of anti-christ. The Lord has no controversy with those who merely set legitimate business on Sunday.

W. H. M.
