REV. FRANCIS W. WARE, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the State of Michigan, says that the American Sabbath Union is "not altogether a religious organization," though admitting it to be a creation of the different branches of the "evangelical" churches. These churches, then, have given birth to something not altogether religious. God's plan in the beginning was that every tree should bear fruit after its kind, and such is still the invariable law of nature. What can it mean that these churches are evolving something not altogether religious? What is the matter with the churches?
