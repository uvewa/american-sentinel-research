# Church and State Notes.

THE Manhattan, Kan., *Mercury* thinks that "the name of Christ is able to take care of itself" and that "every true American believes in the separation of Church and State."

---

AN exchange remarks that it is significant that every shop-keeper in Chicago who is alive to "business interests" favors the World's Fair closed on Sunday. Likewise the proprietors of all the near-by saloons.

---

AN argument was made on the 1st inst. to enforce the "Sunday law in Saginaw, Mich.," was "a dispatch to the *Detroit Free Press* remarks, 'it was stated that there was more excitement and a great number of 'drunks' than usual.'"

---

REV. FRANK W. WARD, Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union for the State of Michigan, says that the American Sabbath Union is "not altogether a religious organization," though admitting it to be a creation of the different churches, and to be supported by them. Those churches, then, have given birth to something that has outgrown its parents; the plan in the beginning was that every one should bear fruit after its kind, and such is still the invariable law of nature. What it means is that these churches are evolving something not altogether religious? What is the matter with the churches?

---

In explaining why the American Sabbath Union had voted not to allow different faiths, same gentleman, in a lecture delivered at Battle Creek, Mich., April 24, stated that the Sunday Sabbath for some reason one other has come to pass that "the churches can not handle it alone." That is to say that these "evangelical" churches, of which about 15 or more of its full strength members, are not quite capable of performing their own work and maintaining their religious institutions alone, but just now when they have become extremely stronger than ever before, they require must receive assistance from the State; must have some outside force to help them keep the Sabbath they profess to so greatly love and serve. What, again we ask, is the matter with the churches?

---

If there were not many in these churches who are lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, who have not the moral energy, who, in short, are unsecured, and not whose affections are upon the things of the world rather than on things above, would there be this demand on the part of the churches for worldly assistance? Is not this the trouble with the churches?

SOME weeks ago we said: "Christianity fostered and supported by a civil government must come to be Christianity." Upon this one of our cotemporary exchanges, with National Reform proclivities, makes this inquiry: "Would you have the civil government and Christianity continue with one another?" This is evidently intended as a repudiation. It seems, however, only to reveal the colossal ignorance of our opponent upon this whole subject.

GOVERNMENT, like marriage, is a divine, but not a Christian institution. Like marriage, we are entitled to share its blessings. It belongs as much to the Jew and the infidel and the atheist as to the Christian. Government has nothing to do with religion, any more than it has to do with Odd-fellowship or Freemasonry. It simply secures to all their natural rights, or the government which it knows, or at least should know, neither Jew nor Christian, but only citizens. The kind human government that it really would neither oppress nor favor any religion, that simply of its soul motions alone as entirely outside its sphere.

WHILE in attendance at a meeting at the International Executive Board of the Knights of Labor, at Pittsburg, Pa., Mr. Powderly said to a reporter:\u2014

> I think the World's Fair should be as open to the working man on any other day, as Sunday is the only day of labor as born to enjoy the blessed boon of a holiday.

---

It is a significant fact that notwithstanding the persistent efforts of the Sunday forces to induce the great unions of labor to labor demande Sunday closing, of all the petitions with which Congress has been flooded for Sunday closing of the Fair, but not one has been presented representing a body of laboring men.

THIS *Christian Advocate,* of this city, has in its issue of March 25, this statement:

> A man in this neighborhood, wishing to set an example to those less faithful in attending church, this belong to the Methodist Episcopal church.

It is just fair to say that this statement is merely made on the basis of a question, and that in replying to the inquiry the *Advocate* says:

> These persons visited the Disciplines of the Methodist Episcopal church. *They are ordered* by the appliances of the Discipline.

It might, however, be well for the Methodists, and some other churches as well, to get their own dooryards thoroughly cleaned before they again charge those who conscientiously oppose all Sunday laws with being allies of the saloons. An application of a liquor license might search the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the lakes to the gulf, he would not find one Seventh-day Adventist willing to sign his petition, yet, because of their opposition to Sunday laws Adventists are classed with about all that is evil.

THAT Sunday Observance Conference at Keyport, N. J., held a meeting recently, at which reports from various committees were listened to. The committees to wait upon Mr. Cornell, of the Keyport Steamboat Company, to ask him not to run his boat to New York on Sunday during the summer, reported that Mr. Cornell stated that the Sabbath committee should consult the farmers in reference to the receiving and shipping of produce on Sunday. The committees resolved to enforce the law upon those who laid their pleasure of business open the previous Sabbath.

In a recent meeting held in this city in behalf of Sunday observances, of the religious commission, thereof, President of the American Sabbath Union, is reported by the *Mail and Express* as speaking "of the revolutions and reverses which mark the fourth commandment, that man must so fight on not one continuous period of one rest, and would be rewarded with infinite patience in the end." Had this piece appeared in any other paper there might be a surprise that something had not been left out. But we are advised by a former contributor in these pages, and put into mouth words which to any right-thinking mind are blasphemous. It we must believe Mr. Shepard now advocates keeping "one continuous rest with part of time." It seems to us, that at all times, the thing is quite impossible, no man lives long enough to do that. The folly of his by summoning juntas the Colonel. Is quite our warmly! of the thing is brought to mind. If the individual, the difficulty is equally great, for so man has been able of more the few days, himself can not keep one continuous a seventh part of his time. Any man who wishes can keep a distinct attitude as to his time, or a seventh part in regular periods, but to keep a continuous one seventh part of time is out of the question. The Colonel should had requires of his disciples impossibilities.
