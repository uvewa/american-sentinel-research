SOME weeks ago we said: "Christianity fostered and supported by a civil government ceases to be Christianity." Upon this one of our country exchanges, with National Reform proclivities, makes this inquiry: "Would you have the civil government and Christianity enemies with one another?" This is evidently intended as a squelcher. It serves, however, only to reveal the colossal ignorance of our querist upon this whole subject.

GOVERNMENT, like marriage, is a divine, but not a Christian institution. Like marriage, all are entitled to share its blessings. It belongs as much to the infidel and the atheist as to the Christian. Government has nothing to do with religion any more than it has to do with Odd-fellowship or Freemasonry. It simply secures to all their natural rights, or rather, the free exercise of those rights. The government knows, or at least should know, neither Jew nor Christian, but only citizens. The ideal human government would neither oppose nor foster any religion, but simply let such matters alone as entirely outside its sphere.
