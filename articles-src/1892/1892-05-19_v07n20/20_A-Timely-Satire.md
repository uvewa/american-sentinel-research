THE Christian Cynosure, of Chicago, last week contained this paragraph:—

The Chicago City Council, with its customary effrontery, instructed the Mayor to close all the offices of the City Hall on the 17th of March (in Patrick's day) and to declare it a holiday; and the Mayor obeyed. At the Baptist Ministers' meeting on the 4th instant, Dr. P. S. Henson presented a resolution, that "this conference of Baptist ministers imperatively demands that, if the precedent thus established by our City Council is to be followed in the future, St. Andrew shall have a memorial day in deference to the feelings of our Scottish fellow-citizens, and that William Penn shall be similarly honored in deference to the Quakers, and Roger Williams in deference to the Baptists, and John Wesley in deference to the Methodists, and John Calvin in deference to the Presbyterian, and Martin Luther in deference to the Lutherans; and if there be any other race or religion that can claim enough voters to be an influential factor at the polls, then the representatives of such a race or religion shall each have the privilege of naming any patron saint or reverend ecclesiant in whose honor the city offices shall be closed once a year—if there be days enough in the calender to serve the purpose." The satire of this resolution is as timely as it is pointed and deserved.

Now that this resolution of the Chicago Baptists has opened the eyes of the Cynosure to the folly of legislation, by city or State, on the ground of religious preferences, perhaps it will have less to say than formerly about legislation in favor of Sunday. And perhaps it will not. How different would it sound if Congress, or any other body with legislative power, should order all places of business, within the limits of their authority, closed on Sunday in deference to the wishes of a certain class of religionists who demand it? Then let some Henson frame a resolution that the same body pass a law that all places of business be closed on the seventh day in deference to the religious preferences of Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists and Jews, and on Friday in deference to the conscientious practices of the Mohammedans, etc. Would not the satire be as timely, pointed, and deserved? When will well-meaning men learn that all religious legislation is class legislation and is a menace to all religious and civil liberty, and so is a direct sword thrust at the foundation principles of our Government?—Sabbath Recorder.
