In view of the great wrong (?) which the churches have suffered by not being allowed to dictate to the State and to give laws to the Nation, the Statesman asks, "What can we do?" and in the energy of despair says:—

Let us turn more earnestly than ever to Congress, whose action alone can be final. Sad to say, at this critical moment, when action in Congress is daily expected, the little sect of Seventh-day Adventists, that has not as many thousands in its constituency as the friends of the Lord's day have millions, is just now sending more petitions to Congress than we, having shrewdly reserved its few rounds of ammunition till it could see the whites of our eyes on the very verge of battle. The Lord of the Lord's day calls to us, like the sound of many waters, "WHITE." Not petitions only (duplicated for Senate and House and Commission) but letters especially to congressmen and senators should be sent at once.

The Statesman's reference to a prominent feature of the battle of Bunker Hill is unfortunate for the National Reform side, for the illustration is more nearly true to life than Mr. Crafts thought, else he never would have used it. In this case as at Bunker Hill the defenders of liberty are, as compared with those who would overthrow it, only a very small number; their petitions are likewise few, but they battle for the right, and though like their ancestors at Bunker Hill they may meet temporary defeat, their noble stand will have all the moral effect of a victory. The Statesman should remember "that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong." God fights, not for the majority, but for the right, and it will finally triumph. Truth will be vindicated, if not before, at the final Judgment.

But the Statesman is not done; it says:—

In the May meetings, which include the great General Conference of the Methodist Church, and the Assemblies of all the Presbyterian churches, and many Sabbath school conventions and other religious gatherings, not only protests against the action of the Directory and the delay of the Commission, and appeals to Congress should be adopted, but also and especially more drastic measures. Let such bodies refuse to aid in the erection of any building or in the preparation of any religious congress until the question of Sunday opening is settled, and let every Christian be advised to accept no position as a member of any advisory board in any World's Fair "Parliament" or "Congress," except on condition that religion is to be respected by Sabbath closing.

Boycott is a hated word, because abused, but no Christian will seriously declare that there are not institutions that ought to be boycotted. If the World's Fair with Sunday opening should not fail, it would boom Sabbath-breaking all over the world for a century. In case of opening, friends of the Sabbath would be bound not only to shun it as they would a Sunday saloon, but to fight it as they would an invading army whose avowed purpose was to crush American Christian institutions.

If this does not show the Satanic spirit that actuates those who, while calling themselves "Christian" would adopt unchristian methods to compel others to comply with their demands, then nothing could show it. The boycott is unchristian and never can be anything else. The proposition is not only to remain away from the Fair on Sunday, but to boycott it on every day and in every feature if it is open on Sunday. That is if in the estimation of these Sunday zealots the managers of the Fair do wrong on Sunday they will see to it that they are punished on Monday. They forget that the Scripture says, "Average not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." Or perhaps they realize that the Lord has no controversy with those who carry on legitimate business on Sunday, and so fear to leave the matter in his hands. They have robbed God of his own sacred memorial of the finished creation, have, as it were, forced upon him another day—the sun's day—and fearing that God does not accept the substitute, they propose to bolster it up by boycott, legislative enactments, police regulations, etc.
