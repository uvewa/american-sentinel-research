THE Washington Post, of May 10, says that "the usual flood of petitions in reference to the World's Fair was poured into the regular channel of the Senate yesterday morning." The Post remarks that the petitions were about equally divided in their requests that Congress should, and should not, take action to close the World's Fair on Sunday, and suggestively notes that a "mass-meeting of Protestant clergymen, of Tennessee," arrays itself in favor of enforced religion at the Exposition, and a company of "Babbath-keepers," of Vermont, in opposition.
