THE New York Legislature is a droll body of lawmakers. It has passed a bill appropriating $300,000 for a World's Fair exhibit, but commanding that the exhibit be closed on Sunday. Immediately after this display of Puritanism the same Legislature appropriated $50,000 annually toward the maintenance of the Natural History Museum in New York City upon the express stipulation that it should be kept open on Sunday. Explanations are in order.—Ottumwa World.

Apropos of the foregoing is the fact that the same Legislature which was zealous for Sunday sacredness in Chicago, legalized fishing in Jamaica Bay, L. I. It is still very naughty to fish anywhere in New York State except in Jamaica Bay. Such facts illustrate the utter absurdity of legislating upon such subjects.
