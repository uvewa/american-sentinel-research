THERE has been introduced in both the Senate and House "A bill to prohibit the delivery and sale of ice within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday."

The bill would enact—

That from, and after the passage of this act, it shall be unlawful to sell or deliver ice in any quantity or quantities, by means of wagons or other vehicles, on the public streets or thoroughfares or at depots or offices within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday.

SECTION 2. That any person or corporation violating the provisions of this act shall be liable to a penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars for each offense, upon conviction in the police court of the District of Columbia.

SECTION 3. That acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act be, and the same are hereby, repealed.

Upon this bill being submitted to the District Commissioners for their approval, they recommended the striking out of the words "at depots or offices," and the insertion, after the word "Sunday," the words, "nor at depots or offices of ice companies except between the hours of five and nine o'clock A. M., and five and six o'clock P. M., on that day."

In reference to this bill a communication to the Washington Evening Star, of April 29, says:—

From a purely humanitarian standpoint it is to be hoped that the bill recently introduced to prohibit the sale or delivery of ice on Sunday will become a law, and, while the matter is under consideration and the rights of the working people are being considered, I think it a timely suggestion that the sale or delivery of groceries on Sunday can readily be dispensed with. . . . It would be a shame to work mules on the canal as these boys and young men are worked. They would take it as a great boon if only these Sunday hours of labor were taken from them. While the sympathy of our large hearted legislators is going out toward oppressed humanity, I hope it will be broad enough to take in this class of laborers, by enacting a law that will relieve them from Sunday work.

It is not at all strange that the writer of this communication ardently desires the success of the Sunday too bill, for the principle involved in both is the same, and if one were passed the other would follow naturally, and the door being opened for that class of legislation, no limit could be set short of the enactment of the whole line of religious legislation asked. The same principle applies to this that applies to all. This differs from all the rest only in its restricted application. The religious clause in the Blair Educational amendment, the Blair Sunday Rest bill, the local Sunday bill for the District of Columbia, the bill forbidding appropriation of money to expositions which open on Sunday, the proviso conditioning Government appropriation to the World's Fair upon Sunday closing, and this last, to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday in the District, are all but slight variations of the same thing, a persistent attempt to lead Congress to commit itself to a line of religious legislation, which, having once entered upon, it must follow and obey the behest of the majority of religionists, with the same zeal with which congressmen conform to the political views of their constituents.

Those who have been instrumental in the presentation of this Sunday ice bill are saying that now a bill has been drafted which no one can oppose. Why not? It is only a smaller edition of the same thing. It does not vary at all from the "bill to prevent persons from being forced to labor on Sunday in the District of Columbia," except that the one is an attempt to secure a sweeping Sunday law which shall include all forms of labor and secular occupation, while this specifies one, and thus paves the way for other special enactments, which will at length reach the full requirements of the general act. But the extent of the application of the act is not the question. The character of the legislation asked is vicious. If the requirements of the bill were so restricted as to apply to but one man in the District of Columbia, instead of to one occupation, the thing asked would be just as evil, and in its present form is just as pernicious as its predecessor, the local Sunday bill, which applies to all occupations. This same course of narrowing down the legislation asked, to single occupations, has been followed elsewhere, though in other places it has usually been the barbers who have been used as here it is attempted to use the icemen. If this bill were passed, the next would apply to groceries and grocery clerks, as foreshadowed in the communication to the Evening Star.

It is claimed that there can be no valid ground for opposition to this measure, because it is purely civil. Is it? It forbids the sale of ice "within the District of Columbia on the Sabbath day, commonly known as Sunday." Suppose, in the interests of accuracy, it were proposed to amend this to read, "on Sunday, erroneously called the Sabbath," would the framers of the bill accept it? By no means. Why not? Because it would decide that Sunday is not the Sabbath. What, then, does it do in its present form? It asks Congress to decide that Sunday is the Sabbath. It is a religious bill.
