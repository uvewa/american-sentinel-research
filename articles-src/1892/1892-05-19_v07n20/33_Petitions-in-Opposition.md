THIS Congress has been besieged with petitions from the advocates of religious legislation begging for the passage of the different measures for the enforcement of Sunday observance before it, but more especially that Congress should take some action which would result in closing the World's Fair on Sunday. Congressmen who recognize the impropriety of any such legislation by Congress have asked, "Are there no petitions in opposition to this?" Of late such petitions have begun to be heard, mostly worded as follows, "We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully but decidedly, protest against the Congress of the United States committing the United States Government to a union of religion and the State in the passage of any bill or resolution to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, or in any other way committing the Government to a course of religious legislation." Those who desire printed blanks can obtain them by writing to A. O. Tait, Corresponding Secretary National Religious Liberty Association, Battle Creek, Mich.
