The *Dispatch*, of Pittsburg, reports the member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, who, in 1889, introduced the bill for the repeal of certain portions of the Sunday law of 1794 as saying:—

I think my bill could be passed now without any trouble. For one thing, the crusade against the Sunday papers had not yet been inaugurated in 1889, and neither the people nor the Legislature realized the extremes to which the informers were capable of going. Why, I have been a church warden for over twenty years, and at least fairly regular in attendance on service, but I would sooner think of doing without my breakfast on Sunday than without my daily paper. It is a necessity of our civilization, and we can not do without it.

THE SENTINEL would not be understood as justifying the reading of secular papers every day in the week. Such papers ought to be banished from Christian homes on the Sabbath; but that does not justify suppressing them by civil law. True, Sabbath keeping is an individual matter, and the man who keeps the Sabbath as enjoined in Isa. 58:13, will have no use on that day for the secular news; neither will he need a civil law to bolster up his tottering morality. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it."
