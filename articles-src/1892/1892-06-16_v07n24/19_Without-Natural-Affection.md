THE London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children recently made a public report which is horrifying to all who have not lost their natural affections. A noticeable feature of the report is that it reveals the fact that the worst and most frequent cases of cruelty are found among the so-called better classes of English society. One woman shut her little daughter, naked, in a dark closet, tied in such a manner that she died of suffocation. This woman is said not to have been an exceptional monster. English parents have been known to put pins and lighted matches in the nostrils of their children. One baby of seven months was bitten until it was half covered with blood. A boy of six years had a rope tied around his neck and he was repeatedly thrown into a canal. The perpetrators of these cruelties plead that they have a right to give their children moral discipline for the good of their immortal souls! And yet people imagine we are living in a very intelligent and altogether superior age, when burning, or even imprisoning or whipping people to save them is entirely out of the question! The fact is, that if human nature is undergoing any change, it is becoming worse; and this conclusion agrees exactly with 2 Tim. 3: 1-5.
