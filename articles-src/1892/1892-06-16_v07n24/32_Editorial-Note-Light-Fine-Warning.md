THE light fine imposed by the Judge in the case of the four Adventists, referred to on another page of this paper, must not be understood as indicating a purpose on his part to discourage the prosecution of such cases or the finding of indictments for Sunday work. On the contrary, the Judge warned the prisoners that if they persisted in Sunday work in the future, the situation would resolve itself into a question of the relative strength of the law and of those who violated it, and that in such a contest the Court could take but one course.
