THE annual summer revival of the Sunday laws of Asbury Park has begun, and this time it has the electric street cars to attack. The Sun, of June 6, has the following:

"In spite of strong protests made by clergymen and church members here, the cars of the Seashore Electric Railway Company were running all day. A. S. Hickley, the Superintendent of the line, has published notices to the effect that in deference to the wishes of the people, as expressed in a petition sent to the officers of the company, the cars will be run on Sundays until further notice. The people who are opposed to Sunday traffic and travel threaten to apply to the State authorities. The cottage owners at North Asbury Park are deeply incensed at the attempt to stop the cars, and they in turn threaten that if they can not have Sunday cars that they will cause the arrest and prosecution of all merchants and livery stable men who do business on the Sabbath. As the ancient Blue Laws are still on the statute books, the liberals, as they are called, can make a great deal of trouble. The liberals met at the cottage of one of their members last night, and after a long discussion, decided to have the Sunday laws strictly enforced in case the church people should succeed in having the cars stopped on that day. No little amount of bad feeling has been already caused. The charter of the company, which was granted by the Board of Commissioners of the town, gives it the right to run cars on Sundays."
