THE evidence now in, even if there were no other proof, is sufficient to show, that, whatever value the party of religious legislation places upon the legislative expression it had from the House of Representatives on May 25 and 26, if members are not lashed too bitterly, or bullied too prominently, they will, yet, during this session, record themselves as assuming to consecrate this, in consonance with Justice Brewer's decision, a Christian Nation, and declare, that as such it shall accept its national religion hereafter from the White House and the Capitol.

But if, on the contrary, the boycott and bulldoze should react against itself, in this Congress, it would only be gathering strength for the next, in which the members could be brought more generally and more completely to their knees to pray to their spiritual advisers for their weekly bread with the full acceptance of the proviso that it can be buttered only on the Sunday side.
