# Mr. Crafts and the Printers.

UNDER the sub-head of "Conspiracies and Pessimists," in the *Christian Statesman* of May 5, 1892, Mr. Crafts finds fault because for hundreds of work people working men every day, and work people who are not working men on Sunday; because workpeople work on Sunday in printing newspaper offices, etc.

This statement will excite nothing but contempt for Mr. Crafts among printers, who will consequently be impressed most unfavorably by the champions of their selfappointed champions of them and their interests. Every printer in the land knows that there is no such thing as seven days continuous work in a newspaper office.

It runs by day-morning papers. By a law of the International Union printers are on the day as follows: morning paper, seven days continuously; on the seventh day or any days continuously: on the seventh day of each class of paper an extra is allowed that must be represented by another one man; for, though the substitutes or extras are always left free to select his period of rest, so as to insure one day off in seven to every man.

This Mr. Crafts could find out easily on inquiry, or by inspecting his own morning paper (if his intelligence and observation are equal to the task) he will discover new names in the advertisements on Sunday or any other one day out of seven.

But not only is Mr. Crafts' position absurd as above stated; it is also mischievous, in its foolish and straited idea from the consumer's standpoint, that no printer in a newspaper office ever really works more than six days in the week---could tolerate not only for its own health, but a desire to give a healthful influence to the newspaper. The weight more with the printer than any amount of Mr. Crafts' petty meddling.
