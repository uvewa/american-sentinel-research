A LATE Sunday liquor case before Judge Lippincott, of Hoboken, N. J., is thus reported:

The Judge displayed considerable feeling. He is usually calm and self-possessed, but on this occasion he spoke sharply and emphasized his remarks by bringing his clenched fist down on the desk. He said in part:

"Reilly was absolutely restrained from selling liquor on Sunday. We, the Court and the jury, have taken a solemn oath to enforce the law as far as we can. Of all things in the world, we can not say that we will overlook these things as they would be moral perjury. If the sentiment of the people is against this law, let the people elect representatives to repeal it. The moment the court and jury overlook the violation of one law, encroachments will immediately be made, and other laws will be violated. Let us not be led astray by ridicule on the part of some, or by the notion that there is a single law on our statute books which can be violated.

"Let it never be said that a court and jury in this county are too cowardly to enforce the law. Remember, too, that if we allow one violation, we throw down the gates for the admission of all moral transgressions."

So it is that these excise cases are a school for practice, preparatory to the attainment of the full enforcement of Sunday laws against all.
