# The Church Bar.

REV. DR. W. S. RAINSFORD, Pastor of Calvary Church, this city, it is stated, has viewed a novel idea in regard to the solution of the temperance question. In an interview Dr. Rainsford said to a reporter of the *Evening Post:*---

You can not stamp out an evil such as saloons. I have never advocated stamping them out by law, and I do not believe that they are practicable. I think on the whole it is of far more importance to make the saloon unnecessary than it is to try and suppress the saloon by legislation.

In connection with any such scheme, Dr. Rainsford believes in having a moral and religious environment. In such a thickly populated city as this, where there is a saloon within an easy walking distance of almost every man, woman, and child, and that we, as a Christian community can personally take the standing of the saloon to a level which it will not descend.

What is more, I would have there open on Sundays just as they are the week, what I call Sabbath clubs; but that would hardly meet the situation unless they were entirely similar to public houses of refreshment.

Of course "proper hours" for Sunday beer would be from noon to midnight; this would not interfere with church services, however, is not likely to become popular,
