THE vote in the House of nearly four to one to close the Government exhibit on Sunday ought to satisfy the advocates of legal religion in politics of the complexion of the House on this question. Yet they are not satisfied. By this overweening zeal they may yet throw obstacles in their own pathway. The House has shown itself ready to follow their lead, and even in some degree submit, without remonstrance, to their threats. The representatives have been numbered and their standing and pedigree taken in reference to this subject. Arrangements have been made to put the political thumb screws upon them at home, and word has gone out that, whether they desire it or not, they are to be forced to go on record upon the matter in the House. This is to furnish data for the use of the political boycott which a paragraph in many of the memorials has held before congressmen as awaiting their opposition or their neutrality in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress.
