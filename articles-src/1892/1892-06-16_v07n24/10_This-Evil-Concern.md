This reprint from the Christian Nation, of June 1, does not need any comment.

"We give an extract recently sent by THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of this city to the students of the University of Ann Arbor, Mich:—

The Sentinel deplores any attempt on the part of Christianity to secure political favors, as a confession of weakness which must be humiliating to every true Christian, and a just cause of reproach to every non-Christian. It believes with Madison that "religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together." Hence from a patriotic conviction of duty it is unalterably opposed to any movement which looks to an alliance between them. That there are decided tendencies in this direction at the present time may be easily seen (the proposition to close the World's Fair by law on Sunday is a good example) and every loyal citizen must sooner or later determine his own attitude toward such questions. Thus The AMERICAN SENTINEL occupies an important field in that it discusses them fully and impartially.

"Some idea of the extent to which this evil concern has pushed the circulation of its pernicious literature may be had by reading the following clipping:—

In publishing work they are especially strong, operating five large houses located at Battle Creek, Mich.: Oakland, Cal.; Basel, Switzerland; Christmas, Norway, and Melbourne, Australia. They have also branch houses in London, England; Chicago, Ill; New York City, and Toronto, Canada. These houses print papers and books in 14 languages. The present worth of the four principal publishing houses is estimated to be $953,261.03. Their literature consists of many found volumes, pamphlets and tracts, from the $4 subscription book to the penny leaflet. About 1,200 canvassers will be engaged in selling the books of the denomination the present season (1892), and the sales now reach annually over $700,000.

"Referring to this notice and clipping we have received the following letter from a student at the University:—

Mr. J. W. Pritchard—Item Friend: A few days ago I received the inclosed notice from the Ann Arbor agency of THE SENTINEL. They seem to be supplying all the students and people of the town. The inclosed slip shows their publication work. We stand as a church for the idea that an oath to the United States Constitution or any unchristian Constitution is a dishonor to Christ. About all the chance the voters of this country have had to hear this truth is from our own church pulpits. Possibly we have reached about 10,000 voters in this way, which is less than one in 1,200. Yet we wonder why the work moves slowly.

Yours, J. M. C.

"Times without number, in private and in these columns, we have insisted on the necessity for a wider distribution of our literature, for more aggressive National Reform work by our church as a church along our high water mark lines, and for the ultimate establishment of a publication house on a sufficiently generous plan to enable us to reach all Christian people with our arguments We must get among the people, get our literature into their hands, our arguments into their heads, and persuade their hearts by our zeal for their salvation."
