ONE of the most contemptible features of the recent Sunday cases in Henry County, Tenn., was that brethren were made to testify against brethren. Though the work done was alleged to be a great annoyance to the people of the county, not one witness was found to testify that he was annoyed by it; and in only two instances had anybody but Adventists, who were themselves at work, seen the defendants at work on Sunday. They only supposed that it was their habit to work on Sunday because they were known to rest upon the seventh day. The indictments were found against "five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church," not upon evidence that they worked on Sunday, but simply because of the fact that they belonged to that church; and then the indictments were supported and four of the defendants convicted on evidence wrung from their brethren in the church.
