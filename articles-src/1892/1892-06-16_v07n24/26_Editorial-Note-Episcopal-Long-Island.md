THE Episcopal Church has, almost universally, maintained a neutrality in the strife to compel the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, but the Diocese of Long Island, at its Annual Diocesan Convention, lately held, has made itself an unworthy exception and passed resolutions in reference to the Sunday closing of the Fair, and also favoring the enforcement of the Sunday laws in the Long Island towns; giving special mention to Newtown, Woodhaven, Maspeth, and Bowery Bay.
