THE Supreme Court of the State of Georgia has decided, in an appealed case from the Superior Court of Houston, Ga., that the statute making it a misdemeanor to hunt any kind of game with gun or dogs, or both, on Sunday, does not violate the Constitution of the State or the United States; and also holds that "Sunday," and "the Sabbath day," are synonymous in the legal and legislative language of Georgia.
