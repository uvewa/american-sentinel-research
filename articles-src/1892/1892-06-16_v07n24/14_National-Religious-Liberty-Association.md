# National Religious Liberty Association.

NOTE are more current for the closing of the Fair on Sunday. Those who want to enjoy the society of the visitors that day want to enjoy the Fair.

SENATOR QUAY is working hard to prevent the desecration of the Sabbath by holding the World's Fair open the first day of the week. Senator Quay believes that ought to be sacred to politics.

REV. Joseph Cook claims to have discovered that the Sabbath day was first sacred a thousand years before Abraham. Possibly true; what is Joseph Cook's Sabbath day?

If there is a sensible, consistent Christian in America who believes, as a matter of sentiment, that if the World's Fair is closed Sundays the work together the peculiarity of the particular Sabbath to the Sunday-closing people with the great Christmas holidays, the astronomical Sabbath to the same men---and who cannot see through this contemptible sham of calling it a "day of rest."

Is there reform to close the World's Fair Sundays? Oh, the good people are so merciful to their servants and the poor, sure, to have compulsory forfeiture of their Sundays. It occurs to be no busier neither on Sunday than they do on Saturday: and how much more would it be for those at the World's Fair Sunday than to consort and utter falsehoods on the floor of a Congress of the United States?

It is a little singular that the advice now coming with working quite as pretty at the close of the Fair on the observance of the Sabbath. Petitions for the great show, they would obtain a larger attendance by being open seven days, and strangers to the city. The latter, of course, are not to have any consideration, but their money and them will do the same. The Fair may close and hundreds of thousands be turned away from the gates.

If there were left any sort of argument against the denial that the World's Fair be closed on the same grounds as those on which it was opened, with, the petitions for that act of exclusion have themselves furnished it. The character of the recent discussion upon this question which has swept the entire population of the State, town, and country into the whirlpool of religious-political controversy. In another words, the self elected religio-political policemen of the nation have deliberately forged the names of millions of people and would bring a great pressure to close the World's Fair as pernicious names of petitioners to Congress. These facts, together with all the attending circumstances, stamp this as the real thing of the day of the week. It looks as if the edition of the latest political morality for this country will not contain, "thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
