# The Purpose of the Action.

THE purpose of the action, in reference to Sunday closing at the World's Fair, sprung upon the House of Representatives on May 19, is said by its supporters, to have been to try the temper of the House on this subject, preliminary to the contest over the appropriation bill with the Sunday closing proviso to be attached to it.

The vote in the House of nearly four to one to close the Government exhibit on Sunday ought to satisfy the advocates of adding religious politics to the occupations of the House on this question. Yet they are not satisfied. By this overmastering vote they may throw those obstacles in their own pathway. The House has shown itself ready to follow their lead, and even in some degree explicit, without remonstrance, to their dictation. The preparatives have been numbered and their standing and pedigree taken in reference to this subject. Arrangements have been made to act on the political church voters upon them at home, and word has gone out that, whether they desire it or not, they are to be forced to go on record upon this matter in the House. This is to furnish data for the use of the political boycott which is a paragraph in the memorabilia of those before Congresses as asserting their operation or their neutrality in the Sunday closing of the World's Fair by act of Congress.

Already the dignity of several senators has been ruffled by the open threat that their re-elections would be conditioned on the attitudes which they assumed to the demand from the religious political forces among their constituents. Every succeeding step in the progress of the matter makes it more and more evident that this warning as to the future contests of the church ballot box was not intended as an idle threat. And certainly it would not do to underestimate the efforts of these political religionists if they are able to multiply votes in the same ratio that they have multiplied acts and resolutions; for the present Congress of the United States is by no means composed entirely of men who feel themselves compelled to truckle to the erroneous views and fanatical demands of any one class of men. On the contrary many of them are, as some have already expressed themselves, of such a stamp of mind and fibre of character as not to brook any semblance of being put upon or coerced in their public career.

It yet remains to be seen, when the crux of the religious party is heartfelt, whether congressmen will come under the yoke at last—to listen like dumb, driven cattle, and at the call of their names obediently register a religious decree.

The evidence now is, even if there were no other proof, is sufficient, to show, that, whatever value the party of religious legislation places upon the legislative expression it had from the House of Representatives on May 19 and 20, of members who had not lashed nor bitted, or bullied too much, upon their own, and speaking upon their own, record themselves as seeming to coincide, this in connection with Justice Brewer's decision, a Christian Nation, and therefore, that as such it shall accept the national religious temperament from the White House and the Capitol.

But if, on the contrary, the boycott and bulldoze should react against itself, in this Congress, it would only be gathering strength for the next, in which the members could be brought more generally and more cajolingly to their knees to pray their spiritual advisers for their weekly bread with the full acceptance of the proviso that it be buttered only on the Sunday side.

The arrogance of the party of religious politics does not fall of expression in any of its public utterances as to the manner in which the different propositions to guide and control the morals of the world and the World's Fair, were treated by the members of the House of Representatives. They had previously taken the measures of the House, but the vote showed an unexpected strength of their opposition called in the lobby, and more than one hundred members had answered in the affirmative. Then, a second effort, repeated to vote "yea" upon any and all national and religious questions, pertaining to the World's Fair, which might be sprung upon the House. When shocking Columbia should be brought before them, with fingers over her eyes, and again corner in her moral, asking with conscious feminality that the American standard of purity in art should be discovered by a congressional investigating committee, and enforced in the art rooms of Chicago; and when the political "Sabbath" clique should demand that Congress prohibit Colonel Shepard's guests at the World's Fair from drinking their champagne, or their claret, outside of their twenty-five thousand dollar apartments; or when the Presbyterian and Methodist parsons agreed with their revised prayer the voices of many millions who have petitioned the Congress of the United States, on this, and, in the strict sense of the American Sentinel shall enforce for them a quiet Sunday for religious devotion at the World's Fair;—if any one of these were broached, or any two, or all three of them together, there would be the applause of every Protestant, and what was confidently expected the entire contingent, which it was reported had been gathered, would vote as one man, no matter what absurd, or paternal, or papal, for legislation might be the subject. In this they attempted too much. They went outside of their constitution. A body of men, governed by the central Government, of the outward semblance of virtue, or of sobriety, is something they ought to be proud of.
