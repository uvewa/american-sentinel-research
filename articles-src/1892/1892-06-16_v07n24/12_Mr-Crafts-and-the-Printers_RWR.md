Under the sub-head of "Compositors and Pressmen," in the Christian Statesman, of May 24, 1892, I find the following statement:—

The seven-days' newspaper means seven days labor for hundreds of hard working men every week. "Nine out of every ten of us want the seventh day of re-t," say these toilers.

This statement will excite nothing but contempt for Mr. Crafts among printers, not only because of his ignorance of the conditions that surround them, but for his self-appointed championship of them and their wants. The fact is, every printer knows that there is no such thing as seven days continuous work for compositors on seven-day morning papers. By a law of the International Union a printer can only work six days continuously; on the seventh day after six days of continuous labor his case must be represented by some one else, for at least twenty-four hours. Each man is left free to select his period of rest, so as not to hinder the progress of the business. Thus Mr. Crafts could hold cases on the morning paper (if his intelligence was such as would pass muster), and not work on Sunday or any other one day out of the week.

But not only is Mr. Crafts' position absurd on the foregoing proposition, but it is foolish and uncalled for from the consideration that no printer on a morning paper ever really works more than five days in the week,—consideration not only for his own health, but a desire to give the poor "sub" a chance for a living weighs more with the printer than any law Mr. Crafts could ever have enacted.

Instead of the printers appealing to Mr. Crafts for help in these premises, they do not need his guardianship in any respect whatever. They are not only abundantly able to take care of themselves, but they can see through the flimsy drapery of the subterfuge that would use them as cat's paws to secure his coveted union of Church and State. Mr. Crafts must not assume that printers are ignorant of the past. They have fortunately read some history, and know how "the successors of the prophets" have used laws which were secured by just such base and fraudulent means to oppress the innocent, and they know, too, that the darkest crimes upon the pages of history were perpetrated by some so-called "successors," etc., when they had secured power.

Mr. Crafts is not only ridiculous, but his mistaken zeal has made him foolish.
