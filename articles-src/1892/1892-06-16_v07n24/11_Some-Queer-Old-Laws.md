"Uncle Joe" Brown, of the County Clerk's office, is one of the queerest men in the court house, and also one of the best informed. Whenever any question of an especially puzzling nature comes up for settlement and no one else can answer it the seekers for information go back to the room where "Uncle Joe" works, and he explains it to their satisfaction. This sort of procedure is a matter of daily occurrence, and the old gentleman's encyclopedical knowledge is proverbial.

The other day after a delegation of information-seekers had learned what they were in search of they hung around "Uncle Joe's" desk to hear some of his reminiscences which their questions called up fresh to his memory.

"It is strange how the old laws cling to the statute books," he said meditatively. "In the Eastern States many of the strict colonial laws stand unrepealed on the books. Of course where they conflict with the more advanced ideas of to-day they have become dead letters. I was the victim of an attempt to revive one of the old statutes myself when I lived in Washington City a good many years ago. I was the manager of the Washington Gas Works, and some religious enthusiasts brought a prosecution against me for violating the Sabbath by operating the works on Sunday. I knew that unless the works ran on Sunday there would be no gas on Monday night, and on the ground of public necessity felt sure I would be sustained in the suit.

"To my surprise I found the law not only exactly against me, but learned that it was supplemented with severe penalties. For the first offense the penalty was a heavy fine, and for each succeeding offense a term of imprisonment. I finally had to settle the case out of court by the payment of a considerable sum of money and the granting of some concessions. That law still stands on the books, but I have heard of no attempt to enforce it since my unhappy experience.

"The queerest of the ancient laws which has been allowed to remain unrepealed in the District of Columbia is one which makes it a crime to deny belief in the Holy Trinity, and fixes the punishment at imprisonment. If that law was suddenly put into force to-day it would cause a lively agitation. It was on the books when John Quincy Adams was President of the United States, and he was a pronounced Unitarian. Every Sunday he would go to the little Unitarian Church down on Sixth Street and lead in the singing. There was a strange spectacle during all that administration of the President of the United States living in open violation of the law."—Indianapolis News.
