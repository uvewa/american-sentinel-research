THE *Christian at Work* would have people believe that the matter of closing the World's Fair on Sunday is only "a rest-day matter." It says:—

The question has interest for religious people on religious grounds; but as treated by Congress it is not a religious question but a holiday or rest-day question—that and that only. In some quarters we meet with the statement that Congress should close the Exhibition for religious reasons. But that involves ignorance of the fundamental law of the Nation.

If that is all that is involved why is Congress asked to consider anything in connection with the question except the purely business propositions connected with it? And why do so many "religious" people threaten to boycott the Fair upon all days if it is not closed on Sunday? It is the most arrant nonsense to deny that it is a purely religious question. If Sunday were not a religious day nobody would ask to have the Fair closed. The only way to separate it from religion and religious considerations, is to separate it from Sunday, but that would destroy the question entirely, for it is the nature of that particular day that gives rise to the question. This "civil rest-day" plea is most sickeningly hypocritical.
