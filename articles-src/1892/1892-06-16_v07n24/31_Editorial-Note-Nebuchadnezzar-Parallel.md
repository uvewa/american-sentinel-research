THE demand made by Sunday-keepers that those who observe the seventh day shall also keep Sunday, is no more reasonable than was the like demand made by Nebuchadnesses that the three Hebrews who worshiped Jehovah, should also bow down to the golden image—which he had set up. The king did not forbid the worship of the living God; he only required a very slight and formal acknowledgment of his god and of his religion. The partisans of Sunday are less modest in their demands than was the heathen king.
