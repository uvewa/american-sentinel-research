# When Doctors Disagree.

ELLIOT F. SHEPARD of the *Mail and Express*, claims that there are in this country ten millions of people and that this Sabbath should be observed. There are more World's Fair who should be, perhaps, better informed than Mr. Shepard, or who at least differ from him. For example, a Presbyterian pastor, of Chicago, recently addressed the following at a Sunday-closing mass meeting.

It is astounding that a majority want the Fair open, but suppose this is the voice of the majority; it is a dreadful thing to be in the minority, but it is dreadful to be wrong.

Shall public opinion rule in this matter?

Sam Small who recently spoke in Chicago made the same argument,---

I say that the people who want Sunday closing are in a thousand majority.

When the religious bigot is in the minority he wants his views forced on the majority because his views are right, but when he imagines that he is in the majority he demands that the minority submit to the will of the majority. This is the Government of the people in which the majority rules.
