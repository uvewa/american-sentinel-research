THOSE who cry "Blue Laws" do not, as the Statesman asserts, "thereby proclaim for themselves the red laws of anarchy." Blue Laws are codified injustice; anarchy is disorganized injustice, or the tyranny of brute force. The one is little better than the other. Whatever difference there is is in favor of disorganized injustice, for where injustice is done by individuals without the color of the law it is short lived. Where it is supported by law it has an appearance of respectability that prolongs its wicked reign.
