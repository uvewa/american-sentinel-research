ALREADY the dignity of several senators has been ruffled by the open threat that their re-election would be conditioned on the attitude which they assumed as to the demand from the religious aristocracy among their constituents. Every succeeding step in the progress of the matter makes it more and more evident that this warning as to the future contents of the church ballot box was not intended as an idle threat. And certainly it would not do to underrate the efforts of these political religionists if they are able to multiply votes in the same ratio that they have been able to repeat petitions. And yet, the present Congress of the United States is by no means composed entirely of men who feel themselves compelled to truckle to the erroneous views and insolent demands of any man or class of men. On the contrary many of them are, as some have already expressed themselves, of such a stamp of mind and fibre of character as not to brook any semblance of being put upon compulsion in their public acts.

It yet remains to be seen, when the crack of the religious party whip is heard, whether congressmen will come under the yoke at its behest like dumb, driven cattle, and at the call of their names obediently assent to the demands of their drivers.
