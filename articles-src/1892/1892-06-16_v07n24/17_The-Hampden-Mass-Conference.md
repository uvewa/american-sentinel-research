# The Hampden (Mass.) Conference.

The Hampden (Mass.) Conference of Congregational churches, at its recent meeting at which took at the First Church, Springfield, adopted, among others, the following resolutions:

*Whereas*, we believe one of the most serious evils specially operative to keep business men and their employees working on Sunday is the business practiced by working on loudly protested against too much work on a Sabbath rightly done. Therefore,

*Resolved*, That, as the Hampden Conference of Congregational Churches we do most earnestly recommend the common practice of doing all their trading with the religion of Christ is in our midst and the better Sabbath observer we so earnestly recommend to all men at this hour, they may not do all their shopping before to-day's sundown.

That everything is to be made to lend to Sunday observance. How long at this rate will it be until the State will be under the name of Sunday law in harmony with the underlying thought of those resolutions, for instance, that some fine any day that labor be made pay day, and all civic affairs be regulated so as to be tributary to the observance of the civil beginning in religion.
