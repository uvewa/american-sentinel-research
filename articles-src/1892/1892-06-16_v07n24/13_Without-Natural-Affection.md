# Without Natural Affection.

The London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has just issued its annual report which is horrifying to all who have not lost their natural affection. A noticeable feature of the report is that it reveals the fact that the worst cases of frequent cases of cruelty are found among people who profess to be deeply religious and saintly. One woman slick, hot air, and darkly completed, naked in a dark cellar, in the dead of winter, in a manner that tells of cruelty in a nutshell. This woman is said not to have touched food for days before discovery. Some parents have been known to put pins and needles in the hands and other parts of their children. One baby of seven months was found with its body covered with burns. It was only a child well covered with blood. A boy of six years had a rope tied around his neck by which he was thrown into a canal. The perpetrators of these cruelties plead that they have a right to give their children moral discipline for the good of their characters. That is, they have a right to correct their morals. And yet people imagine we are living in a very intelligent and altogether superior age, when whipping people to make them good, and whipping people to save them in either the body or the soul, has been abandoned, that if human nature is undergoing any change it is becoming more brutal. The conclusion agrees exactly with 2 Tim. 3:1.
