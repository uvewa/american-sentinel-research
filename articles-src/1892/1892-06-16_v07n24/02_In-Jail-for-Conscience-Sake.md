# In Jail for Conscience' Sake.

LAST Friday the final judgment of the Circuit Court of Henry County, Tenn., was pronounced in the case of the five Seventh-day Adventists convicted of the felony of maintaining a public nuisance by doing farm work on Sunday on their farms near Springville, in said county. The judgment of the court is that each of the defendants should pay a fine of one dollar and the costs of the prosecution, amounting to nearly twenty-five dollars in each case, and that "defendants\' acts stand committed until the fine and costs are paid."

Only one of the defendants was financially able to pay the fine and costs at this time, and he declined to do so because it being a matter of conscience the Court had no just right to impose a fine. The others would have taken the same course if they could.

All four were of course committed to jail where, unless their sentences are paid by friends, they will remain at a credit of twenty-five cents per day until the demands of the law are satisfied, which will require nearly one hundred days.

On being arraigned for sentence three of the defendants made no plea in their behalf, a motion for a new trial in one case having failed. It had been proven that they had worked on Sunday contrary to the statute; it had not been shown that said work was a nuisance, or that anybody was disturbed by it. Indeed, so far as the testimony was concerned every witness testified that he was not disturbed, and they were of course the nearest neighbors of the defendants. The Court held, however, that the gist of the offense was in doing work in the State publicly in violation of the civil law, and that it was not necessary to show that anybody was actually disturbed, or annoyed; that to do common work publicly within the meaning of the law, it was only necessary that people know whether it is actually seen or not. This means that these men would be guilty even if they were screened at work on that day if they be indicted and convicted on their own confession. In fact, in the case of one defendant, who was convicted, the Attorney General asked the witnesses if he had ever heard any man say that he worked on Sunday. It so happened that they had not, or so could not recall it positively, and on this the State failed to prove its case and the defense rested. The Court, however, was for the prosecution in the court with a verdict. A direction of the case, however, the possibilities bound up in the prosecution of this case, had not been by Blackstone and adopted by the Tennessee Court during the last century especially to meet the cases of conscience of the so-called evil influence of their observance.

CHAPTER 2, section 2289, of the Code of Tennessee provides that,—

> any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person, who is guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life on Sunday, or of using or employing his children, servants or slaves, apprentices, or any other person under his charge or control, in labor or other business on that day, unless of necessity or mercy, shall, for each and every offense, forfeit and pay $3.00, on oath to be applied to county purposes.

Section 2290 provides that,—

> any person who shall hunt, fish, or play at any game of sport on Sunday, shall be subject to the same penalties as those who violate section 2289.

This is all that the law of Tennessee says about the common avocations of life, business, or sport on Sunday, and the fine of three dollars is the only penalty provided by the Legislature for violation of Sunday. The Courts have, however, discovered a way of greatly increasing the penalty; namely, of prosecuting the individual violator of Sunday as a public nuisance. And of course in order to give color and apparent consistency to the charges, indictments for Sunday work speak of "unlawfully," "publicly," "repeatedly, continually, and continuously," and that it was done "to the annoyance and disturbance of the people of the country." This particular phraseology is used because the gist of a nuisance is that it amounts to, *a nuisance*.

*Webster.*

Nuisance 1. That which annoys or gives trouble or annoyance; that which produces inconvenience, damage, or hurt. 2. In law, that which produces inconvenience or damage. A nuisance may be classed as public and general, private, when they affect individuals only.

This suggests that the law is broad enough to cover almost anything. To conduct a ship in an unreasonably and repeatedly, or to fix a single time and place for amusement, or leave the observation would be a nuisance. For instance, a widow may be prevented from going to the use of a public library for the sake not of the estate. The same mere obstruction of mail road during the process of clearing, or of an excavation for building across it would not be to in a law sense a nuisance, merely an inconvenience. But if a were to continue the obstruction, or willingly leaving the building standing in the road longer than necessary, it would become a nuisance.

Another place of instance would be the holding of a manufacturing concern or offensive or unwholesome smell. A glue factory that should be operated too near to human dwellings in some states and in some sections of the country might be considered offensive enough to be a nuisance, which would prevent the owner from being a real annoyance in the neighborhood.

But work quietly done on Sunday in that district is not and can not be a nuisance to any proper sense of the word. Any disturbance consequent upon its observance is only mental, and must arise from the inflamed feelings of the one who disturbs himself rather than from the act of another. And this time is shown when, by the decision of Judge Hammond, in the case of R. M. King. The Judge said:—

> Sunday labor by Seventh-day Adventists of the civil law have secured the aid of the civil law—that the prosecution of these people is in the spirit of the clause for religious freedom, and the provisions are in the nature of a regulation of the police for the purpose of a nuisance and is so essentially a part of that religion into the form of the statute as would make out an invasion of their freedom in all respects; herein be it that the law as applied to the defendant is religiously intolerant, and upon the above facts is unconstitutional, and the defendant is entitled to his discharge on the grounds above stated.

This showed that religious "feelings or sentiments" are the only things disturbed by this anti-nuisance law against Sunday work. This is sustained by the fact that the Attorney General himself, people living in the same neighborhood were not as much annoyed by the Sunday work of these Adventists as they were by their neighbors. The above too plainly is to need further comment, and shows that this is in fact only religious persecution.

We are reliably informed that a number of indictments for Sunday work will be brought at the next term of the circuit court in Obion County, Tenn. In fact, the Attorney General told one of the editors of this paper that that lack of time alone prevented the finding of such indictments by the last Grand Jury, and that, "at the next term of court every man of them who violated it," [the Adventists] that work on Sunday will be prosecuted until they quit it.

One of the most contemptible features of the recent Sunday cases in Henry County, Tenn., was that brethren were made to testify against brethren. Though the work done was alleged to be a great annoyance to the people of the country, not one witness was found to testify against them who was not, by word or deed, themselves Adventists who were at work on Sunday. The defendants, in court, were found guilty of violating the law, not upon the evidence that they worked on Sunday, but simply because of the fact that they belonged to that church, and that the defendants were surprised and four of the defendants convicted on evidence wrong from their brethren in the church.

WHAT is the lesson of the logic of the events chronicled in the last few issues of the SENTINEL—the Supreme Court decision making that this is a Christian Nation—a judicial decision that Sunday is its Sabbath; the result of the vote in the House of Representatives on May 19 and 20, and the Sunday closing of the World\'s Fair, the many heated discussions that have swept all over the country; and the prosecution of honest, simple hearted, Christian men for personally, conscientiously keeping the day they believe to be the Sabbath? Who will take heed and learn?
