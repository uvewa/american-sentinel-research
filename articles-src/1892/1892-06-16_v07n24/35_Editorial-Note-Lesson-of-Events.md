WHAT is the lesson of the logic of the events chronicled in the last few issues of THE SENTINEL?—the Supreme Court declaration that this is a Christian Nation; judicial decisions that Sunday is the Sabbath; the result of the vote in the House of Representatives on the Sunday ice bill, and the Sunday closing at the World's Fair; the many hundred arrests under the Sunday laws all over the country; and the prosecution of honest, simple hearted, Christian men for pecunition's sake! Who will take heed and learn?
