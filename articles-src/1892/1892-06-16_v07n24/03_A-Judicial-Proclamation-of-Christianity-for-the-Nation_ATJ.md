# A Judicial Proclamation of Christianity for the Nation.

[Extract from an address by A. T. Jones, at the National Religious Liberty Association, New York.]

On the 29th of February, 1892, the Supreme Court of the United States rendered a decision in which no constitutional amendment could possibly do, or Congress do; that is to give a legal status to Christianity and legalized forms of religious observance as any bigots may choose who desire the civil power.

All that remains is to give this a practical application, and for the executive authorities of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, or in any other way to set it into effect. There has been no law forbidding any aliens to come to this country, nor restricting them, from the service of any kind. The reason of that was not what our constitution tells us, but actually, instead, the reason of its being. The United States, and corporations of great power formed in this country, could get, with as little expense as possible, workmen outside of this country, instead of some of the people whom they could get, to come, these work for smaller wages than their expenses over, and allow them to work it out as very small wages after they get to this country. This was unfair to every industrious workingman already here. The authorities of the United States of America in Congress assembled enacted that no aliens should be solicited for any person, company, partnership, or corporation in any manner whatsoever to in any way assist or encourage the importation or migration of aliens or foreigners into the District of Columbia, under contract or agreement, previously made with such alien or foreigner, to perform labor or service of any kind in the United States, its Territories, or the District of Columbia.

A certain church corporation in New York City hired a preacher in England to come over to this country. He came and contracted with him before he came. He came, to preach for that church corporation, to perform service for that church. The United States Attorney instituted proceedings against that church corporation under this law. The United States Circuit Court decided against the church, and confirmed judgment accordingly. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, upon writ of error.

The Supreme Court reversed the decision, *first* upon the well-established principle that "the intent of the law maker is the law." The court quoted directly from the reports of the committees, both of the House Committee who had the bill in charge, and of the Senate Committee, and these both said in express terms that "when they spoke of service, the labor meant in the statute, was intended to mean manual labor or service, and not professional service of any kind." Therefore, they said, being the intent and the very intent of the law, and the intent of the law maker is the law, that in itself and of itself reversed the decision of the lower court, and said that the act complained of was not a violation of the statute.

So far as that goes, the decision is correct and proper, and there is no fault, no further. But between that paragraph and the decision of the court, Justice Brewer inserted a long argument for the purpose of declaring of this Nation to be "a religious people," and "this a Christian Nation." This, the opening part, as the title of the *Papacy*, was put in, so as much as is made of it, is absolutely without authority. It is *altogether* false; it is totally without authority in principle. The United States as the people established it under the Constitution is as far from being in any sense Christian as it is from being under the Papacy. So I turn to that part of the decision.

But beyond all these causes, for the purpose of a national declaration of religion, what sort of a new view of the Constitution, etc., and of the Constitution itself, is that which the lower court gave it, the Supreme Court adopted the conclusions of the lower court.

But beyond all these causes, for the purpose of ascertaining the intent of that law, the Supreme Court went outside all proper bounds. It had no right, for this or any other purpose, to declare this to be a religious people, a Christian Nation, or of any other religious character whatever. As well might one of our courts, for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of an act of Congress in regard to the importation of opium, proceed to enumerate all the reasons that could be found to prove that this is a people given to the use of that drug. Such a proceeding as this was wholly and entirely uncalled for. Suppose it is granted that this is "the historical American people;" what of this "historical religion?" What is of a bill that the people of this country may not desire to see perpetuated? We shall see. Now we want to know, first, what is it whether to be kind, or whether the process of the Supreme Court is to show that it is perpetuated by this decision.

I prefer to get this before us in the very frankest way. I will first run close to the text of the decision, and show by the history which it cites, what the decision makes, of this Constitution as it touches religion. Take, then, the words of the decision. Justice Brewer's arguments are these statements that show that the Roman Catholic religion is "the religion of this Christian Nation;" which establish the righteousness of demanding a religious test or qualification for office; which require belief in the doctrines of the Trinity, of course—and the interpretation of the Trinity—as a qualification; which establish the righteousness of the State taxing the people and all classes in support of religion. Now, among other things, then, the court quotes favorably and in support of its own position, this: that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," and says of this that it is not a declaration of indifference to religion.

There is no discussion in these declarations as to whether they mean the same one thing or two different things, or more than one meaning: they are simply the announcement of the people by the Constitution of the United States, and you see what they say. And that is all that has any weight, in the estimation of this Supreme Court of the United States and the people of the United States. I begin—
