Rev. Dr. W. S. RAINSFORD, Pastor of St. George's Church, this city, has advanced a novel idea in regard to the solution of the saloon problem. In a recent interview Dr. Rainsford said to a reporter of the *Evening Sun*—

You can not stamp out an evil such as saloons. I have never advocated attempting reforms in this way, and I do not believe that they are practicable.

What we must do is to provide substitutes which will not be tainted with vice and unwholesome surroundings. In such a thickly populated city as ours to attempt to do away with saloons is simply impossible. But we can do the next best thing, and that is, we as a Christian community can provide the beer demanded by those who want it, and elevate the standing of the saloon to a level which it has never occupied.

Business men of the churches can open saloons and run them profitably. I do not mean to give away the beer, but to sell it at good prices with a profit. Let the saloons maintain themselves. They could do so. I only wish that I myself had the money with which to demonstrate that this is the only successful way to deal with this problem.

Would I sell whisky in these saloons? No, I don't think that I would, but beer, light wines, coffee, and chocolate, I certainly would. Reading rooms could be introduced and the saloons made an attractive place of resort, without intemperance.

What is more, I would have them open on Sunday during the proper hours, but they would be so managed that they would conform strictly to the laws and in no way evade or break them.

Of course "proper hours" for Sunday opening of saloons would be hours that would not interfere with church services. The idea is not likely to become popular, however.
