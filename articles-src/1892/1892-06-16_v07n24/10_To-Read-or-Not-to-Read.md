# To Read or Not to Read.

The *Dispatch*, of Pittsburgh, reports the fact that the Sabbath Committee of that city, who, in 1889, introduced the bill for the repeal of certain portions of the blue laws of 1794 as saying---

I think we shall not be plagued with any more trouble. For one thing the crusade against the Sunday newspaper has been attended with more than usual success. As to the blue laws we have followed the extremes to which the informers were pushed, and for which the whole community has been in a condition of excitement and uncertainty for over twenty years, and at least forty million papers sold each week,---this city would be very illy used if it were obliged to sit on Sunday than without my daily paper. It is simply impossible to enforce the laws, and it is not desired.

THE SENTINEL would not be understood as justifying the reading of secular papers every day in the week. Such papers should be read for commercial reasons on the Sabbath, but that does not touch the point, which is that, if everybody, from Truro, Sabbath keeping is an individual matter that concerns the town directly, as already explored in Jas. 1:12, will have not use on that day for the personal newspapers, neither will he need a civil law to bolster up his own conscience. Conscience that regards the day, regardless is unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.
