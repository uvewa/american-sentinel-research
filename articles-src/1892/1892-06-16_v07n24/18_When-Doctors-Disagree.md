ELLIOTT F. SHEPARD of the *Mail and Express*, claims that there are in this country fifty millions of people who want the World's Fair closed on Sunday. There are some people who want to see the Fair closed on Sunday, that are either better informed than Mr. Shepard, or have more regard for the truth than he. A Presbyterian pastor, of Chicago, recently made the following statement at a Sunday-closing mass meeting.

I acknowledge that a majority want the Fair open, but suppose this is the voice of the majority, have the minority no rights? I claim that it is possible for the majority to make a terrible blunder. Shall public opinion rule in this matter? I say, no.

Sam Small who recently spoke in Chicago on the same subject argued thus:—

I say that the people who want Sunday closing in this country are in the majority and the minority have got to submit.

When the religious bigot is in the minority he wants his views forced on the majority because his views are right, but when he imagines that he is in the majority he demands that the minority submit to his views because the Government is a Government of the people in which the majority rule.
