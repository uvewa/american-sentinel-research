# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 24 (1892-06-16)

## General Notes

This issue was transcribed from OCR output of B&W scanned pages. The following uncertainties and observations were noted during the transcription process:

### Page 1, Column 2
- **Line reference:** "bigotis may choose" (in A. T. Jones article)
- **Transcribed as:** "bigotis"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Likely OCR error for "bigots" - the word appears in context of religious enforcement

### Page 3, Line 199
- **Line reference:** "the 'Mole of Baptism'"
- **Transcribed as:** "Mole"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests this should be "Mode of Baptism" but OCR shows "Mole" - preserved as scanned

### Page 5, Line 425-426
- **Line reference:** "This Speller is bound in Mother, in of convenient size"
- **Transcribed as:** "bound in Mother, in of"
- **Confidence:** LOW
- **Reason:** Advertisement text appears garbled - "Mother" likely should be "leather" and "in of" should be "and of" - but preserved OCR reading

### Page 5, Line 426
- **Line reference:** "it prays all words pronounced alike"
- **Transcribed as:** "prays"
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** Context suggests "arrays" or "displays" but preserved OCR reading

### Page 6, Line 506
- **Line reference:** "NEW YORK, JUNE 16, 1893"
- **Transcribed as:** "1893"
- **Confidence:** HIGH - This is an OCR ERROR
- **Reason:** The issue is clearly from 1892 (Volume 7, Number 24). The masthead and all content references confirm 1892. This appears to be a typo in the original or OCR misread of "1892" as "1893"

### Author Identification
- **R. W. Roberson** - Author of "Mr. Crafts and the Printers" article
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Initials "R. W. ROBERSON" appear at end of article (full name given)

### Author Identification
- **J. H. Benson** - Author of "What Attitude Ought the Church to Take toward Politics?"
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Reason:** Article explicitly states it was read by "the Rev. J. H. Benson, before the Methodist ministers' Monday meeting, of La Crosse, Wis."

## Overall Quality
The OCR quality of this issue was generally good. Most text was clear and readable. The main challenges were:
1. Occasional letter substitutions (particularly in advertisements)
2. The year typo on page 8
3. Some formatting irregularities in advertisements

All substantive article text was preserved as scanned with high confidence in accuracy.
