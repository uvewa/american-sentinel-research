# This Evil Concern.

THIS reprint from the *Christian Nation,* dated June 1, does not need any comment:

"We are an earnest motley sent by THE AMERICAN SENTINEL of this city by the students of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

The American Sentinel deplores any anxiety about the proportion of the money should be paid to the managers of the Ex-----. We do not believe that there is any a written agreement that the gates of the Ex----- shall be closed on Sunday. "It is a purely religious question, and as such the Government has nothing to do with it; therefore we must leave it alone. The American Government does not derive its just powers from a patriotic conception of duty it is a serious misfortune to the whole of Christianity as to every non-Christian. It believes with Madison that any government which has the right to establish Christianity in exclusion of all other religions, is not alone from a patriotic conception of duty it is a serious misfortune to the whole of Christianity as to every non-Christian." This is the key note of the paper, a fair specimen of whose editorial teaching in the direction at the present time may be found in its issue of June 2, 1892. Its plea for a lay or for Sunday is a good example and every good American can judge as to just how American Sentinel, boycott an important field for elective work, as its articles against the American Sentinel, boycott an important field for enterprise, goes.

They have now some forty different publications, some in three, some in six, and some in eight languages. These print papers and books in 14 different languages, and send them into all lands. The publishing house is estimated to be $800,901.80. It sends out more than two million packages a year, to say nothing of the periodicals which are issued to the penny reader. About 1,500 colporteurs, with forty canvassing agents, are in their employ.

"Referring to this quaint and curious subject, we have received the following letter from a student at the University of ------.

MR. J. W. PATTERSON---*Dear Friend:* A few days ago I received several copies of your paper and also a copy of THE SENTINEL. They are very well-printed and the association should be congratulated. We hope to soon put your paper to systematic work. We stand as a church for the idea that
