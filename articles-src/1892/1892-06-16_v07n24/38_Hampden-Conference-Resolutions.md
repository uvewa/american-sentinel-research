THE Hampden (Mass.) Conference of Congregational churches, at its recent annual meeting at the First Church, Springfield, adopted, among others, the following resolutions:—

WHEREAS, we believe one of the causes which specially operates to keep business men and clerks from Sunday worship is bodily weariness produced by one's work on Saturday nights, therefore,

Resolved, That we, the members of the Hampden County conference, hereby enter our protest against the common practice of doing all their trading upon Saturday night, and that in the interest of a better Sabbath observance we earnestly recommend that the members of our churches plan to do all their shopping before 8 o'clock Saturday night.

Resolved, That we hereby request the business men in the communities we represent to favor the early closing of their places of business, and as far as possible to influence the opinions of others in favor of this movement.

Resolved, That we recommend to employers that they should make some other day than Saturday the day for the payment of wages to employes, in order that the purchases of family stores may be made earlier in the week than is now common.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be furnished to the press, and that another copy be sent to the General Association, with the request that that body may take suitable action upon the same subject.

Thus everything is to be made to bend to Sunday observance. How long at this rate will it be until the State will be asked to make laws in harmony with the underlying thought of these resolutions, for instance, that some other day than Saturday be made pay day, and all civic affairs be regulated so as to enforce the remembrance of the civil injunction to observe Sunday?
