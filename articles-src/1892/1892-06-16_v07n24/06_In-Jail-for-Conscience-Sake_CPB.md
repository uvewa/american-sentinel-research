Last Friday the final judgment of the Circuit Court of Henry County, Tenn., was pronounced in the cases of the four Seventh-day Adventists convicted on the previous Friday of maintaining a public nuisance by Sunday work, done on their farms near Springville, in said county. The sentence of the Court was that each of the defendants should pay a fine of one dollar and the costs of the prosecution, amounting to nearly twenty-five dollars in each case, and that "the defendants stand committed until the fine and costs are paid."

Only one of the defendants was financially able to pay the fine and costs on the spot, and he declined to do so because it being a matter of conscience the Court had no just right to impose a fine. The others would have taken the same course even though their means had been ample. All four were of course committed to jail where, unless the costs are paid by friends, they will remain at a credit of twenty-five cents per day until the demands of the law are satisfied, which will require nearly three months each.

On being arraigned for sentence three of the defendants made each on his own behalf, a motion for a new trial on the ground that while it had been proved that they had worked on Sunday contrary to the statute, it had not been shown that said work was a nuisance, or that anybody was disturbed by it. Indeed, so far as the disturbance was concerned every witness testified that he was not disturbed, and they were of course the nearest neighbors of the defendants. The Court held, however, that the gist of the offense was in doing work on Sunday publicly, in violation of the civil law, and that it was not necessary to show that anybody was actually disturbed or annoyed by it. To do work publicly within the meaning of the law is to do it when it may be observed whether it is actually seen or not. Thus one who worked on Sunday habitually, even if he were never seen at work on that day, might be indicted and convicted on his own confession. In fact, in the case of the defendant who was not convicted, the Attorney-General asked the witnesses if they had ever heard him say that he worked on Sunday. It so happened that they had not, or could not recall it certainly, and so the State failed to make a case. The effort and the decision of the Court, which was for the most part in the exact words of a decision of the Supreme Court of the State in a like case, show, however, the possibilities bound up in this law, make, not by the Legislature, but by Blackstone and adopted by the Supreme Court of Tennessee and adapted especially to meet the cases of conscientious observers of the seventh day, because of the so-called evil influence of their example!

CHAPTER 2, section 2289, of the Code of Tennessee, provides that,—

if any merchant, artificer, tradesman, farmer, or other person, shall be guilty of doing or exercising any of the common avocations of life, or of causing or permitting the same to be done by his children or servants, acts of necessity or charity excepted, on Sunday, he shall on due conviction thereof before any justice of the peace of the county, forfeit and pay $3.00, one-half to the person who will sue for the same, the other half for the use of the county.

Section 2290 provides that,—

any person who shall hunt, fish, or play at any game of sports, or be drunk on Sunday, as aforesaid, shall be subject to the same proceedings and liable to the same penalties as those who work on the Sabbath.

This is all that the law of Tennessee says on the subject of ordinary labor, business, or sport on Sunday, and the fine of three dollars is the only penalty provided by the Legislature for violation of the law. The courts have, however, discovered a way of greatly increasing the penalty, namely, by proceeding against the habitual violator of Sunday as a public nuisance. And of necessity in order to give color and apparent consistency to the charge, indictments for Sunday labor charge that it is done "publicly, notoriously, and continuously," and that it "was and is to the great annoyance of the people of the county." This particular phraseology is used because the gist of a nuisance is that it annoys. Webster says:—

Nuisance, 1. That which annoys or gives trouble or vexation; that which is offensive or noxious.

2. (Law.) That which incommodes or annoys; something that produces inconvenience or damage.

Nuisances are public when they annoy citizens in general; private, when they affect individuals only.

Thus it appears that in law a nuisance must be something which produces inconvenience or damage. To obstruct a high-way unnecessarily, and repeatedly, or to do it a single time and not promptly remove the obstruction would be a nuisance. For instance, A wishes to move a building from one side of a public road to the other side of the same road. The necessary obstruction of said road during the time absolutely necessary to move the building across it would not be in law a nuisance, though it might occasion some inconvenience. But if A were to continue the obstruction by carelessly, negligently, or willfully leaving the building standing in the road longer than necessary, he would be guilty of a nuisance.

Another phase of nuisance would be the maintenance of something producing an offensive or unwholesome smell. A glue factory would be a nuisance in close proximity to human dwellings but not in some place sufficiently remote to prevent the odor from being a real annoyance in the neighborhood.

But work quietly done on Sunday in rural districts is not and can not be a nuisance in any proper sense of the word. Any disturbance occasioned by it could be only mental, and must arise from the intolerant feelings of the one annoyed by it rather than from the work itself. Indeed, that this is true is shown by the decision of Judge Hammond in the case of R. M. King. The Judge said:—

By a sort of factitious advantage, the observers of Sunday have secured the aid of the civil law, and adhere to that advantage with great tenacity, in spite of the clamor for religious freedom, and the progress that has been made in the absolute separation of Church and State. . . . Sunday observance is so essentially a part of that religion that it is impossible to rid our laws of it. . . . As to the non-observer, he cannot be allowed his fullest personal freedom in all respects; largely he is allowed to do as he pleases, and generally there is no pursuit of him, in these days as a mere matter of disciplining his conscience; but only when he defiantly sets up his non-observance by ostentatious display of his disrespect for the feelings or prejudices of others.

This shows that religious "feelings or prejudices" of the majority are to be protected by this un-common law against nuisances, for as the writer is informed by the Attorney-General himself, people living in other parts of the county are quite as much annoyed by the Sunday work of these Adventists as are their immediate neighbors. This shows too plainly to be mistaken the character of the annoyance and the reason for the prosecution, which is in fact only religious persecution. A good many people see these cases in just this light, and the imprisoned Adventists have the sympathy of the best people in the county, especially of their neighbors and of the business men of Paris and Big Sandy, who would trust any of the persecuted men to any amount that he might ask, for they know that not one of them would accept credit beyond his ability to pay.
