NONE are more earnest for the closing of the Fair Sunday than the Chicago saloon keepers. They want to enjoy the society of the visitors that day in spurious seances.—St. Paul Globe.

SENATOR QUAY is working hard to prevent a desecration of the Sabbath by holding the World's Fair open the first day of the week. Perhaps Mr. Quay believes that ought to be sacred to politics.—Peoria Transcript.

THE Rev. Joseph Cook claims to have discovered that the Sabbath day was kept sacred a thousand years before Abraham. Possibly. Neither New York nor Chicago was doing business at that time.—New York Advertiser.

If there is a steadfast, consistent Christian in Congress, that man is Senator Morrill. He declares that if the World's Fair is closed Sundays the working people will be practically deprived of its benefits. Do the Sunday-closing people want the great Exposition exclusively for the rich?—Indianapolis Sentinel.

In their efforts to close the World's Fair Sundays, the good people who are so careful of other people's morals, seem to have temporarily forgotten their own. It occurs to us to inquire whether it would be worse in morals to look at an industrial exhibit Sunday than to concoct and utter falsehoods during the week.—Washington Post.

It is a little singular that the saloon men of Chicago are working quite as eagerly as the pious people for the closing of the World's Fair Sunday. Except for the great show, they would obtain a colossal trade from the hundreds of thousands of strangers in the city. The latter, of course, are not in league with the saloons, but their plan would help them all the same. The Fair may close Sunday but the saloons go on for ever.—Troy Times.

If there were any need of an argument against the demand that the World's Fair be closed on the only day when those who most need it can visit it, the petitioners for that act of exclusion have themselves furnished it. The names of the petitioners purporting to come from Michigan, exceed the entire population of the State, men, women, and children, according to the census, by nearly two millions. In other words, the self-elected defenders of what they call "Sabbath observance," have deliberately forged the names of some millions of people and tried to palm them off on the managers of the World's Fair as genuine names of people who desire that exhibition to be closed on the first day of the week. It looks as if the edition of the ten commandments which those people study did not contain, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."—Detroit Free Press.
