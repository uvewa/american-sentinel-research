THE Christian Statesman virtually admits that its cry of "Anarchy," amounts to nothing, when it says:—

Those who cry "Blue Laws," thereby proclaim for themselves the red laws of anarchy. After the community has incurred all the expense of making laws, they teach that every man shall use them as a bill of fare, skipping all he does not like. That is straight anarchy. Not "dirt," but defiance of the law, marks the anarchist, and anarchy is more blamable in a washed and educated American than it is in a dirty, ignorant foreigner, raised in despotism, where law itself is lawless.

Admit that law itself may be "lawlessness," and the whole question stands just where it ought to, namely, on the merits of the law. Does the Statesman think that the Fugitive Slave Law ought ever to have been obeyed? Does it think that laws permitting and legalizing slavery ever gave the slaveholder any just property rights in human flesh and blood? If not, how can it be that law can take from A one seventh part of his time and give it into the custody of B? A man's time is his own just as much as is his body, and only God has a right to demand that a portion of it be rendered back to him who gave it. Human "Sabbath laws" are blasphemous because they seek to do that which only God has any right to do.
