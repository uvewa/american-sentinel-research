WE are reliably informed that a number of indictments for Sunday work will be found against Seventh-day Adventists, at the next term of the circuit court in Union County, Tenn. In fact, the Attorney-General told one of the editors of this paper that lack of time alone prevented the finding of such indictments by the last Grand Jury, and that, "at the next term of court every man of them will be indicted." The Attorney-General also said: "Every man, woman, and child of them [the Adventists] that works on Sunday will be prosecuted until they quit it."
