# Some Queer Old Laws.

"UNCLE JOE" BOWN, of the County Clerk's office, is one of the queerest men in the court house, and also one of the best informed. Whenever any question of an especially puzzling nature comes up and is not settled by any one can answer it, somebody refers for information to back to the room where "Uncle Joe" works, and he searches in the law carefully. This set of procedure is a matter of daily routine in the Clerk's office and Bown's practical knowledge is proverbial.

"Not long ago, some of the courthouse seekers had learned what they had termed queer old laws, and asked 'Uncle Joe's' clerk to hear some of his reminiscences which had been gathering crust to his memory.

"'It is strange how the old laws cling to the statute books,' he said meditatively. 'In the District's history most of the early colonial laws stand unrepelled on the books. Of course when they conflict with the more advanced ideas of today, they have become dead letters. I was of the impression at one time myself that practically all the earlier statutes were repealed. I told myself so when I lived in Washington and mentioned the matter to the manager of the Washington Gas Light Company, who had just had a suit brought against a competitor for using gas in his establishment for competing with the works on Sunday. I knew that unless the works ran on Sunday they would be in no condition for Monday, and on the ground of public necessity they should not come within the act.

"'To my surprise the law had not been only exactly against me, but I learned that it was supplemented with severe penalties. It fixes a fine of three dollars and fifty cents heavy fine, and for each succeeding offense the fine is doubled. Then there is a way to settle the case out of court by the payment of eight dollars and the costs and the granting of some concessions. That old act stands on the books, but I have heard of no attempt to enforce it since my residence in Washington.

"'The rarest of the ancient laws which has been allowed to remain unrepelled in the District of Columbia is one which makes it a citizen deny belief in the Holy Trinity a crime for which the perpetrator is imprisoned. If that law was suddenly enforced, it might cause quite a religious agitation. It was on the books when John Quincy Adams was President of the United States, and he was a pronounced Unitarian. Every Sunday he would go to the little Unitarian Church down on Sixth Street and lead in the singing. There was a strange spectacle during that Administration the very President of the United States living in open and daily violation of a law enacted for the District.'
