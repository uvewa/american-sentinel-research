# Editorial Notes.

POSSIBLY one too cowardly to enforce the law. Remember, too, that if we allow one violation to go through many things we give for the admission of others.

It is a fact that some cases also as much a mockery of justice, and that enforcement of the full consequences of Sunday laws cannot succeed against it.

---

AT OAKLAND, Iowa, over two hundred arrests have lately been made, and two hundred informations filed for alleged violation of the Sunday laws.

---

A SEVENTH DAY Adventist at Malvern, Arkansas, had his property attached. They told him to quit working, warning him that unless they stopped working on the Sabbath of the Lord, all legal proceedings required to have the State.

---

WATSONTOWN, New Jersey, and its Methodist Church, is all torn up over bicycle riding on Sunday. The Methodist minister has made a test of some young men of his town who indulge in Sunday bicycling, and partisans of both sides are waging warm in their attack and defense of the cause.

ON JUNE 7, MR. LAYTON, of Ohio, presented in the House of Representatives, "Resolutions of District No. 2, International Typographical Union of Pratt Frith, Ohio, protesting against the action of any and all movements, having treaty relations with the United States, whereby any of our citizens are discriminated against because of their religious faith."

THE EPISCOPAL Church has, almost universally, maintained a neutrality in the effort to compel the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, but the Convention, lately held, has made itself on an unworthy exception, and passed resolutions in favor of closing the Fair on Sunday, and of otherwise favoring the enforcement of the Sunday laws in various forms. The Convention was held at Newtown, Woodhaven, Maspeth, and Bowery Bay.

THE annual summer revival of the Sunday laws of a defunct antiquity are about due. Last year the electric street cars came to attack. The *Sun*, of June 6, says:---

"In spite of strong protests made by clergymen and church members here, the cars of the Elmira and Corning Electric Railway Company were running all day. A. J. Dicker, the Superintendent of the road, published notices to the effect that in deference to the wishes of the people, an express petition to a petition to the officers of the company, the cars will be run on Sundays until further notice. The people of Elmira and Horseheads and the intervening territory are rejoiced, and will not be likely in the future to apply to the State authorities. The riding events of the Sunday crowd at North Anthony Park too deeply interested at the attempt to stop the cars, and they have no intention that if they can not have Sunday cars that they will cause the arrest and prosecution of all newspaper and livery stable men, who let out and carry passengers on the cars and run hacks and busses on the Sabbath. As the ancient blue laws are still on the statute books, the threats, if they are called, can make a great deal of trouble. The livvish met at the cottage of one of their members last night, and after a long discussion, decided to have the Sunday lawstrictly enforced against the cars. No formal movement to have the cars stopped on that day. No little amount of feeling has been already aroused. The charter of the company, which was granted by the Board of Commissioners, does not mention the right to run cars on Sundays."

THIS is the way the discussion on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair in the House of Representatives, appeared to the Washington correspondent of the *Times*.

On Wednesday and Thursday of the week when Representatives was considering, in Committee of the Whole, two questions, whether the World's Fair should have an appropriation of $2,500,000, and whether the sale of intoxicating liquors be excluded, and you will have to watch the matter with close attention in order to understand the proceedings and the conditions of yesterday, when the vote that the exposition should be open on Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. This explains itself sufficiently through various attempts, and paid proclamation of public sentiment, what is agreed on the conditions for the question of closing the Exposition on Sunday which sprang up in the House Committee of the Senate; was vigorously taken up by the Senate amendment. "Provided, That no part of the money hereby appropriated, or of the expenditures for the Exposition should be available on Sunday. The opposition in this matter is based entirely on the motion offered by the Hon. John N. Bland, of Missouri, to pronounce all such restrictions unconstitutional. But there was hardly time enough for proper debate. Besides, the Elliott bill will cover the ground, and again, when that United States Government and the right to legislate on this directly, the United States is not on, and descendments to amendments to appropriation bills are always looked upon with disfavor, the feeling always is that their rights upon aside getting and statuary, another feeling always is not to be overloaded. They felt that the World's Fair should not be opened to the general public on Sundays. Congressmen thought this was a subject upon which legislation is unnecessary. The Commissioners of the Exposition know perfectly well what the people's wants. They understood also that there are other means quite as effective as legislation in keeping the gates shut on Sunday, and that repaying their good faith to pack on the Sunday closing restriction would be an unwise and an offensive performance, if it was not done effectively on able men. The upshot of this parliamentary controversy is about this: The Senate yesterday final did pass was Mr. Jockney's substitute, requiring the Exposition to be closed on Sunday. This left Mr. Johnson on the third paragraph of his bill, a requirement that the gates be closed on the same day. Its amendment was defeated by parliamentary law. On Thursday the bill will very likely be taken up in the House, and we will probably have a yea and nay vote on the Sunday-closing amendment of the Senate. That the vote will close. They may not close the Exposition as they choose. The Commissioners would hesitate a good deal before they opened on that day. Some have often wondered how for the vote of the country and of whose will those votes shall be the exponent; or for whom they voted. If the Exposition is open in the final it was against the protest of the majority. She was a shum builtin'! But sham battle in the drill is preparation for actual war.
