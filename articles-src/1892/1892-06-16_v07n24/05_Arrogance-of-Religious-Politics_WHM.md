THE arrogance of the party of religious politics does not fail of expression in any of its public utterances as to the manner in which the different propositions to guide and control the morals of the world, at the World's Fair, were treated by the members of the House of Representatives. They had previously taken the measure of the House, but the vote showed an unaccountable shrinkage. The roll had been called in the lobby, and more than one hundred members had answered in the affirmative. These, it seems, were expected to vote "aye" upon any and all moral and religious questions, pertaining to the World's Fair, which might be sprung upon the House. When blushing Columbia should be brought before them, with fingers over her eyes, and apron corner in her mouth, asking with self-conscious femininity that the American standard of purity in art should be discovered by a congressional investigating committee, and enforced in the art rooms of Chicago; and when the political prohibitionists should ask Congress to prohibit Colonel Shepard's guests at the World's Fair from drinking their champagne, or their claret, outside of their twenty-five thousand dollar apartments; or when the Presbyterian and Methodist parsons appear with their revised census of Michigan and Ohio, in which the weird voices of so many millions who have no place or habitation, petition that Congress shall enforce for them a quiet Sunday for religious devotion at the World's Fair;—if any one of these were broached, or any two, or all three of them combined in one amendment, it was evidently expected that the entire contingent, which it was supposed had been gathered, would vote as one man, no matter how absurd, or paternal, or papal, the legislation might be that was asked. In this they attempted too much. They went outside of their commission. A legal enforcement by the central Government, of the outward semblance of virtue, or sobriety, is something they never will attain to; but the compulsory acknowledgment of Sunday sacredness is something which may be yielded without the sacrifice of a single personal gratification; when they asked for this alone the House gave it to them by an overwhelming majority, just as far as the character of the subject matter before them would permit.

This party of religious legislation has a commission, but its commission does not cover the entire scope of paternalistic action which it may occur to them to ask Congress to take. On the contrary, the field of their success is limited to the creation of a certain papal similitude, and their success in this will not reduce, but rather increase, sensuousness and sensuality.

But they waste no sorrow, even now, over the failure of the accompanying measures. That which makes the action, so far as it has gone, seem to them valueless, is that the House did not rise to an utter disregard of even the semblance of legislative propriety, and affix the condition of Sunday closing of the entire Fair, as a prerequisite to the further appropriation of any money by the Government for any purpose whatsoever connected with the Fair.

Congressmen recognize now, and always will, that they can not make the world virtuous by clothing statuary and turning nude pictures to the wall, or make the people temperate and sober by assuming control over the restaurants of the World's Fair for six months. Why then is it that they will not just as clearly see that the assumption of authority to enforce Sunday rest, by Congress, will not make another Christian, or save a single soul?

The questions of legislative propriety and jurisdiction deter them from giving their sanction to the first two measures; why should not the same reasons, existing in still greater degree, coupled with the knowledge that the religious factor involved should preclude all legislative action on the subject, cause them to refuse also their sanction to the last. It did not. Why not?
