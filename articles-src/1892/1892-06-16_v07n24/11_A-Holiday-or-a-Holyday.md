# A Holiday or a Holyday.

The question has interest for religious people as well as for the civil government. If it all that is involved in why Congress asked to consider anything in connection with the opening question except in this: Shall the exposition gates be open all days if it is not closed on Sunday? In the most prevalent common to everybody that it is a purely religious question. If Sunday were not a religious day nobody would ask to have the Fair closed. The only way to separate it from religious and religious considerations, is to separate it from Sunday, but that would destroy the question entirely, for it is the nature of that political day that gives rise to the question. This "civil rest-day" plan is most astonishingly hypocritical.
