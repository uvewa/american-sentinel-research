[Conclusion of the paper lately read by the Rev. J. H. Benson, before the Methodist ministers' Monday meeting, of La Crosse, Wis.]

TAKE, for example, the life of Paul; he never declared himself on Roman policies, although there was an outward and ordinary occasion for it; but it was the measure of great wisdom in him to remain silent as to outward operative forms, and work away on that which he knew would change the whole of them for the better. His appeal was to the divine life in the human heart.

Look at the political reforms of England, which were led on by the elder Pitt, and obstructed by Walpole; they were born and received their momentum in religious revivals of Whitfield and the Wesley. It is certainly a misfortune that this swift moving age gets impatient of these unseen and slow, yet tireless, forces of man's inward life. I refuse to believe that the great social evils with which we are now struggling, would have been in existence to-day if the Church had been faithful to her bestowed powers and opportunities.

The Church can not espouse any political method; for the Church of Christ needs equal evangelical influence over men of all political creeds. This it can not have, if even semi-officially, it takes up any partisan measure to carry it to its issue. No doubt it were possible for the religious life of this country to take up a question of political expediency and urge it to a successful issue; but the procedure would be extremely hazardous, because, if successful, there would be a coming down from the high grounds of revealed truth, and a committal of the Church to the uncertainties of the campaign. It would be a flushing of the energies of the religious life with hopes of a speedy and short way forbidden in the gospels; and when once there is a committal to this sort of work, it must continue, as there would be no chance of retreat from it; and when defeat comes, as it probably would, as change in the policy and form of law in this country is frequent, there would then be brought against the policy of the Church the repulsive force of an organized majority, against which the Church is not likely to prosper. It is the mission of the Church, by the gospel, to save all classes, in all parties; and if, from its borders should come the advocacy of any partisan measure, those who are not in harmony with that measure would be estranged, and rightly so, for such a measure is not the property of the Church. It is unwise for a church to take any political attitude that would produce among organized classes any irritation against it. There is but one step from hatred of a church, to hatred of religion. The Church can not afford to take any position that will fan the disaffection between the secular and the sacred spirit.

The Church as Christ made it is a spiritual body, designed to preserve and nourish its own spirituality and to convert unbelievers to the Saviour. Its high province is to hold, and to hold forth, the truth of God in Christ. There is an enormous amount of error afloat on this subject, simply because Christians go to the world to know how they ought to live, when they should go only to God's word; where they will find that the soul's relation to God is the first and the main thing, and that the Church is the spiritual household of faith, the fruits of which faith, in doing good to every one as we have opportunity, are to be seen in the Christian individual life.

These are times of more or less ecclesiastical tinkering with politics. Many of our people are not drawing the line. The unwritten law of fitness applies with equal force to national party conventions, and church associations. In a national party convention, candidates are nominated and a platform of principles is declared. There is no unfitness in such a proceeding. But before adjournment, suppose the convention sends out a committee to bring in a report on "Predestination," or the "Mole of Baptism," or "The Admissibility of Women to our General Conference." What would be the result? The Nation would laugh at the blunder, and the blunder would be a defeat. Whenever church associations voice themselves on the political expediencies, they go beyond their bounds, and blunder. All such proceedings go out in the name of the church, and they take their place as part of the problem of the political calculator. All political matters are out of place in a deliberative church assembly.

There are churches and preachers, unconsciously it may be, in the double business of politics and religion. This is the open and century-long policy of Rome, and because of her efforts to perpetuate her power along political lines, she is a menace to the Nation. If a church is committed formally to a partisan issue, rather than to the broad patriotism that knows no party, it is committed to a policy that will work the destruction of liberty as we understand it; but, first, and most fatally, it works the destruction of vital religion among the people. A church thereby destroys the power by which it wields the supreme truths of religion.

The churches of America are now suffering from the clash of political antagonisms within their own ranks, through the haste of those who say that their religious and political convictions are never to be separated, but to be uttered indiscriminately on all occasions. If this sentiment should prevail, and this state of things become general, the denominational church life of this country would soon sort itself according to political affiliations.

If the Christian life fades; if the Christian forces are so only in name; or if the secular spirit, in the popular mind, comes to be more efficient in the overthrow of social evils than the religious; it will, of course, come to that supremacy in which it will absorb everything.

The mingling of the Church and the world is to the sad detriment of the Church and without the slightest good to the world. Instead of leading the soul upward to a holy contemplation of Christ, they lead them into the dust and turmoil of political actions, where the soul becomes smirched and loses its power to rise to heavenly contemplations. Let the Church hold high and fast the standard of Christ's cross; and let this be the first and main work of the Christian Church, and then the people will be better fitted to discharge the personal duties which belong to them, both as men and citizens. So will the Church best work to purify our politics, and to serve the State.

Look at the sequel of Hamilcar taking his boy, Hannibal, nine years old, and laying the child's hands upon the altar and teaching him to swear eternal hatred to Rome. Hannibal, a man, became Rome's invincible enemy. He maintained his army for seventeen years in the very heart of Italian territory, and as long as he lived, even when he was without an army, in exile, his very name was a terror to the Roman Senate.

So the Church, in relation to the social and moral evils of the day, has no higher or more hopeful duty than by hearthstone and altar to imbue the hearts of the Nation's children with the unpictured horrors of, and with unchanging enmity toward, these evils: If the Christian Church will promptly discharge her great responsibility here, then from the cradles of the present shall arise the Hercules-like victors who shall rid the coming civilization from the power of these evils.
