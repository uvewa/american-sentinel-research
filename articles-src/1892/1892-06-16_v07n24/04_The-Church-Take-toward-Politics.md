# The Church Take toward Politics.

(Opinion of the papacy lately read by the Rev. Dr. McGlynn, in a public address.)

TAKE, for example, the life of Paul: he never described himself on Roman politics, although there was an outward and ordinary occasion for it; but it was the measure of great wisdom in him in his Roman state not to outward operative forms, and work upon so that which could not thus be changed, the whole of them for life better, the appeal was to the divine life in all men.

Look at the political reformers of England before the Reformation! They fought and were obstructed by Wycliffe; they were the religious revivals of Whitfield and the Wesleys in the last century: who dare say that this swift moving age is impatient of these measures only affecting a change in man\'s inward life. I refuse to believe that the great social evils which are now in struggle, would have been in existence to-day if the Church had been faithful to her bestowed powers and opportunities.

The Church can do more than any political method, for the Church of Christ can make and shape the public sentiment of all political communities. This it can do if it be true to itself; but the moment it, by any partisan measure to carry it to its bosom, the moment the men who lead the religious life of this country to take up a position of individual support--even though it is an honest issue; the procedure would be extremely hazardous--because, if successful, there would be a coming down from a high and impregnable fortress of truth, and a committal of the Church to the uncertainties of the campaign. It would be a forfeiting of the prestige of the Church; it would be to befool the world, filling it with hopes of a snoopy and deceptive character. For it is certain that once there is a committal to the side of one party or social political issue, there would be no chance of retreat from it; and with defeat certain, as, in gaining, there would be a change in its policy and form; and if one in this country be forgotten, there would then be brought against the Church, from the receiving force of an organized majority, against which the Church can hardly be likely to prosper. It is the mission of the Church, by the gospel, to rouse all classes, in all parties; and if, through the unwisdom, or the mistake, of any partisan measures, those who are now the Church\'s adherents should be estranged, and rightly so, for such a mission is not the proper office of the Church. It is unwise for a church to take any political attitude that would produce among organized classes any impression that will fan the disaffection from hatred of a church, to hatred of religion, and it would be very unwise to take any position that will fan the disaffection of the masses against the Church.

The Church of Christ made it a rule to deal with the interior and the normal, the own spirituality and to consecrate us to the salvation of the Saviour. Its high provision is to hold, and to hold forth, the truth of God. If the Church is to use an enormous amount of effort and of time in seeking to convince the men and women of the world to know how they ought to live, how short they would fall really and truly in the Catholic faith.

Where will they find the soul\'s true relationship to God but in Christ and the manifestation of the Christian life, the household of faith, the fruits of which faith, is to be seen in the Christian walk.

There are times of more or less social, intellectual tinkering with politics. Most of our people are not drawing the line. The social problems of this time, are as a rule a reference to national party conventions, and when there is a preference expressed as to candidates, candidates are nominated and elected by a minority vote of the people; the majority are content that others should act for them, or is unfitness in such a proceeding. But individuals, acquainted with principles, properly may and should make their views heard, to report on "Prohibition," or the "Morals of legislation." What I intend to say by this, relates to our general Conference.

I tell you, earnestly, if the religious churches enter into any political campaign, the world would laugh at the blunder, and the world would be right. When the ministers of church associations voice themselves on the political matters--party allegiances, free trade, bond issues, and bimetallism. All such proceedings shall take their place as part of a sectarian platform, for which the church stands. The moment we as a church, depart from the common practice of doing all their trading with the religion of Christ, that moment it is a foregone conclusion--and the sooner the better Sabbath observer we so earnestly recommend to all men at this hour, they may not do all their shopping before to-day\'s sundown.

When a body like a Sunday Sabbath Union makes in the communities we represent to face the reality of our danger placed before us when men as far as possible to influence the opinions of others on the side of practical religion.

Any church should make some other effort to move the day for the purposes of politics as well as to stand by the purchasers of Sunday stamps for their money and Sunday clothes for their vanity.
