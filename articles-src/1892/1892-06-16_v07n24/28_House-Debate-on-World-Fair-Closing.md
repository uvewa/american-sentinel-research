THIS is the way the discussion on the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, in the House of Representatives, appeared to the Washington correspondent of the Examiner:

On Wednesday and Thursday of the week when our anniversaries were in session, the House of Representatives was considering, in Committee of the Whole, two questions, whether the World's Columbian Exposition should be opened on Sunday, and whether the sale of intoxicating liquors be allowed. The contest was a very animated one, indeed, and you will have to watch the matter with eagle eye or they will get ahead of you yet. There is creeping on us a sentiment that all museums and expositions should be open on Sunday afternoons, at least. This opinion is cherished not only by the foreign element, but good Presbyterians of my acquaintance, after a sojourn on the continent, return converted to the new idea. In the debate which sprung up in the House Committee of the Whole over the Exposition appropriation, Mr. Johnstone, of South Carolina, introduced this amendment: "Provided, That no part of the amount hereby appropriated shall be available unless the doors of the Exposition shall be closed on Sunday." The opposition to this was most ingenious. Few members of the Committee had the hardihood of Mr. Bland, of Missouri, to pronounce all such provisions as "rot." One gentleman, a distinguished lawyer, inquired whether the laws of the State of Illinois did not cover the ground, and, again, whether the United States Government had any right to legislate on this matter. Amendments were piled on, and amendments to amendments, and substitutes. One provision laid an embargo upon nude painting and statuary, another upon gambling, another upon intoxicating liquor, and still another resolved that the Government exhibits at the World's Fair should not be opened to the public on the Sabbath day, which is Saturday. It was most ingeniously and alily argued that all such legislation is unnecessary. The Commissioners of the World's Fair are able men and know the people's wants. They understand also that there are rigid laws in Illinois on Sunday, and drinking, and gambling, and public morality. It seems like impugning their good faith to pack on the Sunday civil bill new legislation which is unparliamentary, and which at the same time would be a reflection on able men. The upshot of this parliamentary sham-battle was most amusing. What the Committee finally did pass was Mr. Dockery's substitute that the Government building, a very small part of the Exposition, should not be opened to the public on Sunday. This left Mr. Johnson on the third base, so to speak, with his side knocked out.

The motion to close the World's Fair on Sunday was defeated by parliamentary law. The Committee will recommend Mr. Dockery's substitute to the House, and we will probably have a yea and may vote on the whole bill. The good people of Illinois have the matter in hand so far, and may or may not close the Exposition as they choose. Sitting in the gallery of the House of Representatives as a disfranchised American citizen, I have often wondered how far the voters of my country charged up to themselves the acts of the very men for whom they voted. If the Exposition is open on Sundays, it will be due to the conduct of the accredited representatives of American Christians.

So this was a sham battle? But sham battles are part of the drill in preparation for actual conflict.
