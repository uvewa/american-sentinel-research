It is interesting and instructive to note the extreme dissatisfaction with the action of the House of Representatives on the amendment, offered in consideration of the sundry civil bill, to condition the remainder of the appropriation for the Government exhibit at the World's Fair upon the Sunday closing of the entire Fair. The Christian Statesman entitles an article upon the subject, "Our First Battle a Bull Run"; and says the vote of 131 to 36 to close the Government exhibit was "one of no value, as it only requires what Mr. Blaine as Secretary of State ordered at Paris and Vienna," and again on the editorial page declares:—

The first (but not final) decision in Congress as to the morals of the next World's Fair is that it shall be conducted (if the management so desire), not on the Anglo-Saxon plan of London and Philadelphia, but on the Franco-German plan of Paris and Vienna, with no Sabbath closing required except of the Government exhibit, which Secretary Blaine would have closed at Chicago, without the aid of Congress, as he did at Paris and Vienna. If this decision should be confirmed, the Fair would celebrate, not the discovery of America in 1492, but the foreignizing of America in 1893. Let it be swiftly and strongly shown that an un-American Fair cannot expect Americans to sustain it.

And again upon a very clear and accurate statement of the status of the question at Washington, presented by a correspondent, the Statesman comments editorially:—

We consider the defeat in this preliminary skirmish as much more serious than he regards it, because of the probability he mentions that "the bill appropriating more money will not pass at all" in which case we shall have no chance to defeat Sunday opening in the larger battle. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the Senate or President should secure to us, by non-concurrence with the House on the pending bill, the conditions voted down. Dr. Gray of the Interior thinks that if Congress refuses the five millions and it is furnished by private parties, the management will pay no heed to moral considerations. The Government will, in that case, have twice missed its opportunity to prevent this result.

THE Political Dissenter is also in the same dissatisfied frame of mind, and speaks of what it expected and what it requires from congressmen and from its own following, with no less assurance than the Statesman. It says:

Mr. Stone's amendment provided that no portion of the money should be paid to the management unless they filed with the Secretary of the Treasury a written agreement that the gates of the Exposition should be closed on the Sabbath. This provision on a preliminary vote seemed to be about to carry, together with a further provision that no intoxicating liquors should be sold at any time on the Fair grounds. The vote on this last amendment was 87 to 80 in its favor. But the next day, May 26, many of the professed friends of temperance and the Sabbath proved untrue to their sacred cause. Only 27 stood firm on the first vote to 122 against the proposed provision. Col. Stone forced another vote by tellers, which brought out a somewhat larger vote on each side—43 to 134. He has expressed his determination to compel a yea and nay vote, and thus put every man on record. The provision, which was adopted to close the national Government building on the Sabbath, and prohibit the sale of liquors in it, is a virtual grant of full liberty for Sabbath violation and drunkard making elsewhere.

What has become of the one hundred or more members of the lower house of Congress who had expressed themselves in favor of closing the Fair on the Sabbath? In our issue of May 2 we gave the names of nearly a hundred of these professed friends of the Lord's day. And yet only twenty-seven stood firm at first, and only forty-three under the pressure of a vote by tellers. This vote says to the managers of the Fair, "Go ahead and keep it open Sabbath days and all, and make all the money you can by Sabbath desecration and the liquor traffic." And thus the responsibility of this double iniquity rests on the United States Government. We call, therefore, on all loyal Christians, to come out and be separate both from the Fair, and from the Government that has determined its immoral character.

It is remarkable how full an expression this incident has brought out, from these organs of the party of political religion, of their dissatisfaction with anything short of a complete governmental assumption of control of the morals and religion of the Nation. They are filled with such an insane desire for this that they, as well as their congressman who presented this amendment, are unable to see why a provision should not be tacked on to the appropriation for the Government exhibit by which the Government would virtually boycott the Fair, to which it has already fully committed itself in every possible legislative way, unless its managers sign and deliver an agreement not to open on Sundays. That there should be or should have been such a possibility in the mind of any one shows such an unreasonableness upon this question as makes them willing to undertake almost any puerility which appeals to them to be for the furtherance of their ends. And the end which they seek is not so much Sunday observance, in itself, as that the supreme civil authority of the State shall set the seal of its approbation upon it, and give its signet ring to those who desire to create an "American Sabbath" by law. The propagation of religion is secondary, their first thought is the creation of a Protestant similitude to the Papacy.
