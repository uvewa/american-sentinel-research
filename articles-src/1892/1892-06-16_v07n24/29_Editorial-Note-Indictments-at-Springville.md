It is stated that some of the members of the Springville, Tenn., Seventh-day Adventist Church, recently convicted of maintaining a nuisance by Sunday work, have been again indicted. Indictments have also been found against other members of the same church. It is openly the avowed purpose of the Prosecuting Attorney to "put a stop to that Sunday desecration."
