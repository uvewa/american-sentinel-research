# Editorial Notes (Continued).

It is stated that some of the members of the Springville, Tenn., Seventh-day Adventist Church, recently convicted of maintaining a nuisance by Sunday work, have been again indicted. Indictments have also been found against other members of the same church. It is openly avowed a purpose of the Prosecuting Attorney to "put a stop to this Seventh-day Adventism."

The Supreme Court of the State of Georgia has decided, in an appealed case from the Superior Court of Houston, Ga., that the statute making it a misdemeanor to hunt any kind of game with gun or dogs, or by nets, on Sunday, does not violate the Constitution of the State the United States; and also holds that "Sunday," and "the Sabbath day," are synonymous in the legal and legislative language of Georgia.

---

THE demand made by Sunday-keepers that those who observe the seventh day shall also keep Sunday, is no more reasonable than was the like demand made by Nebuchadnezzar that the three Hebrews who worshipped, should also bow down to the golden image mark--he had set up. The king did not forbid the worshipping of the living God; he only required a very slight and formal acknowledgment of his god and of his religion. The partisans of Sunday aim to make similar demands was the heathen king.

---

The light fine imposed by the Judge of the case of the four Adventists, referred to on another page of this paper, must not be understood as indicating a purpose on his part to discourage the prosecution of such or the finding of indictments for Sunday work. On the contrary, the Judge warned the prisoners that if they persisted in Sunday work in the future, the situation would resolve itself into a question of the relative strength of the law and such a manner was needed in fact in such a contest the Court could take but one course.

---

We are reliably informed that a number of indictments for Sunday work will be found against Seventh-day Adventists, at the next term of the circuit court in Obion County, Tenn. In fact, the Attorney General told one of the editors of this paper that that lack of time alone prevented the finding of such indictments by the last Grand Jury, and that, "at the next term of court every man of them who violated it," [the Adventists] that work on Sunday will be prosecuted until they quit it.

One of the most contemptible features of the recent Sunday cases in Henry County, Tenn., was that brethren were made to testify against brethren. Though the work done was alleged to be a great annoyance to the people of the country, not one witness was found to testify against them who was not, by fact or deed, not in two of those cases had anybody but Adventists, who were themselves at work, seen the defendants at work on Sunday. They only suspected that it was their habit to work on Sunday because they were known to rest upon the seventh day. The indictments were found against "five of the leading members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church," not upon evidence that they worked on Sunday, but simply because of the fact that they belonged to that church, and that the defendants were surprised and four of the defendants convicted on evidence wrung from their brethren in the church.

WHAT is the lesson of the logic of the events chronicled in the last few issues of the SENTINEL---the Supreme Court decision making that this is a Christian Nation---a judicial decision that Sunday is its Sabbath; the result of the vote in the House of Representatives on May 19 and 20, and the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, the many heated discussions that have swept all over the country; and the prosecution of honest, simple hearted, Christian men for personally, conscientiously keeping the day they believe to be the Sabbath? Who will take heed and learn?

---

THE Christian Statesmen virtually demands of the Sabbath Unionists that it amounts to nothing, when it says:---

Those who say "Blue Laws," thereby predicate for themselves that law is less divine. After all the country has invested of the expense of making laws, we forget that every man and woman has to learn to pay its own expenses also. That distinction is not that they are altogether. The Christian Statesman earnestly. Not "the" but demand of the state of the law. It is a matter of opinion merely whether it was a wasted and educated American that it is in a belief so far advanced from where the beginning, where he met it is law.

---

Admit that law itself may to "lawless men," and the whole question stands just where it ought to, namely, on the merits of the law. Does the *Statesman* think the Fugitive Slave Law ought ever to have been obeyed? Does it think that laws permitting and legalizing slavery ever gave the slaveholder any just property rights in human flesh and blood? If not, how can it be that law can take

A one seventh part of his time and give it into the custody of It? A man's time is his own just as much as is his body, and only God has a right to demand that a portion of it be rendered back to him who gave it. Human "Sabbath laws" undertake to dispose of one seventh of that which only God has any right to do.

---

Those who cry "Blue Laws" as not, as the *Statesman* claims, "thereby professing their love of lawlessness and contempt of all law." Blue Laws are codified injustice, namely is disregarding contempt, or the tyranny of brute force. This can in little better than the other. Whatever differences there is in its favor of disregarding injustice, for where injustice is done by individuals without the color of the law it is a short level. Where it is respected by law it has an appearance of respectability that prolongs the wicked practice.
