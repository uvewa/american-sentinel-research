Volume 7 of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL closes with this number. Number 1, Vol. 8, will bear date of January 5, 1893; we will, therefore, publish no paper next week. This is according to our custom, but is mentioned for the information of new subscribers.

The next number of THE SENTINEL will be one of special value. The leading article will be a brief but comprehensive history of the National Reform movement, and of what it has accomplished. This article has been written specially for the initial number of the new volume, and ought to be read by everybody. "Limitations to Majority Rule," and the "Christian's Duty to Obey Civil Rulers," are also among the important subjects to be treated in this number of THE SENTINEL. This paper will be No. 1, Vol. 8, of THE SENTINEL, and will bear date of January 5, 1893. Extra copies will be furnished at $1 per hundred, or $8 per thousand.
