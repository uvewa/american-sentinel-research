The House Committee of the Columbian Exposition, Mr. Durborow, Chairman, has reported a bill authorizing the World's Fair managers to open the Fair on Sunday, but instructing them to stop machinery and traffic, and so far as possible manual labor on that day.

This bill is utterly unworthy of the support of any body except those who are concerned only for the financial interests of the Fair. It can be defended on no correct principle whatever. Congress has no right to say how Sunday shall be observed, or whether it shall be observed at all or not; and the only proper action for that body to take now is to simply repeal the Sunday-losing proviso, and pass a resolution declaring that the whole question is beyond the proper sphere of civil government, and that especially is this true of a government operating under a Constitution which provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."

This has been the position of THE SENTINEL all along, and we are glad to see that some of the daily papers are catching the idea. The World, of the 15th inst., had this to say on the subject:—

Why should not Congress take its hand completely off this matter and leave it to the discretion of the managers? What business has Congress to legislate on the subject of the religious observance of days in a country which is supposed to set all religions free and to let all religions alone?

Is it not time to recognize the fact that in this Republic the State has absolutely nothing to do with the Church, and that Congresses and Legislatures are not bodies qualified by theological training or by religious impulse to dictate to the people what Sabbaths and holy days they shall observe, or how?

A bill is also proposed simply repealing the Sunday closing proviso and leaving the matter in the hands of the Board of Directors, just where it properly belongs. We regard it as very improbable that such a bill would pass, but its discussion would serve an excellent educational purpose just now; and education along this line must always prove detrimental to so-called National Reform.
