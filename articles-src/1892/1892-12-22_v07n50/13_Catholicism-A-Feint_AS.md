ROMAN Catholicism has assumed a prominence in its relation to the political questions of our country that has given it some prestige as an issue in the late presidential campaign; not, indeed, as a distinct plank in any party platform, but as a party influence so marked as to elicit some public comment and prophecies of approaching danger.

While there is doubtless some cause for apprehension of danger from the growing power of Catholicism, it is mainly so from the fact that Protestants, so-called, have so generally ceased to protest. But while from that point arise dark clouds that are somewhat obscuring the horizon of our fair land, from another quarter, as the smoke of a pit, there has arisen an influence that has overcast the zenith of our national glory and darkened the sunlight of liberty.

The National Reform Party, so-called, with its many allies, has done more to override the Constitution of our country, and stultify the wisdom of our forefathers who so carefully framed it, than Catholicism has ever been, or ever could be, able to do, unaided by the truckling of fallen Protestantism. We can only regard it as a feint by the arch-deceiver, to divert attention from the approach of a more deadly foe.
