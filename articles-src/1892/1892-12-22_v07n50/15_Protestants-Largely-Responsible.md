THE result of the recent election has made the downfall of Commissioner Morgan certain. For some reasons, perhaps, this is not to be regretted although General Morgan's administration of the Indian Bureau has been better than that of his predecessors. When he came to office he found the Government committed to the support of a number of so-called Indian contract schools. These are nothing more nor less than denominational schools, supported out of the public treasury.

General Morgan declared his purpose to abolish the whole system, and in this he was clearly right, but by this declaration he provoked the everlasting hostility of the Roman Catholics, and it was a foregone conclusion that his political undoing was only a question of time. It is true that in taking the position that he did, General Morgan may have been influenced more by his opposition to Romanism, than by fidelity to the principle of absolute separation of Church and State; but be that as it may, it is to be regretted that the system which he endeavored to terminate seems likely to survive. But for this, the so-called Protestant churches of the country are very largely responsible. Had they unitedly denounced the evil in the beginning instead of becoming parties to it, by themselves accepting Government money for the support of their Indian missions, the penicious system could not have survived. But now it is almost certain that it will not only live but that it will grow.
