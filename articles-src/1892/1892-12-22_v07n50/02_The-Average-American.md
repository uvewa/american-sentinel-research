In a "Round Table of Good Reading" in the Christian Statesman, Oct. 8, 1892, the editor-in-chief, Mr. W. F. Crafts, sets forth the following:

It would not do the average American a bit of harm to be put through a course of genuflections and prostrations after the Greco-Russian style. It might help to moderate some of his impudence to be made to kneel oftener; even to get his face fairly in the dust, as I have seen in the case of well-dressed ladies, black-coated civilians, and officers in gold lace, as well as poor folks.

And it is into the hands of such men as this that the governmental power of the United States has been surrendered! Doubtless the people will discover it when it is too late for deliverance from the cruel exercise of it.
