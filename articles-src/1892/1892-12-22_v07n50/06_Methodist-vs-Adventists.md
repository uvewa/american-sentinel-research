# Methodist vs. Adventists.

ONLY a short time ago we chronicled the fact that a Seventh-day Adventist had been recently arrested and fined for husking corn in his own field on Sunday. Notice has recently come to us that this place has not a monopoly of Methodist intolerance. We have just received from another State containing the following notice from a minister and member of that denomination:

> We undersigned with the fear of God and the public good before his eyes, would call the attention of the proper authorities to certain parties in this vicinity who are in the habit of openly working, seeking to sell a book "Bible Readings," on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday, and thereby desecrating and setting bad examples the observance of the Lord's Day. The names of the parties referred to are as follows: ———— ———— ———— ————.
>
> Yours, J. H LEAVEN,
>
> Pastor of the ———— Church.

The foregoing copied from the Easton, ———— paper, is a fair specimen of the the bigotry and intolerance of those who wouldn't? Another Sabbath-keeper. Publishing nothing in the Scriptures to sustain them, they want to be by putting such articles as this into the papers to keep the people from learning the truth in regard to themselves. The way in which it is worded betrays a spirit which it is hard to believe is himself knows nothing about, what he is to trying to serve the Lord Christ, by complaining of others and judging even for himself.

He says the colporteur Adventists are breaking down the Lord's day, he is. If he charges them with undermining the Bible, that is just what they do not do. The Bible says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord;" and in Isa. 58:13, it says, "If thou turn thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord." This minister should not honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words;" then "shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord." All Adventists are trying to do, is to show the people that the seventh day, and not the first day or Sunday, is not the Sabbath of the Lord, not that it is not coming the Bible.

The book against which this minister warns both Protestants and Catholics says not a word against Sunday observance, but does not say. Mr. Leaven is simply warning the people against reading the Bible, or to express it through his eyes.
