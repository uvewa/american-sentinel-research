# An Interesting Mass-meeting in Chicago.

## THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION ROUTS THE ADVENTISTS AND THE TABLES TURNED IN FAVOR OF RELIGION IN THE FIFTY-SECOND CONGRESS.

DECEMBER 13 and 14, 1892, the American Sabbath Union had a programme prepared conjointly by some of the leading ministers and churches of Chicago, for the enforcement of Sunday observance by law, held its annual session meeting in the city of Chicago. According to previous arrangements, mass meetings were held in four of the largest churches of the city Tuesday night, December 13, at each of which certain of the leading speakers and workers in this Union gave addresses, urging the people to stand firm in the cause of Sunday, to petition Congress to close the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday, to petition against all who would favor opening it, to petition against Mayor Washburne, the local Fair Directory, and all others who dared to ask or petition Congress to open the gates on any day of "our" July.

One of these meetings was held at the South Park Methodist Episcopal Church, corner of 33rd and Indiana Avenue. Rev. T. C. Iliff, District Superintendent, and Rev. H. H. George, of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, the Field Secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was the leading speaker and controlling spirit of the evening. A moderately sized audience, consisting of perhaps one or four hundred persons, assembled in the spacious church to listen to what was to be said. With Rev. H. N. Akroyd, of the Methodist Church, in the chair, Mr. Hay, State Secretary of the Union for Indiana, opened the meeting by reading a portion of the Scripture and making a long prayer. Mr. George spoke quite enthusiastically for a time in regard to the work of the Union, directing his remarks to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and the petition which has recently been going up and quite extensively circulated for the repeal of the Sunday-closing act of Congress and the opening of the Fair on Sunday, the said machinery stopped and religious services provided for within the gates. For Congress to repeal its action touching this matter, he said, would be going backward, and a fatal blow to an institution upon which, on the other hand he said, the Republic rested.

After these remarks, of course, Mr. Locke, a member of Englewood, spoke for a short time upon the subject of uniting men and the Sunday rest, after which a motion was offered for the whole floor for consideration and adoption.

The resolutions constituted a petition to Congress for closing the World's Fair on Sunday. One man arose, and against moving it, saying that he understood Mr. Washburn that in going to Washington to ask the opening of the Fair on Sunday because he was not attending to his business and would better be home attending to Sunday laws of his State and city. The petition was quickly read, and its adoption moved and carried, and to the evident satisfaction of Mr. George's friends in that the "ones" seemed to have it. A rising vote was called for, which appeared to be in favor of the petition. But the friends of those present were evidently not all of one mind.

## WANTED TO HEAR REASONS.

The gentleman who had presented and read the resolutions at once requested that some one of those who had voted against the motion be asked to explain his reasons for voting thus; in response to which a call was made for "Mr. Jones." This call seemed to surprise not a few, and the fact that Alonzo T. Jones, editor of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, was invited to write a paper uncompromisingly opposed to religious legislation, they were astonished to find that the South Park M. E. Church being in the vicinity of the Seventh-day Adventist headquarters, the population of the religious denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists—a people coming to be quite well known as sharp champions of religious liberty and opponents of governmental interference in matters of religion,—gave a number of them a splendid opportunity to be at this prayer meeting.

## THE REASONS GIVEN.

Mr. Jones being called upon, began by saying to the chairman that those who voted against the resolutions. He said that his reason for not voting that the Fair on Sunday was concerned they would not turn their lands over to them if it was opened or closed; but that those who were opposed to the resolutions presented, as the resolutions were a protest against Seventh-day Adventists. He also presented some reasons from a constitutional standpoint. He stated that Sunday legislation was religious legislation and religious legislation wholly, citing as proof the fact that the Sunday closing measure was asked for by churches and religious people and no others, was interrupted by Congress, and stated that the measure was purely religious. Chaplain at the time the measure was so. Mr. George admitted this was so, but his own argument had shown it abundantly proved.

Mr. Jones then proceeded to show that the powers of the general Government belonging to the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people, and consequently the general Government has never had delegated to it the power to legislate upon religious matters or questions, Congress had no right whatever to legislate upon this subject. He further declared that the Government was positively forbidden from touching religious creeds and matters by the Constitution which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." Congress shall not make any law, therefore Sunday legislation on the part of the general Government is unconstitutional; and that those who by threats of loss of places had moved their opposition, had forced Congress to override the supreme law of the land, as Article Six of the Constitution declares the Constitution of the United States to be. That by thus coming together with ill-gains they were working for oblivion, on the part of others to override the Constitution.

A third point made, was to the effect that the Sabbath, Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts, Secretary of the American Sabbath Union Association, to which he belongs knew this kind of legislation to be unconstitutional, for, for the last twenty years and more they have been laboring to secure a religious amendment to the Constitution, in order that this very kind of legislation might have an "undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land;" but that having no such basis they had gone ahead with the legislation without; they could not go ahead constitutionally, and that the legislation is unconstitutional. This no prearranged plan to "pack" the meeting. On account of the inclemency of the weather and an apparent indifference on the part of that class which it might naturally be supposed would be largely represented, quite a number of Seventh-day Adventists, contrary to their own expectations, found themselves crowded in themselves in the majority. And inasmuch as this meeting was a mass-meeting, and all present were called upon to vote, this people, expressing themselves in accordance with their conscientious convictions, accordingly voted the resolutions down, and unconscionably and quite unexpectedly turned the scales of the American Sabbath Union against itself.

fact Mr. Jones made very emphatic and clear, and no attempt was made by Mr. George in his reply to answer it.

In conclusion, Mr. Jones reminded that although not affecting the principles of the question by any means it was nevertheless a fact that Sunday was not the Sabbath; the seventh day, and not the first, the seventh day, was the Sabbath of the fourth commandment; and not Sunday the first day; and that the American Sabbath Union was therefore not only overriding the supreme law of the land, but the divine law of the universe.

This sort of argument was rather too much for Mr. George to take gracefully. When he got the floor to respond, he said he enabled an order similar to that which he had seen in the *Christian Statesman* late last summer, and expressed his pleasure at having Adventists present in terms not the most complimentary, asserting that he thanked the Lord there were so few of them in comparison to the forty millions of people he claimed were behind him and his cause. He also cited the Haymarket rioters, of Chicago, a few years ago, and by their acts addressed stating the right of the Adventists who attend the meeting, covered much in the same way. He was talking so long the resolutions thus failing to carry.

The chairman of the evening, Rev. Mr. Akroyd, it must be said to his credit, took the position of the Adventists on this in very many respects. Several turns were taken by the speakers, both of which were ready and forced in their discussion, and both being exceptionally well received by the congregation. Mr. George reminded one of what modern military styles call the "battle of the giants." It was certainly the best and most direct way of liberty for one in those days of progressive ecclesiasticism to have put it a decided victory. A few others particularly of the Adventists gave some words of fact past its credit, when Mr. George and his friends withdrew from the scene evidently much discomfited and chagrined. They had evidently encountered not only what they did not expect, but were not able successfully to resist.

The Seventh-day Adventists evidently had as much right to attend and take part in the meeting as any other citizens, it being advertised as a "mass-meeting;" and when it was remembered that they were invited to speak and give their reasons for their side, their action in voting against the resolutions, had certainly which defeat caused the indignation which is created in the American Sabbath Union is not just, and it is to some degree from the following statement, published in the account of the meetings at the First Methodist Church, in the Chicago office of the American Sabbath Union study the course of the Adventist "disorderly conduct," and here was a proposition, was made to send a telegram to the House Committee on the World's Fair, stating the result of the four mass-meetings.

> I think the facts ought to be stated that we had a well organized effort on the part of the Adventists, and there was a decidedly well organized effort on the part of the enemies, this being the most successful effort I ought to be made against them by our own speakers, and no such course again taken to defeat the action taken. I am very much opposed to any such course.

> A few men, calling themselves so-and so, should not be allowed to come deliberately to an organized meeting of that description, and show themselves so much organized that meeting, and show themselves so much more than they have any right to deny the arguments of the speaker. Mr. George is right about it, that is the Constitution [the House World's Fair Committee] should have the facts before it, and it ought to be shown to the people the unfair manner in which the vote was attempted to be taken.

Following an editorial in *The Inter-Ocean* the next morning appeared the following very accurately:

> We are not quite sure as to the accuracy of this report; but assuming it to measure from their standpoint it speaks for itself.

Such are the illiberal sentiments of those who are insisting that Congress has the right to maintain its action for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and the liberty they would give to free citizens, and the liberty they desire.
