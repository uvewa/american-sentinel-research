The following note from the author of a work quoted on page 371 of the current volume of THE SENTINEL, explains itself:

Baltimore, Dec. 13, 1892.

To THE EDITOR OF THE AMERICAN SENTINEL: With many thanks for your kind mention of my little book on "The Law of Sunday," will you give me leave to suggest that your reviewer has done me a high but undeserved honor by connecting my name with the Johns Hopkins University? I am really an humble member of the Law Faculty of Baltimore University, an entirely distinct institution.

Truly Yours,
JAS. T. RINGGOLD.

We are glad to correct this error into which one of our editorial writers inadvertently fell. We wish only to give our readers the veritable facts upon every subject presented in our columns. Those who are acquainted with Mr. Ringgold's book will not esteem him less highly because he is not connected with the Johns Hopkins University; the knowledge of the facts will simply give them an added interest in the Baltimore University.
