THE Advance claims that the Sunday resolutions from the religious societies are wholly spontaneous and in no way through the influence of the "Sabbatarian associations." Does not this item from the proceedings of the annual meeting of the M. E. Church General Missionary Committee, held last month in Baltimore, show about how spontaneous these resolutions are:—

A telegram from Rev. Dr. J. H. Knowles was read, requesting the General Committee to protest against the present scheme to remove the Sunday closing condition from the national appropriation to the World's Fair.

A committee was appointed to do it in behalf of the body.

Another item from the organ of the Presbyterian Missionary Society, Church at Home and Abroad for December suggests how the Presbyterians do not work in China. In the edict of a magistrate favoring toleration of Christians, this plea is made: "Foreigners preaching in China have never used coercion nor have they thwarted the magistrates, but each Chinese may or may not embrace the (new) religion according to his own pleasure. Nor do the converts oppose the good among the people, but are themselves all loyal subjects of China."
