# A Congressman's Influence.

A CONGRESS'S Minister of Massachusetts has written an open letter to Bishop Potter which is a regular continuity in the way, coming as it does from a member of Congress from a member of Congress stature in the country. The Congressman writes as follows:

*To Rt. Rev. Bishop Potter*

> I learn from the Members of Congress on receipt of a very widely written letters against the reopening of the Sunday of the World's Fair, and the repeal of the provisions accompanying the appropriation, I express earnest hope that the responsible Bishop of your Church hold the Lord's Day. This letter is remarkable for what it says.

First, it does not say that the petitions asking for the opening of the Fair on Sunday bear the names of thousands of additional patrons who would be glad to add their signatures to the petition.

Secondly, it is entirely silent in regard to letters urging on the Lord's day, being a double record of the Christian people of Chicago at least of the First Methodist Church, not of millions, of our countrymen, and then petitioned against the Sunday opening.

This letter emphasizes the action of Congress in deciding that the Sunday closing of the Sabbath, and that it must be kept holy by closing the Fair upon that day. Not only has the Senator assumed to decide this question, but a member of that body takes it upon himself, to practically read out of the Church those who think that the Fair might be consistently kept open on Sunday. This again is really to Sunday not only made the test of Christianity but admission to certain forms of Sunday observance is decreed to be necessary to entitle one to recognition as a Christian. And not only so, but the thunderbolts of God's wrath are to be used against any who would question Sunday according to Mr. Morse's ideas of Christianity.

"Sunday is absolutely without any standing in the Bible. This book knows it only as an ordinary working day, but lot under the leadership of the so-called American Sabbath Union, the popular churches of the country have made its observance, and that in a particular way, the great and all-important element of Christianity. THE test of Christian fellowship!" All Congress has been only aided in this matter, and a member of Congress then aids himself to instruct in this regard a Bishop in regard to the government of the Church?

Since foregoing was put in type, Bishop Potter has sent the following reply letter:

*Rev. Elijah A. Morse*

> The recent use of my name in the discussions has not been authorized by me, and if it had not been given to you, you would have been given no an opportunity to reply at all to me. But the matter ought to rest here. I have used all of my power is reply in your letter, further the attempt to place me in any false position or misrepresentation. Very truly yours.

New York, Nov. 17.

Our readers that the note be not acknowledged or gratified is not of not of place, in this Sunday Rest of your national legislation.

C. P. B.
