# Uncertainties - American Sentinel v07n50 (1892-12-22)

## General Note

The scan quality for this issue is notably poor throughout, with low resolution, faded text, and blurring affecting all 8 pages. Many passages were extremely difficult to read, and several transcriptions contain passages where the exact wording could not be confirmed with high confidence. A higher-resolution scan would be needed to verify many readings.
