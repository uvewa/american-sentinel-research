# Uncertainties Log - Volume 7, Number 50 (December 22, 1892)

## General Notes

- **Page 1, Line 9**: "Perjuration" appears in the masthead motto - likely OCR error for "Persuasion" (from Jefferson's quote "Equal and Exact Justice to all Men, of Whatever State or Persuasion, Religious or Political")

- **Page 1, Line 19**: "BORN ST." appears as the address - uncertain if this is correct or should be "BOND ST." Given the address in later issues, this is likely "BOND ST."

- **Page 2, Line 95**: "notifie" should likely be "notified"

- **Page 3, Line 320**: "Iea. 58:13" appears to be OCR error for "Isa. 58:13" (Isaiah)

- **Page 4, Line 262**: "A. O. TATT" - signature appears with double T, but known author is "A. O. Tait" (single T) - likely OCR error

- **Page 6, Line 412**: "C. P. R." appears as signature - uncertain if this is correct initials. Given context and previous articles, this may be "C. P. B." (C. P. Bollman)

- **Page 7, Line 451**: Author signature appears as "ERNEST H. RUSSELL" (new author not previously in known authors list)

- **Page 8, Line 594-603**: Table format with subscription prices appears corrupted in OCR - numbers and columns not clearly delineated

## Author Attribution Notes

- **Article 12 (Methodist Protest)**: Signed "ERNEST H. RUSSELL" - new author, not in previously known authors list
- **Article 6 (The Secret is Out)**: Signed "ALLEN MOON" - new author, appears with full name
- **Article 13 (Catholicism—A Feint)**: Signed "A. SMITH" - new author

## Confidence Levels

- **HIGH**: Most article text, titles, and author attributions are clear
- **MEDIUM**: Address "BORN ST." vs "BOND ST." - requires verification against original
- **MEDIUM**: "C. P. R." signature - may be C. P. Bollman
- **LOW**: Table formatting on page 8 - subscription prices table structure unclear
