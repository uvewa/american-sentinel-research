The order of the day just at present seems to be more or less pronounced religious war. The contest over the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is making itself felt in Congress and throughout the whole country.

In Toledo, Ohio, there is a bitter combat between Protestants and Roman Catholics over the public school question. Protestant antagonism to the Hebrew is also manifest in this case, as appears from this paragraph in the published report of the trial of one of the members of the Board of Education of the city for unjustly seeking the dismissal of teachers who were Roman Catholics. The paragraph reads:—

Miss Humphrey, another East Toledo teacher, testified that Scott said Kuhn (a Hebrew member of the board) had taken advantage of his (Scott's) absence to appoint Miss Sugarman, a Jewess, and that he (Scott) had no more use for a Jew than for a Catholic.

Further examination developed such a condition of things as this:—

Professor Hutchinson, assistant superintendent of schools, testified that Dr. Scott asked for a list of the Catholic teachers employed in the city. The list was furnished. The doctor remarked that he wanted to get rid of the Catholic teachers, and he (Hutchinson) had remarked that Miss Sullivan was one Catholic that should be kept anyway, owing to her excellence as a teacher. Mr. Hutchinson continued: "Dr. Scott wanted a Miss Beall removed, saying she was a Catholic. He also told me Miss Sugarman must not get a school. I asked him how he would prevent it if she passed the examination. He said: 'Has she got her certificate yet?' I replied, 'No, but she will.' Then he said: 'She must be marked down so low she will not get a certificate. Compton should do that. I would do it myself if I dared.'" Professor Hutchinson admitted belonging to a secret anti-Catholic society, therefore his testimony was certainly not swayed by religious bias in favor of the Catholics.

This is significant. The assistant superintendent of schools a member of a secret anti-Catholic society! Oath-bound to discriminate on religious grounds against a religious sect! Members of the Board of Education, the member on trial, no doubt, as well as others, belonging also to the same organization! Such conditions as those immediately bore their legitimate fruit as this shows—the closing paragraph of the same report:—

The city is greatly excited over the affair, which is dished up in the daily papers to the extent of pages. Several bloody affrays have resulted from the excitement, and neighbor is arrayed against neighbor, according to their sympathies.

The same sectarian contest, from a different point of view, crops out in this State; a dispatch from Saratoga says:—

There is commotion in Waterford, this county, over the reading of the Bible in the public schools. Father Emmett, of St. Mary's Church, of Waterford, demanded of Superintendent Falconer that he order the teachers to cease reading the Bible, on the ground that to do so was against the law. The superintendent declined, saying he could only act on the orders of the Board of Education. Then Father Emmett went to some of the teachers and ordered them to discontinue reading the Scriptures in school; and they stopped doing so. Last evening the priest sent a letter to the Board, calling their attention to the fact that the Bible was read in the schools, with a request that its reading be ordered discontinued. The Board deemed the demand of Father Emmett "discontestuous and impudent," and entitled to no consideration, as this priest is not even a legally qualified voter in the school district. The Board passed a resolution instructing the teachers not to obey any orders or instructions except those of the Board and the school superintendent, and threatening instant dismissal if orders from "outsiders" were obeyed. The Protestant Clergymen of Waterford have held a union meeting.

In Pittsburg the preachers have undertaken to dictate to the city government, and control the policing of the city. In this city Rev. Dr. Parkhurst has thrown down the gauntlet, without reservation, and the war between himself and his society, and Police Superintendent Byrnes is now to the death.

The war is certainly on already, in not a few phases. It is a contest for sectarian supremacy over Congress, the World's Fair and the Nation, for supremacy over other sects, and for control of the policing and municipal government of cities.

This is a new revolution. The aristocracy of religion is making it coup d'etat.
