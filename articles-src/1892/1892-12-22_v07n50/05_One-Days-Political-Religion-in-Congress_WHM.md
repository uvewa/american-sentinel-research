The proceedings of the second session of the Fifty-second Congress are already characterized by many of those incidents which would be apt to such a great council of religion as Chaplain Butler of the Senate declared that body resembled when discussing the Sunday closing of the World's Fair.

Number 6, of the Congressional Record begins with "Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. J. G. Butler, D.D." Under its second sub-head—"Petitions and Memorials"—such documents are reported as presented by twenty-one different senators, nine of whom offered petitions upon religious subjects; one marked example being recorded as follows:

MR. PEPPER.—I present a paper intended to be in the nature of a petition, but it refers to several different matters that are not cognizable by one committee, and I will briefly state its purport.

It is first an expression of thanks to God, and to both Houses of Congress, and to the President for the passage of an anti-lottery law, and prayer for the passage of the Hatch-Washburn anti-option bill.

The next paragraph is a petition praying this body to stand by its action on the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday, and not to retrace its steps in relation to the sale of intoxicating liquors on the World's Fair grounds.

The next paragraph is a petition to Congress praying for legislation to restrict immigration by consular examinations, educational tests, and a high tariff on immigrants.

The last paragraph is a petition to Congress and to the President to accomplish the submission of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment, forbidding State Legislatures (as only Congress is now forbidden) to unite Church and State, and especially forbidding what is the very essence of such union, namely, sectarian appropriations.

This paper comes from the Presbyterian Church of Washington, Kan., and inasmuch as it relates chiefly to matters that concern the Columbian Exposition, I move that it be referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

The motion was agreed to.

MR. DOLPH.—I present a copy of the petition just presented by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Peffer]. It is a petition from citizens of Milton, Oreg. I move that the petition be referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

MR. PLATT.—What is the nature of the petition?

MR. DOLPH.—I say it is a copy of the petition which has just been presented by the Senator from Kansas, but from a different place. He has fully stated its contents, but I can give the contents if the Senator from Connecticut desires it.

MR. PLATT.—Just in a word.

MR. DOLPH.—It starts out with the following resolution:

Resolved, That we rejoice and thank God, and Congress also, with the President, for the Sabbath closing of the World's Fair.

It authorizes our presiding officer to forward this and the following resolutions to the President and through our congressman and the senators residing nearest to us to both Houses of Congress, in duplicate.

It resolves further:

That we also express our heartfelt thanks to God and to both Houses of Congress, and to the President, for the passage of the anti-lottery law some months since, and to the House for the passage of the Hatch-Washburn bill, which we hereby petition the Senate and President to complete and so suppress gambling in foods.

The paper also embraces the following resolution:

That we petition Congress to renew its rescinded action excluding liquor-selling from the World's Fair, taken in the last session by both Houses, on the temperature ground alone, but now called for with the added reason that to allow the carry-on of the matter, and that the same liquor would violate two laws of Illinois, and on the act of Congress by which the Fair was instituted, and which requires that the State law shall be observed in the contracts and conduct of the Fair, to which violation of State and national laws we urge the President, after due investigation through the Attorney-General, to call the attention of Congress.

Then there is the following resolution:

That we petition Congress and the President to accomplish the submission of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment, forbidding State Legislatures (as only Congress is now forbidden) to unite Church and State, and especially forbidding, what is the very essence of such union, sectarian appropriations.

MR. PADDOCK.—It seems to me that the petition should go to the Committee on Education and Labor. It is a typewritten petition, and it is not unlikely that a large number of such petitions will come here.

MR. DOLPH.—This petition was adopted at a public meeting held at Milton, Oreg., and is signed by the presiding officer of the meeting.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—What reference shall be made of the petition?

MR. PADDOCK.—I think it should be referred to the Committee on Education and Labor.

MR. DOLPH.—I have no objection to that reference.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—At the request of the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Peffer] a similar petition presented by him was referred to the Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial.

MR. PADDOCK.—As the Senator from Kansas is not in the Chamber at this moment, I ask that the reference of the petition presented by him be reconsidered, and that that petition and the one just presented by the Senator from Oregon lie on the table for the present.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT.—That course will be pursued if there be no objection. The Chair hears none, and the petitions will lie on the table.

The proceedings of the House of Representatives open thus:

THE SPEAKER, at 13 o'clock M., amid general applause, called the House to order. Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. W. H. Millburn, D.D.

Under the title, "Bills, Memorials, and Resolutions," is the following—read and referred:

BY MR. DURBISCOW.—A joint resolution (H. Res. 160) to provide for the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday—to the Select Committee on the Columbian Exposition.

Twenty-four representatives presented petitions from their constituents; of these, thirteen referred to religious matters.

The remarkable blanket petition which occupied the attention of Senators Peffer, Dolph, Platt, Paddock, and the Vice-President to the extent of a column in the Congressional Record, as quoted above, is a good example of the religio-political atmosphere with which the church party of this country is striving to envelop the "great national council." As Senator Paddock tells us also, "It is not unlikely that a large number of such petitions will come here."

The devout thanks of these petitioners seem to be about equally divided, with blasphemous impartiality, between God, Congress, and the President. From their point of view, of course, this is not blasphemy, but highly proper; for they look to Congress as being the vicegerents of God on earth, to legislate and enforce the petitioners' interpretation of God's moral laws. Therefore there is to them no blasphemy and no inconsistency in this vast hutch-potch of devotional expression to their threefold divinity, the supposed tutelary deity of the American Sunday, God, Congress, and the President, and those civil measures, the Hatch-Washburn anti-option bill, the anti-lottery law, the prohibition of liquor selling at the World's Fair; and then to add a closing clause which shouts aloud with derision at their opening paragraph:

That we petition Congress and the President to accomplish the submission of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment, forbidding State Legislatures (as only Congress is now forbidden) to unite Church and State, and especially forbidding, what is the very essence of such union, sectarian appropriations.

How is it possible that senators, long-experienced in public life, and presumably fully conversant with the proprieties of civil affairs, can accept with unconscious gravity such ridiculously inconsequential inconsistencies, and fail to see either their inaptness to civil affairs or their glaring religious error?

Who will see and say, when these petitions, with which Senator Paddock tells us Congress is to be flooded, are considered in committee, that the last paragraph of this petition reminds Congress that it can not do, and prays that it restrict the States from doing, just what in the first paragraph it thanks God, Congress, and the President, has been done?
