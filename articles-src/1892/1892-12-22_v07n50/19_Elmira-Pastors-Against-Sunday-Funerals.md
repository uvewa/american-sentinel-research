TEN Elmira pastors, headed by Rev. Thomas K. Beecher, have declared against Sunday funerals. They agree upon the general principle that they are unwise and inexpedient, and except in cases of extreme necessity are to be avoided. Hereafter people in straightened circumstances in Elmira must bury their dead at night if they want their friends who are dependent on their daily earnings for a livelihood, to be present and assist them in paying the last sad tribute of respect to the departed. This anti-Sunday-funeral crusade is about as heartless a phase of the Sunday agitation as has yet been developed.
