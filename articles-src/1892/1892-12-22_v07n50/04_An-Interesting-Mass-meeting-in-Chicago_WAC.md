THE AMERICAN SABBATH UNION ROUTED

BY THE SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS,

AND THE TABLES TURNED IN

FAVOR OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY FOR ONCE.

DECEMBER 13 and 14, 1892, the American Sabbath Union, an organization formed conjointly by some of the leading religious denominations of this country for the enforcement of Sunday observance by law, held its fourth annual session in the city of Chicago. According to previous arrangements mass-meetings were held in four of the largest churches of the city Tuesday night, December 13, at each of which certain of the leading speakers and workers in the Union gave addresses, giving their reasons, if reasons they may be called, for enforcing Sunday observance by civil authority, for desiring to close the World's Colombian Exposition on Sunday by act of Congress, and inveighing against Mayor Washburn, the local Fair Directory, and all others who have dared to ask or petition Congress to repeal its Sunday-closing act of last July.

One of these meetings was held at the South Park Methodist Episcopal Church, corner South Park Ave. and Thirty-third St., and Rev. H. H. George, of Beaver Falls, Penn., who is general field secretary of the American Sabbath Union, was the leading speaker appointed for this place for the evening. A moderately sized audience, consisting of perhaps not far from one hundred persons, assembled in the spacious church to listen to what was to be said. With Rev. H. N. Axtell, of the Methodist Church, in the chair, Mr. Day, State Secretary of the Union for Indiana, opened the meeting by reading a portion of the 17th chapter of Jeremiah, and offering prayer. Rev. Mr. George spoke quite enthusiastically for a time in regard to the work of the Union, directing his remarks chiefly to the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and the petition which has recently been gotten up and quite extensively circulated for the repeal of the Sunday-closing act of Congress, and the opening of the Fair on Sunday, with the machinery stopped and religious services provided for within the gates. For Congress to repeal its action touching this matter he thought would be a long stride heathenward, and a fatal blow to an institution upon which more perhaps than any other, he said, the Republic rested.

Following Mr. George's address, Mr. Locke, a merchant of Englewood, spoke for a short time upon the aspect of the laboring men and the Sunday rest, after which a series of resolutions was introduced for consideration and adoption. The resolutions consisted of a protest against Congress in any way rescinding its act for closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and a gentle suggestion to Mayor Washburn that in going to Washington and championing the Sunday opening cause he was not attending to his business and would better be home enforcing the Sunday laws of his State and city. The resolutions were put to vote without discussion or comment, and to the evident astonishment of Mr. George and his friends the "noes" seemed to have it. A rising vote was called for, which developed the fact that by actual count a majority of ten or fifteen of those present were opposed to the adoption of the resolutions.

# WANTED TO HEAR THEIR REASONS.

The gentlemen who had presented and read the resolutions at once requested that some one of those who had voted against their adoption be called upon to state his reasons for voting thus; in response to which a call was made for "Mr. Jones." What followed soon developed the fact that Alonzo T. Jones, editor of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL, of New York, a paper uncompromisingly opposed to religious legislation, was in the audience, and that the South Park M. E. Church being in the vicinity of a considerable population of the religious denomination known as Seventh-day Adventists—a people coming to be quite well known as ardent champions of religious liberty and opposers of governmental interference in matters of religion,—quite a number of these had come out to see and hear what was going on, though, as they stated, with no preconcerted plan to "pack" the meetings. On account of the inclemency of the weather and an apparent indifference on the part of that class which it might naturally be supposed would be largely represented at a mass-meeting of this kind, the Adventists, contrary to their own expectations, as they afterwards stated, found themselves in the majority. And inasmuch as the meeting was a mass-meeting, and all present were called upon to vote, this people, expressing themselves in accordance with their conscientious convictions, necessarily voted the resolutions down, and unceremoniously and quite unexpected turned the scales of the American Sabbath Union against itself.

## THE REASONS GIVEN.

Mr. Jones being called upon, begun by explaining why he and his people had voted against the resolutions. He said that so far as the opening or closing of the Fair on Sunday was concerned they would not turn their hands over whether it was opened or closed; but that they were opposed to the resolutions presented, as the resolutions were a protest against Congress repealing an unconstitutional act. He stated that Sunday legislation was religious legislation and religious legislation wholly, citing in proof the fact that the Sunday closing measure was asked for upon the ground of the fourth commandment, as interpreted by Congress, and statements of Senator Hawley and the Senate Chaplain at the time the measure was secured. Though at first denied by several in the audience, Mr. George admitted this to be so, as his own argument had already abundantly proved.

Mr. Jones then proceeded to show that the powers of the general Government were delegated powers only; that according to the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the powers not delegated to the general Government were reserved either to the States or to the people, and consequently inasmuch as the Government had never had delegated to it the power to legislate upon religion and religious questions, Congress had no right whatever to legislate upon this subject. He further declared that the Government was positively and expressly forbidden to legislate upon such matters by the First Amendment to the Constitution which says, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;" and that therefore Sunday legislation on the part of the Government was unconstitutional, and that those who by threats of loss of votes had secured such legislation had forced Congress to override the supreme law of the land, as Article Six of the Constitution declares the United States Constitution to be; and it was consequently with ill-grace they were pleading for obedience on the part of others to minor laws.

A third point made, was to the effect that Mr. George and the National Reform Association to which he belongs know this legislation to be unconstitutional, for, for the last twenty years and more they have been laboring to secure a religious amendment to the Constitution, in order that this very kind of legislation might have an "undeniable legal basis in the fundamental law of the land;" but that having secured the legislation without first having secured the amendment, they could not possibly be ignorant of the fact that the legislation is unconstitutional. This fact Mr. Jones made very emphatic and clear, and no attempt was made by Mr. George in his reply to answer it.

In conclusion, Mr. Jones remarked that although not affecting the principle of the legislation involved, it was nevertheless a fact that Sunday was not the Sabbath of the Bible anyway; that Saturday, the seventh day, was the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and not Sunday, the first day; and that the American Sabbath Union was therefore not only overriding the supreme law of the land, but the supreme law of the universe.

This sort of argument was rather too much for Mr. George to take gracefully. When he got the floor again he said he smelled an odor similar to that which he encountered while lobbying with Congress last summer, and expressed his opinion of the Seventh-day Adventists in terms not the most complimentary, accusing them of being "anarchists," and thanked the Lord there were so few of them in comparison to the "forty millions" of people he claimed were behind him and his cause. He cited them to the Haymarket Orders, of Chicago, a few years ago, and to their fate, and although admitting the right of the Adventists to attend the meeting, seemed much incensed at its taking the turn it did, and the resolutions thus failing to carry.

## THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.

The chairman of the evening, Rev. Mr. Axtell, it must be said to his credit, kept his balance well, and allowed fair play all the way through. Several turns were taken by the speakers, both of which were ready and forcible in their utterances, and both being exceptionally tall and well-built, the scene altogether reminded one of what modern history styles the debates between Lincoln and Douglass, "the battle of the giants." It was indeed an interesting occasion, and religious liberty for once in these days of departure from truth and justice, gained a decided victory. A few others participated in the discussion, which lasted until half past ten o'clock, when Mr. George and his friends withdrew from the scene with anything but an air of triumph. They had evidently encountered not only numbers but arguments which they could not successfully meet.

The Seventh-day Adventists evidently had as much right to attend and take part in this meeting as any other people, it being advertised as a "mass-meeting;" especially is this so in view of the fact that they were invited to speak and give their reasons for their action. But the chagrin which this defeat caused and the indignation which it created in the American Sabbath Union may be understood to some degree from the following statements made by members of the Union in its meetings at the First Methodist Church, the following day. Rev. Mr. McLain styled the course of the Adventists "disorderly conduct," and when a proposition was made to send a telegram to the House Committee on the World's Fair, announcing the result of the four mass-meetings, he further remarked:

I think the facts ought to be stated that we had four meetings; but in a serreptious, and, in our judgment, a very unbecoming way, through an organized effort on the part of the enemies, they undertook to capture one of our meetings; and that very thing made public will heap contempt on any such course. I believe it ought to be made public; and I believe we ought to enter a vigorous protest against any such imposition in a line of this sort. I am very much opposed to any such course.

That a few men, calling themselves men, should come into a meeting organized properly as we had organized that meeting, and show themselves in that manner, ought to be treated with indignity and contempt, and the Government ought to know about it, that is the Committee [the House World's Fair Committee] ought to be notifie in regard to it; and it ought to be shown to the people the unfair and improper methods used by those who are opposed to this movement.

Following these remarks the secretary of the convention, Mr. Thompson, of Ohio, said:

If the committee on resolutions should bring in a resolution to censure these people I think it would be entirely proper.

Such are the illiberal sentiments and such the animus of the "Union" which is seeking to maintain what it has already secured from Congress in the way of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, and to force upon the people its ideas of religion and the Sabbath by law.

## ADVENTISTS NOT SURPRISED.

It may not be inappropriate just here to state that such treatment as is indicated by the utterances just quoted, as well as the charge of "anarchy" made by Mr. George, is no surprise to the Seventh-day Adventists. For years they have not only been looking for this very condition of things to be brought about through a controversy over the Sabbath question, but predicted that these very charges would be made against them in consequence of their loyalty to God and his commandments. The following paragraph from a work published by them as long ago as 1884, entitled, "The Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan" (Vol. IV., p. 409), is in evidence upon this point:

Those who honor the Bible Sabbath will be denounced as enemies of law and order, as breaking down the moral restraints of society, causing anarchy and corruption, and calling down the judgments of God upon the earth. Their conscientious scruples will be pronounced obstinacy, stubbornness, and contempt of authority. They will be accused of disaffection toward the government. Ministers who deny the obligation of the divine law will present from the pulpit the duty of yielding obedience to the civil authorities as ordained of God. In legislative halls and courts of justice, commandment-keepers will be censured and misrepresented. A false coloring will be given to their words; the worst possible construction will be put upon their motives.

And in the same work (pp. 444, 445) the statement is further made that,

In the last conflict the Sabbath will be the special point of controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of the Sunday; and as milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be enacted. It will be urged that the few who stand in opposition to an institution of the Church and a law of the land ought not to be tolerated, and a decree will finally be issued denouncing them as deserving of the severest punishment, and giving the people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to death. Romanism in the Old World, and apostate Protestantism in the New, will pursue a similar course toward those who honor the divine precepts.

From these statements it is evident that this people are not ignorant either of the nature of this movement to establish Sunday as the Sabbath of this Nation and enforce its observance upon the people, or of the bitter persecution that is finally to result from it. Two further paragraphs from the same work (page 410) are so much to the point we insert them here:

The dignitaries of Church and State will unite to bribe, persuade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments. Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for truth, and in order to secure public favor, legislators will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which has cost this Nation so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet's words: "And the dragon was wrath with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."

Our land is in jeopardy. The time is drawing on when its legislature shall so abjure the principles of Protestantism as to give countenance to Romish apostasy. The people for whom God has so marvelously wrought, strengthening them to throw off the galling yoke of popery, will by a national act give vigor to the corrupt faith of Rome, and thus arouse the tyranny which only wails for a touch to start again into cruelty and despotism. With rapid steps we are already approaching this period. When Protestant churches shall seek the support of the secular power, thus following the example of that apostate church, for opposing which their ancestors endured the fiercest persecution, then will there be a national apostasy which will end only in national ruin.

These predictions are in rapid process of fulfillment. The statement that "in order to secure public favor, legislators will yield to the popular demand for a law enforcing Sunday observance," has already been fulfilled. Every one who is acquainted with the facts knows that this is exactly the ground upon which the Sunday closing of the World's Fair measure was secured from Congress last summer. Threats of loss of votes upon the part of the churches, and the acknowledged fear on the part of the legislators that to refuse to comply with the demand of the churches would not be "wise statesmanship" and would endanger the likelihood of their "coming back here again" were precisely the elements which conspired to accomplish the unconstitutional result.

Thus, clearly have the course and results of this movement been marked out in the literature of this people. In conclusion, we wish to ask the reader, in view of all the facts in the case, and of your own eternal interests, upon which side of this controversy do you think it wise for you to stand?
