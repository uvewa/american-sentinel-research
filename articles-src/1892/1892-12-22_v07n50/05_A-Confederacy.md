# A Confederacy.

A DISCOURSE delivered on Columbus Day in Hillsdale, Mich., Rev. A. F. Chase said during the course of his remarks, in reference to the unity of the American church, and, that it was to be accomplished by the combined efforts of their churches, the Episcopalians the Lutherans of the sects, the Presbyterians, the Congregationalists, the Baptists, Methodists, etc., taking the basis of Christ, and identifying their banners, "Unity."

If these churches were melted together by the Spirit of Christ, and forming one body, united in sentiment and encouraging and thankful for the Christ. But when that "unity" is simply a unity of creeds and decrees by the aid of the law, and a confederacy by wielding the aid of the law and decrees by assisting the aid of the statute, it then becomes a dangerous institution but to every American citizen, a thing that confronts as at the present time. All history shows that upon ecclesiastical combinations the realm of the State, and securing and enforcing ecclesiastical laws, has resulted in gross evil and that the controlling spirit of the various organizations is tending in the direction of encroaching upon the State, and it will require the closest and most careful watching the present trend of events.

The "Reign of Terror" of the 2 Thessalonians of that of November, (2.) Statements that of November, it was only the culmination of what Christendom had been for centuries responsible for. The French Revolution which was terrible; which was its disastrous effects; but what caused the infidelity? Was it the persecution? It was nothing but the Church and State, and of the abuses which grew out of the infidelity lifted its head in the presence of the truth, the situation is the power of God for the salvation of man; but it flourishes in the absence of a State religion organization, and a members of a State religion organization which is always a denial of the sufficiency of the gospel of Christ. In nothing is the utter perversity of human nature more fully demonstrated than in its attempts to advance Christianity by law and by the substitution of human inventions, forms, and rites, for the truth of Christ. There is danger in any union which looks to the mere form of union, no matter by what name it may be called.

When Oliver Cromwell sought to disband the Parliament, that he might to elect a new one more favorable to his schemes of theocratic government, he did it through the officers of the army. The contest was divided. Cromwell and Harrison rose, and after dissolving the Parliament, Cromwell only sought to make it easy for the first named, and he said: "Major Strauss attend to Cromwell's ambitions, briskly repeated to the major the order, who was quickly, for if he delays it till after Christ would not succeed." "Major Strauss acted his place occupied." "Hume."

Cromwell, having by the assistance of his army to support him, dissolved this Parliament, and then another was assembled composed of "the saints." The leader was called by God Barebones,' named after him, the Parliament was noted for its ignorance, naturally meddled and sincere hypocrisy that is sometimes shown. All their attempts unequal. All their literary were charged and sanctified by prayer and fasting and however, the prayers that were offered, them all, failed to guide the Parliament into Cromwell in his own strength into the proper way. As well might it be imagined that a destruction of the army under Harrison entered, and asked whom they wanted him. Harrison entered, and asked whom they are seeking the Lord." Then, said the other, they might have remained; for to my certain knowledge, he has not been here these twelve years.

This all is but a faint picture of what will be again when the National Reformers seek to usher in the reign of Jesus and his saints. It would be far more feasible for them to leave that heretically took to Jesus himself, who will certainly accomplish it himself.

The third reason given by Mr. Foster for demanding is this, "The Bible is not recognized as the foundation of all law." Suppose we recognize the Bible and law, and make that recognition practical. It would do away with all evil legislatures, and place the clergy of the country in their place to interpret the divine law in harmony with their varied needs. The ordinary officers would then be not the civil officers at all, but priests, and it would not be long until it be before ecclesiastical courts directed. These are nothing but extraordinary courts. There are nothing but extraordinary influence now for their denominational school, and political purposes.

General Morgan declared his purpose to establish the Public School system. He was clearly right, but by this declaration he provoked the resentful hostility of the Roman Catholic, and it was a foregone conclusion that its political influence was only a question of time. It is true that in making the position that he did, General Morgan may have been influenced more by his opposition to Romanism, than by fealty to the principle of a separate government without church, and of a policy of Church and State; but he has succeeded in drawing attention to the system which he endeavored to tamper with—to the Roman Catholic Church, and to so-called Protestant churches of the country are very largely responsible. That they unitedly denounced the evil in the beginning instead of becoming parties to it, by themselves accepting Government favor for the support of their denominational institutions, the pernicious system could not have survived. But now it is almost certain that it will not only live but that it will ultimately grow.

over, it has been tried again and again, and it has tried with the same glaring anticipation of a glittering success. All those religions that lives and feelings were applied, to be consulted for the people of "the so-called" "sovereign" in their own rights, and the emperor's and the Church were all denounced publicly and everywhere, in the papers, and in all civic public places, in the papers theatres, and the emperor's statures in the public squares were broken down in the face of the conflict that ensued from this Christian (!) discussion, —discussed till, says the historian, "if you conquer the power of Israel to be a laden one are told, 'The Son is subordinate to the Father.'" And if the bark is ready for you and you are told, 'The Son arose and nothing.'" "Hume."

The Dark Age of ignorance and spiritual death, of ushering in the peaceful reign of Jesus and his saints in its various manifestations, upon this country as it had overrun the pope. Instead of introducing an era of enlightenment, peace, prosperity, and enlightenment, it introduced the Dark Age of ignorance and spiritual death. These theocratic schemes of those self styled reformers, have in them that which would subvert every department of the Government,—legislators, judicial, and executive, and put all the power in the hands of the clergy. It is no too serious in every thoughtful mind, that these gentlemen are seeking for worldly power to accomplish what has cost this Nation so great a sacrifice, yet denying the sufficiency of the power of God. We are watching the present trend of events.
