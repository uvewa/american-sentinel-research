THE Supreme Court of Georgia has rendered a decision exempting telegraph companies from penalties for failure to deliver messages on Sunday. The court holds that under the code of the State it is unlawful for any person, including a telegraph company, to pursue his business or the work of his ordinary calling upon Sunday, works of necessity or charity only excepted. A well-known commercial organ says the decision might produce interesting results if it should be followed by the courts of other States having similar Sunday laws.
