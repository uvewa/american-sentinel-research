We still have on hand a limited number of copies of THE SENTINEL of December 15, containing the Arena article, "Religious Intolerance in the Republic: Christians (?) Persecuting Christians in Tennessee." These papers will be furnished at $1 per hundred. Not a single copy of this number should remain unused. The Arena article alone is worth several times the price of the paper, which contains other good matter besides.
