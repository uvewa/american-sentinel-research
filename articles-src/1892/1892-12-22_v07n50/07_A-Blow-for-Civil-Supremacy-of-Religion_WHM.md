# A Blow for Civil Supremacy of Religion.

TAKE one ruler or day; just one supremacy seems to be more or less connected from some quarters, not to mention the fact that the Sunday closing of the World's Fair is making some decided efforts to achieve it.

1. To-day, Others, there is a bitter and hard battle had between Protestant and Roman Catholic; the former saying the latter should. Protestant apologistic to the Hebrew is also objectionable; this is very true, as appears from this paragraph in the published report of the trial of one of the members of the committee, of the Board of Education, who are seemingly asking the dismissal of teachers and professors of the Hebrew faith merely because of their religious groups reads:

> Another minister East Tabole teacher said that both said Kohles a Hebrew member said that both and Kohles a Hebrew member another matter. Not has it been thought that "you wouldn't do more for a Jew than for a Christian."

Further of things developed and to which the last seems to be an attempt at disruption that was carried from there to many and middle. The last seems to be an attempt at disruption. There was recently a call by the Labor Unions on the subject of the employment of compelled persons to be working on Sunday. The Chicago *Times*, of a recent date, gives an account of the effort:

> Further let us now examine what the labor leaders has to regard in the opening or closing of the Fair on Sunday. It is well that public opinion be an expression since, later, in his color or his religious opinions.

The special deposit from which each of the petitions set forth, particularly, that the further request for Sunday closing of the World's Fair is a moral, religious, and civil obligation.

The devout thanks of those petitions seems to be about equally divided, with half going to the National Reform party, God, Congress, and the President. From their sentiments as expressed, they are not seeking piety, not history, but highly proper; for they look upon the reopening as going back upon our national interpretation of God's word pertaining to the observance of the Sabbath, and an inconsistency in this vast and important matter.

Thus they would directly thrust their theology directly into the American Government; and having thus directed it, God, Congress, and the President, and their anti-option bill, the anti-lottery law, petition Congress not to open the World's Fair; and then to add a closing petition addressed to Congress, and the President to veto the bill.

Thus we petition Congress and the President to act on behalf of the Sabbath and the proposed Sixteenth Amendment, forbidding State Legislatures ever to make or enforce any law respecting the establishment of religion.

How is it possible that senators, long familiar with the discussion, can be really so fully convinced with the propositions of gravity such ridiculously inconsequential conclusions as these, and we no either that injustices to civil affairs or their glaring inconsistencies?

Who will see and say, when these petitions, with their bold assumptions bring the Government to the ground, but paragraph by paragraph has been pointed out as yet to do, and prays that it restarted the language of the petition, and putting it in reformed it thanks God, Congress, and the President.

and control the policing of the city. In this city Rev. Dr. Parkhurst has thrown down the gauntlet, without reservation, and was between himself and his society, and Police Superintendent Byrnes in the city.

The war is certainly no sham, in a vast political significance. Can it be that a man so supremacy over Congress, the World's Fair and the churches of Chicago, and other sects, and for control of the policing and political government of cities.

This is a new revolution. The astute policy of religion is making it a snug full of itself a revolution.
