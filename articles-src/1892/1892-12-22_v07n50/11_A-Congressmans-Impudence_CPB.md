Congressman Morse of Massachusetts has written an open letter to Bishop Potter which is a regular curiosity in its way, coming as it does from a member of Congress to one of the most prominent ecclesiastics in the country. The Congressman writes to the Bishop, as follows:—

To the Rt. Rev. Bishop Potter.

Reverend Sir. All the members of Congress are in receipt of a very adroitly written letter signed by the President of the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, giving reasons for and asking for the repeal of the proviso accompanying the appropriation of two and one-half millions by Congress, providing for the closing of the Exposition on the Lord's day. This letter is remarkable for what it does not say.

First, it does not say that the petitions asking for the repeal were circulated largely by the liquor dealers of Chicago, anticipating a harvest from the thousands of additional patrons who would be brought to the city from the surrounding towns and cities on the Lord's day.

Secondly, it is entirely silent in regard to hundreds of excursion trains that would be run in Chicago on the Lord's day, bring a motley crowd of Sabbath breakers, requiring the labor of thousands of additional employees on the railroads, who have petitioned against the Sunday opening.

This petition is entirely silent in regard to the fact that the unanimous voice of the churches and Christian people of Chicago (at least of the Protestant churches) is opposed to Sunday opening.

It is silent also in relation to the fact that thousands, if not millions, of our countrymen, and these certainly the best of our citizens, petitioned Congress for the Sunday closing proviso.

I write this letter to say that the communication to which I have referred addressed to members of Congress, by inference at least, represents you as in favor of such Sunday opening, and uses your name as an endorser. Will you kindly advise me whether such use of your name is authorized by you?

The awful scourge known as the Asiatic cholera is at our door. God only knows what the next twelve months may develop, or who will be its victims. In this presence can we afford to offend the Almighty by a national sanction of the desecration of the Lord's day, that we were commanded to observe amid thunderings and lightnings from Sinai? The circular is very adroit. It proposes to throw a sop to the Almighty for the desecration of his day by Sunday trains and requiring thousands of employees to work, by giving an opportunity on alternate Sundays for different kinds of religious service in some part of the ground. It proposes to compensate the thousands of employees who would be required to work on that day by giving them some other day in the week.

I can not but believe that this circular does you an injustice. Whether it does or no, I trust the good people of this country will continue to petition and pray the Almighty to save us from being numbered among and sharing the fate of the States and nations that disobey and forged God, and a national sanction of the desecration of the Lord's day will be a long step in that direction.

Very respectfully,

Elijan A. Morse.

Canton, Mass., Dec. 9.

This letter emphasizes the action of Congress in deciding that Sunday is the Sabbath, and that it must be kept by closing the Fair upon that day. Not only has Congress assumed to decide this question, but a member of that body takes it upon himself to practically read out of the Christian Church a prominent minister who thinks that the Fair might be consistently kept open on Sunday. Thus again is fealty to Sunday not only made the test of Christianity but adherence to certain forms of Sunday observance is declared to be necessary to entitle one to recognition as a Christian. And not only so but the thunderbolts of God's wrath are invoked against those who do not honor Sunday according to Mr. Morse's ideas of propriety.

Sunday is absolutely without any standing in the Bible. That book knows it only as an ordinary working day, but lo! under the leadership of the so-called American Sabbath Union, the popular churches of the country have made its observance, and that in a particular way, the great and all-important element of Christianity, THE test of Christian fellowship! And Congress has become their allies in this matter, and a member of Congress takes it upon himself to instruct in this regard a prominent Bishop of a prominent branch of the Church!

### IMPUDENCE REBUKED.

Since the foregoing was put in type, Bishop Potter has sent the following reply to Mr. Morse:—

Hon. Elijah A. Morse.

My Dear Sir. The use of my name in the circular to which your letter of December 9 refers, was not authorized by me, and if you had been governed by the courtesies which obtain among gentlemen, you would have given me an opportunity to say so before attacking me in the public prints. As it is, the course you have seen fit to take puts it out of my power to reply to your letter, further than to say that if you make public use of this note, I must request that you draw without mutilation or abbreviation.

Very truly yours,

H. C. Potter.

New York, Dec. 13, 1892.

The caution that the note be not abbreviated or mutilated is not out of place. The ultra Sunday-closer will bear watching.
