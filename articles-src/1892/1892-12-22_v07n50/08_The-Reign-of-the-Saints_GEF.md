IN reading a recent number of the Christian (?) Statesman (that of November 26), I find enough anti-Christian theology, and enough anti-American politics, if practically carried out in our land, to utterly ruin both Church and State, subverting our Federal Constitution, and building up over the grave of American liberty, a perfect image of the old time papal despotism.

In an article entitled, "Why Covenanters are Political Dissenters," Mr. J. M. Foster gives as the first reason, "God is not recognized as the sovereign." "The Declaration of Independence assumes that rulers derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." So this that has come to us through the experiences of millions is only an assumption. In the place of this sublimn truth which universal history declares to lie at the very foundation of all civil liberty, Mr. Foster would revive the old theory of the divine right of kings and rulers; for he immediately adds, "Rulers are God's ministers. They represent God. Their authority comes from him."

Of course if rulers represent God, and not the people, and their authority comes from him, and not from the people, then they are responsible only to God and not to the people for the exercise of that authority. Every student of history knows that this always has been and still is the underlying principle of every oppressive despotism. From the ancient tyrants of Assyria and Rome to the modern autocrat of Russia, every despotic ruler has thus sought to give to his iniquitous decrees the authority and sanction of Deity. Nor does Mr. Foster evade the force of this by saying, "God's method of communicating this authority is through the people. The whole truth is: 'Whom God and the people choose.'"

The voice of the people is here made the voice of God, and that too in things pertaining to God and his worship. This is a revival of a pagan proverb. The truth of the Bible is that the people persecuted Noah, the people crucified Jesus. The people have in every age put to death God's prophets and apostles, leaving posterity only to build their sepulchres and do them honor. Neither the people nor their rulers are supreme in matters pertaining to the moral government of God, but God himself; and his will is not revealed to any chosen rulers simply, but to each individual soul, by his Spirit, and through his word.

The second reason given why Covenanters are political dissenters is "that Christ is not recognized as the King of kings," and the failure to recognize him as such in our Federal Constitution is "treason against the Constitution of Christ." Just what the "Constitution of Christ" is, the gentleman fails to inform us. The nearest approach to a Constitution for a civil State in all His recorded words, is where he teaches the total separation of Church and State by saying: "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's;" and in that other place where he plainly and solemnly declares, "My kingdom is not of this world." Both of these declarations the Covenanters seem to have forgotten; and so they present themselves to the world as the spiritual descendants of the unbelieving multitude who sought to take Christ by force and make him king.

Jesus came from the highest heaven, stooping in infinite love to lift up humanity, till even in this poor world, he was a wanderer without where to lay his head.

The human representatives of Christ, have exalted themselves above all humanity, both people and kings, till climbing up into the very seat of God, they claimed the power and the right, by their own poor human authority, to change the divine law. Jesus was the Christ. The popes have by this very exaltation proved themselves anti-Christ. Yet they were the logical result of that theory of government which the Statesman is seeking to revive. Revive that theory, and in the place of our civil rulers, we should soon again have these theocratic despots.

From another article in the same paper I clip the following. The article is entitled "Christian politics":—

Now let a single presidential canvass be conducted with the American people, on a platform which frankly acknowledges the Lord Jesus Christ as sovereign in political affairs, for servants tried and true of Christ for these chief places; let every issue be in the platform that Christ in his providence demands by placing it in national life; let them all be argued before the people by the press and speakers bringing them to the infallible test of the law of Christ; appealing to reason, conscience, love to God, love to man, love of country, love of righteousness, hate of evil, etc., etc., and would it not be one of the most tremendous instrumentalities to educate the whole people in the knowledge, love and obedience of Christ?"

This looks at first thought very plausible, as error often does, but it wholly disregards Christ's declaration that his kingdom is not of this world. Moreover, it has been tried again and again, tried with the same glowing anticipations of a glorious result. All these religious motives and feelings were appealed to, to secure the election of the so-called "servants of Christ true and tried." These things were all discussed publicly and everywhere,—discussed till the discussion was parodied in the pagan theatres, and the emperor's statues in the public squares were broken down in the heat of the conflict that ensued from this Christian (?) discussion,—discussed till, says the historian, "if you enquire the price of bread in a bake shop you are told, 'The Son is subordinate to the Father.' Ask if the bath is ready, and you are told, 'The Son arose out of nothing.'"—Stamley.

What was the result of all this? Instead of ushering in the peaceful reign of Jesus and his saints, it ushered in the reign of the popes. Instead of introducing an era of quickened consciences, and universal enlightenment, it introduced the Dark Ages of ignorance and spiritual death. It would do the same again. These theocratic enthusiasts do not expect Jesus to come and reign in person. They assume to themselves the title of "his saints," and their narrow creed, they dignify with the sounding title of Jesus' law. Give them their way, and it would be they, and not Jesus, who would reign. The difference is immense.

When Cromwell sought to disband the Parliament, that he might elect a new one more favorable to his schemes of theocratic usurpation, he called a council of the officers of the army. The council was divided. General Harrison assured them that by dissolving the Parliament, Cromwell only sought to make way for the reign of "Jesus and the saints." "Major Streater alluding to Cromwell's ambitions, briskly replied: 'Jesus ought then to come very quickly, for if he delays it till after Christmas he will come too late, and will find his place occupied.'"—Hume.

Shortly after, Cromwell in person with his army to support him, dissolved this Parliament, and then another was elected composed of "the saints." The leader was called "Praise God Barebones," and from him, the Parliament was called "Barebones Parliament." Says the historian: "Though the English nation be naturally candid and sincere hypocrisy prevailed then among them beyond any example in ancient or modern times."—Hume. All their iniquity was checked and sanctified by prayer and fasting. Soon, however, the spirit that was guiding them all, failed to guide the Parliament and Cromwell in the same direction; so Cromwell sent a detachment of the army under Gen. Harrison to dissolve that Parliament. Coming to the House of Parliament, Harrison entered, and asked them what they were doing there. They replied, "We are seeking the Lord." Then, said the General, "You may go elsewhere, for to my certain knowledge, he has not been here these many years."

This all is but a faint picture of what will be again when the National Reformers seek to usher in the reign of Jesus and his saints. It would be far more modest for them to leave that herculean task to Jesus himself, who will certainly accomplish it in due time.

The third reason given by Mr. Foster for dissenting, is this, "The Bible is not recognized as the foundation of all law." Suppose we recognize the Bible as such, and make that recognition practical. It would do away with all evil legislatures, and place the clergy of the country in their place to interpret the divine law in harmony with their varied creeds. The executive officers would then be but the official enforcers of the clerical will. How long would it be before ecclesiastical courts and synods, would, as in olden time, try cases for heresy, and then turn them over to the civil (?) power for punishment. The theocratic schemes of these self-styled reformers, have in them that which would subvert every department of the Government, legislative, judicial, and executive, and put all the power in the hands of the clergy. It is but too evident to every thoughtful mind, that these gentlemen are seeking for worldly power to accomplish their ends; and in so doing they are denying the sufficiency of the power of God.
