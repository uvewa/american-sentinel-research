THE Circuit Rider has this paragraph from a correspondent:—

"HONOR THE SABBATH DAY AND KEEP IT HOLY."

The 53d Congress has left a record in virtually closing the gates of the World's Fair on Sunday, and, in spite of the quibbling of some secular newspapers, will stand by its record, backed by the Christian people of this Nation. If a large mass of the people will patronize the saloons of Chicago on Sunday, instead of the churches, that will not be the fault of the Christian people. It will be a great deal better to offset this by making the churches attractive and all welcome to the sanctuary, than by opening the gates of the Fair on Sunday and thus "doing evil" under the false supposition "that good may come." Senator A. H. Colquitt, of Georgia, who championed this cause is a member of our church and we are proalter of him than ever.
C. D. H.

The writer of the foregoing understands the matter; the closing of the Fair by act of Congress was secured by the churches, for the benefit of the churches, and the churches will reward those who cater to them in political things. The time has come when it is quite an object for candidates for office to belong to "our church," or at least to be in favor with the churches, and as a result politicians are almost tumbling over one another in their mad haste to secure front seats in the National Reform car.
