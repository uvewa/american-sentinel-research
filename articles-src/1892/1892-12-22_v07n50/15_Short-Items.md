# Short Items.

A JEW merchant in Findlay, Ohio, has recently been informed by the city authorities that he must keep his store closed on Sundays.

In some town one of the ministers, a sermon delivered a few weeks since, said that the Church was now on a pedestal that had not been attained, and that in order for men to be placed in positions of trust they should be church members. The Church is not slow to claim the advantage that they gained over private citizens in the recent requirements in our national Legislature. But, oh! when the Church will be when all the supernumerary political forces die; it is the purpose of getting the suffrage that they are now boldly told they've got; but have been the last to be seen.
