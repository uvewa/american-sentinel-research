"The Constitution of the United States declares the people to be sovereign; Pope Leo XIII. claims to be sovereign. The Constitution guarantees freedom and justice; the Pope attacks and tries to break down all guarantees of freedom. The Constitution forbids Congress to establish any religion; papacy demands that it alone be established by law. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press; papacy denounces both as a pest and a pestilence. The Constitution guarantees a fair trial by jury; papacy urges and employs the secret tribunals of the Inquisition. The Constitution forbids cruel and excessive penalties; papacy demands torture and death for heretics and claims the right to inflict it. Is this the kind of patriots the Roman parochial school makes?"

The foregoing clipped from the Chicago Evening Post, of November 28, is an extract from a paper on "Roman Catholicism and the public schools" read by Rev. J. J. Tobias, pastor of Lincoln St. Methodist Episcopal Church of that city, before the Methodist minister's meeting.

Apparently it is a very honest and able protest against the encroachments of a power dominated by ideas foreign to the spirit of our American institutions, but the record of the "Protestant" denomination represented by the reverend gentleman destroys much of its force. Hear him as he declares that "the Constitution forbids Congress to establish any religion; papacy demands that it alone be established."

When has the Roman Catholic Church demanded more in the matter of religious legislation than the Methodist Episcopal Church? Has not the Methodist Church until its last General Conference received for its religious work, money appropriated by Congress. Has she not worked for the appointment of Methodist army chaplains? Has she not in company with other professedly Protestant bodies demanded the passage of Sunday laws? Has not Methodism again and again made herself felt in the matter of elections and appointments to office?

While Rome has made herself exceedingly obnoxious to every patriotic son of America, who dwells under the protection of the stars and stripes, she has not meddled in politics to the extent that Methodism and her so-called Protestant sisters have. Alas, what a pitiable spectacle! The Methodist Church, once the pride of every devout Christian, now playing the cats-paw for Rome; spending her time and energies to compel Congress to pass a law that will fix on free America the badge of the Papacy, the special mark of Roman Catholic authority—the heathen holiday, Sunday.

The Roman Catholic Church is not making much of a stir in regard to this matter, but why should she when her former bitter enemies, her own daughters, are doing the work for her?

"The Constitution guarantees freedom and justice; the Pope attacks and tries to break down all guarantees of freedom." While no right thinking man will deny that Rome in all ages has been the enemy of freedom of thought and speech, the foe of progress, the persecutor of those whom she is pleased to term "heretics," yet will the Rev. Mr. Tobias claim that Methodism has entirely cleared herself of this characteristic of her mother?

Has Methodism never censured or opposed those in her communion who presumed to think or speak contrary to her standards? For an instance of the spirit of the Roman Catholic Church in the Methodist body, consider the case of Rev. W. E. White, of Washington, D. C. Some time ago, the gentleman attended some meetings held under the auspices of another denomination, and after a time accepted at least part of their views as being more scriptural than the doctrines he had held up to that time. Not long afterwards, in the midst of a meeting in his own church, he was notified that he was not needed, and was dismissed without a ghost of an investigation or trial; without being given an opportunity of defending himself or the position he had taken on the basis of Scriptura, which Methodists claim to be the "only and sufficient" rule of practice.

This is not an attack upon the Methodist Church, but must be considered as an examination of Rev. Mr. Tobias' arguments in the light of facts. What is here said of that body of people is more or less true of all "Protestant" denominations. They are all playing into the hands of Rome.

The Constitution does guarantee freedom; look at the freedom "enjoyed" by the Sabbath-keepers of Tennessee! If Mr. Tobias will direct his attention to the movements at Rock Hall, Kent County, Md., he will see an example of the kind of freedom enjoyed by people who presume to believe differently from the standards of Methodism. I refer to the arrest of Mr. Judefind, a Sabbath-keeper, upon complaint of the Methodist preacher in that neighborhood. Is it possible that Mr. Tobias' ministerial brethren believe that a man has a right to freedom of thought only so long as he chooses to believe according to the iron-bound creed of their particular sect? Why, that is precisely what the Roman Catholic Church teaches; and Mr. Tobias has roundly denounced that apostate body.

The Constitution does forbid Congress making "any laws respecting the establishment of any religion." Mark you, it does not say "any particular denomination" but "any religion;" and yet many of these apparently rabid opponents of Rome are laboring with might and main, with pen and voice, with vote and pocketbook, aye, with threats of boycott, to fasten upon free America, the particular insignia of Rome.

"Consistency, thou art a jewel."
