# The Secret Is Out.

IT has been suspected that the present Congress would go to the extreme of amending the Constitution so as to recognize Christianity, but that, it seems, is not necessary now. The Supreme Court of the United States has already virtually done this by its decision declaring the country a "Christian Nation." And nothing more in their decision than devotion to the pure principles of Christianity, and late developments cover for nothing but political religion.

At the constitutional convention of North Dakota, held in the year 1889, Mr. Thompson, of the American Sabbath Union, who appeared for that body, said: "We, as Americans we deny the old doctrine that the people in the olden times, that the people have a divine right to rule; assuming that the people themselves, and not God, is the source of all authority to the people, that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. We recognize that suns exist, and is therefore the better element in the State. To follow this in order to have a good government the Church should be this ruling power." We are not surprised at this statement. We know that those men who are members of Christian political organizations seek political power for all places of trust in the legislative, the executive, and the Judiciary, as well as in the army and navy, and the police.

At a meeting of the National Reform Association, recently held in the city of Philadelphia, the same gentleman read the following language:

> The Supreme Court of the United States has settled that this is a Christian Nation, and this is the first time that the Government itself has distinctly recognized it. The Constitution does not recognize Christianity, but the Supreme Court has said that Christianity and its institutions are interwoven with all our institutions. It is a matter of political life; in social life, they can see as well as you or I, that any man who is compelled to live a double life; in social life, they can see distinctly. Both paths are those of schemers, and wise patrons, and the Church is no longer regarded as such.

It was evident that the speaker held that in all its details the Government should fail to give preference to those so-called Christian men, for he proceeded to say:

"Here then, in some sense the Constitution recognizes it that he gave decree, and should in accordance be recognized as such, in the fact that the Government should exist based on the religious part of the Constitution."

So, by the Constitution should preferably give to all Christian men of all desirable places in Church and State, Christian statesmen will be delivered from the temptations to become men of deceit, to seek advancement, and from degenerating into political demagogues, by coming up in competition with the other fellow.

The people are the schooling theory, seem to forget that when the Constitution shall be so changed as to give preference to Christian men, that then not only believers will be every tempted to speak, and instead of the Church being recognized, they will be unrecognized, and all the rest of the wire-pullers, and the schemers of Government.

This certainly is a novel plan for reforming the Church, but it has not proved a success except in Roman Catholic countries; nor, it has, however, not been made use of in this country since the days of Puritanism, and since our fathers put that clause in the Constitution forbidding that any religious test should ever be required on account of their religious belief. In all this we see the outworking of the plan of the Church and the State, and will produce the same results in this country if the experiment is tried.

A Christianity that does not have power to keep men pure when it is not established, would not be worth establishing, although it were right to do so; unlike politics, not the Constitution, but with the people.

Is it not fair to infer that these so-called Christian statesmen, following the example and spirit of the times, have allowed sufficient influence so far to get the better of them that they are not willing to remain so on an equal footing with other men, but are seeking a monopoly for themselves, as legislators preferring over all other citizens to the exclusion from all these authorities, for no other class of men in this country have ever yet gone so far as to demand the right to rule to the exclusion of others.

This demand is not born of the spirit of him who said, "My kingdom is not of this world."

When the legislative department of every country shall have enacted righteous laws that have been based upon all this language, everyone to be satisfied to be said that these are righteous administered, and the judiciary reader just and equal judgment,—certainly not till then, if then, may we justly set up the claim of being a Christian Nation; but this can not be as long by merely passing an act, recognizing or calling itself Christian, from a class of men professing themselves for political profit to be Christian.
