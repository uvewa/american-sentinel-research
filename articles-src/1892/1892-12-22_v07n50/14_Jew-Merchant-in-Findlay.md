A JEW merchant in Findlay, Ohio, has recently been informed by the city authorities that he must keep his store closed on Sunday.

In the same town one of the ministers, in a sermon delivered a few weeks since, stated that the Church was now in a position where it could say to the world, that in order for men to be placed in positions of public trust they must be Christians. The Church is not slow to claim the advantage that they gained over politicians in the recent encounters in our national Legislature. But, oh! what a Church it will be when all the unprincipled politicians flock into it for the purpose of getting the suffrages that they are now boldly told they can not have unless they are Christians. For years THE SENTINEL has been telling the people what would be the outcome of this Church and State union; and now all can see how clearly it is being fulfilled.
