It has been suspected that those people who so ardently advocate the revision of our Constitution so as to recognize Christianity as a part of the common law of the land, had something more in their mind than devotion to the pure principles of Christianity, and late developments go very far to confirm the conviction.

At the constitutional convention of North Dakota, held in the year 1889, Rev. Mr. Wylie, one of the secretaries of the American Sabbath Union, who appeared before that body, said, substantially: "As Americans we deny the old doctrine that kings rule by divine right, but we believe in the other doctrines, that the people have a divine right to rule; and since God is the source of all authority to the people, and since the Church of God, only recognizes that source, and is therefore the better element in the State, it follows that in order to have good government the Church should be the ruling power." We are to infer that the reverend gentleman believes that those men who are members of Christian churches should have the preference for all places of trust in the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary, as well as in the army and navy, and the police departments of the Government.

At a meeting of the National Reform Association, recently held in the city of Philadelphia, the same gentleman used the following language:—

The Supreme Court of the United States has decided that this is a Christian Nation, and that is true of the people, but not of the Government. The Constitution does not recognize Christianity, and therefore is not Christian; and the consequence is that Christian men who enter politics are compelled to live a double life; in social life they conform to the customs and usages of the Church, but in their political life they must of necessity become schemers, and wire pullers, and the Church is filled up with this class of men.

It was evident that the speaker held that all this was the result of the fact that the Constitution of our country failed to give preference to these so-called Christian men, for he proceeded to say:—

However much we esteem the Constitution, we recognize that it has grave defects, and should be amended so as to be in harmony with the fact that this is a Christian Nation.

That is to say, the Constitution should be so amended as to give preference to Christian men for all desirable places in government, and by this means those Christian statesmen will be delivered from the temptation to become wire-pullers and schemers, and from degenerating into political demagogues, by coming into competition with the other fellows.

The people who are advocating this theory, seem to forget that when the Constitution shall be so changed as to give preference to Christian men, that then the other fellows will be sorely tempted to become "Christian" in order to share the spoils, and instead of the Church being reformed it will have within its embrace all the rest of the wire-pullers, and the conflict will still go on.

This certainty is a novel plan for reforming the Church, but it is not entirely new, it has, however, not been made use of in this country since the days of Puritanism, and since our fathers put that clause into the Constitution forbidding that any preference should be given to men on account of their religious belief. In all other countries it has been the curse, both of the Church and the State, and will produce the same results in this country if the experiment is tried.

A Christianity that does not have power to keep men pure when it is not legalized, would not be worth legalizing, even though it were right to so unite politics and religion.

The real difficulty is not with Christianity, nor the Constitution, but with the men.

Is it not fair to infer that these so-called Christian statesmen, following the example and spirit of the times, have allowed their selfishness to so far get the better of them that they are not willing to remain on an equal footing with other men, but are seeking a monopoly for themselves, a legalized preference over all other men, thus revealing their supreme selfishness, for no other class of men in this country has ever had the effrontery to demand the right to rule to the exclusion of all others.

This demand is not born of the spirit of him who said, "My kingdom is not of this world."

When the legislative department of this country shall have enacted righteous laws that bear equally upon all the people, the executive be faithful to see that the laws are righteously administered, and the judiciary render just and equal judgment,—certainly not till then, if then, can we justly set up the claim of being a Christian Nation; but this can not be attained by merely creating an aristocracy calling itself Christian, from a class of men professing themselves for political profit to be Christian.
