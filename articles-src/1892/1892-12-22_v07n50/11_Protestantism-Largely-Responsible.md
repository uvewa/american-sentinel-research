# Protestantism Largely Responsible.

THE result of the recent election has made the downfall of Commissioner Morgan certain. For other reasons, perhaps, this is not to be regretted although General Morgan's administration of the Indian Bureau has been better than that of his predecessor. When he first came before the Government committed to the support of a so-called or of Indian contract schools. There are nothing but extraordinary influence now for their denominational school.

General Morgan declared his purpose to establish the Public School system. He was clearly right, but by this declaration he provoked the resentful hostility of the Roman Catholic, and it was a foregone conclusion that its political influence was only a question of time. It is true that in making the position that he did, General Morgan may have been influenced more by his opposition to Romanism, than by fealty to the principle of a separate government of Church and State; but he has succeeded in drawing attention to the system which he endeavored to tamper with—to the Roman Catholic Church, and to so-called Protestant churches of the country are very largely responsible. That they unitedly denounced the evil in the beginning instead of becoming parties to it, by themselves accepting Government favor for the support of their denominational institutions, the pernicious system could not have survived. But now it is almost certain that it will not only live but that it will ultimately grow.
