A LADY of the National Reform school of Christianity(?), writes to us from Pennville, Ind., as follows:—

You are making a great mistake in sending your wicked paper to me. I don't want one of them seen in my house. If you and your un-American friends don't want to abide by the law of this country, we will be just as well off without you. You are at liberty to go to some heathen land where you belong. But if you want to stay here, I beg of you in God's name not to try to make the people any worse than they already are. God's holy day is desecrated to such a degree already that we hardly know when our blessed holy day comes.

If you have any other day that you want to keep, that is all right, but the law of this country ought to compel every person on American soil to keep the American Sunday.

This has the true National Reform ring, and sounds amazingly like the following bit of Christian(?) sentiment uttered by Rev. E. B. Graham some years ago:—

If the opponents of the Bible [that is, the National Reform view of the Bible] do not like our Government and its Christian features, let them go to some wild, desolate land; and in the name of the devil, and for the sake of the devil, subdue it, and set up a Government of their own, and if they can stand it, stay there till they die.

The mistake of both Mr. Graham and of our correspondent is in supposing that National Reform is Christianity, or that it is even Christian. We are not opposed to Christianity, but simply to having something forced upon people as Christianity which is only a base counterfeit. It is impossible to enforce true Christianity.

According to our correspondent's own words there has been a total failure to preserve the Sunday Sabbath by the civil law; they have for years had Sunday laws but now can scarcely tell when the day comes. Why not cease to appeal to force and appeal to the power of God and to his word, trusting his Spirit to impress it upon hearts? There can be but one reason; the word of God says nothing about the particular day which they are determined shall be observed, and which they are determined to enforce, even if they have to banish all who oppose them.

We are told that infidelity was responsible for the French Revolution which a century ago deluged France with blood; but what caused the infidelity? Was it not largely the result of a corrupt union of Church and State, and of the abuses which grew out of it? Infidelity hides its head in the presence of the truth, which is the power of God for the salvation of men, but it flourishes in the atmosphere of a State-bolstered religion which is always a denial of the sufficiency of the gospel of Christ. In nothing is the utter perversity of human nature more fully demonstrated than in its readiness to pervert the truth of God, and by the substitution of human inventions, deny its power to regenerate and save men. There is danger in any union which seeks to exalt men rather than God, no matter by what name it may be called.
