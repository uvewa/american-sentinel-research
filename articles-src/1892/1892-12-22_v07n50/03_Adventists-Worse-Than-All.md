A CORRESPONDENT writing from Alma, Mich., under date of December 6, says:

This place has just been visited by Rev. W. F. Ware, Secretary of the so called American Sabbath Union. Mr. Ware spoke on the evils the Church had to contend with. The first evil was the non-attendance at church of their own members. The cause of this, he said, was, first, the running of Sunday trains and Sunday excursions, Sunday picnics and Sunday papers. Then the Sunday saloons and the train of evils that follow them, such as the great strikes.

Then leaving these without suggesting a remedy, Mr. Ware attacked the Seventh-day Adventists, which, according to his idea of evil are worse than all the rest, from the fact that "they are not law-abiding citizens." In proof of this he cited his hearers to the State of Tennessee, where they have good Sunday laws, where four men had been put in jail and worked in the chain-gang and still would not obey the law. He also stated that they were not "evangelical" because they believe that the spirit can not live without the body. And then came the remedy for these evils, the repeal of the exemption clauses in the States where they exist. When this is done, which he said would surely be, then "the sect which has its head-quarters at Battle Creek must die and be buried without a coffin."

This shows the animus of Mr. Ware's work. It is not the first time that he has given expression to just such sentiments. But he should possess his soul in patience. Persecution has not yet killed the Adventist sect in Tennessee, in fact, it has had thus far the contrary effect; and as our correspondent remarks, "he may find that they will die as hard in Michigan as in Tennessee."
