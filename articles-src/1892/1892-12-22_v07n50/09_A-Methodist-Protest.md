# A Methodist "—Protest."

"THE Constitution of the United States of America guarantees freedom. But Pope Leo XIII. claims to be sovereign. The Constitution guarantees freedom of all religion; the Pope attacks and tries to break down all guarantees of freedom. The Constitution forbids Congress to establish any religion; papacy demands that it should be established by law. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press; and papal councils forbid both. The Constitution plays the secret tribunals of the Inquisition. The Constitution and every other conceivable penal penalty; papacy demands tortures and death for heretics and claims the right to inflict it. Is this the kind of patriotism the Roman parochial school is going to teach?"

The foregoing clipped from the Chicago correspondent of the *Advance*, is an extract from a paper on "Roman Catholic Patriotism," read before the ministers' meeting by Rev. J. J. Tolson, pastor of Lincoln St. Methodist Episcopal Church of that city, before the Methodist minister's meeting. Apparently it is a very honest and able protest against the encroachments of a power dominated by ideas foreign to the spirit of our American institutions, but the record of the "Protestant" denomination represented by the reverend gentleman deserves much of its force. How does the Constitution really guarantee, or forbids Congress to establish any religion; papacy demands that it alone be established.

When has the Roman Catholic Church demanded more in the matter of religious legislation than the Methodist and Episcopal Churches? Has not the Methodist Church in the last General Conference petitioned Congress to close the World's Fair on Sunday by Congress. Has she not worked for the same laws that the Roman Catholic Church has? Has she not in company with other professing Protestants of the Church demanded the passage of Sunday laws? Had not the Methodist signs and made applications of herself fail in the matter of elections and applications to office?

"While Rome has made herself accused only charges to comply by everyone of Americans, who dwells under the protection of this Government. All those whose ideas or policies in the politic acted that Methodist and her so-called Protestant sisters were seeking the dismissal of teachers and professors from this establishment.

The Methodist Church, once the pride of freedom, and the hope of the world, is a cats-paw for Rome; spending her time in fighting her battles upon promises that will fix on to free America the halter of history. The Protestant holding the Roman Catholic authority; the headmen holding authority.

"The Roman Catholic Church is not making much of a stir in the way of this matter, but why should she when her forces are doing it for her?

"The Constitution guarantees freedom and Protestantism never censured or opposed those who sought to think or sought contrary to her Protestantism never ceased or opposed those who to break down all guarantees of freedom."

Has Methodism never censured or opposed to think or speak contrary to her to that Rev. Mr. Tolson claims that Methodism is making? and all at Rome's request, if for Rome it at all ages has been the enemy of progress, the persecution of those whom the Rev. Mr. Tolson claims that Methodism has not for Rome in all ages.

Has Methodism never censured or opposed to think or speak contrary to her dictates? Let the records of persecution by the parochial schools of her sister members of the Roman Catholic Church in the country be consulted. It is the record of W. E. White, of Washington, D. C. He has given it as his opinion that in some meetings held under the auspices of the denomination he has discovered that in the course of at least part of the of them doing been excerpted, that the meeting was dismissed by the chairman, held in the city afterwards, in the midst of a meeting in a hall, the moderating vote of the chairman was not needed, and was dismissed without being given an opportunity of expressing his views on the subject. He takes on the basis of Scripture, which not only shows that this minister the pastor was not making a protest, merely against Protestantism in its New, will pursue the same course.

This is not an attack upon the Methodists in general. A careful reading and an examination of Rev. Mr. Tolson, is to test and condemn that of Romish Church, and we said it that body of people is more or less than consistent in their administration. They are all playing into the hands of Rome.

The Constitution does guarantee freedom, look at the freedom "enjoyed" by the Sabbath-keepers of Tennessee. If Mr. Tolson will direct his attention to the situation at Rock Hill, Kent County, Md., he will see an example of the kind of liberty to behave differently from the

standards of Methodism. I refer to the practice of Mr. Josford, a Sabbath-keeper, who has been arrested and fined for husking corn on his own farm on Sunday in that neighborhood. Is it possible that Mr. Tolson ministerial, hereafter believes that a man has a right to freedom of thought only so long as he chooses to behave according to the time-honored creed of their particular sect? Why, that is precisely what the Roman Catholic Church teaches; and Mr. Tolson has recently the distinction of being made to point out that apostolic body.

The Constitution does forbid Congress "making" or any "respecting." Mark you, it not only forbids Congress from establishing "religion" but "any religion;" and yet many of these, apparently valid arguments, for Rome are infesting with might and main, will and not religion, with more particular looks, aye, with threats to boycott, to punish, aye from America, the particular religious bodies of the Government.
