Only a short time ago we chronicled the fact that a Seventh-day Adventist had been arrested and fined in Kent County, Md., on complaint of a Methodist minister for husking corn in his own field on Sunday. It seems that this minister has not a monopoly of Methodist intolerance, for now comes a paper from the same State containing the following notice from another minister of the same denomination:—

The undersigned, with the fear of God and the public good before his eyes, would call the attention of all Christians, whether Protestant or Catholic, that there is a man canvassing in Talbot County, seeking to sell a book called, "Bible Readings for the Home Circle," and he is also talking against the observance of the Lord's day. The book is in the interest of the Second or Seventh-day Adventists. Christians, beware of his craftiness and book. Yours, J. D. LECATES.

## Pastor of the Tightman M. E. Church.

The foregoing copied from the Easton, Maryland, Gazette of Dec. 3, 1892, shows the bigotry and intolerance of those who uphold the "American Sabbath." Finding nothing in the Scriptures to sustain them, they seek by putting such notices as this into the papers to keep the people from reading or finding out the truth for themselves. The way in which it is written should show to anyone that Mr. Lecates himself knows nothing about what he is trying to warn the people against, and is therefore not capable of judging even for himself.

As for his charging the Adventists with breaking down the Lord's day, he is entirely mistaken in thinking thus; for that is just what they do not do. The Bible says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord;" and in Iea. 58:13, 14, we read: "If thou turn thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord." The Adventists are trying to show the people that the so-called "American Sabbath," or Sunday, is not the Sabbath of the Lord, but that it is a man-made institution. The book against which this minister warns both Protestants and Catholics says nothing about the Sabbath that the Bible does not say. Mr. Lecates is simply warning people against reading the Bible, except through his eyes.
