IN a discourse delivered on Columbus Day in Hillsdale, Mich., Rev. A. E. Craig stated during the course of his remarks that he was looking for a great American church, and that it would be formed by the Catholics taking the best of their churches, the Episcopalians the best of theirs, the Presbyterians, the Congregationalists, the Baptists, Methodists, etc., taking the best of theirs, and inscribing on their banners, "Unity."

If these churches were being melted together by the Spirit of Christ, and forming one body, it would certainly be very encouraging and desirable for the Christian. But when this "unity" is simply a confederation to enforce their dogmas and decrees by securing the aid of the State, it is, not only to the genuine Christian but to every American citizen, a question that is the most serious of anything that confronts us at the present time. All history shows that large ecclesiastical combinations entering the realm of the State, and securing and enforcing ecclesiastical laws, has resulted in great evil. And that the combining of these various organizations is tending in the direction of encroaching upon the State, and that it will ultimately end in an attempt to force the consciences of men, must be clear to those who have been watching the recent trend of events.
