# One Day's Political Religion in Congress.

THE proceedings of the second session of the Fifty-second Congress are already characterized by many of those incidents which would be apt to mark a great crisis between Church and State, if Senator Blair's old Sunday-Rest bill were on the carpet. Speaker Stacker declared that body resembled when it attempted to close the World's Fair.

It is said that Henry W. Blair, of the lower house of Congress, is still pushing for a seat in the lower house of Congress, proposing to be reintroduced to the Senate; if so it is to be hoped that he meets a better fate when he was in the Senate.

A lady of the National Reform school of Christianity, writes to *Evangelical Christendom*, of the National Reform movement, Ind., and follows:

> You are sending samples to me asking whether I want paper or not. I don't want one of them a bit, they are such unchristian papers. If you will say, we will be just as well or without you. You have no right to send such papers to people that you belong. But if you want to obey here, I beg of you to send and consider than I or the class to which you have appealed will stand here but a single day.

This has the true National Reform ring, and sounds amazingly like the following bit of Christianity's extremes uttered by Rev. B. B. Graham some years ago:—

In the opponents of the (Blair) plan, in the enemies of our Government and its Christian features, there are a great many people, indeed both in it and against it, set up a Government of their own, and they set up a Government of their own.

The mistake of both Mr. Graham and of this correspondent is in supposing that National Reform is Christianity, or that it is even Christian. We are not opposed to Christianity, but simply to having something forced upon people as Christianity which is only a base counterfeit. It is impossible to enforce Christianity.

According to our correspondent's own words there has been a total failure to enforce it upon one individual at least; yet, they have for years had Sunday laws. Why not compel one to keep Sunday as a day of conscience. Why not cease to appeal to force and appeal to the power of God and to his word, trusting his Spirit to impress it upon hearts? There can be but one matter; the word of God says nothing particular, the particular which they say, or are determined shall be observed, and which they are determined to enforce, even if it takes to banish all who oppose them.

These predictions are in rapid process of fulfillment. The statement that "in order to secure public favor, legislation will be rapidly enacted in the States, enforcing Sunday observance," has already been fulfilled. Every reader is acquainted with the facts which know that this is exactly what is taking place, step by step. Thousands of petitions were coming from churches and religious people of the World's Fair measure was secured from Congress last summer. Thousands of letters and petitions are now being received, and the acknowledged face on the part of Congress on the question of Sunday closing; with the demand of the churches would not be complied with. They "came back" and the churches at once began to endanger the livelihood of their "coming back here again" were precisely the elements which conspired to accomplish the result that has been accomplished.

Thus, charity have the course and results of this movement been traced out in this interesting and true forecast, and let the churches in which to the reader, in the light of this movement, reading out your own eternal interests, upon which all depends. And reader, how is it that we fare for you to stand?

W. A. COLCORD.
