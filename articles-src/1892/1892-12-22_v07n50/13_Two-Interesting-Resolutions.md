# Two Interesting Resolutions.

THE *Advance* claims that the latest resolutions from the religious societies are wholly spontaneous and now to any through the influence of the "Sabbatharian sentiments." Does this claim that from the projected contest to be so? Says what the E. Church General Missionary Committee, how spontaneous these resolutions are—

a telegram from Sec. J. B. KNOWNS was the

first, requesting the General Committee to protest against the present scheme to reopen the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, and the Sabbath Observance.

A committee was appointed to act on behalf of the body.

Another item from the organ of the Presbyterian Missionary Society, *Church at Home and Abroad*, announced that the Presbyterians do not work for China. In the lot of cities a suggestion that the Episcopalians also have their share in the direction of Christianity, Church, and State:

> "Foreign preaching in China is not as popular as in the United States." It reached the imagination, but such Church institutions must build on Chinese principles according to its own manner. Not the converge, upon good ground, begin, but yet themselves of all loyal and popular teaching.

The Georgia Legislatures recently rejected a bill providing for the reading of the Bible in the public schools.

The Illinois papers, headed by Rev Thomas T. Munger, have declared against Sunday newspapers upon the grand principle that they are wrong of government and inexplicable, and except in cases or in some to misplaced circumstances be recommended where they could find a copy of the papers and find a copy of their work there. Friends who are depressed on their calling should try it for themselves by a good intent in a practical method. This anti-Sunday-footer crusade is about the only thing they accomplish.

The different influences brought to bear on this people not to say the least of all these many and middle. The last seems to be an attempt at disruption. These was recently a call by the Labor Unions on the subject of the supply of employment. Shall their work be Sunday for Sunday closing. The Chicago *Times*, of a recent date, gives an account of the effort:

## A Few of Evangelists' Masterful.

> Further what they now owe examination what the labor leaders has to regard in the opening or closing of the Fair. It is well that public opinion be an expression since, later, in his color or his religious opinions.

We still have all laws on hand a limited number of copies of THE SENTINEL of December, 1888, containing the Senatorial Hearing on the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill and the proposed amendment to the Constitution [!] Protecting Christians in the observance of their Faith. The pamphlet is bound at 81 per hundred. But a single copy is 15 cents, post paid; 25 copies $2.50. The above article also is worth reading with this pamphlet, in which it contains other good matters besides.
