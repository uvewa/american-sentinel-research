# Editorial Notes (Continued).

Volume 7 of THE AMERICAN SENTINEL closes with this number. The initial number of Volume 8 will bear date of January 5th. Already we shall enter as its subscription January. We will, therefore, publish no paper next week. This first issue will be somewhat delayed, and is maintained for the information of new subscribers.

The next number of THE SENTINEL will contain an article by Brother Ringold, which as we will be a brief but comprehensive historical of the National Reform movement, and of what it has accomplished. This article has been written specially for the initial number of the new volume, and ought to be read by everybody. "Limitations to Majority Rule," and the "Christianity's Duty to Obey Civil Disobedience," are among the important subjects to be treated in the next Volume of THE SENTINEL. This paper will be No. 1, Vol. 8, of the AMERICAN SENTINEL, which will be furnished at $1 per hundred, or $8 per hundred.

This American Federation of Labor, on proved on the 15th inst., by a vote of 8 to 4, the following resolution, asking that the World's Fair be opened on Sunday.

It is said that Henry W. Blair, of New Hampshire, now desires to again take a seat in the lower house of Congress, proposing to be reintroduced to the Senate; if so, it is to be hoped that he meets a better fate this time than when he was in the Senate.

A lady of the National Reform school of Christianity, writes to *Evangelical Christendom*, Ind., as follows:

> You are sending samples to me asking whether I want paper or not I don't want one of them a bit, they are such unchristian papers. If you will say, we will be just as well or without you. You have no right to send such papers to people that you belong. But if you want to stay here, I beg of you to send no more for you to represent my claim to those who truly belong.

This has the true National Reform ring, and sounds amazingly like the following bit of Christianity's extremes, uttered by Rev. B. B. Graham some years ago:—

> In the opponents of the (Blair) plan, in the enemies of Our Government and its Christian features, they are a great many people, indeed, both in it and under it, set up a Government of their own.

The mistake of both Mr. Graham and of this correspondent is in supposing that National Reform is Christianity, or that it is even Christian. We are not opposed to Christianity, but simply to having something forced upon people as Christianity which is only a base counterfeit. It is impossible to enforce Christianity.

According to our correspondent's own words there has been a total failure to enforce it upon one individual at least; yet, they have for years had Sunday laws. Why not cease to appeal to force and appeal to the power of God and to his word, trusting his Spirit to impress it upon hearts? There can be but one matter; the word of God says nothing particular, the particular which they say, or are determined shall be observed, and which they are determined to enforce, even if it takes to banish all who oppose them.

We are glad to Mr. T. Ringold, to which one of our editorial writers indicated a desire Evangelist writers, to the readers the veritable facts upon every subject presented in its columns. Those who are acquainted with Mr. Ringold's work will not estimate this too highly because he is not connected with the Johns Hopkins University; the knowledge of the facts will simply give them an added interest in the *Baltimore Sun.*

THE House Committee of the Columbian Exposition reported a bill to give the authorities a Millennium of the Columbian Exposition in but instructing them to stop machinery but instructing, and for no compulsory labor on that day.

The bill is utterly unworthy of the stamp of any body except those who are avowedly only for the financial interest of the Fair. It can be defended on no correct principle whatever. Congress has no right to say how Sunday shall be observed. That is, whether it shall be observed at all or not; and it is futile for Congress to say that what it is to take now is to simply repeal the Sunday-closing proviso, and pass a resolution declaring that the whole question is beyond the proper sphere of its government, and that especially is this true of a govern-

ment operating under a Constitution which provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." This has been the position of THE SENTINEL; and it is to-day. We are glad that some of the daily papers are catching on to the proper point. The *Baltimore Sun* had this to say on the subject:—

> It is not really a religious question at all. The question of the matter and leave it to the discretion of the Fair management to decide whether on certain days of a course in which it is important and we will have it decided upon.

It is not time to recognize the fact in this country that morals are inborn, and that they are not bottles qualified by theological training or by legislative enactment to dispense moral rectitude by the square foot or the pound.

A bill is also proposed simply of a general nature which we would hope, leaving the matter in the hands of the Columbian Exposition Commission and directors. We regard it as very impossible that this effort, pursued with vigor and enthusiasm, would serve an excellent educational for every party, and educational one which has almost always proven detrimental to all its members.

THE Supreme Courts of Georgia has returned a decided exemption from compulsory attendance requiring persons failing to deliver messages on Sunday. The court said in concluding the argument: "This court is on the side of religious freedom. We should not compel for any person, practicing a faith or not, who shall work seven days in a week, days, weeks of necessity or charity only extending otherwise."

We still have on hand a limited number of copies of THE SENTINEL of December, 1888, containing the Senatorial Hearing on the Blair Sunday-Rest Bill and the proposed amendment to the Constitution [!] Protecting Christians in the observance of their Faith. The pamphlet is bound at $1 per hundred. But a single copy is 15 cents, post paid; 25 copies $2.50. The above article also is worth reading with this pamphlet, in which it contains other good matters besides.
