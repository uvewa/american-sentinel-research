THE different influences brought to bear to secure the Sunday closing of the World's Fair, are many and subtle. The last seems to be an attempt to antagonize the World's Fair management and the Labor Unions on the subject of the employment of non-union labor, and turn this to account for Sunday closing. The Chicago Times, of December 11, has this, purporting to be the language of President Highbotham:—

I don't care a continental what the labor leaders do in regard to the opening or closing of the Fair on Sunday. If they don't want it open, I am sure I don't. It is no more our business whether a man employs union labor, than is his color or his religion.

The special despatch from which this is taken contains also the following comment in explanation:—

Mr. Highbotham is said to have made these remarks in reply to the criticisms of local labor unions upon the action of the Fair Directors in letting the printing of the official Exposition catalogue to a firm which does not at all times pay the union scale of wages. Mr. Highbotham is further quoted as saying that personally he would prefer to have the World's Fair closed on Sunday, as it means much less individual work to him if this is the case. He has been working in the interest of workingmen, he declares, when he labored for Sunday opening, and now, if the local unions withdraw their support from the Sunday opening movement, as they threaten, it is no affair of his. He is also quoted as saying that he merely followed good business principles in accepting the offer of the printing house to get out the catalogue, and in so doing, he did his best for the welfare of the Exposition.

This is an unexpected but a very effective way of giving trouble to those who are seeking the repeal of vicious legislation on this matter. It marks very clearly also the selfish, personal and partisan methods to which the Sunday closing element is willing to stoop. The high water mark in demagoguery and hypocrisy seems to have been reached in this Sunday closing of the World's Fair.
