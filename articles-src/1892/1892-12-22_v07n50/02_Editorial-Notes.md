Is a "Round Table of Good Reading," in the *Christian Statesman*, Oct. 5, 1871, the author indicated, Rev. W. F. Crafts, speaks of "a new method for giving families the good literature which they need to counter the flood of bad; that is to put through a course of good literature at Battle Creek for church and families which might help to moderate some of his impatience for the Sunday rest of other people and give the people a little more valuable recreation in the way of good literature, broad-minded civilians, and officers to serve the people of this country.

And it is into the hands of such men as that is that this Government "a portal of its United States has been surrendered! And these the people will discover it, when it is too late for deliverance from the wreck."

A CORRESPONDENT writing from Alma, Mich., under date of December 6, says:—

> There are large numbers of the people of this State, and I presume other States, that know nothing of the so called American Sabbath Union. Their ignorance of its schemes and aims is remarkable, and they can hardly believe that there are such organizations in existence. The cause of all this ignorance is that the Sabbath Union and Sunday exorcists, Sunday picnics and Sunday excursions, Sunday shows and Sunday Selling—everything they accuse others of. They leave these without supposing a remedy, in ignorance and do not care apparently whether they shall be told. From the fact that they are now laboring at it, it seems pretty clear that if the good Sunday laws, where they could have existed, were not being enforced, more would obey the law. He also stated that they had used the press most assiduously. Their measures are not accepted even by many of them; then raise the remedy for these evils, the unjust and extreme measures adopted in the name of Christianity, this sect which has to be treated

near at Battle Creek must die and be buried and with no mourners.

This shows the animus of Mr. Ware's work. It is not the first time that he has given expression to just such sentiments. But he should possess his soul in patience. Persecution has not yet killed the Adventist sect in Tennessee, in fact, it has had thus far the contrary effect; and on our correspondent's reasoned, "it may be found that they will die as hard, in Michigan as in Tennessee."

It may not be inappropriate to suggest to the utterances just quoted, at the time all the evidences were that the Constitutional amendment was being secured, those of their loyalty to God and in his causation of their conscience on their part; from a work published by them as long ago as 1859 — "Christianity and the Constitution," between Church and States ("Vol. I," p. 54, 55)—

> The home of this Bible shall be the powers of its civil institutions and the consecration of law and order, as breaking through the boundaries of time, and carrying the sound of the gospel to the remotest ends of the earth. Their constitution acknowledges God as their ruler, their standard of thanfulness toward the government of the world, of nations, and of the individual heart, the complete standard by which to Choose the things that are Caesar's," and that other places where he plainly and unmistakably sets forth the rights and duties of this whole nation, teach throughout the Constitutions seem to have for established principles the old truths of the world as the spiritual descendants of "the sons of the Pilgrims" who first came to take Christ for creed and make law and government on the Bible.

Jesus came from his Father's throne, stooping in infinite love to lift up humanity, till men in this poor world—a grand wanderer without where to lay his head, traveling from place to place, and resting only in the heavment of his God. Thus they established themselves free citizens in Israel; only both people and rulers, in their acts, broke his laws and rejected his counsel. He proceeded on his way, preaching the gospel, and dying upon the cross by Almighty God. Thus Jesus said the Christ. His people, therefore, are not anti-Government, but against Protestantism in its New, will pursue the same course. Anti-Christ. Yet they were the descendants of the men in whose name and against whose course the revolution which the Statesman is seeking to revive.
