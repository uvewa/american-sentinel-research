# Catholicism—A Feint.

ROMAN Catholicism has assumed the protestations in its relation to the political question of our country that has given it some prestige as an issue in the last presidential campaign; not, indeed, as a party plank in any party platform, but as a party influence so marked as to shift its course public comment and prophesies of politicians.

While there is before some come for satisfaction in this supposed overthrow of the power of Catholicism, it is mainly on its surface, and consequently a majority has been as generally caused to protest. But while from this point of view anti-clerical, that are somewhat observing the horizon of our fair land, from another quarter or the smoke of a pit, there has arisen an influence which, in its far reaching efforts for national glory and darkened the sunlight for liberty.

The Roman Catholic Church teaches, the many allies, has done more to weaken the defences of the Constitution and stability the wisdom of our forefathers reared than any other influence. Catholicism has ever been, or ever could be, able be crushed by the force of a false Protestantism. We can only regard it as a foil to the game's point; a divert attention from this approach of a more deadly foe.

A. SMITH.
