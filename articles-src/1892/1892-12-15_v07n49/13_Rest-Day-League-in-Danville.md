A "Rest Day League" organized lately in Danville, Ill., has elected as its president Judge J. W. Wilkins, of the Illinois Supreme Court. Of this organization, the Christian Statesman says: "The churches, young people's organizations, and several labor unions are federated in this league, and it is planning for complete closing up of business on the Sabbath by persuasion and law." This is a confederacy indeed; and in such a connection the word "persuasion" has a most secretly threatening sound.
