CARDINAL GIBBONS has written a letter to J. R. Thompson, of Chicago, declaring himself in favor of keeping the World's Fair open on Sunday. The Cardinal says:—

The Sunday closing of this spectacle would be very unfortunate for many thousands of our countrymen, who would be tempted to spend the day in dissipation. In their name I would favor the opening of the Fair Sunday afternoon to evening, with the provision that all machinery should be stopped and all mechanical and laboring work that will not be urgently necessary should cease. In this I do not see any desecration of the holiness of the day; on the contrary, those who will visit the Fair on these days will be inclined to raise their minds and hearts to Him who inspired men who produce such marvelous things.

When Cardinal Gibbons wrote to Mr. W. F. Crafts some two or three years since declaring in favor of a national Sunday law, the then field secretary of the American Sabbath Union promptly added the 7,250,000 Roman Catholics in the United States to the number of petitioners for a national Sunday law. Will the American Sabbath Unionists now admit on the strength of the Cardinal's letter to Mr. Thompson that all the Catholics are in favor of an open Sunday Fair? And if not, why not?
