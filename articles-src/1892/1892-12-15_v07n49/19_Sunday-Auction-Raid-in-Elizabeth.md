A DESPATCH from Elizabeth, N. J., says, that on Sunday, December 4, "William H. Moffett undertook to have an auction sale of buildings at North Elizabeth, and in order to draw a crowd he hired a band of music and also had a free lunch spread on the grounds. Chief of police Tenny, by order of Mayor Rankin, raided the crowd, which numbered about three hundred, and arrested the agent and his two clerks. Augustus Salefield, the caterer, who runs a Paterson hotel, was pulled in, and also the band of fifteen musicians.

"The prisoners were marched to police headquarters. Lawyer Foster M. Voorhees was sent for to defend them, and Justice Heifield held a special session of court, at which eighteen prisoners were arraigned. They pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, and were fined $3.85, each."

Would it have been disorderly conduct to have held this sale on any other day of the week? If not, why was it disorderly to hold it on Sunday? If it was disorderly to sell houses on Sunday, why was it not disorderly to hold a session of court and transact the business of the court? If Sunday was desecrated by the sale of houses, but not by the holding of the court, was it a civil court or an ecclesiastical council? If an ecclesiastical council, how did it come within its province to fine and imprison for selling houses?

Who can not see the hopeless tangle, and where it begins?
