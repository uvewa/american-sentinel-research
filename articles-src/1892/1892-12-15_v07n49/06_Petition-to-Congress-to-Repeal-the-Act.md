# Petition to Congress to Repeal the Act Closing the World's Columbian Exposition on Sunday.

Religious Toleration in Christian Civilization.

*To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled.*

We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, hereby respectfully protest and petition against the enforcement of the conditions of the Act entitled "An act in aid in carrying out the Universal Exposition authorized to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, by the Corporation known as \"the World's Columbian Commission and the City of Chicago\"---approved August 5, 1892, which reads: . . . \"That it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for, or pertaining to, the World's Columbian Exposition, are made upon the condition that the said Exposition shall not be opened on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriation be open, on the first day of the week commonly called Sunday, upon that condition, is what he, and it is hereby, made the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by act of Congress of April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety, to modify the said contract with the Corporation known as the World's Columbian Commission, in such manner as shall require the closing of the Exposition on the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday.\"

In presenting this memorial to your consideration we respectfully submit:---

Said Exposition should be so conducted, managed and supervised, as best becomes the character of a civilization which with its varied departments of science, art, education, history and religion, such civilization claims to possess and represent. Within said Exposition there will be represents. tives from every nation, religion and belief of civilization in the world.

While the period of the Exposition is limited to six months; and while it is prohibited from being open on Sundays, it is clear that one-seventh of the time of the Exposition is taken away by our Government, and is a governmental interference with the filling the life of said Exposition.

It should be left to each and to impartially observe to all of said nations or beliefs the right of observing such observance by statutory law is within the province of the government of those countries.

It is our judgment that the Exposition should be opened every day from Monday to Saturday, and such regulations as will prohibit the use of machinery (except in the mechanical departments), and other noisy labor, should be adopted, so that the highest standard of artistic and mechanical science, that the exhibits of architecture, horticulture, and all buildings in which exhibits of arts and mechanical arts are installed, should be thrown open to visitors on any and every day.

We believe that the study on Sunday of such exhibits by those who can visit the Exposition only on that day, will be to them not only a commercial advantage, but that the thoughts of reverence and homage which it will excite, by its magnitude and beauty, will direct the mind to pay appropriate to the great Creator of all things more than any church service could.

We believe that if within the buildings belonging to the Exposition grounds religious services, as provided for in the Act to which this petition relates, shall be regularly conducted by church services, under the control and direction of the most eminent religious teachers and moral instructors of America, in its first form of sacred moral.

The closing of the Exposition will drive millions away from the only religious services within their advantages.

We further present that the citizens of the ave pence is active\* in the interests of Sunday for those who most earnestly need its offices within the Exposition for temperance which millions will come from foreign lands who will arrive in this country. \"not for the free interchange of thoughts and culture.\"

It should be left\* as originally provided by the Act of Congress April 25, 1890, to the Directory, the Local Committee, the World's Columbian Commission, and the Board of Directors, the whole matter of opening and closing the Exposition.

The movement to open bids fair to assume larger proportions than even the stream of petitions and of petitions and resolutions by which Congress was assailed last winter.

But it remains to be seen to what extent direct pressure will be made. . . . We call upon each principled man are emboldened in the opening move the readers of this paper.

The President's annual message, as read before the Senate and House of Representatives makes no reference whatever to questions of religious import, but the report of the Commissioners of the District as submitted to the President, and from him to Congress, contained a recommendation for \"the enactment of a law to prohibit the grounds of ordinary secular occupations on Sunday as being in the interest of public morality and quiet control.\"

A most a list of Durborow measures published by the *Star* as having passed the Senate, which will probably go before the Senate committee, therefore coolly awaiting consideration. Representative Durborow, banned the bill to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sundays in the District of Columbia. It does not yet appear what effect, if any, the lower temperature per-

centage visiting during this session will have on the mercantile veer taken of the Sunday bill.

A meeting of the Union of American Hebrew, consisting of delegates from all Hebrew congregations in the country, has lately been in session in Washington. An interesting item of the first day's proceedings was this: read of the board of delegates of civil and religious rights. The committee to which this was referred reported: \"The Sons of Israel and David, a Lodge Cadets, have been solicited from a town, Texas, for the protection and help of two of their fellow-Israelites, who are in a very bad condition.\" To be forwarded to the \"proper officers\" for examination. Authorized Catholics throughout the Union.

Rev. W. W. McFarren, of Biddeford, Maine, member of the special committee appointed to examine certain Maine denomination in reference to a formula for a plan to ensure better Sunday legislation. \"a resolve to and to continue to cherish and set at Rest the State, copies of a petition to be forwarded to the Senate at Washington.\" That Sunday excursions by railroads and steamboats should be taxed.

Sunday Smashed to Pieces.

A \"Rest Day League\" organized lately in Danville, Ill., by Elder E. B. Graham and D. W. Wilcox, of the Illinois Supreme Court. Of this organization the *Illinois State Register* says:

\"It is a league to gather young people's organizations, and use them for temperance and for defeating this aim; and it is planning for complete closing of shops on and for Sabbath by parliament law like that of everybody indeed; and is much aided in its purpose by letters and lectures from prominent religious people in this county.\"
