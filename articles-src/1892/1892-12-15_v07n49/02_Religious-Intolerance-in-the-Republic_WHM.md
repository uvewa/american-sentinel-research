# Religious Intolerance in the Republic.

## *Persecuting Christians.*

ON the 18th of last July a moral crime was committed in the State of Tennessee; a crime which should fill us with indignation; a crime which should rouse every patriot, statesman, and citizen in a nation over which bigotry and fanaticism have cast the dark shadows of intolerance; and so vitiate its far-reaching principles of religious liberty and civil equality that the facts is necessary to be marshaled if we remain silent; a crime which reveals in the boldest manner the measures and power in our midst of that spirit of intolerance which almost two thousand years ago pressed to the cross, then, faultless, true to the throne of death's deputy a great, brave, heroic, God-fearing man. The Gospel of Nazareth had asserted the rights of man and had declared that all men are created equal in their right to life, and not by observances of rites, customs, and Sabbath days. It declared the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. It gave to all nations the supreme rule of life for all true living; a simple but comprehensive law. "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." That the sign by which in all ages the disciples are known, not one as these two things, before this pure and tender soul that had carried out and turned over reveal the same principles as those against which enlightened torches to-day revolt, and which lit up the long night of the Dark Ages with human bonfires, and drove to death for conscience' sake the noblest hearts and greenest lives of Europe, because the victims could not conscientiously conform to the dogmas which the vast majority believed to be the will of God. Strange, indeed, that the closing years of the nineteenth century should witness, flaming forth, the same spirit of persecution, the same spirit of religious intolerance made such an eloquent, and, for the time, successful fight against. And the present instance, as in the religious persecution of the past, the crime has been committed in the name of justice, religion. Hugo, in speaking of the social structure in France in 1700, said: "At the base was the people, above people, religion; above religion, justice, trampled by the magistrate, represented by the clergy, by the side of all this, force, butchered by the magistrate."

And at that period of human society what was the people?---It was ignorance. What was religion?---It was intolerance. And what was justice?---It was injustice. The statesmen of this nation, with that keen eye which penetrates the darkness of the future, from the noble stand-point of justice, wisdom, and toleration, will point to such deeds as have recently been committed in Tennessee, illustrating the cruel intolerance of a perverted civilization which could tolerate such enormities without a universal protest.

## THE FACTS INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME.

I will now briefly outline the facts involved in this crime against personal liberty, which has been committed in the name of law and through the instrumentality of a spirit which the fair-minded, honest and understanding mark of savagery, which is at the present time existing in this country, like a malignant and dangerous cancer woven at the tap root of the greatest plant of liberty ever nourished by human genius; a spirit which I profoundly believe to be the most dangerous, as it is the most insidious, evil which menaces republican government.

The facts relating to the persecution in Tennessee are briefly as follows:---

At the town of Paris, Henry Co., Tenn., on the 18th of July, 1892, three conscientious, law-abiding, God-fearing Christians who had been lying in jail for a week previous, were marched through the streets, in company with some colored prisoners, in chains, in the full view of the common highway. All were men of families. One was a man of about sixty years; another was thirty-five years old. The State's Attorney, who, in the interest of fanaticism, prosecuted these men with the same animus as a blood-hound would exhibit in attacking its victim, was constrained to admit that, as for the crimes charged, that of working on Sunday, after they had religiously observed Saturday as their day of rest, they were otherwise good citizens. It will be seen that the offense with which these men were charged is that of following their fellowmen, either legally or illegally, they were not very strict, neither were they highly moral and exemplary citizens. Moreover, they were *God-fearing* men. They belonged to the little band of earnest believers in Christ known as Seventh-day Adventists, a body of Christians who find in the Bible an injunction which they hold to be divine, requiring them to work six days in the week and to keep holy the seventh day, and who do not find any passage repealing this command in the Holy Scriptures. These sincere men were, of course, well disposed to obey this law and understood it, by keeping holy the Sabbath or seventh day of the week, and they were poor men. Fifty two days in the year, in which by the sweat of their brows and the toil of their hands, they earned their bread. From these days of labor the Puritan law deprives them. Are these not men, with natural and inalienable right to worship God by the exercise of a religious conviction of their own conscience, . . . . that no power, control or interference with the rights of conscience; and that this prerogative shall ever be given by law to any religious creed or manner of worship?

From this it would seem that evil-will and malice with which might oppose it must render it impossible for God-fearing citizens to enjoy its simplicities and benefits without doing violence to their religious interest or having to disclose by what religious conviction they prefer to obey God, or it would be unconstitutional and unchristian. It will be seen from the extract showing that if any percentage of the population observed Saturday as the Sabbath and commanded them to keep holy any day other than the first day of the week, and compelled those persons to desist from work on the first day would be to compel every people in the present fierce battle for livelihood to work on one day less than every body, as to rest one over one hundred days in the year; and thus drive them out of business and their loved ones. It can be seen how any mind that is not blinded by the mists of bigotry and prejudice could fail to view the same steps in this conclusion. But this is enough. The whole is a shame which the thoughtful mind is inclined to let proceed.

In some States, there are ancient statutes,

## SHAKING OF PALSIED AGE,

which are nothing but the relics of the Blue Laws of colonial days. These laws are, of course, in their character, peculiarly obsolete. Hate, spite, and intolerance have occasionally represented them; but constitutional guarantees, competent judges, have usually found them null and void. The law in Tennessee which is the matter now is a great illustration; the burlesque of Blackguard, producing contempt for law, and having people arrested for Sunday work, "except works of real necessity." A modern statute prescribes a fine as punishment. If the fine is not paid, the offender is sentenced to be imprisoned. Another statute provides that the same rules of law for the punishment of a fine by one convicted inlaid crimes, shall be according to counsel of that circuit courts in Tennessee, a succession of events occurring on working or Sunday, the prosecutor must individuals.

On May 7 the Grand Jury of Henry County indicted five farmers of the small place near the village of Springville, in Henry County, Tennessee. In that same month the cases were heard before a certain Judge, W. H. Swiggart. The principal witness for the prosecution that say one was disturbed by the work of these poor mechanics, but the principal witness for the State each declared that he was not disturbed. One of the accused had been seen ploughing strawberries on Sunday, another cutting sprouts, and still another hoeing in his garden. The same man was accused not of any serious crime, but each made a simple statement of his case, relying upon the guarantees of the Constitution and the inalienable rights of the judges and jury for acquittal. The following is the statement made by Mr. W. S. Lowry, whose case came first:---

I would state to the court that, as has been stated, I am a *six-day* Adventist. I observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath. I read in the fourth commandment that "in it thou shalt not do any work;" meaning thereby that on the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath, which I desire to keep in harmony with the fourth commandment. Then I also find given to me six days for labor. I have a wife and daughter to support; I must make them a living. If I do not do my work quietly, do not make any noise, do not disturb any one, do not interfere with any one, I believe and feel that I should be allowed to work. Can not Fitch and Co, who live around me that I have a law-abiding, peaceable citizen; and, if it please for that right I claim as a Christian, I have a law abiding right to work on Sunday. I have a right, having rested on the Sabbath, and I hold and believe so long as I do not interfere with my religious conviction and the Bible, I stand and here to live for what I believe. I do humbly ask for an acquittal, or so the jury can any reflection upon the State. As you are acquainted with me and know what I have always been.

This simple, eloquent, and noble statement of a high-minded Christian gentleman would have made an impression on any mind not blinded by bigotry, and would have rendered just and holy and exerted dwarfed by religious fanaticism and prejudice. But like in the field Huguenots of the sixteenth century, these victims of religious prejudice lacked broad-minded, intelligent, and conscientious judges and patriotic for judges and jurors. The proceedings of the trial itself clearly revealed the true animus of the prosecution when the closing his speech he made one of the following significant expressions:---

Are we to recognize a man as a citizen to be a peaceable, law-abiding citizen runs on as disregards our law and tramples on my foot or the rule of every gentleman under the sun has no more right against the holy Sabbath, as we believe it and have driven it a chain-gang with blacksmith, and this animus loyalty to what he considered to be right. Think of it is the Golden handed infamy and, remember that this crime against him, this crime against human rights, was perpetrated in this name of law, and instigated by persons professing to be religious Christians.

The persecution of Jesus by the Pharisees was tender-heartedness compared to the persecution of the Seventh-day Adventists by those whom maliciousness itself was to-day. And yet these same shrill shouted at "eighty-odd thousands" Christians! Let us see how their actions square by the Golden rule, which one of the greatest master of that basic principle of moral government.

Let us suppose that in Louisiana, for example, by the Christian, intelligently and on certain days made holy by their whole religion and teaching of Sabbath. "Other than acts of real necessity." Let us suppose that Protestants lived to keep these days, first, because they denied the right of the church to enslave men or make holy days, and secondly, because the fierce struggle for bread made it imperative that they work. Now let us further suppose that a runup of the most unpopular citizens openly disregarded this unjust statute, and if the violators were dragged to prison, doomed to lie in jail, and finally put to work in New Orleans streets in company with the lowest class of criminals. Would not there be a mighty outrage? But the principle that has been trampled in the land at such an un-American and unconstitutional manner, so clearly trampled on the right of conscience and disregarded the spirit of free government!

"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Just taught this as a cardinal truth, the sum of laws and precepts.

## ARE PERSECUTORS OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS CHRISTIANS?

At numerous times, like the Apostolical papacy. Apollo-loving Constantine, who understanding the subversive character of, persecuting Jesus, in short model. But let us pursue this thought one step further. Constitution declares the right of the seventh-day Adventist to have some strength, that of the ancient children of Israel. The Hebrews, and were so disposed, and such an intolerance, the first Christians were enabled to resist a law compelling all Christians to work on the seventh day. Would our Puritan friends and their churches promptly proceed to secure a statute. Would not our people urge upon the authorities to compel or to ratify such a wrong! Would we not hear on every hand that to compel us to keep the seventh day would be equal to forcing a large percentage of the population into a life of indolence by breaking the command. As some body's precepts for every one could see, hundreds kept in the soul and yet it is the same with Adventists on the first day. In short every man can see it, and so it must if clear to everybody indeed; and it is as much an invasion of the right of conscience of our own as of Sabbatarians; for whoever has come into the conflict on no person who resists plain man's right. Conscience is a matter for the individual, not for society or the state. Fellow-countrymen, patriots, I grant you are the legitimate offspring of the old Huguenots, and I warn you the old red square by the Golden Rule.

Poor Mr. King, of whom I have written, frankly supposed to be a law-abiding citizen, was firmly supposed to be characteristically representing that body and those views. He and these new victims of religious bigotry in Tennessee should be recognized by every legal soul who in all ages have been persecuted for conscience' sake. Did not the Lord Jesus was a conscientious violator of a dogma made by the bigotry and superstition of his day, and his twelve disciples took up the cross. The early Christians in the catacombs of Rome, the martyrs in the Colosseum and for this were burned and suffered. Men were racked and tortured, the chosen souls, of the Dark Ages like, who followed in the spirit of their faith, and for their faithful and sublime loyalty, were burned, racked, and martyred. They were burned, racked, and disemboweled and flayed for their loyalty. When flames followed the nation guiding star of conscience in matters of religion, so does the result, was rebellion of the slave for liberty in history, as it was always done, and always must be. In truth, truth, truth, liberty, and right. The spirit makes men free and gives them independence, all traced broad-minded and tolerant development, under one god and ruler. There must come into the attention this age-long spirit of intolerance occupied by the martyrs and heroes for freedom and for religion, whose providence can resist and are darkest forms luminous examples of right thinking and noble and most essential things for our land.

## ARMY OF THE PRESS.

This secular press of the land, with scarcely an exception, has given its protest hard to these persecutions.
