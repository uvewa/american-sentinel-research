THE Mail and Express says:—

The reign of lawlessness in Chicago is the direct result of the efforts of the Exposition authorities in that city to break down the Sabbath.

By this is meant, that, because of the course of the Board of Managers of the Exposition in asking Congress to repeal its Sunday closing proviso, the protection of divine Providence is being withdrawn from Chicago, and the city given up to lawlessness and violence. That is a sample of what will be said more and more by those religionists whose opinions the Mail and Express voices. Evil men and seducers will multiply in numbers, and violence and lawlessness increase, pestilence and physical disaster will come upon the earth. We have the words of the apostles and of Revelation for this. The Mail and Express and all its fellows are ready with their explanation.

Should the industrial discontent, already threatening, break out next summer while millions of people are away from their homes, in Chicago and on their way to and from, and the wheels of travel be suddenly stopped, and cholera add its terrors to the turmoil, it is easy to see where the Mail and Express would find the cause of it all. Although this particular catastrophe may not happen, things similar will, and that fanatical explanation will be given for them and considered sufficient. Then will come the cry—"Who is the Jonah? Overboard with him!"
