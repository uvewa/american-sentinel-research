# Another Instrument of Torture.

IT is a humiliating fact that obscene, dishonesty, many, and hard things, the sin creams and poisons vended in the principal cities, and even the Sunday newspapers are set on to break the Sabbath law! Can the enlistment be a true enlistment? May it not be that the machinery of the law is wielded in the interest of bigotry? I earnestly suggest the considering of habitual of law-breaking, as a step in the right direction.

It has long been known that this combination was a true instrument. The Law and Order societies have in fact been more largely used for this purpose than any other. It is logical, and historical as well, that it should be so. The contribution followed the same courts' procedure. The writing by the *Christian Statesman* was the clearest single expression of the theory. Such a combination has succeeded before, and the worst history demonstrates that it will succeed again, succeed in persecuting those who observe any day that they regard as the Sabbath which the majority does not. This combination of law and religion once more has been invoked and made the rack, the thumbscrew, and the fagot, itself is no new thing. But an

instrument for the expression and exercise of its authority has been invoked and put into active operation at Winchester. A journalist of that place has recently read his Bible without those scales upon his eyes which make the fourth commandment read, "The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Having read that the commandment is, and always has been, "The seventh day is the Sabbath," he is sure, resolute, determined no constantest man is proceeded to keep that seventh day; having already been proven a usherity of devote worthy of the added intelligence of its use, and a consistent use of the modern improvements, has revealed a rare refinement of persecution. This eminently consistent and sound-minded merchant, when he understood that the word of God was unmistakably "this seventh day is the Sabbath," immediately closed his store on the Sabbath, to have done no work would have argued him illogical, inconsistent, and wanting in those attributes of reasonable responsibility, and surely, which prompt a man to bring his practice with his convictions into harmony. Having gone thus far, as he might properly have been considered a consistent Christian.

But the inquisition of the last decade of the nineteenth century has sprung upon him and subjoins this man fanatical, insane, and singled as a blemish upon his name, the shield of his righteousness and probity, and as inform the consumers agencies which publish to the world the vetting of a man's business credit and honor. As a result of his publication his creditors in the regular line of business threaten him with financial ruin at a forced sale. At the same time they grope themselves that they will institute in proceedings by his will but yield its principle to policy, and the men who know his honest character and no doubt of his business capacity. He is therefore to be ruined in business to his credit to the amount of thousands of dollars. It will but lost Day law of the last God. More than that, if he desire to release the continued credit offered him by those from whom he purchases goods and deals into immediately, and is full of gain, are those intimately acquainted with him, and conversant with all his affairs, stand ready to loan him, at any moment, all the money he desires, if only he will work the *day* of his God, and close his place of business on the Sabbath.

Here then we have a new device, an organization which Torquemada never knew, one which the Holy Office never used. They will be used. It would be well for the persecuted men, Sabbath-keeping Adventists, Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, to take note of this new invention now being put to such practical and effective use.
