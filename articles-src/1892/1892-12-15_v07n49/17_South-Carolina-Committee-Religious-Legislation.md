The committee on privileges and elections of the Legislature of South Carolina is confessedly bringing its individual religious opinions into the legislative proceedings of the State, as witness the following taken from a press report from Columbia, S. C., December 5:—

Representative Blease inadvertently admitted that the committee on privileges and elections had formulated a report on Sunday. Representative McWhite pounced on him and said this was a stigma on the House and State, and that such legislation was inoperative. Mr. Blease replied that the committee met as individual citizens and that they were responsible at the bar of heaven.

This last clause is very true; but at the bar of heaven the responsibility for the legislative enforcement of religious observance will be found to be very heavy.
