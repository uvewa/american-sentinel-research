Congress has opened, and with its first day's proceedings began again the discussion of the congressional measures in reference to Sunday closing of the World's Fair. In his opening invocation the Chaplain of the Senate referred to that and kindred subjects in the petition: "Exalt us more and more in righteousness among the nations. Preserve to us our Sabbath and our sanctuaries,"—but the House heard petitions and protests from members and constituents "against imposing conditions either as to keeping open or closing on Sundays the World's Columbian Exposition," and also one petition from a Young People's Society of Christian Endeavor for its unconditional closing. Representative Durborow, of Chicago, Chairman of the House Committee on the World's Fair, introduced a joint resolution in which it was made the duty of the World's Columbian Exposition to make such rules, or so modify the rules of the corporation known as the World's Columbian Exposition as to prohibit the use on Sundays of machinery, unnecessary manual labor, and all merchandising, and at the same time give opportunity for the study of the highest standard of artistic-mechanical excellence; that the art gallery, horticultural building, and all buildings in which exhibits of mechanical art are displayed shall be open to the public every day, and that each employee shall be given one day each week for rest, study or recreation.

Mr. Durborow's resolution, it can be seen, is a plea for a silent Fair. As a matter of moral right and constitutional principle why should it be any more proper for Congress to require the Commission to make rules prohibiting the running of machinery on Sunday than for Congress to require the Commission and the Managers to close altogether? What jurisdiction has Congress in that regard at all? Nevertheless this is the phase which the matter has assumed on the opening day of the session.

A reporter for the Washington Post interviewed Mr. Durborow on this matter and reports him as saying:—

We shall make a dignified appeal to members to repeal that provision. We feel that Sunday opening is in the interest of good morals. There will be no merchandising or selling of liquor on the grounds on Sunday and the machinery will not be running. Religious services will be held in the Exposition grounds every Sunday, conducted by eminent clergymen, with sacred music of the highest order. The employees of the park are to work only six days in the week, so as not to desecrate the Sabbath. Every Sunday for months past there have been from 4,000 to 50,000 visitors in the park, and a quieter, better-behaved crowd you could not ask to see. Sunday opening will give hundreds of thousands of people their only opportunity to see the Exposition. We think a presentation of these facts ought to be effective in securing a repeal of the provision, and we shall rely upon them to win votes for us.

This is the complexion which the popular movement for the repeal of last session's legislation for Sunday closing has thus far taken.

The following is a copy of the petition which the World's Fair Sunday Opening Association presents for signatures:—

## Petition to Congress to Repeal the Act Closing the World's Columbian Exposition on Sundays.

## Religious Toleration is Christian Civilization.

*To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled:*

We, the undersigned, citizens of the United States, do hereby respectfully pray and memorialize your Honorable Body to repeal that portion of the Act entitled "An Act to aid in carrying out the Act of Congress, approved April 25, 1890, entitled 'An Act to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by the holding of an International Exposition in the City of Chicago'"—approved August 5, 1892, which reads as follows: "That it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for, or pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition, are made upon the condition that the said Exposition shall not be opened to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriations be accepted by the corporation of the State of Illinois, known as the World's Columbian Exposition, upon that condition, it shall be, and it is hereby, made the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by the Act of Congress of April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety, to make such rules or modifications of the rules of said corporation as shall require the closing of the Exposition on the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

Also, to repeal that portion of the Act entitled, "An Act making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, and for other purposes"—approved August 5, 1892, which reads as follows: "And it is hereby declared that all appropriations herein made for, or pertaining to the World's Columbian Exposition, are made upon the condition that the said Exposition shall not be open to the public on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday; and if the said appropriations be accepted by the corporation of the State of Illinois, known as the World's Columbian Exposition, upon that condition, it shall be, and it is hereby, made the duty of the World's Columbian Commission, created by act of Congress of April twenty-fifth, eighteen hundred and ninety, to make such rules or modifications of the rules of said corporation as shall require the closing of the Exposition on the said first day of the week, commonly called Sunday."

In presenting this memorial to your consideration we respectfully represent that—

**Said Exposition should be so conducted, managed and controlled, as will best promote the social, moral and educational interests of all the people.**

Within said Exposition there will be representations of all that is good and useful, beautiful and artistic, and that the same will be object lessons in science, art, education, history and religion, such as the world has never before seen.

While the period of the Exposition is limited by law, the people should not be prohibited from visiting the same on Sundays, or any other days, during the life of said Exposition.

It is the duty of all men to properly observe the Sabbath, but we do not believe that the regulation of such observance by statutory law is within the letter or spirit of either State or Federal Constitutions.

It is our judgment that the Exposition should be open on Sunday, under such reasonable rules and regulations as will prohibit the use of machinery and restrict manual labor, and at the same time give opportunity for the study of the highest standard of artistic and mechanical science; that the art gallery, and all buildings in which exhibits of mechanical arts are installed, should be thrown open to the public on each and every day during the entire term of the Exposition.

We believe that the study on Sunday of such exhibits of science and art, and of the skill and genius of the artisan, will not only be of inestimable educational advantage, but that the thoughts of the visitors will be lifted above these creative agencies to the great Creator of all things useful and beautiful.

On each Sunday afternoon there should be held within the Exposition grounds, religious services, so arranged that each of our Christian organizations will have a Sunday set apart for its particular service, under the control and direction of its most prominent clergymen, with songs of praise and anthems, in the best form of sacred music.

The closing of the Exposition on Sundays will deprive more than three millions of our people of these advantages.

We further believe that the citizens of the several States should have the privilege of visiting on Sunday the temporary buildings or homes within the Exposition grounds, erected by their respective States, for the free interchange of thought and social amenities.

And finally, we believe that if this whole matter shall be left, as originally provided by the Act of Congress, to the judgment and discretion of the appointed agencies of the Government, the National Commissioners, and the Board of Directors, the moral and educational interests of all the people will be best subserved.

The movement to open bids fair to assume larger proportions than even the storm of petitions and preachers' exhortations by which Congress was assailed last session in favor of closing.

But it remains to be seen to what extent correct principles will be invoked. To what extent such principles are embodied in the opening moves the readers of this can judge.

The President's annual message, as read in the Senate and House bore no reference to questions of religious import, but the report of the Commissioners of the District as submitted to the President, and through him to Congress, contained a recommendation for "the enactment of a law to prohibit the pursuit of ordinary secular occupations on Sunday as being in the interest of public morality and comfort."

Among a list of District measures published by the Star as having passed the House and received favorable mention by Senate committee, therefore only awaiting presentation to the Senate for passage, is named the bill to prohibit the sale and delivery of ice on Sunday in the District of Columbia. It does not yet appear what effect, if any, the lower temperature prevailing during this session will have on the senatorial view taken of the Sunday Ice bill.

A meeting of the Union of American Hebrews, consisting of delegates from the different Hebrew congregations in the country, has lately been in session in Washington. An interesting item of the first day's proceedings was the report of the board of delegates on civil and religious rights. Simon Wolf and Lewis Abraham, both of the city of Washington, are respectively president and secretary of this board. A paragraph of the report recited facts, as follows:—

As there are growing efforts being made by direct religious organizations to seek innovations upon the cardinal principles of the national laws by passage of enactments that infringe the most valuable clause of the Constitution, action in respect thereto appears to be appropriate. As is well known, showers of petitions were poured into Congress from religious bodies employing rigorous legislation on the Sunday question. Clergyman of various denominations, from sectarian standpoints, persistently importuned the committee in charge of the subject, advocating prohibitory and penal enactments to enforce their views. The local members of your committee were called upon to give their views and argued the question solely from its constitutional aspect. Large bodies of citizens, lay and clerical, vigorously denounced and opposed passage of any national law interfering, directly or indirectly, with religious observance, and for a long period the question of ecclesiastical supervision by Congress was combated by opposing forces. The result is known. It follows as a sequence that if one phase of religious belief and practice is under jurisdiction of the national representatives, they can also pass upon others, and at no distant day the questions of heresy, that are agitating many bodies, can be sent to them for adjudication and we shall have religious formula and doctrines promulgated and enforced through government officials. This is a subject that affects all American citizens alike, as it is the entering wedge of union between Church and State.

Mr. Lewis Abraham, the secretary of this board, is a prominent and able member of the District bar, and a man whose voice has frequently been heard before the different committees of the House and Senate in the defense of civil and religious liberty, and always with sole reference to the principles involved, and in defense of civil equity and religious liberty pure and undefiled.
