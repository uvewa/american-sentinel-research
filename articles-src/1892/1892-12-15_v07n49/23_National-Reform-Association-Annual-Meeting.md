THE National Reform Association held its regular annual meeting in Philadelphia on December 6-8, and at the same time there was held under its auspices a "National Conference on the Christian Principles of Civil Government." The meeting was slimly attended, and there was nothing new offered. The National Reform Association is away behind the movement of which it is a part. The American Sabbath Union, so-called, is the real National Reform Association, and is doing vastly more so-called reform work than the original Association ever has done or ever can do until it gets out of its rut. It is impossible to give any news concerning the doings of an association that is thrashing over the same old straw that it has been pounding for twenty-eight years, but we shall in future numbers notice some points presented at the Philadelphia meeting.
