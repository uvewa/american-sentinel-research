THE article from the Arena, for December, printed elsewhere in this paper, is a most excellent and timely one. The attention of the people must be called to the outrages being perpetrated upon innocent men in this country in the name of good morals and good government, and in no way could this be more effectively done than by setting forth the facts editorially, as Mr. B. O. Flower has done in his deservedly popular and widely-read magazine.

HITHERTO the press of the land has been strangely silent upon the subject. Editors would probably plead that the facts so vigorously set forth in the Arena had not been brought before to their notice in such a way as to challenge their attention and arouse their interest. They can say this no longer. Every reading man in the United States must now decide for or against liberty of conscience. Every newspaper of any influence must decide whether it will lift its voice against the iniquity which in Tennessee is outraging liberty, or whether by continued silence it will assent to religious persecution on American soil. Mr. Flower's article is a bugle call to the press of the country; how will the editors of the United States respond?

THERE is hope that the secular press will for the most part be found on the right side in this contest; but, alas! the religious press is, with very few exceptions, already committed to the support of bigotry and intolerance. It is true that comparatively few of the religious papers have openly justified the Tennessee persecution, but the attitude of the denominations for which they speak is such that their position is not a matter of doubt. The great religious bodies of the land have formed a confederacy for the purpose of crushing out all opposition to their ambitious schemes for the acquisition of power, and they have found their most determined foes to be the very people who are being persecuted under the color and forms of civil law in Tennessee. The so-called Protestant churches and their organs will not, therefore, cry out against the wickedness so ably and fearlessly assailed by the Arena.
